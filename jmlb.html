And then, at one time or another over the years, Japan won minor wars. These victories led the Japanese leadership to sheer arrogance, and then they entered into a major war with the U.S. and the Western allies.</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-mr-utsunomiya-em-both-superpowers-the-united-states-and-the-soviet-union-have-a-combined-destructive-force-capable-of-destroying-the-whole-earth-probably-ten-or-twenty-times-and-yet-they-continue-to-build-and-add-to-this-enormous-power-some-people-particularly-president-reagan-insist-that-all-this-power-is-necessary-to-deter-the-other-side-from-attacking-the-rest-of-the-world-the-theory-of-deterrence-some-japanese-leaders-also-agree-with-the-american-contention-but-this-is-a-self-defeating-logic-in-my-thinking- mid-1738597"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/jmlb-10"><em>Mr. Utsunomiya:</em> Both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, have a combined destructive force capable of destroying the whole earth probably ten or twenty times. And yet they continue to build and add to this enormous power. Some people, particularly President Reagan, insist that all this power is necessary to deter the other side from attacking the rest of the world-the theory of deterrence. Some Japanese leaders also agree with the American contention. But this is a self-defeating logic, in my thinking.</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-mr-utsunomiya-em-yes-i-fully-appreciate-what-you-have-just-said-speaking-about-the-theory-of-deterrence-again-i-doubt-very-much-that-what-those-people-are-calling-the-nuclear-deterrent-is-functioning-in-any-way-rather-it-s-the-certain-degree-of-rationality-morality-intelligence-and-good-conscience-of-those-in-leadership-in-their-respective-countries-that-is-keeping-war-at-bay-these-qualities-may-be-limited-but-they-are-really-keeping-the-world-from-nuclear-destruction-as-a-politician-my-basic-policy-my-most-important-political-pronouncement-is-that-we-should-reduce-the-useless-arms-and-if-possible-get-rid-of-them-entirely-that-is-my-basic-stance-in-my-political-life- mid-1738598"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/jmlb-11"><em>Mr. Utsunomiya:</em> Yes, I fully appreciate what you have just said. Speaking about the theory of deterrence again, I doubt very much that what those people are calling the nuclear deterrent is functioning in any way. Rather, it's the certain degree of rationality, morality, intelligence and good conscience of those in leadership in their respective countries that is keeping war at bay. These qualities may be limited, but they are really keeping the world from nuclear destruction. As a politician, my basic policy, my most important political pronouncement, is that we should reduce the useless arms and, if possible, get rid of them entirely. That is my basic stance in my political life.</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-mr-utsunomiya-em-i-am-certainly-impressed-with-what-you-have-said-and-this-has-to-be-repeated-the-trust-you-have-spoken-of-now-and-the-beliefs-which-i-have-referred-to-in-some-way-should-be-widely-disseminated-among-the-people-one-of-the-worst-possible-effects-of-a-nuclear-war-would-be-the-destruction-not-only-of-the-men-who-started-it-but-also-of-all-other-living-animals-plants-and-beings- mid-1738599"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/jmlb-12"><em>Mr. Utsunomiya:</em> I am certainly impressed with what you have said, and this has to be repeated. The trust you have spoken of now and the beliefs which I have referred to in some way should be widely disseminated among the people. One of the worst possible effects of a nuclear war would be the destruction not only of the men who started it but also of all other living animals, plants and beings.</a></li>

Most of the military leaders survived. This is not a war in the classical tradition. Classically, war was fought by uniformed people, military experts, professionals. But in a nuclear war, such as we experienced in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, far more innocent people were killed. This fact should be remembered by all.</a></li>
