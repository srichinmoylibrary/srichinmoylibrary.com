<li class="leaf part-iv mid-1821149"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1077">Part IV</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-in-terms-of-actually-sponsoring-ultra-marathon-events-the-700-1000-and-1300-mile-races-did-you-specifically-feel-that-there-was-a-void-to-be-filled-when-you-started-these-events-i-know-that-a-number-of-years-ago-your-team-helped-the-new-york-road-runners-club-in-their-ultra-distance-events-then-at-a-certain-point-they-stopped-doing-it-and-you-began-organising-them-did-you-do-it-because-you-felt-the-world-would-lose-something-if-these-events-were-not-going-on- mid-1821150"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1078">Question: In terms of actually sponsoring ultra-marathon events — the 700, 1000 and 1300-mile races — did you specifically feel that there was a void to be filled when you started these events? I know that a number of years ago your team helped the New York Road Runners Club in their ultra-distance events. Then at a certain point, they stopped doing it, and you began organising them. Did you do it because you felt the world would lose something if these events were not going on?</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-i-have-been-told-that-you-have-returned-to-sprinting- mid-1821151"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1079">Question: I have been told that you have returned to sprinting.</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-when-somebody-like-stu-mittelman-or-yiannis-kouros-or-fred-lebow-says-quot-you-know-if-sri-chinmoy-were-not-doing-this-now-nobody-would-be-doing-it-quot-it-is-very-impressive-they-say-it-would-be-a-huge-loss-if-you-ever-stopped-conducting-these-races-you-do-not-respond-to-that-at-all-in-other-words-you-might-stop-the-events-when-your-inner-pilot-told-you-to-stop-them-even-if-it-meant-the-end-of-the-ultramarathon- mid-1821152"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1080">Question: When somebody like Stu Mittelman or Yiannis Kouros or Fred Lebow says, &quot;You know, if Sri Chinmoy were not doing this now, nobody would be doing it,&quot; it is very impressive. They say it would be a huge loss if you ever stopped conducting these races. You do not respond to that at all? In other words, you might stop the events when your Inner Pilot told you to stop them, even if it meant the end of the ultramarathon?</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-so-you-do-not-see-any-end-to-your-involvement-at-all- mid-1821153"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1081">Question: So you do not see any end to your involvement at all?</a></li>

<li class="leaf question-i-know-that-you-are-uncomfortable-associating-yourself-with-big-name-sponsors-but-if-you-wanted-to-bring-more-glamour-to-the-ultramarathon-would-you-ever-consider-working-with-big-sponsors-in-the-future- mid-1821155"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1083">Question: I know that you are uncomfortable associating yourself with big name sponsors, but if you wanted to bring more glamour to the ultramarathon, would you ever consider working with big sponsors in the future?</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-i-have-been-reading-some-of-your-writings-em-the-outer-running-and-the-inner-running-em-as-well-as-some-things-on-meditation-in-one-talk-that-you-gave-before-the-new-york-city-marathon-a-few-years-ago-you-told-your-students-to-run-their-best-but-if-they-happen-not-to-run-their-best-time-if-they-fail-in-their-personal-expectations-not-to-worry-about-that-at-all-you-said-the-main-thing-was-their-cheerfulness-that-the-running-itself-was-the-most-important-thing-i-also-know-that-you-do-have-a-special-respect-for-champions-like-carl-lewis-can-you-reconcile-these-two-attitudes-for-me- mid-1821156"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1084">Question: I have been reading some of your writings, <em>The Outer Running and the Inner Running</em>, as well as some things on meditation. In one talk that you gave before the New York City Marathon a few years ago, you told your students to run their best, but if they happen not to run their best time, if they fail in their personal expectations, not to worry about that at all. You said the main thing was their cheerfulness, that the running itself was the most important thing. I also know that you do have a special respect for champions like Carl Lewis. Can you reconcile these two attitudes for me?</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-are-people-like-carl-lewis-blessed-in-some-special-way-to-become-world-champions- mid-1821157"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1085">Question: Are people like Carl Lewis blessed in some special way to become world champions?</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-an-ultramarathon-is-very-much-a-kind-of-inner-search-as-opposed-to-competitive-sports-like-football-is-that-what-you-find-attractive- mid-1821158"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1086">Question: An ultramarathon is very much a kind of inner search, as opposed to competitive sports like football. Is that what you find attractive?</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-many-religions-claim-that-the-gods-of-other-religions-are-false-and-only-their-god-is-the-right-one-you-speak-of-the-supreme-but-this-does-not-seem-to-be-a-specific-god-to-the-exclusion-of-all-other-gods-it-is-everyone-s-god-somehow-your-disciples-are-not-strictly-following-a-religion-but-a-path-is-that-correct- mid-1821159"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1087">Question: Many religions claim that the Gods of other religions are false and only their God is the right one. You speak of the Supreme, but this does not seem to be a specific God to the exclusion of all other Gods. It is everyone's God, somehow. Your disciples are not strictly following a religion, but a path. Is that correct?</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-that-philosophy-would-have-prevented-many-wars-over-the-years- mid-1821160"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1088">Question: That philosophy would have prevented many wars over the years.</a></li>

Should these sports continue the way they are constituted or should there be a change in them to make them less violent?</a></li>
<li class="leaf part-v mid-1821162"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1090">Part V</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-when-we-meditate-with-you-specially-when-we-have-a-walk-past-meditation-should-we-concentrate-more-on-receiving-divine-qualities-from-you-or-on-giving-our-undivine-qualities-to-you- mid-1821163"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1091">Question: When we meditate with you, specially when we have a walk-past meditation, should we concentrate more on receiving divine qualities from you or on giving our undivine qualities to you?</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-some-of-your-bengali-songs-have-extremely-beautiful-melodies-but-when-i-learn-the-meaning-i-am-not-inspired-to-sing-them-sometimes-they-embody-a-degree-of-helplessness-for-example-em-bedanai-bhara-jibana-khanire-em-for-me-songs-that-have-a-more-positive-meaning-are-easier-to-sing- mid-1821164"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1092">Question: Some of your Bengali songs have extremely beautiful melodies, but when I learn the meaning, I am not inspired to sing them. Sometimes they embody a degree of helplessness — for example, <em>Bedanai bhara jibana khanire.</em> For me, songs that have a more positive meaning are easier to sing.</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-similarly-your-famous-song-em-sundara-hate-em-has-the-line-em-chaudike-mor-bishwa-bhubane-bedanar-sur-baje-em- mid-1821165"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1093">Question: Similarly your famous song <em>Sundara hate</em> has the line <em>Chaudike mor bishwa bhubane bedanar sur baje.</em></a></li>
<li class="leaf question-in-one-of-your-prayers-you-say-quot-if-i-love-you-just-because-you-love-me-then-i-am-worse-than-the-worst-quot-i-feel-that-if-i-love-the-supreme-it-is-only-because-the-supreme-has-brought-forward-that-capacity-in-me- mid-1821166"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1094">Question: In one of your prayers, you say, &quot;If I love You just because You love me, then I am worse than the worst.&quot; I feel that if I love the Supreme, it is only because the Supreme has brought forward that capacity in me.</a></li>
<li class="last leaf question-if-we-have-been-meditating-for-a-long-time-how-can-we-renew-our-inspiration- mid-1821167"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sca-1095">Question: If we have been meditating for a long time, how can we renew our inspiration?</a></li>
