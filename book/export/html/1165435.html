<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They can go as far as they can surrender cheerfully to God's Will. If they practise devotedly and cheerfully surrender their strength-capacities to their Lord Supreme, they will do extremely well. They will increase their capacities and they will be surprised to see their enormous progress.</p>  </div>
