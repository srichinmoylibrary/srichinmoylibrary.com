  <h1 class="book-heading">The secret run</h1>
  
 
<p>This morning before the ten-mile race, I ran to the three-and-a-half-mile mark in Flushing Meadow Park, and then I ran home.</p>
<p>Yasu saw me, then Kalatit and then Edythe. She was in a car, driving to Flushing Meadow to set up. But once I got home I pretended that I had not yet run so I could surprise everyone later.</p>
<p>During the race I was afraid Yasu would say, "I saw you running this morning," but fortunately he didn't say anything, so I kept my secret.</p>
<p>I was running so slowly during the ten-mile race that I didn't feel tired at all, even after nine miles. Then I waved to Lavanya and Chetana, saying that I was going to go faster for the last mile.</p>
<p>So this morning altogether I ran seventeen miles.</p>
