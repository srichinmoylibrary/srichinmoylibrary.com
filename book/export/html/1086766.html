<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is much wealth up in the sky. People have taken this wealth from earth and have kept it in the sky. When people pray and cry for God, they immediately get inner wealth which certain souls take up into the sky.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>I am telling you a great secret: you are a fantastic Dream of God</em>, Agni Press, 1974<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/gsdg-55</p></small>    </div>  </body>
