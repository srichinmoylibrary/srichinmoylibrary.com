  <h1 class="book-heading">Converting Canadian money</h1>
  
 
<p>I went down to the lobby of our hotel in Quebec City to do some shopping. I bought lots of things, and it came to $115. I asked the lady, "Do you accept American money?"</p>
<p>She said, "Oh, sure."</p>
<p>I asked her to convert the total cost from Canadian dollars into American dollars.</p>
<p>She said, "It is $165."</p>
<p>I said, "How can it be?"</p>
<p>She said, "This is what the register says."</p>
<p>I was laughing, and she was getting mad at me. She asked me to wait for her supervisor.</p>
<p>I said, "I am ready to wait for your supervisor."</p>
<p>When he came, the supervisor apologised to me. He said, "She has just joined us. She doesn't know the difference between Canadian and American money."</p>
<p>Then, when the supervisor converted the cost, it became $85.</p>
