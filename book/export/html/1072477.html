<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, this is not a religion at all. This is a path. This is not like Christianity, or Hinduism, or Buddhism or Islam. People from any religion can walk along a path, whereas a religion is like a house. If you are a Christian you live in Christianity, and if I am a Hindu I live in Hinduism. You may live in a different house from me, but we can both walk along the same path, and our destination can be the same.</p>  </div>
