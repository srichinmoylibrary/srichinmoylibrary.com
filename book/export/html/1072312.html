<p>Sri Chinmoy’s weightlifting-comet began its orbit on 26 June 1985 when he first took up the sport. A humble 40-pound dumbbell marked his debut. During the following months, the world witnessed this comet hurtling towards its zenith with a velocity and an energy that challenged all our preconceived ideas of human potential.</p>
<p>On 27 November 1986 Sri Chinmoy succeeded in lifting a 2,039-pound dumbbell overhead and supporting it with one arm. Three days later, he lifted 2,000 pounds using a standing calf raise. Even then, he continued to blaze a trail across our skies. On 20 January 1987 Sri Chinmoy succeeded in lifting a dumbbell weighing 3,081 3/4 pounds.</p>
<p>Gazing at the mysterious passage of this human comet, we find ourselves asking how and why such impossible feats have suddenly become possible. Far transcending the domain of sheer physical strength, they seem to be more in tune with the vast cosmic forces of the universe.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy’s answers to the many questions posed by his students, the media and bodybuilding and weightlifting experts, enlighten us by explaining how we can establish a free access to this inner source of power. His secrets are not training or diet-related. His secrets are meditation, prayer and absolute faith in God. With a heart of loving oneness, he encourages others to try this inner approach and experience for themselves the joy of touching the Infinite.</p>  </div>
