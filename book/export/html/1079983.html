    <title>Question: Is the reason for this that there is a feeling of oneness in human gratitude and God&#039;s Compassion? Is that why these two qualities are so all-encompassing?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In oneness you get everything. A child has established oneness with his parents, so he knows he will get everything. If the parents have material power or any power, any capacity, then it is all his: the parents are going to give it to him. If you are one with someone, that means all his qualities are your very own, and vice versa. Your eyes are one with your legs and arms. Your arms want to perform something at a particular place. Your eyes show you how to get there and your legs take you. Just because oneness has been established in all your limbs, one complements and fulfils the other. So if you establish your oneness with God's Compassion on the strength of your gratitude for God's Compassion, then inside God's Compassion you will get everything.</p>
<p>But again, if you find it extremely difficult to think of God's Compassion all the time or your own gratitude, then try to bring to the fore individual aspects of God's Capacity. If God's Power is what you want, then concentrate on God's Power. If you want inner cry, which you need, then try to bring this to the fore. Or if you need sincerity, try to get this. Anything you need, you bring forward individually.</p>
<p>But if gratitude is there, then inside gratitude you will find power, sincerity, simplicity and all divine qualities, because gratitude means oneness. God has played His role by giving; you have played your role by expressing your gratitude. By giving, God has shown his oneness with you; and by offering your gratitude, you have become one with Him.</p>  </div>
