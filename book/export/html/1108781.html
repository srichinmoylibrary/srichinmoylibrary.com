<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em>: My dear Brother-Friend Roberto, I wish to offer you my prayerful and soulful gratitude for this signal award that you have accorded to me. In all sincerity I wish to tell you that, unlike you, I am not a musician of Himalayan height. In the past you have given this award to most distinguished people who have contributed much to the music world and to the Society. Here you have made a most deplorable mistake by offering this award to me! I am a budding musician, still blooming. But as a student of peace, as a man of prayer, I try to include music in my prayers and meditations. Whatever I do, I do with prayerful and soulful melodies deep inside my heart.</p>
<p>So, in that capacity I wish to accept your blessingful award — as a student of peace, as a man of prayer, as a lover of God who tries in each and every activity of his to carry a peaceful melody. My prayerful and peaceful music I wish to offer to you, Brother-Friend Roberto, and also to my dear friend Rafael, and to all the others who are blessingfully offering this award to me. I shall cherish this award in the very depths of my gratitude-heart.</p>
<p>I feel that each and every human being in God’s creation needs a heart of gold. A heart of gold means purity, beauty, divinity and immortality. If each of us has a heart of gold, then this world of ours — which right now is full of conflicts, quarrels and fights — will, without fail, be inundated with peace, light and bliss. So today’s blessingful award of yours will always remind me, and I do hope all my students as well, of one thing — that we all desperately need a heart of gold to have a peaceful world. If we have a heart of gold, then automatically peace will blossom in each and every human being, and the whole of humanity will be flooded with love, joy and bliss. I wish this heart of gold to grow inside my prayerful heart so that my heart will be as beautiful, as pure and as divine as your blessingful offering to me today.</p>

<p>Corazón de Oro, Corazón de Oro, Corazón de Oro!<br /> O Heart of Gold, O Heart of Gold, O Heart of Gold!<br /> Infinity’s oneness-delight you ever enfold.<br /> Your song-beauty, music-fragrance, treasured by God’s Core.<br /> Your culture-heritage is the summit-pride of the Golden Shore.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>


<p>Corazón de Oro!<br /> El deleite de la unidad del infinito<br /> Los envuelve a ustedes siempre.<br /> La fragrancia musical de su bella canción<br /> Es atesorada por el centro de Dios.<br /> Su herencia cultural<br /> Es la cima de su orgullo.</p>
