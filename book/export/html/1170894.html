<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I meditate at the United Nations on Tuesdays and Fridays from one to two o’clock. We have been offering these peace meditations for the last 27 years. When the United Nations celebrated its 50th anniversary, our peace meditation group celebrated 25 years of dedicated service to the United Nations. We are half the age of the United Nations. Our meditation sessions originated under the late Secretary-General U Thant, who was very kind to me.</p>
<p>The first Secretary-General was Trygve Lie, then Dag Hammarskjöld, then U Thant. He came from Burma. He was a close friend of mine, and he inspired me to start the peace meditations at the United Nations. The delegates and staff who are interested come and meditate with us. Over the years we have organised many, many programmes honouring the countries that long for oneness and peace. I have also given many talks about world peace, oneness and harmony at the United Nations.</p>  </div>
