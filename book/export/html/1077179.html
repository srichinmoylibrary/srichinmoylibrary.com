<p>Even when world name and world fame touched the very dust of his feet, it seems that his absent-mindedness-friend would not leave him. Soon after Einstein moved to Princeton, the Dean’s office received a phone call asking where Dr. Einstein lived. When the office said it was the policy not to give out this information in order to protect the scientist from curious visitors, the caller lowered his voice and said, <em>“Please do not tell anybody, but I am Dr. Einstein. I am on my way home and have forgotten where my house is.”</em></p>
<p>What do we learn from this? The mind is so deeply absorbed in one highly illumining and fulfilling reality that it finds it extremely difficult, almost impossible, to come down to the matter-oriented consciousness of human life.</p>  </div>
