<p><em>Columbia University; New York, New York, USA</em><br /><em>St. Paul’s Chapel</em><br /><em>23 April 1971</em></p>
<p>Dear sisters and brothers, we belong to one family, one spiritual family. The head of this spiritual family is the Supreme, our Inner Pilot. Today I offer to each of you my soulful gratitude for granting me the opportunity to be of dedicated service to the Supreme in you. Nothing gives me greater joy than to be of selfless service to the Supreme in humanity. Again and again, to each seeker present here this evening, I offer gratitude, soulful gratitude, endless gratitude, from the inmost recesses of my heart.</p>
<p>Our Inner Pilot is crying for us. Let us run, run towards His Boat. Let us enter into His Boat, and let us sail along with Him towards the Golden Shore of the Beyond. He is our Aspiration. He is our Soul. He is at the same time our journey’s perpetual Goal. He is our own, very own. We came into the world, Him to serve, Him to reveal, Him to manifest, Him to fulfil. He showers His choicest blessings on the dedicated hearts of His spiritual children.</p>
<p>“Uttisthata jagrata…/ — Arise, awake! Awake, arise!” Let us stop not until the Goal of Goals is won. This Goal of Goals is the Heart of the Supreme, our Eternal Pilot.</p>  </div>
