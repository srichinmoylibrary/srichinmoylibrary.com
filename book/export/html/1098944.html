<p>Once I went with Eric Hughes, my sponsor’s friend, to visit his parents in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was on the occasion of Thanksgiving. Just before we began our Thanksgiving meal, Eric’s mother asked me to say Grace. I did not know what the term ‘Grace’ meant. Then she said, “Just say a prayer.” So my prayer came. Unfortunately, my prayer never ended! They were all waiting to eat and my prayer was going on and on. But Eric’s mother was so kind to me. I used to call her my mother. She said, “Only say Grace for a minute. Do not say it for so long!”</p>
<p>The second time I visited Eric’s parents, I was there for three or four days. Again she begged me to say Grace. “No, I do not want to say it,” I said.</p>
<p>“Only for a minute, please say it,” she asked. So I said Grace for even less than a minute. That was how I learned to say Grace.</p>  </div>
