<p>Everybody at the Consulate was so kind to me. I must say that Mr. Ramamoorthy was very, very nice to me. He is an excellent cook and he invited me to eat at his place quite a few times. His dal is simply excellent. Once I told him that I wanted to take a loan from the bank and he immediately co-signed.</p>
<p>Mr. Ramamoorthy had a friend, Krishan Dhanda, who used to live in the same apartment. They used to quarrel and fight like anything; they were like the North Pole and the South Pole. They both worked at India House. Again, they stayed together. They were always arguing.</p>
<p>Krishan Dhanda was the one who made the arrangements for me to give my maiden speech here in America. It was at Hicksville High School on 4 October 1965. That was the day Pope Paul VI came to New York to speak at the United Nations. When we came out, we heard it in the car.</p>
<p>Krishan Dhanda has been paralysed for the last four or five years and I have been promising Mr. Ramamoorthy that both of us should go and visit him. I must keep my promise. He was so kind to me.</p>
<p><em>Mr. B. Ramamoorthy:</em></p>
<p><em>Krishan Dhanda used to tease Guru like anything. It was his nature to tease and make jokes. Guru would come to me and say, “Mr. Ramamoorthy, Dhanda has said such and such.”</em></p>
<p><em>I would reply, “Don’t worry, Ghose. I will take care of it.”</em></p>
<p><em>Even when Dhanda was sick, he used to crack jokes. He had kidney stones and was admitted to the hospital several times. The nurses were all nice to him because he was such a joker. One time, I drove him there and he was in severe pain. The nurses said, “Krishan, are you back again?”</em></p>
<p><em>“No, I just came to say hello,” he replied. Needless to say, he was admitted that day!</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. B. Ramamoorthy:</em></p>
<p><em>At the Consulate, Guru was extremely, extremely shy and aloof. You can say he was in the other world. Normally he would not initiate any conversation, but if others spoke to him, then he would reply. He used to remain all by himself.</em></p>
<p><em>Once in a while I would talk to him and then later we became close friends.</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. B. Ramamoorthy:</em></p>
<p><em>In April or May 1966, Guru made a prediction for me on a personal matter. He said that on a particular date I would get a letter. At that time, the letter had not even been written.</em></p>
<p><em>His prediction came true. On the exact date which he had said, I got the letter.</em></p>  </div>
