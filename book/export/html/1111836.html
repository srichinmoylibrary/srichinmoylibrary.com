<p>For such a long time I have had many famous runners' questions to answer for our newspaper column. Finally, today I answered a question from Craig Virgin. I did not know outwardly that today Niriha had taken a videotape of my running to show Craig Virgin at the New York Marathon clinic so that he could analyse my style. I was answering his question, and he was solving my problems! This is how things go together in the soul's world.</p>
