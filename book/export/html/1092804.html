<p>When his rivals were at their resistance-obstruction-height, Subhas Chandra's heart was all concern for Gandhi-ji's health. One day, when the Mahatma had a fever, Subhas wrote to him with utmost devotion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am feeling anxious about your fever. I am praying that it may soon disappear. With respectful pranams,</p>
<p>Yours affectionately,</p>
<p>Subhas"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas, when Subhas was a victim to high fever and sickness, his fate was otherwise.</p>  </div>
