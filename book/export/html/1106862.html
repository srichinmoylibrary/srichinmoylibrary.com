<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind does not want us to get anything from anybody other than itself. Right from the beginning the human mind wants to keep us away from everything and everybody. If God is in the picture, then the mind will not have supremacy. Therefore, the mind wants to keep the Supreme away from us, and it wants to keep us from getting what the Supreme wants to give us.</p>  </div>
