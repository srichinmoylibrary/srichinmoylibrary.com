<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is nothing wrong if you feel aspiration in your music. But you have to know how many hours you can think of your music. If you spend five hours, six hours, seven hours a day on music, then spend one hour or two hours, let us say, on spirituality. Music is also a form of spirituality; I don't deny it. But the height that you will achieve from meditation either you may not get or cannot get from your music. Music is an added help. From meditation you may get ninety-nine dollars of spiritual wealth and from music you may get one dollar. There are many things that will not give you even one dollar's worth. Music is ready to give you five dollars or even ten dollars worth. But the main eighty or ninety dollars' worth you will get from your meditation.</p>  </div>
