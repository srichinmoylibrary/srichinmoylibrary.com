<p>I always say that if someone’s soul comes to me, I invariably see the person a few seconds later. This time it was at least seven minutes. The incident happened three days ago, early in the morning.</p>
<p>At least seven minutes before I saw her, Vijaya’s soul came to me and I blessed her. It was at my 1500-metre mark. Then when I had gone another 800 metres, I saw Vijaya running. I said, “I never thought she would run at this hour by herself.” On other days, I have seen Nilima with her. But on that day she was alone.</p>
<p>No matter which way I go, Sulochana is available, either here or there. Usually, I do not draw attention from people. But in her case, she runs looking down. So I have to scream and draw her attention. She is in another world.</p>
