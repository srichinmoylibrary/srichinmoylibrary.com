<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My concerts are free because my students all over the world are very kind and generous to me. They want to defray all the expenses of the concerts that I offer. I have given more than 700 concerts in various countries and some of the venues are very well known â€” Royal Albert Hall in London, Sydney Opera House, Carnegie Hall in New York, Davies Hall in San Francisco and so forth. I feel it is my duty to offer my music to my brothers and sisters of the world free of charge. So my students have organised these concerts and they are encouraging me to offer them without charge.</p>  </div>
