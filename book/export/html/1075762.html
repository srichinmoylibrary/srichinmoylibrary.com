<p><em>(Aurobindo, Rash Behari Ghosh, Sir Gurudas Banerjee and Nagendra Nath Guha.)</em></p>
<p>RASH BEHARI: Aurobindo Babu, please do not take me amiss. We admit that Nationalism is an invaluable thing. But to preach it in the College, we believe, is not advisable. You always insist on admitting the boys who have been rusticated from Government institutions on political grounds. You say that they are just the sort of stuff that you want for this College. Moreover, it is not safe at all. The Government have already started looking upon our College with an eye of suspicion.</p>
<p>AURO: <em>(After heaving a deep sigh)</em> I think our College must have an ideal of its own. Will you be pleased if it follows other Colleges <em>in toto</em>?</p>
<p>GURUDAS: Not at all. But the thing is, if the students pay more attention to politics and nationalism than to their studies, then their studies will go to the dogs.</p>
<p>AURO: I don't think politics and nationalism stand as a bar to their mental culture. One has to adore one's Motherland first. Mere mental information is of no use. I believe, one who has no love for his country is no better than a learned fool, although one may be rich in mental attainments.</p>
<p>GURUDAS: I must say, you are quite ahead of our age. Nationalism, politics and mental culture — these three cannot go together.</p>
<p>AURO: I am sorry, I fail to share your views. The name of our College is Bengal National College. Will it not be a negation of the <em>raison d'être</em> of the College if it keeps clear of Nationalism?</p>
<p>NAGENDRA: Aurobindo Babu, you are always noted for your clarity of thought and expression, depth of understanding and the facility with which you make the abstruse intelligible. I am deeply convinced that your own lofty spirit of Nationalism will fill the country with a powerful idealism that will build up our Nation. But our College is a different matter ...</p>  </div>
