<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Oh, dear man, how wonderful of you to come! <em>(Sri Chinmoy offers Leonard Bernstein a bouquet of flowers.)</em> Thank you so much for the gift.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is so kind of you to invite me.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I am sorry to keep you waiting. You are an important man. Are you all alone?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am here alone, but my students are downstairs.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Your students? How many?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are about twenty or so. I have composed a song in honour of you and I would be very grateful if you would kindly allow us to sing the song.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> But of course. Do you want to bring them up?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here we could have a few minutes of silence, and then we could call them.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> How wonderful!</p>  </div>
