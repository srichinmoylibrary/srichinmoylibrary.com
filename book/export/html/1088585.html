<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No! although the political boundaries of India changed, the consciousness of India did not disappear and will not disappear from the places that used to be part of India. If some lands have now become Pakistan or Bangladesh, the consciousness of India remained with these lands. If a portion of India is now in Pakistan, then that portion definitely has India's consciousness.</p>  </div>
