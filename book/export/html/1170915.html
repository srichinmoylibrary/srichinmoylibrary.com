SCA 448-465. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions during a bus trip to Kingston, Canada, on 25 October 1997.</p>
<h2>Question: When chosen instruments fail, does the choice withdraw and go to others?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When chosen instruments fail, in some cases the Supreme wants me to wait indefinitely for the return of their highest height. In some cases He wants me to wait for a few years and see, and then make the final decision. In some cases He wants me to withdraw completely from them. In some cases He asks me to replace them.</p>  </div>
