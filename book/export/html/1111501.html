<p>Nayana was helping Chetana. Chetana had already run thirteen miles before Nayana started running with her, but Nayana was dying to such an extent that she needed help herself. After eight hundred metres Chetana went ahead of Nayana. I told Nayana to try to catch up with Chetana and help her anyway. Nayana was very obedient. She ran and ran, but she could not catch up with Chetana — even near the finish line.</p>
