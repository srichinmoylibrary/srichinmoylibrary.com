<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not a mental process. Unfortunately, I will not be able to explain it to you. It is a gradual revelation. Gradually, gradually, gradually it came to the point where everything became very clear to me. Gradually I came to the point where I saw or felt the truth that I had been searching for. When we take exercise regularly, we strengthen our muscles and become very, very strong. In the spiritual life also, slowly and steadily we win the race.</p>  </div>
