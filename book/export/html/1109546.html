<p>Evolution can never come into existence from nothing, from zero. The appearance of 'is' can only be from the existence of 'was'. Let us fill our minds with the immortal utterance of Wordsworth from "Intimations of Immortality":</p>

<p>"Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:<br /> The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,<br /> Hath had elsewhere its setting,<br /> And cometh from afar:<br /> Not in entire forgetfulness,<br /> And not in utter nakedness,<br /> But trailing clouds of glory do we come<br /> From God, who is our home."</p>

<p>Here the poet carries us into the mystery of the soul's eternal journey and reminds us of the perennial Source.</p>  </div>
