<p>There was once a minister who was also the court jester. He used to amuse the King with his wit, his talent and his earthly wisdom. The King was very fond of this particular minister.</p>
<p>One day the King was a bit upset. His favourite minister displeased him while he was in this mood, and he burst out, “You are the son of an ass!”</p>
<p>The minister immediately replied, “You are perfectly right in your statement. That is why I consider you to be my true father.”</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>The son reflects the light of the father. If I am a spiritual man and you accept me as your true father, that means that you are also a spiritual man.</p>
<p>God is Divine. Since we are all His children, we are nothing but Divine.</p>  </div>
