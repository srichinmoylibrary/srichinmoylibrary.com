<p>While I was lifting the car with the disciples sitting inside it, I was not even in the human world; I was in the inner world. When I was about to do my sixth lift — the car plus eleven disciples sitting inside and on the trunk — I was clearly seeing Bill Pearl’s soul next to me. The soul said to me, “It is too much, too much!”</p>
<p>I said to the soul, “I know, I know. But please help me!”</p>
<p>Then his soul said, “Definitely.”</p>
<p>After I lifted the car and eleven disciples, I soulfully thanked Bill Pearl’s soul for its help and the soul made the comment, “Stupendous!”</p>
<p>Then I did exactly the same thing again. This time, the soul was so amazed that it was absolutely speechless.</p>
