<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I always give one hundred per cent credit to God. God gave Carl Lewis the capacity to become the fastest human being. Some people will say that it is because he practised so hard. True, he did practise, but even the aspiration and dedication he had to practise came from God. If I have to give credit, I will always give one hundred per cent credit to God. Carl Lewis had brothers who ran very fast, and he had so many athletic friends. They also practised. Why did they not become world champions? It was God who inspired Carl Lewis to become world champion.</p>
<p>In a class, there are so many students, but only one person comes first. Grace is operating in and through everybody. It is a matter of receptivity. That is why I give one hundred per cent credit for my success and others' success to God.</p>  </div>
