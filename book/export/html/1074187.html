<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, you wonâ€™t understand their language, but you can hear it with the subtle ear. Again, you can get it with the third eye. Many times the third eye gets the voice infinitely sooner than the ear. It is not a language with words. The language they use is light. The message is in the light. They can sing and do everything through light.</p>  </div>
