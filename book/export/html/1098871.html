<p>One of the secretaries in our section was Mrs. Carol Coutinhoe. Except me, is there anybody who did not get scoldings from her? She used to tell Dhanda: “Dhanda, do not forget that I am married! You should not speak to me so much!” My other colleagues also used to cut jokes with her and she would scold them and insult them mercilessly. But, in my case, she used to say, “Ghose is very nice. Ghose never cuts jokes with me.”</p>
<p>When I started going to the United Nations, Carol Coutinhoe’s husband was there. He used to work at the Permanent Mission. That was in 1971 or ’72.</p>  </div>
