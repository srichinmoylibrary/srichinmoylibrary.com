<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can know which part of your intellectual or creative self should be developed by becoming more fully acquainted with the divine qualities that each part of your existence embodies, reveals and manifests most effectively. Suppose you want to see the truth most effectively on the intellectual plane. Then, instead of sharpening your intellect, you have to try to illumine your intellect by invoking the light of the soul. Or suppose you want to know which field of creativity is meant for you. Then, while your creative self is revealing its capacity in various fields, try to observe which field gives you most joy and satisfaction. If the poet in you gives you immediate joy, then throw yourself into the poetry-world. If the artist in you gives you spontaneous joy, then throw yourself into the art-world. If the musician in you gives you spontaneous joy, then throw yourself into the world of music. Whatever field gives you the most joy should be immediately accepted. Your very acceptance of this is the best way of serving the Supreme.</p>  </div>
