<p>On another day in Scotland I wanted to run my seven miles for the day. I ran with Janaka for three and a half miles. Two and a half miles were all hills that we had to really climb. Janani and David were watching us run.</p>
<p>Then we came to such a steep hill! It went straight up. We saw one man run about a hundred metres up the hill and we were admiring him. I also wanted to run up that hill, but the Scottish disciples were saying that the road was not good enough to run on.</p>
