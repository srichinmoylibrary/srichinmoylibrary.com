<p>One tip for the shoppers: if you drive for an hour out of Guatemala City, there is a place where there are literally hundreds of shops, all cute, cuter, cutest. They are Indian-style shops. As soon as you see them, you will be reminded of Sri Lanka, Bali and other places. They are so beautiful. This lane and that lane have hundreds of shops on each one. And it is indoors, so the sun will not bother you. I do not know the name of the place, but I know that it takes an hour. You have to make sure you find the right place. Otherwise, you will see only a tourist street, but that is not the place. You have to go inside the compound and there you will see so many small, cute shops. They will definitely satisfy your curiosity, plus empty your pockets. The people there are very, very nice. I have a bad habit of bargaining, but it seemed to me that they enjoyed and I enjoyed our 'discussions'.</p>
