SCA 1033-1038. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions for the Italian magazine <em>Armonia</em> in New York on 13 July 2000.</p>
<h2>Question: Which spiritual qualities has humanity developed at this point in its evolution?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To be very frank, because the world has not developed appreciable spiritual qualities, it is in such miserable condition. If I have to say what spiritual qualities the world has developed up until now, I will say: compromise, mutual agreement and a deep hunger for world peace.</p>  </div>
