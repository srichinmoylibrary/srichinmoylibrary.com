<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good! Each second the Supreme fulfils Himself in a specific way. At one particular second He may like His Compassion-aspect infinitely more than His Power-aspect or His other aspects. At that moment, if my disciples sing most soulfully the songs that deal with compassion, then definitely these songs will please Him most. Similarly, if He wants to manifest the Power-aspect on earth more than any other aspect at a particular second, then if the disciples sing most powerfully the songs that I have written on power, these will please Him most. So it entirely depends on the Supreme's own Consciousness as it deals with the Supreme's own earth-bound and Heaven-free Time.</p>  </div>
