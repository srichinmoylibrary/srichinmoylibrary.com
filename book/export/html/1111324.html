<p>Yesterday, while running by the canal in Honolulu, I saw S the Great first among the girls.</p>
<p>S is a great runner. She went ahead of me. Madhuri and Annette were right behind her by the canal, but I didn't see them.</p>
<p>Before I greeted S, I looked at the time. It was four minutes to six. I said, "How can she do this? She is not allowed to run alone until after six o'clock."</p>
<p>Then, ten metres behind, I saw the other two I said, "All right."</p>
