<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To be very frank with you, if you chant somebody's name when they are asleep, it won't have any effect. Please forgive me, you may be chanting with all your love, affection and concern for that person, but unfortunately you will not be able to identify yourself with his soul. His soul may be in some region that you cannot enter. But in my case, at any time, whichever region the soul is in, I can go there. Only when you become one with the soul in this way does chanting become effective.</p>
<p>As your spiritual leader, when I make a fervent request to you during a meeting to repeat another disciple's name so that we can help that person's soul, at that time I take all of you totally inside my heart. So if you want to, repeat the name of the Supreme or your Guru's name, and then say your prayer for the person. I always say that if you repeat the Supreme's name, the Supreme identifies Himself with you. The Supreme's Soul is within you and your soul is in the Supreme, whereas your friend's soul is not inside you. So if you repeat the name of the Supreme a few times and then offer your prayer to Him, you will get the most immediate results.</p>  </div>
