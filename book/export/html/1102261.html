<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The United Nations is a place where humanity can talk, learn and become. Humanity can talk of lasting peace, learn the secret of love and become the delight of oneness. Because of this, the United Nations is unmistakably the greatest in terms of its vision-capacity, which will eventually be manifested as the most fulfilling reality-perfection and Immortality-satisfaction.</p>
<p>According to our limited body, curious vital, searching mind and crying heart, the United Nations is no less than a miracle. But we have one more member in our family: the soul. The soul has quite a different story to narrate. It tells us that there is no such thing as a miracle. Anything that in the ordinary world seems uncommon, unusual and unfamiliar we call a miracle. But there are many higher planes of consciousness where these so-called miracles are common occurrences.</p>
<p>God the Creator and God the creation are one. We see God the creation here, there and everywhere. But we find it difficult to realise or accept God the Creator so easily, not to speak of so lovingly and devotedly. When God the Creator, out of His infinite Compassion, reveals just an iota of His Light and Power through a human life, or lets humanity have a glimpse of a realm of consciousness to which it does not have a free access, our human minds quite often call this a miracle. But, from this point of view, God the creation should also be regarded as a miracle. Only we do not appreciate it because it is always visible and available to us.</p>
<p>Again, from the highest point of view, there is no such thing as a miracle. Although today we are not aware of something or something has not yet manifested on earth, tomorrow we may become aware of it or it may become manifested. So there is no need to call it a miracle; its existence-reality has already been discovered by the highest and greatest member of our own family, the soul. Needless to say, miracle-power does not and cannot elevate our consciousness. It is our soulful aspiration that can and will elevate and illumine our consciousness and fulfil unreservedly the Real in us. And what is the Real in us? The universal oneness of the Transcendental Height. Truth to tell, the soul of our dear United Nations embodies this all-loving and all-fulfilling divine Reality.</p>
<p>With your soul's kind permission, I am bringing this answer to the personal level. I have had the opportunity to hear a good many speeches by a good many speakers. My searching human mind tells me that each speech of yours is nothing short of a miracle in the way it embodies and reveals most striking depths and heights. But my flying soul-bird, which has a free access to the higher planes of reality, tells me unmistakably and shows me convincingly the actual reality that your soul so spontaneously and beautifully reveals through your aspiration and dedication-life. If I believe in my soul, which I eternally do, then your invaluable gifts to the United Nations and to the world at large are not miracles but a spontaneous self-offering to the Absolute Pilot Supreme on the strength of your aspiration-vision and dedication-mission.</p>  </div>
