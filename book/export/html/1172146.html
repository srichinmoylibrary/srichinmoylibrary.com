<p>When I arrived at the hotel, they asked me to pay in advance, so I gave them eight hundred rupees. Then they asked me, "At what time do you wish to leave?"</p>
<p>I answered, "I want to leave this place at three o'clock."</p>
<p>They said, "Oh yes, we shall call you at three o'clock."</p>
<p>I told them three, but I knew that if I left at 3:15, it would also be all right. The plane was due to leave at 4:30. It was only three minutes from there and I had my ticket. In the room I took out my timer. I said, "In case they do not call me, I will use this." So I set the timer.</p>
<p>Then I called my brother to find out how my sister was. He said, "She is still alive. You will be able to see her."</p>
<p>I said, "This is the greatest news I have got." This was the only message I wanted to hear; I was so happy that she was still alive.</p>
<p>Then I phoned up the nursing home. The nurse shouted, "Lily-di, Lily-di, Chinmoy-da is calling you!" Then she took the phone to my sister, and said, "Say something, say something! Say hello at least or call his name."</p>
<p>My sister was not able to do me that favour. She could not speak. I thought, "The boat is sinking. Before I touch the destination, before I reach Pondicherry, she cannot even say hello. She is so sick." I was praying to God: "Since I have taken such trouble to come to see my dearest sister, God, allow me at least to see her."</p>  </div>
