  <h1 class="book-heading">The Core Of India&#039;s Light, Part 2</h1>
  
   <div id="node-1074324" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1. Abhaya</h1>
  
 

<p>Be fearless. Ignorance-tiger will immediately disappear.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074325" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2. Acharya</h1>
  
 

<p>A spiritual Teacher is he who not only tells us and shows us where God is but also teaches us how we ourselves can eventually become God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074326" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3. Aditya</h1>
  
 

<p>The outer sun is inspiration.</p>
<p>The inner sun is at once aspiration and realisation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074327" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4. Agni</h1>
  
 

<p>If you constantly keep your inner fire burning, then God will be nearing you before long.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074328" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5. Aparajita</h1>
  
 

<p>Everything is unconquerable except God. Once we conquer God with our unconditional surrender, we immediately see that the things that were unconquerable are now only unconquered, and the things that were unconquered are now being conquered. To conquer God’s Compassion is to conquer the conquerable. To conquer man’s stupidity is to conquer the unconquerable.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074329" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6. Aparicchinna</h1>
  
 

<p>Infinite is the Goal. Eternal is the soul. We make friends with the Eternal in order to grow into the Infinite.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074330" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7. Aparoksha</h1>
  
 

<p>In order to have the direct knowledge of God, try to unlearn immediately what you have learned so far from humanity’s stupidity, and learn once more what Divinity’s Reality has already taught you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074331" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8. Apavitra</h1>
  
 

<p>An impure thought lasting for a minute is strong enough to destroy a man’s aspiration for the rest of the day. A day lost is the precursor of a new defeat. A new defeat in the life of aspiration marks a fatal destruction.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074332" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9. Apurna</h1>
  
 

<p>By doing something we cannot complete our incomplete life. By becoming something we cannot complete our incomplete life. But by establishing a cheerful and unconditional oneness with God’s Will we can easily complete our incomplete life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074333" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10. Apurva</h1>
  
 

<p>God the created universe is unique, and God the unmanifested Reality is unique. I need God the created universe to see God’s unique Face. I need God the unmanifested Reality to touch God’s unique Feet.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074334" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11. Archana</h1>
  
 

<p>The body’s real offering to God is lethargy.</p>
<p>The vital’s real offering to God is aggression.</p>
<p>The mind’s real offering to God is doubt.</p>
<p>The heart’s real offering to God is insecurity.</p>
<p>The soul’s real offering to God is unwillingness to work in and through ignorance-night for God-manifestation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074335" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12. Artha</h1>
  
 

<p>With material wealth we are apt to challenge the world. With spiritual wealth we are apt to establish our inseparable oneness with God’s entire creation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074336" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13. Asambhava</h1>
  
 

<p>Impossibility at once starves our body’s necessity and feeds our soul’s challenging, illumining and fulfilling promise.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074337" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14. Asanga</h1>
  
 

<p>Non-attachment is an illumining and liberating force. Attachment is a binding and blinding force.</p>
<p>Attachment-teacher tells us that we need everything in God’s creation. Non-attachment-teacher tells us that there is nothing on earth worth having.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074338" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15. Asanti</h1>
  
 

<p>The absence of peace makes one feel that his is the life of an insignificant ant. The presence of peace makes one feel that his is the life for even God to be truly proud of.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074339" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16. Asara</h1>
  
 

<p>When we do not aspire, our very life becomes barren. A barren life and God’s Compassion compete with each other. Eventually we see that God’s Compassion wins the race. And then what does it do? It immediately changes a barren life into the life of an aspiration-sun.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074340" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17. Asat</h1>
  
 

<p>The easiest way to conquer fear, doubt and jealousy is not to say that they are destructive, but to convince the mind that they are totally non-existent.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074341" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18. Asmrti</h1>
  
 

<p>Forgetfulness is a blessing when we dare to have a new and promising life.</p>
<p>Forgetfulness is a curse when we forget God’s Compassion-Light, which is our only fulfilling Satisfaction-Reality.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074342" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19. Asu</h1>
  
 

<p>In the spiritual life, the breath of life is purity. And what does purity do? It expands the finite, and sets it in tune with the Infinite.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074343" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20. Asura</h1>
  
 

<p>The worst possible demon is within us and not without us. The name of this demon is suspicion-night. This demon ruthlessly strangles us, kills us and destroys us.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074344" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">21. Atanu</h1>
  
 

<p>If we want to escape from the body’s prison and become part and parcel of the bodiless reality, then what we need is a constant friendship with the soul’s divinity-beauty.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074345" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">22. Atindriya</h1>
  
 

<p>As long as you are within the reach of the senses, you will try and cry. Once you are beyond the reach of the senses, you will fly and fly. But how can you be beyond the reach of the senses? You can be beyond the reach of the senses the moment you declare that your senses are for God to use, and not for you to use.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074346" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23. Atmabala</h1>
  
 

<p>Self-giving is the matchless soul-force. This soul-force awakens the dormant human in us, liberates the bound divine in us and fulfils the unfulfilled God in us.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074347" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24. Atma-Drshti</h1>
  
 

<p>Perfect perfection does not remain a far cry when we cultivate self-vision in everything and everyone.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074348" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25. Atma-Jnana</h1>
  
 

<p>He who is blessed with the direct knowledge of the Transcendental Self is also blessed with the supreme Pride of the Absolute Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074349" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">26. Atma-Prakasa</h1>
  
 

<p>Self-revelation in the animal world is world-destruction. Self-revelation in the human world is ego-assertion. Self-revelation in the divine world is God-manifestation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074350" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">27. Atma-Trpti</h1>
  
 

<p>Unless and until God-Satisfaction dawns in our aspiration-life, there can be no true self-satisfaction even for a fleeting second.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074351" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">28. Avarana</h1>
  
 

<p>How can we remove the veil of ignorance-night? We can do so only by becoming an untiring cry in the inner world and an unending smile in the outer world.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074352" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">29. Baddha</h1>
  
 

<p>God’s Grace has bound you; therefore, your presence is found in every aspiring and serving human being.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074353" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">30. Bahudha</h1>
  
 

<p>In many ways I can please God. One of the ways to please God is to stop spreading the expectation-net.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074354" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">31. Bahya</h1>
  
 

<p>Our external life needs simplicity and humility more than anything else. Our internal life needs sincerity and purity more than anything else.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074355" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">32. Bandha</h1>
  
 

<p>A bondage-thought instigates me to think that I must needs live only for my own existence-reality. A freedom-thought inspires me to feel that I lived, live and shall eternally live only for my Beloved Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074356" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">33. Bhagavan</h1>
  
 

<p>In the human world the Lord Supreme is the possession-king. In the divine world the Lord Supreme is the Perfection-Prince.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074357" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">34. Bhajana</h1>
  
 

<p>To love the real in us is to worship the Supreme in us. The real in us is the soul. The Supreme in us is self-realisation for God-manifestation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074358" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">35. Bhakti</h1>
  
 

<p>Man thinks that God’s Compassion is sweeter than the sweetest. God knows that man’s devotion is sweeter than the sweetest.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074359" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">36. Bhava</h1>
  
 

<p>When we have a divine attitude towards our ideal Goal, we not only expedite our spiritual journey but also bring nearer to us the ideal Goal itself.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074360" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">37. Bhaya</h1>
  
 

<p>Fear is a strangled, divided reality which makes us feel that we can never claim the universal man and the transcendental God as our own, very own.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074361" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">38. Bhiksha</h1>
  
 

<p>To give alms to the needy is a sign of true generosity, and this generosity may help the receiver for some time. But the offering of an iota of soulful will from the depths of one’s heart can and will last for a very long time, if not forever.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074362" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">39. Bhikshu</h1>
  
 

<p>A mendicant roams from country to country to derive divine satisfaction from his God-search. A true seeker does not have to roam from country to country. His heart-home is large enough to house satisfaction supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074363" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">40. Bhoga</h1>
  
 

<p>When we sing the song of enjoyment, we see that there are many things which we will never be able to enjoy. But when we dance the dance of renunciation, we see that there is nothing on earth which we cannot divinely enjoy. As a matter of fact, renunciation itself is supreme satisfaction.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074364" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">41. Bhrashtah</h1>
  
 

<p>In the spiritual life, if your aspiration descends, you are undoubtedly a fallen hero. But you need not remain a fallen hero if you have an iota of tearful gratitude for what you have already received from your previous inner oneness with the higher realities that came from your inner cry.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074365" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">42. Bhranti</h1>
  
 

<p>To say that you love God more than He loves you is to deliberately enjoy the worst possible stupid mistake, both in your desire-life and in your aspiration-life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074366" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">43. Bija</h1>
  
 

<p>Yesterday I was the seed of inspiration. Today I am the plant of aspiration. Tomorrow I shall not only be the tree of realisation but also the fruit of man-satisfaction in God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074367" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">44. Bhumi</h1>
  
 

<p>Earth is great because of its patience-heart. Heaven is great because of its compassion-soul.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074368" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">45. Bhuvah</h1>
  
 

<p>The higher world longs for the manifestation of God-Illumination. The lower world cries for the descent of God-Compassion.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074369" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">46. Bhuh</h1>
  
 

<p>On the earth plane uncertainty reigns supreme. The manifestation of truth is uncertain. Everything is uncertain on the earth plane, save and except God’s Compassion.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074370" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">47. Bhuma</h1>
  
 

<p>The Delight of the Infinite the finite can never achieve but can easily receive, provided it becomes the song of constant selflessness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074371" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">48. Bhuvana</h1>
  
 

<p>Who can change the world? Not he who just talks. Not he who just does. Not he who says and does. Not he who does and says. But he who eternally is.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074372" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">49. Brahma</h1>
  
 

<p><em>Brahma</em> created the world. If I can change my own thought-world, then the Creator of the world will give me what I do not have: satisfaction in self-giving and satisfaction in God-receiving.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074373" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">50. Brhat</h1>
  
 

<p>Large is man’s heart. Larger is man’s promise. Largest is man’s gratitude-oneness with God’s Will.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074374" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">51. Chaitanya</h1>
  
 

<p>Consciousness binds the aspiration-cry of the earth-reality with the Satisfaction-Smile of the Heaven-Divinity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074375" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">52. Chakra</h1>
  
 

<p>Each centre of psychic power reveals the natural capacities of the inner world in a tangible form on the human plane.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074376" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">53. Chakshu</h1>
  
 

<p>The third eye sees, liberates and fulfils. The third eye sees the past, the present and the future. It illumines the aspiring human being in us and satisfies the serving divine being in us.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074377" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">54. Chanchala</h1>
  
 

<p>For the restless mind, Infinity’s peace will always remain a far cry.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074378" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">55. Cheshta</h1>
  
 

<p>Each time we endeavour to see good in mankind and do good for mankind, we become not only God’s better instruments but also His confidants.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074379" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">56. Chidananda</h1>
  
 

<p>The flood of consciousness-delight can be achieved only by the seeker’s unreserved heart and unconditional life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074380" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">57. Chinta</h1>
  
 

<p>An anxiety-stricken person delays the moment of illumination-poise and accelerates the hour of destruction-noise.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074381" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">58. Daiva</h1>
  
 

<p>Fate can be changed only when we knock at God’s Compassion-Gate and not at our desire’s gratification-gate.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074382" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">59. Daksha</h1>
  
 

<p>In order to become an expert in any walk of life, we must needs work very hard. We also must know that no sincere effort will be in vain. Each and every sincere effort will be crowned with success, of course, at God’s own choice Hour.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074383" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">60. Dama</h1>
  
 

<p>Control your senses. You will not only feel the existence of ecstasy-world but also grow into the very breath of ecstasy-world.</p>
