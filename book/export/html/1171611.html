SCA 1122-1123. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in Tenerife on 22 January 1992.</p>
<h2>Question: What is your opinion about the pollution of the environment?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a very sad thing that nature is being destroyed, the environment is being destroyed. It is nature that keeps us beautiful and soulful. When nature is destroyed, when artificial things replace the natural beauty, it will ruin all the good qualities that human beings have. Unfortunately, people like artificial things, glamorous things. Many people do not like natural things which have their own beauty, purity and divinity. I feel very sad that the environment is being polluted and destroyed. I feel that we should pray that nature should remain natural. Beauty should remain always as it is so that we can derive from it our purest joy, purest love and purest oneness.</p>  </div>
