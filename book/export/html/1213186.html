<p><em>Madal:</em></p>
<p>Chinmoy, when you <em>explicate</em> a most difficult spiritual idea or concept, do your disciples offer you their deepest gratitude, or do they just remain silent taking everything for granted, since they are, after all, your children?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>Dear Madal, even their silence itself is a sign of inner gratitude. But I wish to tell you that when I <em>explain and unfold</em> something difficult to them, at that time, I do not need, I do not even expect gratitude from them. What I expect from them is the application of my advice in their outer life.</p>  </div>
