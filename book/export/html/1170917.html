<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Delight is not a thing to see. It is a thing to feel, to grow into and to become. But if you want to take delight as an earthly achievement or earthly material object, or in an earthly way if you wish to describe it, then try to imagine you have all at once become the highest mountain-height. You have become the highest mountain, the most beautiful moon, the most powerful sun, the largest ocean. Everything that you can imagine as larger than the largest, higher than the highest and most beautiful and most powerful, if you can imagine that you <em>are</em> those very things, the feeling that you get is delight. But that delight is not the real or pure delight. Real delight is inside; it is deep within. When we become inseparably one with God, we drink in and we breathe in and out Godâ€™s Will.</p>  </div>
