<p>Eternally mischievous, the Kauravas once got an opportunity to imprison Krishna's son, Shamba.</p>
<p>Krishna sent some of his representatives to arrange for Shamba's release, but they came back saying, "They refuse to reason. They will not let Shamba go."</p>
<p>Balarama, Krishna's brother, became furious that his nephew was imprisoned. Balarama went to Asanapada, the Kaurava palace, and thrust his ploughshare under its ramparts. Then he said to Duryodhana, the chief Kaurava, "If you do not surrender Shamba now, I will destroy this palace!"</p>
<p>Duryodhana knew Balarama's strength and immediately surrendered Shamba. "We know you are all strength. Again, you are all forgiveness. We have committed an unpardonable crime. Now we realise it and we are releasing Krishna's son. Forgive us, Balarama."</p>
<p>Balarama said, "Do not act like a fool. Your power is nothing but the exhilaration of your stupidity. Whom are you challenging? Krishna? He is the Lord Himself! Whom are you challenging? Me? I am the one who holds measureless strength. O mortals, never dare to create anger either in my brother Krishna or in me, for immediate death will come and shake hands with you. Be careful!"</p>
