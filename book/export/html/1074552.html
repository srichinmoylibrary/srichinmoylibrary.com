<p>If a man wants to have a divinised life, a life of inner and outer peace, then he has to have aspiration, constant aspiration. From constant aspiration he gets realisation. And when he gets realisation, he gets the promise of supreme divinisation and peace. As the inner mounting flame of aspiration gets the opportunity to reach up to the highest, the inner peace starts functioning most convincingly and powerfully. At that time the seeker can never be separated from peace. His entire existence, inner and outer, is flooded with peace. But in order to achieve this peace, one needs constant aspiration.</p>
<p>There are some seekers who are more advanced, while some are relatively unadvanced. There are some seekers who think of God twenty-four hours a day, while others have only a vague idea of God. But if we want to achieve infinite, eternal peace, then we have to make God a living reality in our day-to-day lives. We have to feel that God is of paramount importance. If we do not eat every day, we starve our body. Similarly, we have to feel that if we do not pray and meditate every day, then we are starving our spiritual body; we will become sick. If we do not pray and meditate in the inner life, we find it very difficult to discipline the outer life. Then naturally we will not be able to feel inner peace. It is only through aspiration that we can achieve abiding inner peace.</p>  </div>
