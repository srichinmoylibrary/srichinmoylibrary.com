<p>It took me almost a minute to get to the starting line of the half-marathon. Often when you start a race, you lose at least one or two minutes at the beginning. Then it is hard to run; there are so many people ahead of you blocking your way. There are always some poor runners who have to run right in front of you. Once I saw X, but I could not go in front of her because there were so many people blocking me. At one point there were three runners running together, and I couldn't pass them.</p>
