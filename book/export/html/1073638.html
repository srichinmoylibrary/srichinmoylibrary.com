<blockquote>
<p>"If there is a God, we must see Him; if there is a soul, we must feel it. Otherwise, it is better to be an atheist than to be a hypocrite."</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God has to be seen face to face. God has to be spoken with person to person. We must believe first. Then we must feel and live the reality that we believe in. If we do not believe in the reality within and consciously try to manifest it in our outer life, then we are not only fooling ourselves and others, but also lowering humanity's God-inheritance-prestige.</p>  </div>
