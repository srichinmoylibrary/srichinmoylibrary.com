<blockquote>
<p>Blue eyes say: “Love me or I die.” Black eyes say: “Love me or I kill thee.”</p>
<p>— Spanish proverb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Red-angered eyes say: “Whether thou lovest me or not, I have come to kill thee.” But soul-illumined eyes say: “I see God in thee and love thee whether thou killest me or not.”</p>
<p>No doubt, life precedes love. But if love does not follow life faithfully, life is no better than death.</p>
<p>Love in the process of its manifestation is conscious truth enjoying itself.</p>
<p>If you ever dare to fight against hatred, then there is but one weapon: Love.</p>
<p>When I love a man, I live within his ever-blossoming heart.</p>
<p>When I hate a man, he lives within my ever-torturing vital.</p>
<p>Love has a power of its own. It can be used to see and feel both the lowest and the highest.</p>
<p>The noblest love of man constitutes his purest vision of God.</p>
<p>Love is always expensive, whether heavenly or earthly.</p>
<p>Like death, man’s love is capable of levelling all ranks.</p>
<p>To have no love for others is in no way a step towards God-Realisation. On the contrary, fellow-feeling helps one considerably to live in the Divine Consciousness.</p>
<p>Vital love lacking in purity is not only a stumbling-block but a dangerous limitation of consciousness that prevents our nature from turning towards the Divine fully and unreservedly.</p>
<p>Marriage is at the mercy of love. At times love allows itself to be caught by marriage; at times it does not.</p>
<p>Ascending love makes friends with the Everlasting. Descending love makes friends with the fleeting breath of death.</p>

<p>It's better to have loved and lost,<br /> Than never to have loved at all.</p>
<p>— Tennyson</p>

<p>But can true love ever be lost? True love enlarges the giver and brings him closer to God, even if he loses the object of his love.</p>  </div>
