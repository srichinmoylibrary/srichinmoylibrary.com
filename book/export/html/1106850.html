<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. If we do something really good and really divine, then God expedites our spiritual journey. He increases our speed and shortens the time it will take us to reach our goal. If our speed is accelerated, then naturally we shall reach our destination sooner than otherwise. So we should try to do divine things in order to reach our destination sooner than at once.</p>  </div>
