<p>Doubt says to God<br /> "God, why do You love<br /> Your daughter, Faith, so much?"</p>
<p>"I love My daughter<br /> Because she does not argue with Me,<br /> Because she does not question Me,<br /> Because she always believes in Me,<br /> Because she does not ask Me to make her understand<br /> What I say to her.<br /> She accepts My Will devotedly,<br /> She executes My Will unconditionally.<br /> I tell you, Doubt,<br /> Here on earth, in My vast creation<br /> My daughter has no equal."</p>
