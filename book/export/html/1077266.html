<p>"He looked... as if he might be having a fit."</p>
<p><em> — Cordner Nelson</em></p>
<p>"He ran as if tortured by internal demons."</p>
<p><em> — Kenny Moore</em></p>
<p>"He ran every step of a race as if there was a scorpion in each shoe."</p>
<p><em> — William Johnson</em></p>
<p>"He runs like a man wasting no time getting out of a graveyard at the witches' hour with blood on the moon."</p>
<p><em> — Allison Danzig</em></p>
<p>"Witnesses . . . still wake up screaming in the dark when Emil the Terrible goes writhing through their dreams, clawing at his abdomen in horrible extremities of pain."</p>
<p><em> — Red Smith</em></p>
<p>Zatopek had many critics, but he ultimately silenced the proud criticism of them all.</p>
<p>He runs like a man who has just been stabbed in the heart.</p>
<p>— European coach</p>  </div>
