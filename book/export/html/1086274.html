<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For the time being just remain in a meditative mood and read spiritual writings or sing devotional songs. If you have been meditating for one hour, then after two or three months you can increase the length of time, but do not increase it suddenly. Even if you are inspired, please increase your meditation time by degrees. Otherwise, if today you meditate well and you meditate for another hour, then in a subtle way pride enters. Pride is your worst enemy. You will be bloated with pride the whole day, and then the following day this pride will not allow you to meditate at all. You will think that you have got everything from your meditation, so for two weeks you won't get up. Meditation is just like eating. No matter how much you eat today, tomorrow again you have to eat to get energy. So do not overeat. Please go slowly. If you have to, increase your time only by two or three minutes. Then after a month or so you can increase it ten or fifteen minutes.</p>  </div>
