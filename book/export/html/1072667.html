    <title>Question: I had an experience in my childhood. In my home everybody played the piano, and as far back as I can remember, everybody has played the piano. One day when I was three years old I asked the maid to take me to the piano, and I started playing with both hands a tune that my mother had been playing the night before. What is the explanation of this?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It may have been a spirit playing through you and it may have been something else. Most probably, in your last life you acquired mastery in playing the piano and all of a sudden your intuition brought forward that experience, that mastery. Very often a childâ€™s intuition is at the fore. A child seldom does anything consciously. He does everything intuitively. A child speaks to God all the time even though he does not open his mouth. A constant communion is going on between the child and God.</p>  </div>
