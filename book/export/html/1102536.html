<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If someone very strong or powerful does something undivine, he will not be afraid of our criticism. Even if he does things that we do not approve of, he does not lie about them. His life is an open book because he does not care what we think. He is not afraid of us, so he has nothing to lose by being sincere. But an ordinary person, if he does something wrong, will deny it. He will try to hide.</p>
<p>The earthbound mind is weak and uncertain; it is always doubting itself and those around it. Because it is weak, it is not sincere and will never be sincere. But when the mind becomes calm, quiet and vacant, it loses its uncertainty and confusion. When the mind takes shelter inside the heart, which identifies with the infinite Reality and infinite Power, then it is afraid of nothing. It feels it does not have to justify itself to anyone and automatically it becomes sincere. So the easiest and most effective way to increase the mind's sincerity is to compel the mind to remain inside the heart.</p>
