<p>"Chinmoy, on my birthday Pradyut came and took a few pictures. You can go and get them from him."</p>
<p>I went to Pradyut-da's house and told him that Nolini-da wanted to have his photographs. Pradyut-da said: "The Mother liked them so much that She kept them for Herself. Please tell Nolini-da that today I am leaving for Calcutta. On my return shall make another set for him."</p>
<p>When Nolini-da heard that his pictures were with the Mother he said: "I am glad that Pradyut knows who comes first and who is the only real in us."</p>  </div>
