<p>Four reporters came to interview me in Lima. One of them was 100 per cent my disciple. She had a soul's connection with three or four disciples, and she was looking at me as if she had known me for a long time. Then she took the chair right near me.</p>
<p>She asked me a question in Spanish and I answered her in English. She was so surprised that I had understood her Spanish.</p>
<p>Then Agraha asked her something. Afterwards, he said he couldn't believe how kind she was.</p>
<p>All the reporters were so nice. Usually you talk for ten minutes and the reporters write down two words. But these reporters were writing continuously.</p>
