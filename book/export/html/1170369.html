<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I started when I was quite young. At the age of twelve I started meditating consciously. Before that, when I was six, I was meditating, but it was not so conscious. It was at the age of twelve that I consciously accepted the life of aspiration. I became very conscious of it from that age and from the age of seventeen my aspiration was extremely intense, dedicated and surrendered.</p>  </div>
