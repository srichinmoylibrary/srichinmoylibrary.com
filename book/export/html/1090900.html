<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it is not bad at all. But if you can continue meditating, that is infinitely better. If you are sleeping at 8:00 or 9:00 because you meditated at four, then your own vital forces or the aggression of the earth, which is agitated at this hour, will disturb your consciousness. This agitation from the earth's consciousness or from your own lower vital can enter into the results of the meditation which you had a few hours earlier at three or four o'clock. So if you do go to sleep after you meditate, the best thing is to get up at five or six o'clock.</p>  </div>
