<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God laughs the loudest when He sees that His instrument, His spiritual instrument, Jim, drives his wagon or his car without insurance, without registration and sometimes without even a license. So God says, "Here I have a creation. But look at the audacity of this creation! He does not believe in other creations of mine, which are insurance, registration, license and so forth. Look at his audacity; he does not believe in my other creations." Then God starts laughing. At that time His laughter becomes the loudest.</p>  </div>
