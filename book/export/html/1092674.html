<h2>A dreamer</h2>

<p>They call me a dreamer. I confess I am a dreamer. I have always been a dreamer-even when I was a child. The progress of the world has depended on dreamers and their dreams-not dreams of exploitation and aggrandisement and perpetuating injustice, but dreams of progress, happiness for the widest masses, liberty and independence for all nations.</p>
<p>I have been a dreamer of dreams. But the dream of all my dreams, the dearest dream of my life, has been the dream of freedom for India.</p>
<p>They think it is a discredit to be a dreamer. I take pride in being one. They do not like my dreams. But that is nothing new.</p>
<p>If I did not dream dreams of India's freedom, I would have accepted the chains of slavery as something eternal.</p>
<p>The real crux of the question is, can my dreams become realities? I submit they have increasingly become realities. The army is one such dream come true.</p>
<p>No, I do not mind being a dreamer.</p>
<p>Subhas Chandra Bose</p>
