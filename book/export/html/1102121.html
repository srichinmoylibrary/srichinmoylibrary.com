<p>"My Lord, this time I shall ask You a question although I definitely and unmistakably know the answer."</p>
<p>"That's fine, My child, but I am anxious to know your question and your answer."</p>
<p>"My question is, do You ever fall sick like me? My immediate answer is, You never fall sick."</p>
<p>"My supremely foolish child, you are totally mistaken. I do fall sick from time to time."</p>
<p>"You fall sick! Don't tell me a dark lie. For God's sake, tell me, why do You fall sick?"</p>
<p>"My child, I fall sick when you threaten Me that you will no longer work for Me on earth. I fall sick when you untimely want to drop out of My cosmic game. I fall sick when you don't tell the world that you and I both badly need each other. I fall sick the moment your foul and impossible mouth tells Me that you don't deserve Me."</p>
