<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am very happy with the way my spiritual students have created such a good atmosphere for these people and are inspiring them in the running world. As I said, the world is all one family. We are inviting our brothers and sisters to come to our races, and it gives us joy when they participate. Our 1,300-mile race is like a Thanksgiving Day celebration. Once a year the family comes together for Thanksgiving, and it gives us all such joy to see one another again.</p>  </div>
