<p>My Beloved Supreme, here on earth, whoever scores the most is the winner. There in Heaven, who is the winner? Do tell me.</p>
<p>"My child, in Heaven the winner is he who becomes cheerfully and inseparably one with the surrender-life and surrender-breath of the tennis ball. A human seeker can learn the message of surrender in its purest form from a tiny little tennis ball — not from the player, not even from the racquet, but from a mere ball. When you think of yourself as a mere ball, you will be able to give the greatest satisfaction to Me, to your Beloved Supreme, your Eternity's Champion Tennis Player."</p>
