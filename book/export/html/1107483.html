<p>"You are a characterless fellow, am I correct?"</p>
<p>"Master, you are absolutely correct. Now Master, just because I am characterless, I have come to you to learn how to turn over a new leaf."</p>
<p>"You are a characterless fellow, am I correct?"</p>
<p>"Master, you are absolutely correct. But Master, forgive me. Right now I am not consciously aware of my wrong actions. But even if I have not done anything blameworthy, on the strength of my oneness with the members of my spiritual family, I am sure that I have done many deplorable things. Therefore, Master, in all sincerity and humility I wish to say that you are perfectly right in your assessment of my life: that I am a characterless fellow."</p>
<p>"You are a characterless fellow, am I correct?"</p>
<p>"Master, you are absolutely correct. Master, I beg to be excused. Since it is beyond my capacity to recollect what I have done wrong — or let me say, <em>if</em> I have ever done anything wrong — I want to prove to the world that my Master is always right. How? Just by doing something undivine to day, I shall prove that my Master's statement is ever faultless."</p>
<p>"You are a characterless fellow, am I correct?"</p>
<p>"No, Master, you are absolutely wrong. Never was I characterless; nor am I now, nor shall I ever be in the near or distant future. I hate you because you have exposed me falsely to the wide world. From now on I shall have to hide my face and my life. But my mouth will vehemently stand against your realisation, revelation and manifestation on earth. Your embodied spirituality is my life's only curse. Dear sir, you are absolutely wrong."</p>  </div>
