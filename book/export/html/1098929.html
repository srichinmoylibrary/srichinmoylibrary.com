<p>While I was in Minneapolis, I stayed with Ida Patterson. She prepared a room downstairs for me to sleep in. She stayed upstairs. O God! She did not tell me that just ten or twelve days before, her husband had committed suicide in that room. Why did she not cancel my invitation?</p>
<p>As soon as I tried to go to sleep, the dissatisfied spirit of her husband came and then so many hostile forces came to attack me. They were attacking me because when somebody commits suicide, it is the greatest victory of the hostile forces. I said, “What is going on? Here the room is clean. What has happened?” Then I had to challenge those hostile forces.</p>
<p>In the morning, I said to my hostess, “What happened to your husband, Ida?” The spirit had told me that it was her husband. Then I told Ida what had taken place during the night and she started crying. Finally she confessed that her husband had committed suicide in that room. Perhaps she had been too embarrassed to tell me before. She did not imagine that I would be attacked by those hostile forces. Perhaps if it had been somebody else, nothing would have happened. But sometimes these undivine spirits come and attack spiritual people with the hope that they will get blessings from them. Their very nature is to attack, like mischievous monkeys.</p>  </div>
