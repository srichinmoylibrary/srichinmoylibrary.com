<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, but there are also symbolic names for these deities. What are their symbolic names, please? Do you know? Each one has a secret name. Each god has a symbolic, secret name. They don't use the name Lakshmi, for example. When a spiritual figure, an aspirant, prays to Lakshmi, he will not say, "Lakshmi, Lakshmi."</p>
<p>There is a secret way of praying to Lakshmi, uttering her secret name. It is possible to use the ordinary name but here is a great secret term, which is the word, <em>Shring.</em> For Kali, you have to say <em>Kring</em> For Krishna there is one; we call it <em>Kling.</em></p>
<p>What do they do when they want to have some spiritual power, psychic power? They don't say "Lakshmi, Lakshmi." What they do is very rapidly they repeat this name: "Shring, Shring, Shring, Shring." And if it is Kali, who is the bestower of power, it is "Kring, Kring, Kring, Kring, Kring, Kring, Kring." And within ten minutes you will feel a kind of power all over you. If it is done in the proper manner, you will get the results. These are the secret names, we call them the seed terms for each god.</p>  </div>
