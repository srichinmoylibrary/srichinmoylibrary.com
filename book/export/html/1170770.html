<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Take all the members of the audience as one person, and feel that this person is yourself. If you see many people watching you, naturally you become nervous. You feel that they are judging you or criticising you. But if you take all of them as yourself, then you will not be nervous. When you are singing by yourself, even if you sing incorrectly, you do not become nervous because there is nobody to hear it. You are the singer, and you are also the audience. So when you are singing in public, take the whole audience as one individual, and then see that individual as none other than yourself. At that time, nervousness goes away.</p>  </div>
