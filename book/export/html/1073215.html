<p>The mind is a creativity. So also is a thought.<br /> The mind says to a thought, "I have you."<br /> The thought says to the mind, "You I am."</p>
<p>The heart is a creativity. So also is love.<br /> The heart says to love, "I have you."<br /> Love says to the heart, "You I am."</p>
<p>The soul is a creativity. So also is life.<br /> The soul says to life, "I have you."<br /> Life says to the soul, "You I am."</p>
<p>The learning of the mind is a creativity, an expanding creativity.<br /> The feeling of the heart is a creativity, a deepening creativity.<br /> The becoming of life is a creativity, a manifesting creativity.</p>
<p>Art is Eternity's cry.<br /> Art is Infinity's smile.<br /> Art is Immortality's delight.</p>
<p>Music is not the mind's creativity-noise.<br /> Music is the heart's creativity-voice.</p>
<p>Poetry is not an earthly chimera's mist-creativity.<br /> Poetry is a Heavenly beauty-dawn-creativity.</p>
<p>Art and God sleeplessly talk together.<br /> Music and God breathlessly feel each other.<br /> Poetry and God unceasingly look at each other.</p>
<p>My life is God's creation.<br /> My blossoming smiles are my soul-creations.<br /> My streaming tears are my heart-creations.</p>
<p>The inner creation is the source.<br /> The outer creation is the course.</p>
<p>The inner creation is indispensable.<br /> The outer creation is irresistible.</p>
<p>My aspiration-heart's inner creation is God-exploration-delight.<br /> My dedication-life's outer creation is God-manifestation-light.</p>

<p>Creativity is in learning. Creativity is in unlearning as well. Creativity is in action-manifestation. Creativity is in inaction — rest as well — only we have to know the proper order for the fulfilment of our life.</p>
<p>My life cries ditto to the wise Chinese saying, "Be the first in the field, the last to the couch."</p>
<p>My creativity-boat plies between my desire-earth-tears and my aspiration-Heaven-smiles. On a lighter note, only an English conductor perhaps can dare to declare: "The English may not like music, but they absolutely love the noise it makes!"</p>
<p>Being an Indian, I feel I have the legitimate audacity to declare: the Indian music of yore touches, illumines and fulfils my very earth-existence. The modern — with an ultra-modern touch — Indian music chases me into the land of nowhere!</p>
<p>From the spiritual point of view, creativity is the beauty of God-revelation and the fragrance of God-manifestation.</p>
<p>Creativity is multiplicity's bloom in unity's blossom.</p>
<p>In the outer world, creativity is the light of individuality.</p>
<p>In the inner world, creativity is the delight of universality.</p>
<p>No matter how sublime the creativity is, the creator of it is notindispensable. If he comes to realise that, only then will he have peace of mind and abiding satisfaction.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish to invoke the most celebrated of the ancient Greek mathematicians-Archimedes. "Eureka! I have found it," was his discovery-cry.</p>
<p>O aspiring world, Him I have found, my Lord Supreme, in the aspiration-beauty and dedication-fragrance of my art, music and poetry.</p>  </div>
