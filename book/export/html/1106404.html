<p>Today for the first time I lifted 155 pounds with both arms simultaneously. You can see there is some spring in my legs. To imagine 155 pounds with both arms at the same time — the very idea is puzzling. That is Pulak’s weight. So now you can see double Pulak!</p>
<p>How much determination is in my face! If I can lift 170 pounds with both arms, even one inch, I will be satisfied. Eleven years ago, when I lifted 160 pounds with both arms, it went up very, very little. You have to use your third eye to see it.</p>
