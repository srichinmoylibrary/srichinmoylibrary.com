<p>In the spiritual life,<br /> To doubt is to meet with<br /> A great disaster,<br /> To lose faith in one's Inner Pilot<br /> Is to meet with<br /> A greater disaster<br /> And to go back once more<br /> To the ordinary life of pleasure<br /> Is to meet with<br /> The greatest possible disaster.</p>
