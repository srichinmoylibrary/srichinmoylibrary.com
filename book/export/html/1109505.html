<p>Life is eternal. It existed before birth and it will exist after death. Life also exists between birth and death. It is beyond birth and death. Life is infinite. Life is immortal. A seeker of the infinite Truth cannot subscribe to Schopenhauer's statement: "To desire Immortality is to desire the eternal perpetuation of a great mistake."</p>
<p>There is no shadow of doubt that it is the ceaseless seeker in man who is Immortality's life, for his very existence indicates the Supreme's Vision that illumines the universe and the Supreme's Reality that fulfils the creation.</p>  </div>
