<p><em>(The White House. Harry Truman is working in his office.)</em></p>
<p><em>Harry Truman:</em> Japan, I warned you. You paid no heed to my warning. You are planning to bother us more and more. We simply can't tolerate you any more. Your cruelties and atrocities will remain unparalleled in world-history. But tomorrow — not even one day more shall pass — I shall end this war. Your Hiroshima and Nagasaki will be totally destroyed by our world-shattering and world-destroying atom bomb, and you will then be compelled to surrender. We want peace. Once victory is won, we shall again work for peace. Be with us and work for world peace if you want to save your face from the infamy of a world war caused and declared by you.</p>  </div>
