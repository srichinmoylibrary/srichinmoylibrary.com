<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to go deep within. Right now you are a beginner. Every day you have to go deep within in order to know. Today you dig one inch, then tomorrow it will be two inches, the day after tomorrow, three inches. The deeper you go, the clearer your vision will be. If your aspiration is intense, easily you will be able to know what the Supreme wants you to do in your outer life.</p>  </div>
