<p>Earth, what is happening?<br /> Why are you so sad?<br /> You mean you do not know<br /> That God needs you?<br /> I tell you, He definitely needs you.<br /> For God's sake, do not treasure<br /> False thought-world.</p>
<p>Heaven, what is happening?<br /> Why are you dancing?<br /> You mean God always needs you?<br /> Don't be a fool.<br /> God can perfectly live without you.<br /> I warn you,<br /> He certainly can.</p>
