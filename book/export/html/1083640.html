<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's phone number is 123-4567. "One" represents Creator. "Two" represents Creator and creation. "Three" represents God in His three aspects: Creator, Preserver and Transformer. "Four" represents God in His four directions: East, West, North, South. "Five" represents the five human senses: sight, sound, smell, taste and touch. "Six" represents six centres, the six chakras inside us: Muladhara, Svadhisthana, Manipura, Anahata, Vishuddha and Ajna. Sahasrara is not counted because it is not inside the body proper, but inside the brain. "Seven" represents the seven higher worlds and seven lower worlds. If the seeker is not aspiring, he sees God in the seven lower worlds. If the seeker is aspiring, he sees God in the seven higher worlds so that he can cherish Him, treasure Him and claim Him as his very own.</p>  </div>
