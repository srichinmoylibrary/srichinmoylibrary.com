<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If there is intensity, then it is not meditation; it is concentration. If there is tremendous intensity, then there is concentrated power. If you feel an intense force energising you like an express train, then it is the result of your concentration. But if you feel deep within an immense sea of peace, light and bliss, then that is your meditation. Meditation-power is all peace, poise and tranquility, like a sea, while concentration-power is like a bullet. Do not give any preference to either experience. Feel that if the Grace of the Supreme wants to concentrate in you and through you, then you will allow it. Again, if He wants meditation, you will allow Him to meditate in and through you.</p>  </div>
