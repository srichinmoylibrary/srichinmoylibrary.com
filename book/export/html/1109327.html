<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It takes place through individual progress. The world is composed of you, me and others. Now, if you become perfect and I become perfect and he becomes perfect, then world-perfection automatically dawns. World-perfection depends on each individual. When we become perfect, the world becomes perfect, for it is we-the human beings living in the world-who are responsible for what the world is. The world is only a vast plot of land where countless beings are staying. It is the inhabitants who can make it perfect.</p>  </div>
