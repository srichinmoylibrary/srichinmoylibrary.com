<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The American Declaration of Independence had the pioneer vision of faith, dignity and humanityâ€™s basic needs: equal rights, justice and freedom. Basically, the same things are found in the Charter of the United Nations. Therefore we can safely say that the Declaration of Independence and the U. N. Charter are two close friends walking along the same road. One came and joined the other later on the road, and now both are walking together to reach the self-same goal, the goal of world peace and satisfaction.</p>  </div>
