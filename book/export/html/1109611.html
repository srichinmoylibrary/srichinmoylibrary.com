<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind’s philosophy is: we are here, but God is somewhere else.</p>
<p>The heart’s philosophy is: God is there, high in the skies. Again, God is also here, inside the heart of His creation.</p>
<p>God’s Philosophy is to support everything and everyone that is in His creation. God’s Philosophy is to support all the philosophies that man can ever imagine.</p>  </div>
