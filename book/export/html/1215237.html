<p>A self-giving will<br /> Fulfils<br /> The inner world.</p>

<p>"Politicians come and go, but in your case, you are the politician of the heart, not the politician of the mouth. History will bear witness to the fact that not only do you speak from the heart, but you give your heart as well. While you are talking, the words are coming from the very depths of your heart. Then you give your heart itself for the betterment of this planet."</p>
