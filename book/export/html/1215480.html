<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I was four or five years old, my sister started teaching me songs. Then, when I was in my adolescence, God blessed me with a good singing voice. I learned hundreds of songs and composed a few as well. Here in America I started composing songs regularly, and I have written a few thousand. They are all spiritual songs, soulful songs â€” songs that can and will help us immensely in our spiritual life.</p>  </div>
