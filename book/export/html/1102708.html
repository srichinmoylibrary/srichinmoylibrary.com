<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is everywhere. But if we do not see Him or feel Him inside our heart, then we will not be able to see Him anywhere. First we have to see Him within us and talk to Him inside our heart. If we can do this, then only will we be able to see God elsewhere. If inside our heart God is missing, then we shall not be able to speak to God or mix with God anywhere.</p>
<p>What is God? God is both formless and with form. He is pure energy without beginning or end; at the same time, He is the most luminous form. It depends on how the seeker wants to see God. One person may want to see God in a human form, but as absolutely divine, supreme, perfect. He feels that if God appears to him with form, then it will be easier for him to recognise God or realise God. So he likes to see the personal God. But again, if someone says that he wants to go beyond the personal God, beyond form, beyond duality, and remain always in the infinite peace, light and bliss, that also can be done. And the same seeker who cries in the morning to see God with form can, in the evening, cry for God as formless, boundless energy.</p>
