<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our Indian theory is that each human being has a special god of his own, apart from the highest God. As there are many human beings, so there are also many gods and goddesses. Here in the West, it is said that there are as many angels as human beings. But you cannot say the same about fairies. An angel is like a direct part of our aspiration. You can also say that they are an express portion of divinity. Angels have more light than fairies. When something serious occurs, when it is a matter of life and death, if you think of a fairy, nothing will happen. But if you think of an angel, because of their infinite affection or compassion, they will come and be of real help to you.</p>  </div>
