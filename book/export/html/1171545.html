<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can always do the right thing if you meditate and meditate. While you are meditating, feel that both your eyes are inside your heart, they are swimming in your heart-river. Feel that each eye is a swimmer — one is a human swimmer, and the other is a divine swimmer. These two swimmers are swimming inside your heart-river with tremendous inner joy, and this river is flowing into the sea. If you can see and feel this, then you will have inner happiness. If you have true inner happiness — not pleasure but inner happiness — you will never make a mistake.</p>  </div>
