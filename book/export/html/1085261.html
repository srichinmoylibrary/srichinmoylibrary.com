<p>The eminent scientist and professor Satyen Bose was dearly loved by his students at Calcutta University and indeed by everyone, young and old. In Satyen Bose everyone found not only the wisdom of the mind, but also the love and affection of the heart. Bose was not only fond of children; he was also fond of animals, especially cats. In the evening of his life he used to spend a large amount of time playing with his cats. This unusual hobby only endeared him more to his students and friends. They were so delighted that such a great and eminent scientist was so fond of cats!</p>
<p>Once his students at the University wanted to postpone a certain examination. They felt that since Bose was so affectionate and kind to them, they could easily get the professor to delay it. But Bose told them, “No. Give me some valid reasons at least.”</p>
<p>The students admitted, “We have no valid reasons; only we were not able to prepare for this examination.”</p>
<p>“That is not a valid reason,” said Bose. “You had enough time. Was there any special problem?”</p>
<p>“There was no real problem,” said the students, “except that we fooled around and then we found that time had become very short.”</p>
<p>Bose remained firm in his decision. “I am sorry. I will not postpone the examination. How can such a great university operate in this way? It is impossible.”</p>
<p>Some of the students became angry and said: “You have to give us an extension of time; otherwise, we shall go on a hunger strike.”</p>
<p>Bose finally said, “All right, here is the only solution that will please me. I cannot postpone the examination. I will simply resign.”</p>
<p>On hearing this the students became very alarmed. “We are so fond of you,” they cried. “We shall never allow you to resign, Baba. We shall study in the time that is left and if we do not secure high marks, we will know that this is what we deserve. But we can’t bear for you to leave us. We need your affection, we need your blessings.”</p>
<p>In this way Bose taught his students the power of conviction and determination, and the necessity for more sincere and serious attention to their studies.</p>
