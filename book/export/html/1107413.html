<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the strict spiritual point of view, developing occult powers is not necessary. God is the only Reality we need. It is up to Him to give us any power, be it physical, mental or psychic power. If it is His Will, He will grant us power when we are destined to do something for Him in His own Way. Let us pray to God to give us Light. Otherwise, any powers we get on the occult plane may create problems for us. If we pray and meditate only for Light, then when Light descends it will illumine our consciousness. At that time if God wants us to develop some spiritual power to be of greater help to mankind, naturally He will grant it to us. The secret of the highest Truth is this: Do not long for anything except God the Supreme Light. We must feel in the inmost recesses of our hearts that it is the Light Supreme that we need to change our natures, to please God, to fulfil God, to serve God in mankind and to serve suffering mankind.</p>  </div>
