<p>This morning I went out running in shorts. It was so bad outside — raining cats and dogs! On the sidewalk there were so many puddles! But when I descended to the street I came across even more puddles. Then I would go back up onto the sidewalk again. Everywhere there were puddles. The rain was falling like arrows, but I still ran two miles.</p>
