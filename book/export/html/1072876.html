<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Christ went to India and got lessons from Indian Masters, but he did not accept a Guru. His Guru was John the Baptist. He was baptised and got initiation from him. At the time his father died, he was in Kashmir. He came back to Palestine. Even now, in India, there are some of the talismans that he used.</p>  </div>
