<h2>Question: In what manner does a large physical object, such as a mountain, show its patriotism towards the country that it is in?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here we have to know the spiritual significance of a mountain. A mountain signifies aspiration. It is climbing up high, higher, highest. If something in a country aspires, the country receives the benefit. And the benefit, in this case, is nothing but patriotic feeling, for the country and patriotic feelings are inseparable. In this case the country represents the individual, and inside the individual is his capacity, which is patriotism.</p>  </div>
