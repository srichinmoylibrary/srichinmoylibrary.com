SCA 659-666. These questions from a journalist friend of Narada Michael Walden were answered by Sri Chinmoy on 19 April 1991 at Aspiration-Ground in Jamaica, New York.</p>
<h2>Question: How would you describe today’s world?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the spiritual point of view, the world is becoming more conscious of what it inwardly is and what it outwardly is going to become. The inner world is bringing to the fore the message of harmony, peace, love and oneness. Outwardly everything may look just the opposite. But we have to know that the darkest night comes just before the day breaks. Here it is exactly the same.</p>
<p>Being a seeker of the ultimate Truth and a lover of God, I unmistakably see in the inner world that each human being will develop a conscious hunger for love — the love that frees, not the love that binds. The love that binds is an old story; God wants us to forget that story once and for all. But the love that illumines, the love that unites the length and breadth of the world — that is the love that God is bringing to the fore in the inner world. The day is fast approaching when that love will be revealed and manifested in the outer world.</p>  </div>
