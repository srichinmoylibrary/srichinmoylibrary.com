<p>Shivaram and I were serious type friends at the Consulate. Once we walked and walked after office hours talking about Sri Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and so many things. Whoever thought that someday Shivaram would become my disciple? Look at his divinity!</p>
<p>Shivaram has a younger brother, Ramachandran, who also worked at the Consulate. His brother was of a totally different type; he was always joking.</p>
<p>In 1987 I saw Ramachandran again at the Los Angeles airport. How much respect he showed me! I could not believe he was the same person. All credit goes to Shivaram; he has changed his brotherâ€™s attitude completely.</p>
<p>In 1990, Shivaram brought his mother and his brother to our tennis court and I lifted them. Another colleague from the Consulate, C. R. Seshu, also came at that time.</p>  </div>
