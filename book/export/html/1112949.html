<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now I wish to be of dedicated service to you all in a practical way by answering a few spiritual questions.</p>
<p><em>Professor David Eckel:</em> Sri Chinmoy has asked for spiritual questions. If there are any issues that you would like to raise with him that come out of your study of Hindu myth and ritual, or out of your study of Hindu philosophy, this would be a good time to ask them.</p>  </div>
