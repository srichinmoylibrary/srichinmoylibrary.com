<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Christ Consciousness and Cosmic Consciousness go together. Let us take Cosmic Consciousness as this room. This room needs someone to live in it. The Christ Consciousness will be the occupant. The Christ Consciousness lives in the Cosmic Consciousness. Then again, in the divine Lila, the divine Game, the Christ Consciousness may become the hall and the Cosmic Consciousness may become the occupant of the hall. They exchange roles.</p>
<p>One who has realised the Highest, like the Christ, has become part and parcel of the Highest. On the strength of his highest consciousness, on the strength of his inseparable oneness with his eternal Father, he said, “I and my Father are one,” and “I am the way, I am the goal.” How is it that he could say this? We all know that God is our Father, but this is just a mental idea. We heard it from our parents or we read it in books. But in the Christ’s case it is a reality, a living reality. He and his Father are one. So the Christ Consciousness and the Cosmic Consciousness are one. At times the Christ Consciousness is inside the Cosmic Consciousness, the universal Consciousness. And again, sometimes the Cosmic Consciousness is embodied in the Christ Consciousness. This is the game.</p>  </div>
