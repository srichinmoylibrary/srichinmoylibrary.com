<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you go deep within you hear a sound similar to a gong. But unlike a gong, nothing has to be struck to produce this sound. When you hear it you can feel that it vibrates right from the soles of your feet to the crown of your head. Like a river that sound is flowing from its source deep in your heart.</p>  </div>
