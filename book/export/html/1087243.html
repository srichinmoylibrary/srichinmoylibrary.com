<p>As soon as I see something I like, I try to think who can use it. One key ring I saw was so beautiful; it had two deer. Mahasamrat's wife is very fond of deer. As soon as I saw the key ring, I immediately thought that she was the right person.</p>
<p>I don't think of the person first. Only after I see something that I like do I ask myself who I can buy it for.</p>
