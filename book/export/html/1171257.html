<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. On the 27th of November, in three hours' time I lifted over 92,000 pounds. Again, I must say, it is not my physical strength. It is all God's Grace. My biceps are not even 13 inches. I am not muscle-bound and I am of very short stature. For all that I do, I depend on God's Grace. I can do nothing on my own. I entirely depend on God's Grace for my poetry, music, art and sports. Everything that I do comes from my prayer-life and meditation-life.</p>  </div>
