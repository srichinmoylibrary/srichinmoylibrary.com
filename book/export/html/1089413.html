<p>Lahiri Mahashoy's wife was named Kashimani. Once she woke up in the middle of the night and was so surprised to see that her husband was not at his usual meditation spot. He was seated in a lotus position high up in the air, quite a few metres above the ground.</p>
<p>Lahiri Mahashoy said to her, "Kashimani, it is high time for you to wake up from your sleep. This time when you wake up, remain in that condition forever. Do not go back to ignorance-sleep. Get up and look for wisdom-light within."</p>
<p>Then Lahiri Mahashoy initiated his wife as his disciple.</p>
<p><em>Spiritual commentary</em></p>
<p>Human life is unconscious sleep. Divine life is conscious awareness. Unconscious sleep makes us feel that there are millions of things which we cannot do on earth. Conscious awareness shows us clearly that there is nothing here on earth or there in Heaven which we cannot do. As a matter of fact, conscious awareness makes us feel unmistakably that everything has already been done. What we are doing now is only observing and appreciating it.</p>  </div>
