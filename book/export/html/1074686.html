<p>Softly she speaks;<br /> Therefore she is kind.<br /> Slowly she speaks;<br /> Therefore she is confident.<br /> Soulfully she speaks;<br /> Therefore she is divine.<br /> Compassionately she speaks;<br /> Therefore she is immortal.<br /> Unconditionally she speaks;<br /> Therefore she alone is indispensable.</p>
