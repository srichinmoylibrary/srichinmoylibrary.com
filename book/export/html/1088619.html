<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the parents' consciousness. No matter where they are, if the parents maintain an Indian consciousness and do not become Westernised, then definitely they will get blessings from Above in an Indian way. But if the parents have completely adopted the ways of their new country, then the soul of that country has to bless and take care of the child. In some cases, both the soul of the new country and the soul of India will bless the child. But the most important blessing comes not from the soul of any country. It comes directly from the Absolute Lord Supreme. If the parents want special blessings for their child, it is the Supreme's Blessings they should pray for.</p>  </div>
