<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. They have nothing to do with it. The mind which you refer to is the average human mind. This mind thinks one thing one moment and another the next. It is always full of ideas and thoughts it is just like a monkey, continuously in motion, pinching and biting. With this mind we cannot meditate or contemplate. We have to go beyond the mind in order to perceive Peace, Light and Bliss.</p>  </div>
