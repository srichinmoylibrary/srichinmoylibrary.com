<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Either one goes to a teacher or one prays to God and cries like a child for God to teach him how to pray and meditate. The first person who began to pray and meditate, thousands of years ago, definitely received this teaching from within. In the outer world we find that there are many people who have not gone to school who are quite learned. Our Rabindranath Tagore, India's greatest poet, and the great dramatist and philosopher George Bernard Shaw did not go to school, but they were both men of knowledge and wisdom. Again, there are many, many people who went to universities in order to learn and become endowed with knowledge. In the same way, to learn meditation, either one has to go to a teacher to learn or one has to learn it by himself.</p>  </div>
