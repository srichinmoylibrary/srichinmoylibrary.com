<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Do not try to have any particular type of meditation. When you start to meditate, do not care what kind of meditation you will have. Not only do you have to give up the idea of having a strong meditation, you have to give up all ideas about your meditation.</p>
<p>The first thing you should do when you meditate is try to make your mind calm and quiet, and then let this calm, quiet mind, this silent mind, this tranquil mind, carry you. If you try by yourself to go toward the goal, it will be impossible. It is the meditation that can carry you. Just dive into the sea of this mind, which is far beyond the physical mind, and let the meditation carry you.</p>
<p>It is not the intensity, it is not the eagerness to possess the truth or be possessed by the truth that counts most. It is a spontaneous, cheerful feeling of self-offering that is required in meditation. This is what the soul expects from the aspirant â€” spontaneous, cheerful self-offering. If the aspirant has this, the soul is bound to bring to the fore infinite Peace, Light and Bliss from above.</p>  </div>
