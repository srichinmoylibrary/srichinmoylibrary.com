    <title>Question: Many times in one&#039;s life, one comes to a crossroads — not just in metaphysical things — when one doesn&#039;t know which way to go and one is looking for some kind of direction. Is there any way one can know what to do? Any sign?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two ways that can be taken when one is in that kind of difficulty, when one can't make a decision about what to do and what not to do. One way is to go to a spiritual person who can easily enter into the soul of the person who has the problem. The other way is to go deep within to get the Inner light. The soul knows what is best for the individual. Now, we do not know, when we are doing something, whether we are doing the right thing or the wrong thing. Why are we uncertain about our own action? It is we who, after all, do something in our life, for our life. We are uncertain just because it is not coming directly from our soul or because, unfortunately, the physical mind is not able to grasp the message of the soul. Now, if you don't want to follow the spiritual path, if you find that impossible, and you just want to know what is best for you, then you have to go to some spiritual Master who will immediately enter into your soul and tell you what is best for you to do.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it is always good to aspire. If you aspire, God will shower His choicest Blessings on you. Eventually, you yourself will come to know what to do and what not to do. You will see not only the Way, but also the Goal.</p>  </div>
