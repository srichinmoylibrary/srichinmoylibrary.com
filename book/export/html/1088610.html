<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything is due to the Grace of the Supreme. Whether the souls that descend are advanced or not advanced, it is His Will that all souls ultimately have to fulfil. It is not that all advanced souls will take birth in India and less advanced souls will take birth in other places â€” no, no, no! If you feel that India has a few advanced souls, then it is one hundred percent due to the Grace of the Supreme. You may say that India was more receptive, but if the Supreme wants to give some individual or some country His special Blessings, special Grace and special Preference, He can do so. He can force that country to receive, even if that country is unwilling to receive. It is like a mother forcing her child to eat, even if he does not want to eat. But if the child is hungry most of the time, then it is easier for the mother to feed the child.</p>  </div>
