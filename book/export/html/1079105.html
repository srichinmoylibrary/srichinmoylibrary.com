<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the soul. One soul may take only one incarnation in a particular country, and one soul may take four or five incarnations in the same country. There is no hard and fast rule. It entirely depends on the Supremeâ€™s Will.</p>
<p>The soul of each country has some inherent wish or urge to reveal and manifest God in a particular way. If it is an Indian soul, it may be through peace; an American soul, through power; an English soul, through nobility. So the soul of each country is different.</p>  </div>
