<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All of them. Once one gets a real spiritual experience, one sees that experience in all three bodies. When it is a matter of realisation, one sees, feels and becomes the Truth in all three bodies. This is not the case for minor experiences. If it is just an ordinary earthly happening, which is not so important, only the physical or the subtle body will get it. But if it is something serious, important and significant, then the experience will be recorded in all three bodies.</p>  </div>
