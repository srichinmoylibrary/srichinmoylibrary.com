<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In oneness you get everything. A child has established oneness with his parents, so he knows that if the parents have material power or any power or capacity, then it is all his; the parents are going to give it to him. If you are one with someone, that means all his qualities are your very own, and vice versa. So if you establish your oneness with God's Compassion on the strength of your gratitude, then inside God's Compassion you will get everything.</p>
<p>But again, if you find it extremely difficult all the time to think of God's Compassion or your own gratitude, then try to bring to the fore individual aspects of God's Capacity. If God's Power is what you want, then concentrate on God's Power. If you want God's Love or God's Peace, then try to bring these to the fore. Anything you need, you can bring forward individually.</p>
<p>But if gratitude is there, then inside gratitude you will find power, love, peace and all the divine qualities because gratitude means oneness. God plays His role by giving; you play your role by expressing your gratitude. By giving, God shows His oneness with you; and by offering your gratitude, you become one with Him.</p>
