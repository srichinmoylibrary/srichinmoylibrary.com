<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My prayerful message to the people of Davao is very simple: together we have to walk, together we have to dream, together we have to feel the necessity of oneness. Each individual in this beautiful place I regard as my own, very own. So to each individual I am offering my love, my affection and my oneness, as I am offering to the General Manager of the International Airport my affection, love and gratitude. He has done us a great favour by allowing us to be associated with this International Airport. For that, to the Manager and Engineer here, I am offering my deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>My message to the people of Davao is the same: my heart of love, my heart of joy and my heart of gratitude I am offering to each individual for the establishment of a world family, which will be flooded with peace, love and joy. This is my message of oneness that I am offering to each person in Davao City.</p>  </div>
