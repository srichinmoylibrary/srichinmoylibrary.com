<p>During the children's bus ride to Niagara Falls, Jessica did an excellent, excellent job as leader and Christopher composed a super-excellent song. I also composed a song for each and every individual on the bus.</p>
<p>Sanatan and Rupantar were driving. Ketan and Sagar were supposed to be their helpers and keep them awake, but they were lying down on the floor of the bus sleeping. Ketan had brought a big teddy bear, but instead of holding the teddy bear, he was holding Christopher.</p>
