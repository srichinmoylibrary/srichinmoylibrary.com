<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mother should pray for the fulfilment of God’s Will inside the retarded child. If the mother grumbles or complains, her negative qualities will enter into the retarded child and make him worse. If he becomes worse, the mother’s life will be infinitely more miserable.</p>  </div>
