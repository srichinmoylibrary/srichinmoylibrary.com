<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I was chanting <em>Aum</em> at that time. <em>Aum</em> is the mother of all Indian incantations or mantras. I was invoking the three principal Indian Gods: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Brahma is the Creator, Vishnu is the Preserver and Shiva is the Transformer. I was invoking these three cosmic gods to illumine our consciousness. As you know, God exists in three aspects: God the Creator, God the Preserver and God the Transformer. <em>Aum</em> has three sounds: a, u and m. When they are united, they become <em>Aum</em>.</p>  </div>
