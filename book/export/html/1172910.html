<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each quality has a way of being received. If you say, “What should I do in order to receive peace most?” then my answer will be one thing. If you ask what you should do to receive light, or power, or any divine quality, then I will tell you something different, because we cannot receive all things in the same way. If you want to have strong arms, then you have to take arm exercises. You have to specify which place you want most to strengthen. Which quality would you like to receive most?</p>  </div>
