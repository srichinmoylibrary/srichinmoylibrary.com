<p>"My Lord, how long should I meditate on You every day?"</p>
<p>"My child, five seconds will be enough."</p>
<p>"Only five seconds? Why? Why?"</p>
<p>"My child, how can I be unjust to you? I don't meditate on you even for one second. Therefore, how can I have the audacity to ask you to meditate on Me for more than five seconds a day?"</p>
<p>"My Lord, You don't meditate on me even for five seconds a day? How can You be so cruel? You are really something!"</p>
<p>"My child, according to you, I am something! I take that as a great blessing to Me'and not as a joke!"</p>  </div>
