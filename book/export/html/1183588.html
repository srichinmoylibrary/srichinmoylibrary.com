<p>A teacher was asking his students many questions on geography.</p>
<p>"Jim, please tell me, what is the capital of Italy?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Jeffries, I have no idea," answered Jim. "Does anyone know?"</p>
<p>No one answered. "All right," said the teacher. "I will give you a hint. It rhymes with 'home'."</p>
<p>"Rome! Rome!" chimed several students at once.</p>
<p>"Excellent! Now, Mary, what is the country where people eat the most?"</p>
<p>"United States?"</p>
<p>"No, Hungary, because they are always hungry!"</p>
<p>All the students laughed.</p>
<p>"Seriously now, can anyone tell me the world's smallest country?"</p>
<p>"Liechtenstein?" guessed one student.</p>
<p>"Sorry, no. But I am amazed you can even pronounce it. Would anyone else like to try?"</p>
<p>"The Vatican!"</p>
<p>"Right! Very good."</p>
<p>Then Mr. Jeffries brought out a big map and at a particular place he put his finger. He asked one of the students, "Steve, kindly tell me the name of the place where I am pointing."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Steve was not paying very much attention. He was looking here, there and everywhere â€” except at the teacher.</p>
<p>Mr. Jeffries asked, "Can you not see where my finger is?"</p>
<p>Steve said, "Yes, I know! It is your index finger."</p>
<p>"I am pointing at something," the teacher continued.</p>
<p>"Yes, of course, you are pointing. But I can see it is your index finger that is pointing."</p>
<p>Exasperated, the teacher went on to the next student.</p>  </div>
