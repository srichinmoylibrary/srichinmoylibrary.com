<p>This morning I left to go running and walking at about 4:30 a.m. As usual, my road crew was following me in a car. Around 5 a.m. a newspaper delivery truck pulled up next to me, and the driver asked, "Tell me, are the people who are following you your friends?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He said, "I was worrying because the car was following you." He thought they were going to kidnap me.</p>
