<p>For my trip back to New York, I had to reconfirm my flights. I do not blame Ashrita, but I blame his fate. His sincerity, his eagerness to do the right thing I appreciate, but the fate that he has is unbearable, and I suffer.</p>
<p>Last time when I went to India from Myanmar, instead of listing my name with a G, it became C: Chose instead of Ghose. This time Ashrita gave me the itinerary. From India I was supposed to come directly via Air India to London. From Madras to Bombay and from Bombay to London, it would be the same plane. The flight number was 101. To reconfirm my flight, I went to a travel agency in the Ashram that is very reliable. The name of it is Auro Travel, and the owner is my very good friend. They are so expert. For twenty-five years they have been in that line.</p>
<p>My friend's assistant said that no reconfirmation was needed since I was in executive class. He said that reconfirmation is usually only needed if you stay longer than a week, but for executive class it is not needed at all. In my case, it was not necessary. But my friend, the boss, disagreed. He said, "It is necessary. This gentleman is my friend. You have to reconfirm it. If anything goes wrong, it will be our fault."</p>
<p>My friend, Gautam, has so many assistants. I was sitting right in front of him, and one of his assistants phoned up Madras, telling my name, this and that. Everything was reconfirmed. My flight number was 101.</p>  </div>
