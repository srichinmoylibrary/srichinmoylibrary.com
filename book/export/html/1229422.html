<div><h3>Translation:</h3>


<p>Just because I was not born<br /> In the government mint,<br /> Everybody calls me a counterfeit coin.<br /> Alas, if by mistake somebody gets me,<br /> He does not keep me in his pocket, in his wallet;<br /> He waits for a golden opportunity<br />      To get rid of me.<br /> Nobody wants me, yet I move from one to another.<br /> Sometimes people get annoyed with me,<br /> They throw me into one corner of the room<br /> And strike me again and again.<br /> If only I was not a false coin.<br />      Ah, there comes a time<br /> When my fate changes for the better.<br /> I take shelter in a pious man,<br /> A religious, spiritual man.<br /> He finds it beneath his dignity<br /> To deceive the world with me, through me.<br /> He never tries to offer me to anybody else.<br /> He just places me in one corner of the room<br /> And takes away all the insults<br /> That were heaped upon me by others.<br /> It is in his hands<br /> That my false journey’s false hope<br />      Comes to a final end.</p>
