<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one is spiritual, that does not mean that one will not suffer. Spiritual people may suffer for various reasons. One main reason is that they take on themselves the suffering of humanity because they have established such oneness with other human beings. I do not want to say that each and every Indian who is suffering is taking the karma of others. No! There can be many other reasons why people suffer. But only God knows for what purpose or for what reason He is having some special experiences in and through those Indian souls.</p>  </div>
