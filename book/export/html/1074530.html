<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As an attendant, you can use your power of humility, your power of love, your power of affection, your power of understanding, your power of concern and compassion. Again, if there is violence and necessity demands, only then will you use your power of self-defense until the police come into the picture.</p>  </div>
