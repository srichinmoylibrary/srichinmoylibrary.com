<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The usual process is that first he has to go to earth and do good things. But hell is only a portion of the vital world, so from there it is possible to go directly to Heaven. If they get direct help from the Supreme or from a spiritual Master, some souls cam go from hell to Heaven. Otherwise, they have to come back to earth and acquire spiritual merits.</p>  </div>
