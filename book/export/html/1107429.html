<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One should try to open the heart chakra, or spiritual centre, first. This is not only for the beginner but for everyone who practises the spiritual life and who wants to open the chakras. The Sanskrit term for this chakra is <em>Anahata</em>, the Soundless Sound. Its seed sound is <em>Yam</em>; this is its secret name. But you need not use the word <em>yam</em>; you can chant "Supreme" or "God". Some people get more joy when they utter the name of God, the Supreme. In your case, "Supreme" would be the best to use if you want to open this chakra. When this chakra opens, it gives you a sense of Joy, Peace and Bliss. The outer emotions, vital emotions or disturbing emotions, will be purified by the opening of this centre. For beginner or for anyone who wants to open the chakras, it is best to open the heart chakra first.</p>
<p>According to Zen Buddhism, the navel chakra should be opened first; but according to the strict Hindu system of the spiritual life, this chakra should not be opened until the heart chakra is opened. If the navel chakra is opened before the heart chakra, then the lowest impure vital will enter into the heart and destroy all its spiritual possibilities. Zen Masters say that by concentrating on and opening the lower centres, purification will be effected. But I feel that it is better first to open the heart. Then if you want to go up, you go; if you want to go down, you go. In this way my teachings differ from the practice of Zen.</p>  </div>
