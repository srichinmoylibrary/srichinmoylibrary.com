<p>Many have come<br /> Into the Supreme's Golden Boat;<br /> Many have left.<br /> Many have appeared<br /> And many have disappeared.<br /> Many are outwardly following the spiritual life,<br /> But inwardly they are elsewhere,<br /> Millions of miles away.<br /> Again, some seekers are inwardly with God,<br /> But outwardly they want to lead another life -<br /> A life of lethargy, indulgence, disobedience,<br /> Unconscious if not conscious self-deception,<br /> Plus self-mockery.</p>
