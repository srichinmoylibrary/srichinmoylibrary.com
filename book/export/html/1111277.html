<p>Twenty metres away from the five-mile mark there was a parked police car with two policemen in it. One of them was asleep. The other one said to me, "Sir, how I wish I didn't have duty at this hour. Why don't you go and rest? Why do you have to run at this hour?"</p>
<p>I said, "I enjoy it."</p>
<p>He asked, "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>I answered, "Somebody has put water at this spot to drink."</p>
<p>The policeman said, "Don't you want to drink it? Aren't you thirsty?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, I am not thirsty."</p>
<p>"Go home and sleep," he said.</p>
