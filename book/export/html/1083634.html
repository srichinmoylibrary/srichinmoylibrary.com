<h2>Question: How come I don't see God any more?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You don't see God any more because you feel that you are sufficient unto yourself. Since there is no room left inside your heart for God to live, how can you see Him? You see someone who is either within you or without you. In your case you have kept both your inner eyes and your outer eyes shut. Naturally you don't see Him, you can't see Him.</p>  </div>
