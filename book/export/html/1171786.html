<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can make progress through eating if you take food as cosmic energy. No matter what you eat, if you feel that you are putting into your system cosmic energy, then you can make inner progress. Also, if you are planning to become one of the heroes of the Mahabharata, like Bhima, who used to eat voraciously and had great physical strength, plus unlimited energy, then while eating feel it is not food but cosmic energy that you are bringing into your system. If you can do that, then you can make real progress.</p>  </div>
