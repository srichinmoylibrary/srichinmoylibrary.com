<p>It seems that something historical has taken place today. Only future generations will appreciate it. This morning, at 8:37, I embarked on this journey and at 8:56 I completed it. I said it would be a very, very, very long journey, but when the Compassion-flood descends from Above everything can take place in the twinkling of an eye. I never, never, never imagined that today I would be able to lift 1,300 pounds. That is why I used the term ‘mystic’. How can one increase by 300 pounds?</p>
<p>There is no such thing as impossibility when you entirely depend on the Will of God. But if you feel that you are the doer, then impossibility looms large.</p>
