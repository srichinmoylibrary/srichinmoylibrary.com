  <h1 class="book-heading">455. His is the choice</h1>
  
 

<p>His is the vital that likes to live<br /> In the abyss of confusion.<br /> His innate weakness disturbs his soul immensely.</p>
<p>His is the heart of humiliation.<br /> Alone he goes,<br /> Alone, blessedly.</p>
<p>His is the enlightening opinion,<br /> His is the enlightened conviction,<br /> His is the choice that moves his heart.<br /> His only happiness is his heart's inner nuclear will.</p>
