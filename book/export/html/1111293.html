<p>One man was following me for at least two or three miles making noise: "Ruhhh, ruhhh, ruhhh." People around him were laughing at him. "Ruhhh, ruhhh." For three miles he went on making that noise.</p>
<p>I didn't have the capacity to go ahead of him, and I didn't want to decrease the little speed that I had. So I said, "No, let me go at my own pace."</p>
<p>For about three miles, he went on making that noise. Then afterwards he disappeared. He didn't go ahead of me; perhaps he stopped running.</p>
