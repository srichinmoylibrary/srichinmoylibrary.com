<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Feel that the day you do not aspire, inside you somebody literally dies. What dies is the most beautiful child which you call the soul. Forget about the philosophy that says the soul never dies. Take the soul as something tangible, a little child, a little plant. If you don’t water the plant inside you every day, the plant dies. Or, if you don’t feed the child every day, he becomes weak and dies. If you don’t pray and meditate, then the soul is not getting nourishment. On yesterday’s food you cannot exist; on yesterday’s meditation you cannot exist. So, if you love the soul, every day you shall pray and meditate. Your love for the soul itself is your aspiration.</p>  </div>
