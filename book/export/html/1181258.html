<p>God has given you<br /> His Power to use.<br /> God has given you<br /> His Love to use.<br /> God has given you<br /> His Perfection to use.<br /> God has given you<br /> His Satisfaction to use.<br /> And what are you giving God<br /> In return?<br /> Can you not give Him<br /> Even a ray of hope<br /> That you will accept Him<br /> As your own, very own,<br /> Unconditionally?</p>
