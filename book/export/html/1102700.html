<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends entirely on what kind of fulfilment an individual wants and needs from his own life and what kind of religion he is practising. If his religion is not broad and all-embracing, then he is not going to get a fulfilment that is everlasting and complete. If he wants total fulfilment, however, then he has to enlarge his vision and his heart's capacity. His vision and his capacity have to increase so that he can see and feel the functioning of his own religion in and through all the other religions.</p>
<p>Again, if one really wants fulfilment, then one has to know that it will not come just by following a particular religion or even by following all religions. Real fulfilment can and will come only from a sincere inner cry for God. Religion is like a house. Either in this house or in that house you can remain. But if you do not aspire while you are inside the house, then there can be no real fulfilment. It is by practising the principle that inwardly dictates the form of a religion that one can find real fulfilment. And this principle is what we call spirituality: aspiration, prayer and meditation.</p>
