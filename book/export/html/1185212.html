<p>Michelangelo had a temper of the quickest. He used to quarrel and fight in season and out of season. A young sculptor named Torrigiani was terribly jealous of Michelangelo's ability. On his part, there was jealousy and, on Michelangelo's part, there was anger. So jealousy and anger fought together.</p>
<p>In the fight, Torrigiani struck Michelangelo mercilessly and broke his nose. As a result, Torrigiani was compelled to flee the city. Michelangelo's nose remained disfigured for the rest of his life.</p>  </div>
