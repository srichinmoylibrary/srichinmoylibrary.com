<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we meditate well, then we feel peace inside ourselves. We feel that all the time there is illumining guidance within ourselves or a beckoning hand which is all the time leading us towards our destination, which is satisfaction-life.</p>
<p><em>First interviewer:</em> So meditation can also decrease blood pressure and do other things?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> These things can be done by the Will of God. When we meditate, we identify ourselves consciously with God's adamantine Will. So if we are in need of something, then naturally our God, who is all Love and all Compassion, will do the needful within us.</p>  </div>
