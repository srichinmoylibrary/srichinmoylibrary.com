<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In his animal incarnation he will not know. A portion of the Avatarâ€™s consciousness will know, but his conscious mind will not know. And unless you know something with the mind, you cannot be aware of it consciously. But when the Avatar takes human incarnation, which is infinitely more developed than the animal life, then he will be able to know.</p>  </div>
