<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is absolutely true. Early in the morning is the best time to meditate, and the earlier the better, provided you can be fully awake and alert. Each person should have a fixed time for his morning meditation, but it should not be after seven o'clock. Of course, in some cases this is impossible. Some people have to work until the small hours of the morning, and it is not out of laziness that they do not get up early. But there are many who can easily get up before seven o'clock to meditate, but don't. What are they doing? They are just enjoying sleep. They are entering into the world of death.</p>  </div>
