<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to please someone in his own way, he will give you much more for your efforts than if you want to please him in your own way. If you please someone according to your capacity, then he will reward you according to your receptivity. But when you please God in His own way, He will actually give you the receptivity to receive His Light, Peace, Bliss — everything. At that time He will say, “Take Me, I am yours.” However, if you please Him in your own way, then He will please you according to your aspiration, according to the capacity or willingness that you have offered to Him. So there is a great difference between pleasing God in His own way and pleasing Him in your own way.</p>  </div>
