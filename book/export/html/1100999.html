<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They have many things to do. In the inner world, the disciples of spiritual Masters pray for the Victory of God, the way they consciously strived for the Victory of God while they were on earth. Ordinary people pray for the fulfilment of their desires. On a daily basis they do not pray for the Victory of God.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when we pray to God for His Victory, our mind will think stupid things. The mind will say, "Since God is omniscient and omnipotent, what can our prayer add to God's Victory?" But God feels, "Here is someone who cares for My Victory." When we pray to God, God will give us a Smile. But when we pray for God, for His Victory on earth, then He is more pleased, infinitely more pleased. When we pray to God, "Give me this," we are caring only for ourselves. But when we pray to God for God's Victory, then God cares for us more, because we are caring for Him.</p>  </div>
