<p>Girish Ghosh had such love, respect and devotion for Sarada Devi, Sri Ramakrishna's consort. Girish used to say to her, "We are fools! Sri Ramakrishna sometimes shows miracles using his occult power. That is why some people believe he is God. In your case, you <em>have</em> everything, but you have hidden it. You are acting like a little village girl. That is why it is more difficult. But our love for you is such that no matter what you are hiding inside, we know that you have the same God-realisation as Sri Ramakrishna. You are the same God the Supreme."</p>
<p>Once Girish fully accepted Sri Ramakrishna, he did not have any difficulty in accepting Sarada Devi. And he was older than her by almost ten years.</p>  </div>
