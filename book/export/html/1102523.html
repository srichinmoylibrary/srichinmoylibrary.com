<h2>Question: Could you speak about the importance of meditating on the heart instead of in the mind?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our philosophy gives more importance to the heart than to the mind. We are not saying that the mind is bad. Far from it! But the mind is limited while the heart, which is very close to the soul, is unlimited. At most, what we can get from the mind is inspiration. But inspiration itself is limited. When we meditate on the heart, inspiration turns into aspiration. And not only do we get aspiration, but we also get the fulfilment of that aspiration: the soul's infinite peace, light and bliss.</p>
