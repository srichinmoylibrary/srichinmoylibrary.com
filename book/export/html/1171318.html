<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fairies can be good. Again, fairies can be mischievous or tricky, while angels are not like that. Fairies do help human beings. But angels, as I said, have more brightness, more compassion, more depth, more maturity. Fairies are like children; they break more than they build. That is their joy. Angels do not believe in breaking. They believe in only making things luminous, more luminous, most luminous.</p>  </div>
