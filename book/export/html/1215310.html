<p>This morning I walked six miles. I went along Union Turnpike past Cunningham Park and then I returned the same way. On the way back, I stopped at a store and bought one grape juice, one Orangina and one corn muffin. I wasted six or seven minutes standing in line in that store. When I came out, I was walking along, drinking and eating. I only ate half the corn muffin. Then I placed the brown bag containing the remaining half outside Suradhuni's store at 7:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Pratibha told me later that she did see it, but she did not know that I had placed it there, so she discarded it. Her intuition did not tell her that the Master came in the form of a corn muffin!</p>
<p>On the way back, I was meditating. Then I started singing Avatar songs. I get so much joy coming back. Definitely speed goes down, but relaxation is there.</p>
