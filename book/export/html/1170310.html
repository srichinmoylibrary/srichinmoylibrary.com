<p>One day a mathematics teacher was giving each of his students a very difficult problem to solve. He was asking them about fractions, square roots, the circumference of a circle and so on. Naturally, most of the students could not solve the problems.</p>
<p>The teacher asked one boy, "Please tell me what is 7,000 divided by 1/7?"</p>
<p>The boy tried and tried, but could not solve the problem. Then a brilliant girl said, "That is just 7,000 times 7 or 49,000."</p>
<p>The teacher was very, very pleased and said, "Yes! That is wonderful." Then the teacher said to a boy who was very clever, "I shall give you a complicated multiplication. Will you be able to do it?" This student said, "No matter how complicated your multiplication problem is, I will definitely be able to do it."</p>
<p>The teacher said, "That is fine. How long do you think you will take?"</p>
<p>"It will take me no more than a fleeting minute," the student replied.</p>
<p>The teacher was surprised. "What are you saying?" he asked. "Will you be able to multiply any numbers so quickly? How is that possible? Even I will take some time to multiply together two long numbers."</p>
<p>"I tell you, I can do it faster than the fastest!" said the student.</p>
<p>"Very well," said the teacher. "Then let me see you do it." Then he gave the student a very difficult multiplication problem. Both numbers were seven digits long.</p>
<p>The boy immediately got out his calculator and multiplied the two numbers very quickly. The teacher asked, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>The boy said, "I am multiplying! You did not tell me that I could not use a calculator!"</p>  </div>
