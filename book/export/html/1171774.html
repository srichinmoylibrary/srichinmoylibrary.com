<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is so clever. He has to keep some impossibility for human beings. Otherwise, there will be no difference between God and man. If man can do everything, then he will no longer need to pray to God for anything.</p>
<p>But as soon as we realise God, God gives us some wisdom. He says, "What do you want? Do you want to get happiness by straightening a dog’s tail, or do you want to get joy by letting it remain as it naturally is?" God always says, "Be natural, be natural!" Natural things give us joy. That is why God does not want people to interfere with His creation by trying to straighten a dog’s tail.</p>  </div>
