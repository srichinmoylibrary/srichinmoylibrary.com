<p>There is no such thing as human authority. Human authority is nothing short of the bankruptcy of conscience and the nourishment of ignorance-hunger. In the truth-world there is only oneness, which is another name for all-illumining, all-guiding and all-fulfilling satisfaction.</p>
<p>Human authority and God’s irresistible laughter are inseparable. Einstein once wrote that over the entrance to the Marx-Lenin Institute in Moscow these words should be inscribed: <em>“In the realm of truth there is no human authority. Whoever attempts to play the autocrat incurs the laughter of the Gods.”</em></p>  </div>
