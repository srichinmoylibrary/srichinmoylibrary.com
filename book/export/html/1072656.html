<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! Let me tell you about an experience of mine not long ago in Connecticut. We spent a few nights at <em>X</em>’s house. <em>X</em> told me her house was haunted, but I did not pay much attention to it. But at night the spirits came. I think there were three spirits involved: a father and two sons. It was a very long story. They screamed and screamed, trying to frighten me. The first night I didn’t take it seriously, but the second night it was really terrible, and I had to take it seriously. They bent a branch of a tree so it came right into my window, breaking the window. The branch came and practically pushed me out of bed. Then I said, “All right! Your time has come,” and I threw them out.</p>  </div>
