<p>The sales manager of the Ambarrukmo Palace Hotel was begging me for an interview. I said that I would give him one at two o'clock the following day. I asked him, "In your office?"</p>
<p>He said, "No, I don't want anybody else to be there."</p>
<p>So we went somewhere else for the interview.</p>
<p>A Muslim wanted to have an interview with a Hindu-very good!</p>
