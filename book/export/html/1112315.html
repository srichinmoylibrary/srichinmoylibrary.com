<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em>: My heart's infinite affection, my heart's infinite love, my heart's infinite fondness I wish to offer to each and every Russian child of my heart, my soul and my God-realisation. This is the message that I am offering to all the disciples that I have in the Soviet Union. To those who have come to visit me, let me say that I am very happy that you are here, very proud of you and very grateful to you. And all those who could not come will receive my heart's boundless fondness, boundless love and boundless affection.</p>  </div>
