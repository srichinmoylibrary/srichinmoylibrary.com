<p>At another point Ilona and I were running near each other. Once I stopped for water and walked for fifty or sixty metres. Then, finished! She took the lead. But then, near the end of the race, my ego came forward so powerfully, and I passed her.</p>
<p>The problem always starts when you drink. Good runners don't drink. If you drink, you are finished! You lose distance, and then for forty or fifty metres you feel miserable.</p>
