  <h1 class="book-heading">Reality</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Case Western Reserve University; Cleveland, Ohio, USA</em><br /><em>28 April 1970</em></p>
<p>There are three realities: God, soul and life. God is the Transcendental Reality. Soul is the inmost reality. Life is the universal reality. God reveals the soul; the soul reveals life. God the Reality lives in His creative Will. Soul the reality lives in its sustaining will. Life the reality lives in its fulfilling will.</p>
<p>Again, God’s Realisation embodies His creative Will. His Concern shelters the soul’s sustaining will. His Compassion feeds the life’s fulfilling will.</p>
<p>Reality is the constant and dynamic process of our inner evolution. The reality of the past is growing. The reality of the present is soaring. The reality of the future will be glowing.</p>
<p>Real reality is not an escape from life. It is the acceptance of life, the expression of life and the interpretation of life. When we accept life, we become divine warriors. When we express life, we become conscious representatives of God. When we interpret life, we become God’s eternal Pride.</p>
<p>Reality is at once the expansion of our human consciousness and the essence of our divine Consciousness. Human consciousness shakes hands with possibility and ability. Divine Consciousness embraces faith and surrender. The flowering of human consciousness is realisation. The flowering of divine Consciousness is manifestation. The human consciousness thought that God was unknowable. Now it feels that God is merely unknown. Soon it will realise that God is unmistakably and unreservedly knowable. The divine Consciousness knows that there was nothing, there is nothing and there can be nothing other than God.</p>
<p>Faith is the simple, direct, effective and complete form of reality. Doubt is the complex, indirect, ineffective and incomplete form of reality. Faith is God-comprehension. Faith is God-description. Doubt is Truth-detention. Doubt is life-suffocation.</p>

<p>Reality’s unity is God’s Existence.<br /> Reality’s multiplicity is God’s Experience.<br /> Reality’s singularity is God the Eternal Lover.<br /> Reality’s plurality is God the Eternal Love.<br /> Reality’s Time-age is Eternity.<br /> Reality’s Experience-age is Infinity.<br /> Reality’s Realisation-age is Immortality.</p>
