<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have jumped into the sea of spirituality and have come to the point where spirituality is most important in your life. You have entered into a new life and now you are preparing yourself. In your particular case, during the time of your preparation, you are not ready to wrestle with the outside world. You are not strong enough. Right now you have two enemies. One enemy is outside: we call this enemy disharmony or conflict. The other enemy is within; it is your own ignorance or imperfection. Since you are a beginner, you have to fight with this inner enemy twenty-four hours a day. So the best thing is to minimise the strength of your outer enemies and work at a job that will not cause you extra difficulties. But a day will come when you will be able to face the world no matter what you are doing, no matter where you are working or who your neighbours are. At that time you will be able to stand tall on your own spiritual strength. When you have grown strong inwardly, when you have acquired inner wealth from your meditation, at that time the whole world will have to surrender to the Light and Peace inside you.</p>  </div>
