So he listened to the Master and began to study medicine. Alas, soon he fell in love with one of the beautiful girls in his class. He told the Master’s other disciples that the Master was to blame for his downfall since it was the Master who had asked him to study medicine. Had he worked instead of studying medicine, he would not have entered into the emotional life. The Master smiled and said, “That means people who work have no emotional problems.”</p>
<p>The Master said to his doctor-friend, “Your Master came into the world to be misunderstood.”</p>
<p>He said to the Master, “You are not my Master; you don’t deserve to be my Master. My temptation-life is the Master. You take care of yourself, sir, and let me take care of myself.”</p>  </div>
