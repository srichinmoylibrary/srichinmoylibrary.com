<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just by allowing your soul's light to come to the mind through the heart. It is as if you have three rooms — mind, heart and soul, — and the only way to reach the third room is to go through the second one. The soul has to come to the mind-room through the heart-room. First concentrate on the soul and feel its presence in the soul-room Then try to bring the soul into the heart-room. Once the soul is well established in the heart-room, illumining the heart, the time has come to enter into the mind-room. So you bring the soul into the mind-room and the mind becomes illumined. The only way to illumine the mind is to bring the presence of the soul into the mind. First you bring the soul into the heart and let the heart be illumined. Then, when the heart is illumined you let the soul come and serve the Supreme in the mind. There is no other way.</p>  </div>
