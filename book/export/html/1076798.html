<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God actually thinks of you all the time. It is I or somebody else that has to think of you at a particular time. But in God’s case, God being All-Awareness, He always thinks of you. But He does not use his mind to think of you. We use the mind to think of a human being. In God’s case, the mind is not required. So whether we think of God or not, God is constantly thinking of us. So in your case God has been thinking and will think of you, because deep within God it is you who are always there and at the same time, in you is God’s Own Reality. So God does not need to think of you. He is All-Awareness and we are deep in His Heart all the time.</p>  </div>
