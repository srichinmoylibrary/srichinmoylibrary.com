<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is within and without. We have not lost God; it is only that we do not care for Him. If we do not want to eat a particular food, if we feel that it is not meant for us, then how can we go and blame others when we do not eat it? It is up to us to decide what to eat. Food, in this case, is God-realisation. It is there for us, but we do not want it. Right in front of us are both ignorance and knowledge. Unfortunately, we make friends with ignorance; that is why we live in constant doubt. Instead of remaining in the soul, we stay in the unlit physical mind, which does not know anything. Because the mind is all ignorance, what we say one minute the mind will doubt or forget the next minute. But if we remain in the soul, we will see and feel our constant oneness with God.</p>
<p>He who lives in the soul, he who cares for God and cries for God, will never say that he has lost God. The moment a child cries for something, he gets it from his father. If we cry for peace, light and bliss from our Eternal Father, then He will give them to us. If we cry for God, then He will come before us. So nothing is denied us; only we do not care for it. If we do not feel a sincere need for God, then we say that there is no God. But if we cry for God and feel our need for God, then we will see that we have never lost God at all.</p>
