<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends entirely on the parents. If they are orthodox and conservative, they may not accept them. But if the parents are liberal in their ideas and cherish broad ideals, if they value the link between East and West, then they will gladly accept their son and daughter-in-law. From the spiritual point of view, in God's light, it is not the race, not the nationality, but the true fulfilment of two human souls in union that is of supreme importance.</p>  </div>
