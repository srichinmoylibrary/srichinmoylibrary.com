<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I fully approve of your cultivating the inner silence. But why do you have to adopt such a difficult method when there is an easier process? The easier process is self-giving. Just give yourself totally and then see whether you are carried away by the waves or whether you become the ocean itself. That is the easiest and most effective way. One way is to dig, dig, dig and God knows when you are going to glimpse a tiny drop of water. The other way is just to throw yourself, let us say, into the sea of Peace, and not worry whether you will meet water animals or jewels inside. The one way takes time and is very uncertain. While you are digging, if you do not get a glimpse of water or consciousness, let us say, then you will be disappointed. You will say, "For six years I have stayed with Sri Chinmoy and I don't know anything. So the best thing is for me to leave him." But the other way, if you go slowly and steadily by giving yourself, throwing yourself into the sea of self-dedication, then you are getting real satisfaction out of life.</p>  </div>
