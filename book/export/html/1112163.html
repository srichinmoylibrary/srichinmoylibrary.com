<p>While I was out walking this morning, I came to an intersection. There was a car coming, so I was going to wait for it to go by. But the driver waved for me to pass first.</p>
<p>As I crossed in front of him, the driver called out, "I know you! You are Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>I smiled and went by. Then he said, "Wait a moment! I want to shake hands with you," and he started coming out of the car.</p>
<p>I said, "Oh no, you do not have to come out of the car." Then I went over to him and put out my hand. He was so surprised that I went to him.</p>
<p>Poor me, I do not know how to shake hands, so I held my hand in a peculiar way. Anyway, he took my hand and shook it. He was of Spanish origin. I think he was a construction worker.</p>
