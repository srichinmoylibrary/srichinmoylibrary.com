<p>President Premadasa is a cosmopolitan heart of sleepless self-giving. For the betterment of the present-day world, his is the spirit indomitable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"President Premadasa's compassion does not stop at the borders of his own race or religion or even nation.... He has a sense of empathy with poor people the world over. Another quality that is especially noteworthy is his refusal to accept that something cannot be done.... At moments like these, his tremendous faith in the ability of ordinary men and women to achieve the impossible, through the force of conviction, comes forth."</p>
<p>Honourable Bradman Weerakoon</p>
<p>Adviser to the President on International Relations</p>
