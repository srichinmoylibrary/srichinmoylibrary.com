<p>She felt she had the capacity to transmit spiritual power. She used to get messages from other spiritual Masters and She felt that other Masters transmitted their spiritual power through her because she was so pure and divine. The Master told her it was not because she was pure and divine, but because the other Masters were compassionate. She was severely hurt.</p>
<p>One day she told the Master that she had realised God. She said her realisation was perfect, but it was not as perfect as the Masterâ€™s realisation. Therefore, she still needed the Master.</p>
<p>The Master said realisation was a very big word, and he did not want to discuss it. He said he only wanted to discuss aspiration.</p>
<p>She felt that the Master wanted to avoid her. She thought she was such a great leader and felt that the Master did not recognise her as a born leader; he was blind, and what should she do with a blind man? So she left.</p>  </div>
