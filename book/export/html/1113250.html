<p>In the afternoon I said to Amrita-da: "Yesterday I saw you fetching water from the tap and carrying the water jug into your room. There are so many young boys and girls who would be I happy and proud to be of service to you. Please allow me to bring water for you every day."</p>
<p>"Chinmoy, it seems that you will not allow me to take even this little exercise. All right, starting tomorrow you have a new job. Come inside; I will show you where to put the <em>kuja</em> (water jug)."</p>  </div>
