<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul cannot live inside someone else, but some of its divine qualities it can leave behind with someone else. The soul is like a most fragrant flower. When the flower is gone, the fragrance remains for some time. When your husband passed away, at that time he may have left behind some divine qualities of his soul.</p>
<p>In your case, what you felt was not your husband's soul but the soul's good qualities or, you can say, the soul's memories. Many, many positive incidents took place between you and your husband, and the memories of some of the most striking of these incidents remained inside you. But the soul itself cannot remain inside another human being after death; it has to go back to the soul's world.</p>  </div>
