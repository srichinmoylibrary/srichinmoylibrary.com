<p>At the rim of sorrow<br /> He found his heartless mind.<br /> On the brink of despair<br /> He found his soulless heart.<br /> In the sea of destruction<br /> He found his goalless soul.<br /> Centuries dropped dead.<br /> Now<br /> On the shore of Time<br /> He finds his searching mind<br /> He finds his crying heart<br /> He finds his illumining soul.</p>
