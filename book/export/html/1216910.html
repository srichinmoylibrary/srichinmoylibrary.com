<p>This morning I woke up with a 105-degree fever. With greatest difficulty I opened my eyes, but then I couldn't see anything.</p>
<p>So instead of running the race we were holding, I walked to the 24-hour eating place and ate coffee and eggs.</p>
<p>Then Vijali came in and I had a long talk with her about Trinidad and Tobago and other countries.</p>
<p>While walking back to the hotel, again everything seemed to be turning white. My fever and back pain were killing me, and I couldn't see anything!</p>
<p>It is very difficult to climb up the aspiration-tree, but the fever-tree one can climb up very easily. The aspiration-flame-tree is difficult to climb up, but the temperature-fire-tree is easy.</p>
