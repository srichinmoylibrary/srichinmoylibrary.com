<p>In Honolulu, you have to take a bus to go to the baggage section, although it is not even 200 metres away. We were all coming out of the bus when a man started screaming: “Stop him, stop him! He has stolen my bag!” One of the passengers, as he was getting off the bus, had grabbed this man’s bag and started running away very fast. So the poor victim was screaming, “Stop him, stop him! He has stolen my bag!” His wife started crying. She could not even walk properly, but her husband began chasing the thief. Everybody was saying, “What happened? Who has stolen the bag?” They were all panicking.</p>
<p>Can you imagine? This happened in the Hawaiian airport! Near where they were checking our baggage tickets, the thief was caught. Ten or twelve people grabbed him and accused him of stealing the bag. There were no police available.</p>
<p>He said, “I didn’t know that I was carrying somebody else’s bag.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you running?” they asked.</p>
<p>He said, “I only wanted to go fast.”</p>
<p>I was one of those watching. Luckily, ten people grabbed him; otherwise the elderly man alone would not have caught him. Now, look at this! The man could have thrown the bag aside, but he did not do that. Then, when he was eventually caught, he said that he did not know he was carrying someone else’s bag. How could we believe him?</p>  </div>
