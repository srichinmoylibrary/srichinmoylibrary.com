<p>After returning from his French class, Nolini-da relaxed on his cot and said to me: "I now have to examine you in something. Can you give me the address of Suhasini Bhaumik? I have no idea where I have put her address. She has just written me a letter and I wish to reply to her."</p>
<p>I searched for the address and found it mixed with the papers of an article he was writing.</p>
<p>In the afternoon a little boy named Mana came to Nolini-da with his mother. Nolini-da said to Mana: "Mana, is this the first time you have come to the Ashram?"</p>
<p>Mana said: "No, this is the second time."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "Ah, then you and I are old friends?"</p>  </div>
