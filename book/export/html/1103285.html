<p>On 4 December 1998, Sri Chinmoy left New York for his annual Christmas trip. During the following two months, he travelled to Hawaii, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, India and Nepal. He took with him some of his main pieces of exercise equipment and thus was able to continue his early morning workouts in each new venue, with the exception of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>This book contains the prayers that Sri Chinmoy offered daily before beginning each new lift.</p>  </div>
