<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sri Chinmoy is not God but he is a son of God just as you are a daughter of God. There is a little difference between you and me. And that difference is that you know who your earthly father is, and Sri Chinmoy knows who your and his eternal spiritual Father is. I tell you that some day you too, like Sri Chinmoy, will know where your divine Father, eternal Father, is.</p>  </div>
