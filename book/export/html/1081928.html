<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, from time to time the Supreme does change His plan, His opinion.</p>
<p>He has every right. It is His world, His Game, and He is the Player. An ordinary human being has the right to change his mind, and the Supreme, being omnipotent and omniscient, also has the right. When He does change His Plan, He does it for our own good. We change our opinion because we don't know what the right thing should be for us. But in the Supreme's case, He knows that He is leading us from Light to more Light to abundant Light, infinite Light.</p>  </div>
