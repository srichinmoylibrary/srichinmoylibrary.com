<p>In Shivaram’s section, Accounts, there was a Gujarati named Ashok Choksi. He was the one who prepared our paychecks. His sister used to be Mr. Mehrotra’s first secretary, but she left before I joined. Then she opened up a restaurant in San Francisco. It is called “Malvi.”</p>
<p>I went there to see her once. The restaurant was supposed to open at five-thirty. But I was there one hour earlier. She was so nice. She opened the restaurant for me and she herself served me. Then, when I wanted to pay her, she said, “No money, no money!”</p>  </div>
