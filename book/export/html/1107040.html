<p>O my aspiration-heart,<br /> Where are you?<br /> God has telephoned me<br /> For news about you.<br /> I simply do not know what to say.<br /> Please come back immediately<br /> And answer the phone.<br /> Every five minutes God is phoning here<br /> With a very significant<br /> And private message for you,<br /> Only for you.<br /> I do not know what it is all about.<br /> Therefore, do come back immediately<br /> And speak to God,<br /> And I shall be so grateful<br /> If you can share with me<br /> Just a little of your conversation<br /> With God.</p>
