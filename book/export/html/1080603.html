<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Inside you is a roaring lion, but that roaring lion is encaged. It is roaring there, but it is unable to come out. As soon as it comes out, then only will it be able to roar properly and manifest what it has within.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Why is it encaged?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why is it encaged? I have to be very frank with you. If you could devote a little more time to the inner world...</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I thought you would say that.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Forgive me.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I am so happy you said that. I spend so much time with the outer world.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have the key, but right now you are not using the key. The door is right in front of you.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> There are so many aspects of the outer world that are spiritual, that are golden. My children are part of the outer world. I spend a great deal of time with my children, for example.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Keats said, "Beauty is truth and truth, beauty." He also said, "A thing of beauty is a joy forever." In your writings I see that beauty and truth are inseparable. That is what you are manifesting all the time. In your case, I see that it is all beauty and truth, and they are interlinked. It is like Walt Whitman's theory in <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. There is no difference between body and soul. You have realised the inseparable oneness between spirit and matter, between the Creator and the creation.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Now you see, that takes a great deal of time.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> But you have done it. Only you have done it in the inner world; in the outer world it takes time. In the inner world you know that you are the supreme musician.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> That is so hard to accept. I cannot take that responsibility.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is good.</p>  </div>
