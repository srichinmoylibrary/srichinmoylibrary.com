<h2>Question: Is there a distinction between man and woman in the soul’s world?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the soul’s development there are distinctions, but they are not based on masculine or feminine. If a soul is very progressive, very mature and very developed in its capacity to receive and achieve, then it will have more light than a less evolved soul. Divinity is inside all of us, but divinity has been received much more by some souls. This receptivity is not based on male-female differences.</p>  </div>
