<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You received as much as possible according to your capacity. During the meditation I brought down Peace, Light, Bliss and all divine qualities. There was no divine quality which I did not bring down. There were times when I was so proud of my children because they were receiving a large portion of what I was bringing down. If somebody receives what you offer, then you feel proud and happy. If you give me a dollar and I gladly take it, then your joy doubles. You are happy first of all because you have it; then you are happy because you have found someone who appreciates its value and claims it as his very own. So I was very pleased with your receptivity-power during the meditation.</p>  </div>
