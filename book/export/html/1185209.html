 <p>
TRNS 34-50. Sri Chinmoy related these stories about some of the world's immortal artists in February and March 1980.</p>
<h2>Two surprises plus one astonishment</h2>

<p>Leonardo da Vinci, when a young boy, drew a picture of a strikingly powerful monster, belching fire and poison, then proudly placed it on a window ledge to surprise his father. When his father came home and saw the picture, he had the shock of his life. The monster was so vivid, so real!</p>
<p>Very shortly after that, his father got the opportunity to spring a surprise on the little Leonardo by enrolling him in an art class.</p>
<p>The Mother Earth did not want to remain in pin-drop silence. She astonished both father and son by making the son the most astonishingly immortal artist-man on earth.</p>  </div>
