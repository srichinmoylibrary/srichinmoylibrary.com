<p>Ganapati’s mother and one of Ganapati’s aunts wanted Suren to get married. Taking advice from Ganapati’s father, together they chose a bride according to the Indian custom.</p>
<p>The aunt gave lots of money for the marriage ceremony. Ganapati’s parents also gave very generously. None of their sons or daughters planned to get married, so they were very happy that at least one member of their big family would be leading a family life.</p>
<p>Everybody liked Suren and they all were so delighted that he was getting married.</p>  </div>
