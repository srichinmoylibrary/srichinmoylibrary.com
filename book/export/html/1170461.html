<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The quickest way is by repeating 'Supreme' as fast as possible. You do not have to shout at the top of your lungs, but you have to be able to hear it; do not do it in silence. You can be seated in your room or walking in a silent place where nobody is going to hear you, but you should not do it while lying down.</p>
<p>While you are chanting 'Supreme', starting with your toes imagine everything that is inside you. Think of your muscles, nerves, blood or anything that you want, and try to feel that the Supreme is entering into that particular part of your body. Then move to other parts of your body. You do not have to see what is inside your legs or your heart or your brain. Only imagine that something is there, and that that very thing is being touched by the word 'Supreme'. If lethargy has already stationed itself inside your knee or shoulder or somewhere else, that portion of the being has to be touched by the very Presence of the Supreme. So each time you say "Supreme", chanting as fast as possible, try to feel that the Power of the Supreme, the Life of the Supreme and the Divinity of the Supreme are entering into you.</p>
<p>This is one of the most effective ways to conquer lethargy while walking or doing something. When you want to conquer lethargy, that is not the time for you to enter into deep meditation; only let the dynamic flow of your chanting percolate through your entire body. If you enter into a higher type of meditation or prayer and are trying to be dynamic, you may succeed; but when the prayer or meditation is over, the dynamism will disappear. But the Supreme's Name you can repeat any time. This is the only way to do it, especially for my disciples.</p>  </div>
