<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A winning attitude, from the spiritual point of view, is a self-giving attitude. If you have a sincere, self-giving attitude, then you are more than ready to conquer your own ignorance. In ordinary human life we try to win by defeating others. In the spiritual life we try to win by conquering the unaspiring and the undivine in ourselves. The winning attitude is our eagerness to conquer the qualities is us that are not progressive.</p>  </div>
