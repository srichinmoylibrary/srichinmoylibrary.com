<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two types of music: earthly music and Heavenly music. There is also a third type, which is the Music of the Supreme. Earthly music stimulates the vital in us. Heavenly music illumines us and spreads the divinity within us. The Music of the Supreme fulfils the Reality within us.</p>  </div>
