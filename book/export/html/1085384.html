<p>There was a very poor Muslim man who used to deal in donkeys, monkeys and dogs. One day he had not been able to sell either his donkeys, monkeys or dogs and he was returning from the village market. It was getting dark and night had set in. It was the month that the Muslims call "Ramjan." For that month Muslims fast during the day and eat only at night. On a specific day of that month, when the stars become very favourable, they feel that no matter what one wishes for, he will get it.</p>
<p>One of the donkeys knew this and said, "How long shall I play the role of a donkey? O Allah, O God, make me the emperor of the world." Then the donkey said to one of the monkeys, "Our prayers will be fulfilled because this is a most auspicious day. I have prayed. Now you pray."</p>
<p>The monkey said, "I pray to be the strongest man in the world." The monkey also believed that his prayer would be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Then one of the dogs said, "I pray to become the commander-in-chief of the world." They all prayed, and they were fully convinced that their desires would be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Then these three animals said to the Muslim, "Now we have prayed. You will see that soon our desires will be fulfilled."</p>
<p>The poor man said, "Yes, I can also pray." Immediately he prayed to Allah, "O God, O God, O God, this is my only prayer. Before You grant their prayers, please make me blind. I don't want to be ruled by a donkey, a monkey and a dog. Please grant my prayer first. Let me be blind so that, if I have to be under their control, at least I don't have to see them."</p>  </div>
