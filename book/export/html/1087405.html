<p>There are two types of purity. One is pure purity; the other is sure purity. Pure purity comes from continuous spiritual discipline. Sure purity comes from the eternal child that dwells in the inmost recesses of our heart, fulfilling cheerfully, devotedly, consciously and unconditionally the dictates of the Supreme.</p>
