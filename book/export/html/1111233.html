<p>After one and a half miles, when I was returning from my three-mile run, I passed by a group of four or five Puerto Rican boys. They were looking at me. Then all of a sudden one got inspiration to run with me. It was almost as though he was chasing me. I ran quite fast for 300 metres and then he gave up.</p>
