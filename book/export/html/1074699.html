<p>He started his pilgrim-life<br />   With implicit faith in man.<br /> He ends his pilgrim-life<br />   With a frustration-mountain.</p>
<p>He started his vagabond-life<br />   With no faith in God.<br /> He ends his vagabond-life<br />   With God's Face in his heart<br />   And God's Heart in his eyes.</p>
