<p>Again at ten o'clock today I went out walking. This was the fourth time. Near my 400-metre mark, just after Sulochana's house, I saw Sandhani vividly. He was standing on the pavement. He was holding a plastic bag or something similar. Then he put his hands on his heart chakra and bowed. I gave him a smile and he gave me a smile. From there I returned home.</p>
<p>Last time I saw him, his better or worse half had to argue with me and say that it was not possible because he does not go out early in the morning. Then it was proved that I was right: I did see him. This time he saw me, greeted me devotedly, and I greeted him blessingfully. So there is no problem!</p>
