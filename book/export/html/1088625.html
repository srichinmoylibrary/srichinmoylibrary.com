<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For that we need another Mikhail Gorbachev! I do not see how India can become one again in the near future. As if it was not bad enough to be dominated by England for two hundred years, another hostile attack had to come in the form of our own leaders who agreed to the partition of India. Even afterwards, when Bangladesh wanted to rejoin India, when it would have been the easiest thing for the Indian government to allow Bengalis to be reunited, the government would not allow it. Ordinary people were suffering so much because of the partition, but the Indian government felt that it could not control a united Bengal. A little portion, Bangladesh — my birthplace — was eager to rejoin the subcontinent, but alas, the people in power did not want them to.</p>  </div>
