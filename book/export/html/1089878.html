<p>Sanctity is the messenger, the harbinger of divinity. Sanctity is the message of God's inner Reality; sanctity is the fulfilling instrument of Reality. With sanctity God started His cosmic Game. In sanctity He feels His veritable Pride. For sanctity He is more than willing to give His All. And to sanctity He offers gladly His Reality and His Essence.</p>  </div>
