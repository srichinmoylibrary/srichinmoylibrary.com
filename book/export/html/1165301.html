<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, that is wrong. Everything should be done at the proper time. If you pluck a fruit from the tree and eat it while it is still unripe, the result will be most deplorable. You always have to wait for the right moment to pick the fruit. Similarly, if someone is fast asleep spiritually and you go and shake him and try to make him get up, he will just kick you. Then you will feel miserable. He will say, “Leave me alone. I want to sleep.” Since you are awake, you can get up and do whatever you want to do. But you have to allow him to sleep, since sleep is what is giving him joy. If a person is old enough to make his own choices, then you cannot force him to accept what you feel is best.</p>  </div>
