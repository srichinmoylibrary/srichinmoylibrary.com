<p>How the workers used to smoke! In our section, everybody used to smoke. Perhaps they could not get peace of mind without smoking. If everybody smokes, what can one person do?</p>
<p>One sectional boss was so nice. He did not smoke in front of the workers. He used to go outside and smoke. But others used to smoke, very graciously, like anything! Even the women secretaries smoked.</p>
<p>Smoking is such a horrible thing! If three persons are smoking, what can you do? You open up the window, turn on the fan—but nobody wants that. So you suffer and suffer and suffer. If at one point three workers are smoking—on your right they are smoking, on your left they are smoking—then what happens? You enjoy smoking! I suffered so much.</p>  </div>
