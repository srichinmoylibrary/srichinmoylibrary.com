<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Nothing can ever affect India's soul, India's heart or India's spirituality. If something happens that goes against India's spirituality, we may think it will affect India's inner reality and inner divinity. But that is not the case. India's inner reality and inner divinity can never be affected by outer circumstances taking place either in India or in any other part of the world.</p>  </div>
