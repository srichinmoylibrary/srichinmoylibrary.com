<p><em>(March 31, 1910. Srinivasachari's house, Pondicherry. Srinivasachari with his friend, Subramaniyam. Moni arrives from Calcutta. He presents an introductory note (2 x 2 inches) to Srinivasachari from Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: <em>(Reading the note most carefully)</em> My dear friend, I find it difficult to believe you. Aurobindo Ghosh has chosen Pondicherry for his stay!</p>
<p>SUBRAMANIYAM: Unbelievable, impossible.</p>
<p>MONI: I am shocked to see that you do not take this note to be genuine. It is in Aurobindo's own handwriting.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: Can anybody imagine that such a great national figure would come down to Pondicherry, a French pocket?</p>
<p>MONI: I give you my word of honour. If I am telling a lie, you may do anything with my life.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: You want simply a house for him?</p>
<p>MONI: Yes.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: Nothing further?</p>
<p>MONI: For the present, no.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: Then I, too, give you my word of honour that as soon as he arrives here I will arrange a house for him.</p>
<p>SUBRAMANIYAM: That's a fine idea.</p>
<p>MONI: <em>(Turning towards Srinivasachari)</em> Well, Sir, I think it would be better if you kept it ready for him beforehand.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: When is he coming?</p>
<p>MONI: On April 4.</p>
<p>SUBRAMANIYAM: And if he doesn't turn up?</p>
<p>MONI: Then you may do with me anything you like.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: The time is so short. I am thinking of giving him a public reception.</p>
<p>MONI: I beg your pardon. He is coming over here <em>(incognito)</em>.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: Where have you put up?</p>
<p>MONI: I am coming straight to you from the station. I don't know where to put up.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: Well, you will be in my house. <em>(He takes Moni into an adjacent room, and returns to his friend, Subramaniyam.)</em></p>
<p>SUBRAMANIYAM: He may be a spy.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: I don't think so.</p>
<p>SUBRAMANIYAM: Anyhow, it is better to be on one's guard.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: I shall be on the alert. But I must find a suitable house for Aurobindo Ghosh. Pondicherry will be blessed by his presence, be it long or short. But in this dilapidated town can I find an accommodation suitable for him?</p>
<p>SUBRAMANIYAM: You can have a talk with Shanker Chetty. His house is three-storeyed. He can easily spare the needed accommodation.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: It is a good suggestion. I will act on it at once.</p>  </div>
