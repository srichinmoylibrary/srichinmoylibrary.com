<p>I had a bitter quarrel with God. Many a time He has come to make up, but my ire has not allowed me to be on good terms with Him. To Him I have said, "God, you have made me the man in the moon, but I wish to be a man of the earth." No answer have I heard from Him.</p>
<p>At last I now comprehend the meaning of His Silence. When evil things torture me, I must in no time become the man in the moon. And when ignorance rises to dominate me, forthwith I must be a man of the earth.</p>  </div>
