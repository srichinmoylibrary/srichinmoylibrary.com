<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is not so subtle. The only thing is that right now we are lacking in vision; we are blind. Even if the sun is shining brightly, even if we are in a brightly lit room, when vision is lacking, we don't see the light. Again, when we have vision, we see everything.</p>
<p>Just because our oneness-heart — our heart which is totally, inseparably one with God — has not been able to convince our mind that God is ours and that He is for us, we are not aware of His Presence. The moment our heart convinces our mind that God is for us, at that time God does not remain subtle. It is the mind that makes us feel that God is subtle, invisible and beyond our reach. Just because we are using the mind to see God, to fathom God, to know God, God and God-realisation remain a far cry. If we use the heart, the heart that identifies with and becomes inseparably one with the eternal Truth, Light and Bliss, then we discover that we are not only of God but also for God. Once we are able to remain inside the aspiring heart and become inseparably one with it, God does not remain invisible, subtle or unreachable. At that time, He does not remain an unreachable. He is all Reality — right in front of our noses. We discover that what we eternally are is nothing short of God Himself in the process of perfect self-discovery and self-manifestation here on earth.</p>  </div>
