<p>In these stories about King Shivaji, we see that spirituality is infinitely higher than anything we can achieve here on earth. Everything is meaningless and useless, save and except spirituality. Again, everything can be meaningful and fruitful if spirituality is inside that very thing. This is what Shivaji's Guru, Ramdas, taught him. Ramdas said, "You go back to your palace and carry me inside you. I will rule the country through you. I will guide all your people."</p>
<p>Spirituality was Shivaji's life-breath. Not as a king was he happy, but as the servant of his Master. When Shivaji brought spirituality into his outer activities, he discovered peace, peace, peace.</p>  </div>
