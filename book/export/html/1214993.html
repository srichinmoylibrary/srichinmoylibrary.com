<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> True, God is a tree, but He does not waste His time in counting the leaves. He feels that the time He will spend in counting the leaves He should use to create more leaves. God does not believe in calculation and multiplication. He only believes in constant, conscious and spontaneous creation.</p>  </div>
