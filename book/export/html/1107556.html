<p>Something is missing. What is it? Man’s gratitude-drop. Something is found. What is it? Man’s haughty pride. Who needs it? Nobody! No, not even the all-devouring death.</p>
<p>Something is missing. What is it? Man’s service-hands. Something is found. What is it? Man’s feeling of worthlessness. Who needs it? Nobody! No, not even the worst possible fool on earth.</p>
<p>Something is missing. What is it? Man’s responsibility-tree. Something is found. What is it? Man’s satisfaction-compromise. Who needs it? Nobody! No, not even the saint who is all forgiveness. The saint is willing to forgive ignorance, but he will never make any compromise with ignorance-illusion. </p>
