<h2>801 Life's Younger Brother...</h2>


<p>LIFE'S YOUNGER BROTHER</p>
<p>He was Life's younger brother.<br /> Therefore<br /> He was always given special attention<br /> In the world of Life.</p>
<p>He was Death's elder brother.<br /> Therefore<br /> He had to take care<br /> Of his younger brother.<br /> This is the only reason<br /> He used to spend so much time<br /> With his younger brother, Death.</p>
