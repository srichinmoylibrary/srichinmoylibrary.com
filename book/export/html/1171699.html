<h2>Goethe's universal spirit</h2>

<p>Goethe was not only a great poet but also a universal figure. He has contributed to humanity in many fields of life — science, art and all kinds of culture. His contribution to the world was in many aspects and not only one aspect. He was not only for Germany but for the entire world. Goethe's universal spirit is blessing all those who aspire for one world.</p>
