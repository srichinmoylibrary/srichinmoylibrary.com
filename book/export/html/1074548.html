<p>Some people want the fruits of aspiration without practising the true spiritual life. Unfortunately these individuals are not aware of the fact that if they do not first become seekers, then the question of receiving a divine experience does not even come into existence. If we want to find the truth without following the path of seeking, then I wish to say that the truth surely will not come to us. If we want to become a finder without first playing the role of a seeker, then we may get something, but we will not derive the utmost joy from it. We may find the truth, but unfortunately we won’t be able to appreciate it at all. And if we cannot appreciate the absolute Truth, then our own inner joy is bound to diminish. If we do not properly seek the reality, then even if the reality comes and stands right in front of us, we will not take it as our very own.</p>
<p>We have to take one step at a time. When a child cries for a lost toy, he is seeking. Then when he finds it, he gets real joy, inner joy. In the spiritual life we soulfully search and cry for our lost divinity, which will really fulfil us. When we cry in this way, immediately we give proper value to the object of our search. So, please try to constantly play the role of a seeker. In the process of seeking you unravel and reveal your divinity.</p>
<p>Again, if we are not true seekers, then what will happen during our search for something which we are not inwardly ready to find? Unfortunately there is every possibility of our adopting foul means to achieve our ends. Without proper aspiration we may try to exercise our mind beyond its capacity. We may try to exercise our dynamic vital beyond its capacity and in that way we may become aggressive. While searching for the truth without genuine aspiration we may say, “I want it. By hook or by crook I will get it.” Unfortunately the use of foul means is the misuse of the God-given capacity within us. While we are seeking we should not be a victim to any kind of wrong thought. At that time we are praying, we are crying, we are meditating on something which is really sublime. We have to feel that we are dealing with the absolute Truth. The finite in us is trying to enter into the infinite with utmost purity, humility and sincerity. While we are seeking, our consciousness is being elevated. It is being heightened. It is running, it is flying toward the Highest. And while we are flying toward the Highest, automatically we will find Light, more Light, abundant Light and infinite Light. In the very process of seeking, we shall see and feel Peace, Light, Bliss and all other divine qualities. The infinite Truth is bound to come to us when we are sincere seekers.</p>
<p>Now, I wish to say that in your case you are not making a very great mistake if, at times, you feel that you don’t want to aspire but you want to 'find'. The very fact that you are really sincere in seeking the Truth will bring down God’s Grace. His Knowledge and His Wisdom will dawn on you to make you feel that the first step is seeking. And while seeking the Truth, you will see that the Truth is automatically found, automatically revealed.</p>  </div>
