<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The seeker knows that he is a divine warrior fighting in the battlefield of life against ignorance darkness and bondage. Here on earth he may live for sixty, seventy or eighty years, and whatever he achieves will remain intact inside his inner being. But a warrior eventually needs rest; so at the end of his earthly journey, his soul goes back to the soulâ€™s world to take rest for a few years. Then the same soul comes into the world once again with a new body, a new mind, a new heart. What for? To enter into the battle against ignorance once more and try to manifest the Supreme here on earth.</p>  </div>
