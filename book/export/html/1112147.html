<p>This morning I went out for a two-mile walk. At my 250-metre mark, all of a sudden Kokila's soul came to me. I said, "I liked your article about my weightlifting so much. I will print it in a pamphlet. Then I will either sell it for 25 cents or give it away free. If I sell it for 25 cents, I will give you all the money." Then I blessed her soul, and the soul went away.</p>
<p>As I came near Main Street on my way back, I saw someone 200 metres ahead of me. I could not see who it was, but I felt a vibration was coming from Kokila's soul. Then, after I turned onto 150th Street, I saw someone about 300 metres ahead of me, and again I felt Kokila's vibration.</p>
<p>When I reached my 250-metre mark, I saw that Kokila had just turned onto the street where she lives and she was waiting there for me. I said, "Kokila!" She turned away her face and started giggling. She would not look at me.</p>
<p>I said, "I liked your article so much. I will print it in a brochure form." Then I told her I had seen her soul at this very spot just a few minutes ago and had blessed it. Again she started giggling.</p>
<p>What can be a greater juicy story? I blessed her soul on my way out, and I saw her on the physical plane on my way back — at exactly the same spot!</p>
