<p>I WAS A FOOL</p>
<p>I was a fool,<br /> I depended on my personal efforts.<br /> I was a fool,<br /> I depended on man's assistance.<br /> I was a fool,<br /> I depended on God's Grace.</p>
<p>But<br /> Now I have become a wise man<br /> Since I revised the order.<br /> I now depend on God's unconditional Grace first,<br /> Ninety-eight and a half percent.<br /> And then I depend on my puny personal efforts,<br /> One percent.<br /> Finally I depend on man's conditional assistance,<br /> One half of one percent.</p>
