<p>Around six miles somebody far behind me shouted: "Guru, you are doing well, quite well."</p>
<p>Now, I had requested the disciples not to run this particular marathon since I was running, so I was wondering who this could be. Finally I saw that it was somebody who had "Reno" written on his T-shirt. His wife is our disciple, and he has been planning for the last three years to become a disciple. Still he is in the planning stage. He is a lawyer.</p>
<p>Another gentleman runner recognised me and said I was doing extremely well. He also called me "Guru."</p>
