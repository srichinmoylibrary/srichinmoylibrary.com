<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul will come down only to aspire more intensely to realise God and manifest more of God's Light. But if God wants a particular human being to become an Olympic star, then it is not the human being who makes the decision. God decides in the soul's world to give the body physical strength so that the person can be an Olympic star. God will tell the soul and the soul will accept. God will say, "If you enter into this family, then only will you have a solid opportunity to become an Olympic star." Then the soul will enter into that particular family.</p>  </div>
