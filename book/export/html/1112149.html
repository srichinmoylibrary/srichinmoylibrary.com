<p>Recently when I was at my 1,200-metre mark, I saw X running. The following day, I was walking along the same route, looking at the ground. When I came to that spot, I said to myself, "Yesterday I saw X here."</p>
<p>Then I lifted up my eyes, and whom did I see? It was X again! She was about thirty metres ahead of me.</p>
