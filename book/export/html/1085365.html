<p>One day a little boy went to a great man and he bowed down to him with folded hands. The great man asked, "My boy, what is your name?"</p>
<p>When the boy told him, the great man immediately became annoyed. "My name? How do you dare to have my name?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," replied the boy. "My parents gave it to me."</p>
<p>"Your parents?" said the man. "How did they dare to give you my name?"</p>
<p>"I do not know," answered the little boy, "but my grandfather says one day I will become as great as you are. That's why they gave me this name."</p>
<p>The great man became furious. "How dare you say this to me? How dare your grandfather tell you this!"</p>
<p>The little boy said, "I do not know. Only my parents and grandfather have told me that I will be as great as you. That's why they have sent me to you."</p>
<p>"Have you come for my compassion and protection, or have you come to bless me?" the man asked.</p>
<p>"I have not come to bless you," said the boy. "I am touching your feet. I have need for your blessings."</p>
<p>"What kind of blessings do you want? Little candies, cookies or a few rupees? What is in the back of your mind?"</p>
<p>The boy said, "No, I have not come to get anything, only to be blessed by you. If you could only touch my head and say that you are blessing me."</p>
<p>"Why do I have to touch your head with my hand? You can touch my feet with your head."</p>
<p>So the little boy touched the great man's feet with his head. The man had remained seated in a chair during the conversation, but at that moment he stood up and lifted the child on his shoulder and said, "My boy, you have far surpassed me. You don't have to surpass me in the future; you have surpassed me already with your patience. I have become great, but I have not conquered anger and pride. You have conquered both anger and pride at such a young age. You deserve this name more than I do, so I am giving you a little money as my blessing."</p>
<p>The man gave the little boy 500 rupees, and the young boy returned home to his family.</p>
