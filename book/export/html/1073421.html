<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is difficult but not impossible. When we use the intellectual mind, constantly we are scrutinising things. But we are never satisfied. We doubt others; we even doubt our own existence with our intellect. The intellect is like a sharp knife that is constantly trying to see what is in something. It cuts the thing into tiny pieces and then tries to see what is inside the tiny piece, to see if there is any reality there. It tries to see the reality in its smallest form. But the heart wants to see the reality as an infinite expanse of Light and Delight. The heart first identifies with the reality; then it expands its own existence. We have to see reality as a whole; then only shall we be satisfied.</p>
<p>We have to know that the soul stays inside the heart. True, its vibration, its consciousness, permeates the whole body; but its actual existence is inside the heart. So if we go to the source, to the place where the soul abides most of the time, it is very easy to feel its light. But if we remain in the mind and wait for the soulâ€™s vibration to reach us, it is much more difficult.</p>
<p>Eventually we have to bring light into the mind, into the intellect, into the lethargic body, everywhere. Light has to permeate every part of our existence. But it is infinitely easier to get light if we go to the heart first and then bring light from the heart to the mind.</p>  </div>
