<p>Ego:</p>
<p>Mother, truly ungrateful are<br /> The dingy human souls.<br /> My labour has freed them from stark<br /> Venomed, Inconscient doles.</p>
<p>Alas, in return they call me names.<br /> Their missiles dire now hound<br /> My aeonless breast from dawn to dusk;<br /> To their hatred I am bound.</p>
<p>Mother:</p>
<p>Offspring, speak out the blue-gold truth.<br /> Where are your words of mail ?<br /> Why dungeon-mates of your sombre past<br /> Why ego at you must rail?</p>
<p>Man:</p>
<p>During our ignorance-dawn she was<br /> Our lonely teacher pure.<br /> But we claimed not our heritage.<br /> So this breach we needs must endure.<br /> Spirit our only changeless guide.<br /> To It alone we bow.<br /> Save It our deathless Form is void.<br /> Thou art the Tree and It the bough.</p>
<p>Mother:</p>
<p>Ego, my erring, doleful child,<br /> Aside you cast your ire.<br /> Inevitable was your gift.<br /> Man now needs the Spirit's Fire<br /> To change his face and sombre fate.<br /> The sky-vast golden Dawn<br /> Can alone slake his sleepless thirst.<br /> He my lion, you my fawn.</p>
