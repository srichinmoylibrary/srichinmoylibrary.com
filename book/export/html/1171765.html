<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a matter of identification. Your identification with me is now transferred to your customers. If you did not keep your identification with me directly, you could not have read their minds. Your connection with me was established before you were able to read their minds. If it is cut, the link is snapped, then you will not be able to read their minds or their hearts. Because your connection is established with the source, then easily you can read their minds.</p>  </div>
