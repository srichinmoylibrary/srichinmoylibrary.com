<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In most cases, it was destined that you would come to me. There are many souls with me now that had been connected with me in previous incarnations, and there are quite a few that I knew in the soul’s region. Once they started to aspire here on earth, they looked for me. But not all souls are meant for me.</p>
<p>Today at the United Nations a friend of one of the disciples said to me, “When I come here I get real joy from you, but I have accepted someone else as my Guru.” His soul is pulling him towards me, but his vital is pulling him away. I didn’t encourage him. I told him to stay with his Guru.</p>
<p>Most of the souls that have come to me are meant for me, even those who have left, except perhaps for one or two that the Supreme didn’t want me to have and that He took away in His own Way. He will take care of those, but the others who have left me will have to wait for me to give them a push again. Disciples may leave me on the physical plane, but in the inner world their souls remain my real disciples.</p>  </div>
