<p>From Dhaka it was only a 45-minute flight to Calcutta. At the Calcutta airport, the story was different. When I opened the bag at customs and the man saw the weight, he wanted to lift it, but he could not. So I lifted the weight up only two or three inches. I did not bring it out of the case even. Then he shook hands with me and said, “Congratulations!”</p>
<p>Just 45 minutes before I had been harassed!</p>
<p>I told him my sad story about Dhaka. He laughed and laughed and he was not at all suspicious.</p>
<p>Here they shook hands with me and congratulated me because I was able to lift it two or three inches. In Dhaka I took it out of the case even, but all they did was harass me.</p>
