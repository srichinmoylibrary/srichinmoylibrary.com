<p>I have many good things to say about France, but each time I go there, I have to lose something — or perhaps I should say they have to steal something! Once they stole my harmonium and another time they took my tape recorder. I had left a tape recorder right on the dresser in my room. As soon as we reached the airport, only fifteen minutes later, I called the hotel and said that one of my students was coming back for the tape recorder. The manager said he would send someone up to see if it was there. After a few minutes he said that there was nothing on the dresser in my room — as if my mind would go blank in fifteen minutes!</p>
