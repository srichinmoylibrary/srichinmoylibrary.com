<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God thinks of you all the time, whereas somebody else may only think of you at a particular time. God, being all awareness, is always thinking of you. While we use the mind to think of someone, God does not need the mind. So, whether we think of God or not, God is constantly thinking of us. God has been thinking of you and will always think of you because deep within God lives your existence and at the same time deep within you lives God's Reality. So God does not need to think of you as such, since He is all-awareness and since we are deep in His Heart all the time.</p>  </div>
