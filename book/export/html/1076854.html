<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This depends on the regular members. Those who come to hear my lectures are not obliged to give anything. My disciples and followers sustain the Centres contributing according to their capacity or wish. Visitors can give a love-offering but they are not obliged to do it. My disciples feel that their Centre is their own house and they sustain it because of the feeling of oneness they have with me. It is not that somebody compels them but that they inwardly feel the desire to help pay the costs of rent, electricity, printing, postage, flowers, incense and so forth.</p>  </div>
