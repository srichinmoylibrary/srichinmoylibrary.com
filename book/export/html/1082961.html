<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, God's Will and the soul's will are one and the same. But we have to know the difference between our soul's will and the urges of our demanding vital. Sometimes we take pleasure-desires of the demanding vital as the soul's will. At that time we cannot say that the soul's will and God's Will are one. But if we dive deep within, we are bound to know the real will of our soul, and that will and God's Will are inseparable. That will is the seed that germinates and becomes a plant. We call it the soul's will. When it grows into a huge banyan tree, we call it God's Will. This Will eventually manifests itself in and through the soul, heart, mind, vital and body.</p>  </div>
