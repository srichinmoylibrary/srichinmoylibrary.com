<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is absolutely right. To be very frank with you and with your listeners, I don’t have the capacity to give people instant realisation. I know that it has taken me many, many years to fully realise the Truth, and I know that it has also taken others quite a few years. It is not like instant coffee, which you can get in the twinkling of an eye. When we try to acquire outer knowledge, we start with kindergarten, primary school, high school and then we go to college and university. It takes us fifteen or twenty years to reach a certain standard and get our diploma. Spirituality is also a form of study. If it takes us twenty years to acquire outer knowledge, do you think that we can acquire inner knowledge in a day or two? Inner knowledge is infinitely more difficult to attain. To keep our mind at peace even for a minute is so difficult. All the time we are being attacked by undivine thoughts and ideas and we can’t make any progress. So it is absurd to think that inner knowledge can be acquired overnight.</p>  </div>
