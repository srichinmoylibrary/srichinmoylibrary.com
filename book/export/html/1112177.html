<p>I have made tremendous progress in my outer walking. In the past, I used to watch who was going ahead of me. If it was a fat lady, it would make me miserable. If I saw someone going ahead of me whose strides were shorter than the shortest and whose legs were hardly moving, I would be so disheartened.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday a young boy passed me near Thomas Edison High School. I said, "Here is the proof that I have made tremendous progress. Ten years ago I would have tried to compete with him, but now I only surrender."</p>
<p>So my surrender is my progress.</p>
