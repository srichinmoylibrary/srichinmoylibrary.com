<p>God asked me for a favour.<br /> I gave Him not what He wanted.<br /> Can you imagine<br /> What He wanted from me?<br /> He wanted to have<br /> All my ignorance.<br /> I said to Him,<br /> "If I give You all my ignorance<br /> What will I have on earth<br /> To live with and to live for?"</p>
<p>I asked God for a favour.<br /> He gave me immediately what I wanted.<br /> He gave me<br /> His Infinity's Love,<br /> Eternity's height<br /> And<br /> Immortality's life.<br /> He shared with me His supreme Secret:<br /> That real joy is in self-giving.</p>
