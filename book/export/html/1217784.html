<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You may call it either Intuition or The Direct Perception of Truth, which needs no mental help.</p>
<p>It is thoughtless. There is no form, no thought. It is direct and spontaneous. It comes and makes you feel what it is. Normally, you see something and then you give it a mental form, saying "This is what it is." But Intuition comes and makes you feel its true existence at once. Intuition houses the depth of vision and the wealth of realisation all at once.</p>  </div>
