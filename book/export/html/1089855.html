<p>God is in everything; that is why everything is divine. But with our aspiration we have to see how much divinity each thing has. In the tiger there is God; so the tiger is divine to some extent. But the quantity of divinity we find in the tiger cannot be as much as the quantity we find in a human being. We have to see the amount of divinity housed in each object. God is inside everything, but in the field of manifestation we have to know how much divinity a chair has and how much divinity a spiritual Master has. When one is wise one will see divinity infinitely more in a spiritual man than in a mad elephant. So in our life of aspiration, we have to be careful when we deal with people and mix with them. We have to approach the person or thing that embodies the most divinity. This is called divine wisdom.</p>  </div>
