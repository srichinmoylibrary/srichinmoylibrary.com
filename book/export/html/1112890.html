<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em>: It is because you are standing at the foot of the tree. You are kind of begging: "I don't know how to climb, I don't know how to climb. How I wish that mango would drop." So like that, you are a beggar. You cry for inspiration. In writing a poem you may spend a few days waiting because you are unable to climb up the tree of inspiration.</p>  </div>
