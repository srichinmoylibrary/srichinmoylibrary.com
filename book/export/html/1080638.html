<p>On Sunday, March 9, 1975, Sri Chinmoy held a special Mother's Day luncheon for the mothers of women disciples in the New York area. The luncheon was held at <em>Annam Brahma</em>, the disciple-owned restaurant in Jamaica, Queens. Each mother was given a corsage upon her arrival at the restaurant, and a few short filmstrips of Centre activities were shown. Then Sri Chinmoy gave a talk to the assembled mothers and encouraged them to ask him questions. He inscribed a copy of the <em>Sri Chinmoy Primer</em> for each mother, and also presented each with a small box containing eight additional gifts.</p>  </div>
