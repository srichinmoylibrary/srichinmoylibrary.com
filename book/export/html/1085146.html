<p>"Who is telling you that you will not be able to surrender to God's Will cheerfully and unconditionally? Do not listen to your mind. Your mind is a fool!</p>
<p>"Who is telling you that you will not be able to become a supremely perfect instrument of your Beloved Supreme? Do not listen to your mind. Your mind is a fool!</p>
<p>"Who is telling you that you will never be able to please your Beloved Supreme even for a single day in this lifetime? Do not listen to your mind. Your mind is a fool!</p>
<p>"My child, I am your Eternity's Friend, and you are My Immortality's friend. I am telling you only one thing: do not try to possess Me; do not try to possess Me; do not try to possess Me.</p>
<p>"If you want to possess Me, you will badly fail in your inner heart of aspiration, and you will miserably fail in your outer life of dedication.</p>
<p>"But if you pray to Me to possess you in My own Way, then your Eternity's earth-existence and your Immortality's Heaven-existence will be inundated with My Infinity's Light and my Infinity's Delight."</p>  </div>
