<p>The Mayor came up to me because he wanted to have a picture taken with me in front of one particular statue of the Buddha, which he liked very much.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not care for that statue. So after we had taken the picture that he wanted, I asked him to stand in front of another statue for another picture. According to me, this second statue was infinitely better.</p>
<p>At that time his photographer was missing. We had two photographers of our own, but he wanted to have his own photographer. So we had to wait.</p>
<p>The Mayor was shouting: "Where has he gone! Where has he gone!" Finally, his photographer came and took the picture.</p>
