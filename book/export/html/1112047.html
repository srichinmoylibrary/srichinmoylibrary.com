<p>Whenever I see a T-shirt with something written on the back, I think it is a shirt from one of our races.</p>
<p>Last week while I was running, I saw a lady ahead of me with quite a few lines written on the back of her shirt. I thought it was Tanima. I ran so fast to catch up with her, but then I saw it was some other lady. And when I came close, I saw it was an American flag on the back of her shirt!</p>
