<p><em>(At the Baroda College)</em></p>

<p>The knowledge-flames of the West in him abide.<br /> But the knowledge-lights of the East from him still hide,<br /> Behold! a miracle-glow upon his brow;<br /> Slowly to him the tongues of Asia bow.<br /> Time holds no paltry dreams before his sight. —<br /> Nothing allures save knowledge infinite.<br /> He conquers soon his students' hearts with love<br /> Immaculate, and matchless remains above.<br /> In his students' minds high thoughts and joys now play.<br /> Their dear 'Arvind' unveils the knowledge-Day.</p>
