<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God was born inside you the moment the real Reality, the highest transcendental Reality, was born. Your highest transcendental Reality and God were born together. When was God known by mankind? God was known, seen and felt by mankind when it offered Him a fraction of gratitude from the depth of its heart. It was inside humanity's gratitude-seed that God was known. God not only became known, He was also born within us.</p>  </div>
