<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> I think the main reason I can relax so well is because I'm so disciplined. It comes from knowing what I can do and having confidence that my way is going to work. So many people get involved in what others are doing, but that’s not my way. If you are within yourself and everything you do is within yourself, then relaxation won’t be difficult.</p>  </div>
