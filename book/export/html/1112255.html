<p>For the last few days I have been running. After a long time I have started again. It is pure joy! Today Databir and the guards gave me a cake to celebrate the start of my long-distance running in June 1, 1978. When I think of my long-distance running, I remember only cramps, cramps, cramps. When you have cramps, your life-breath disappears. When I run a short distance, I do not have a problem with cramps.</p>
