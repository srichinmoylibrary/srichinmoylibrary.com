<p>In one of his most important songs, Tagore says that we must not be afraid of fear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My prayer to You is not to save me from danger, from the crisis. My prayer to You, O Lord, is to give me Indomitable strength so that I will not be afraid of the crisis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This song is so meaningful. Tagore is saying that when there is a serious crisis, he does not want to pray to God for protection. At that time, he wants to pray to God to give him courage so that he is not intimidated by fear itself.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
