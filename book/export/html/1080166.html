    <title>Question: Do you think that the system of &amp;quot;one country-one vote&amp;quot; is democratic? If not, do you see alternatives before the accumulated wisdom of the nations&#039; souls becomes the yardstick in the voting system?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is always advisable for one country to have one vote. But this vote has to come from the general mass. It is not an individual will that is being executed. Otherwise, it will be like many minds going in many ways. At that time nothing will be settled and there will be no hope of reaching any conclusion. So the unity of the collective reality will have to voice forth, and then there will be one vote, one will, one reality â€” one illumining and one fulfilling choice.</p>  </div>
