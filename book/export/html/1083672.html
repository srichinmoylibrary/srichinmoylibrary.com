<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God always likes to eat, not because He is always hungry but because He wants to please the person who has cooked or who has brought the food. There are two persons who bring food for Him. One is ignorance, one is wisdom. When ignorance says, "I have something for You to eat," God says, "Certainly, my son, I shall eat. That is what you have for me and that is what you are." When wisdom says, "Father, I have something for You to eat," God says, "Certainly, my son, I shall eat, for that is what you have and that is what you are." So God likes to please both His sons. He gets satisfaction by pleasing them, not by eating their food.</p>  </div>
