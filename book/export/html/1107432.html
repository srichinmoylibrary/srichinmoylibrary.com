  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: But suppose there were a hundred passengers.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All of the hundred passengers may be destined to die. Out of millions and billions of people on earth, all the passengers may be destined to die. It is just like studying in the same class together. Students who come to school to study together stay at different houses. Each one has a house of his own. So here also, it is just like a class. Their death was destined and they are coming together. Their fate was sealed there.</p>
<p>This may be the case, but again, some evil forces can attack. It may not be their fate at all. Out of two hundred people, perhaps not even one person was supposed to die on that day.</p>  </div>
