MHDI 84-85. These questions were answered by Sri Chinmoy on 14 September 2006 at Aspiration-Ground in Jamaica, New York.</p>
<h2>Question: When I look at the moon, I get a special experience, and I believe it is coming through you. I just wanted to ask you, what is your connection to the moon, specially the full moon?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have a closer than the closest connection with the moon and also with the sun. I have received their blessings, appreciation and admiration in boundless measure. I have received boundless love from both the sun and the moon. Many, many experiences I can tell you. Some of you perhaps know about these. Nothing is new. I have told these experiences over the years.</p>
<p>When I was 14 or 15 years old, I was very fond of the moon. Sometimes for hours I used to look at the moon. Once, my friend was seated beside me. I was looking at the moon and talking to Sri Ramakrishna inside the moon. Sri Ramakrishna was full of love and compassion, and we were talking.</p>
<p>That was one experience. Let me tell you another one. Around the moon there are some nymphs. They are beings who can take human form, and they are most beautiful, most beautiful, most beautiful. They dance, and then they try to ruin the aspiration of the seekers. Once, I was gazing at the moon and I was in my highest. Three or four most beautiful women, celestial beings, were descending to try to tempt me. Then I saw Mother Kali cut them into pieces. She amputated their limbs. This is what my Mother Kali did.</p>
<p>I was only looking at the moon and meditating, but there are always these kinds of beings. In Lord Buddha's case those same undivine forces tried to disturb his meditation and take away his inner wealth. In this way the hostile forces attack many, many spiritual Masters. From around the moon, you can say, those beings were descending. And who cut them into pieces? My Mother Kali. That is one of my very sublime experiences with the moon.</p>
<p>Then I had many, many experiences with the moon relating to Lord Shiva. The moon, and specially the full moon — how beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful it is!</p>
<p>In God's entire Creation, at every moment if we can see beauty, we make progress. We try to see the beauty in everybody, in every being, in every flower — in everything. But again, science has come to show us that there is no such thing as perfection. On the moon, the scientists will see some dark spots. Shall we worship the scientists, or shall we love our heart, the heart that sees the moon and loves the moon and becomes so happy, the heart that swims in the sea of ecstasy? We need that heart, and not the brain of the scientist who sees something wrong in the moon.</p>  </div>
