<h2>Man immortalised</h2>

<p>To perfect our human life, by far the greatest necessity is our soul's delight. When we live in the physical, the teeming clouds of desire are natural, necessary and inevitable. When we live in the soul, the ever-mounting flames of aspiration are natural, necessary and inevitable.</p>
<p>When we live in the soul, we spontaneously cultivate God. His Peace, Bliss and Power become ours, absolutely ours. We grow into our spiritual perfection. This perfection is at once our divine heritage in a human body and our unearthly birthright on earthly soil.</p>
<p>The human in us must live under the sheltering wings of the soul. The divine in us must fly and fly into the Beyond with the flying wings of the soul. The human in us must eventually need transformation. The divine in us must eventually need manifestation.</p>
<p>We expect everything from God. It is supremely good and perfectly reasonable, for who else can fulfil us, both in Heaven and on earth? God is our Face within; God is our Smile without.</p>
<p>God determines everything in us, through us and for us. He is utterly unconditional and infinitely self-giving. Him we serve. Our self-dedicated service unveils Him.</p>
<p>Man's achievement is a supremely unparalleled miracle.</p>
<p>God's achievement is the marriage of His Infinite with His finite.</p>
<p>Lo, God unveiled, man immortalised!</p>  </div>
