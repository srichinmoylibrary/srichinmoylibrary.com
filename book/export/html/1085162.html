<p>My only Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> Do bless me<br /> With Your absolutely choice,<br /> Secret and sacred Advice<br /> For the New Year.</p>
<p>"My child, win My Heart<br /> And thus win My All —<br /> My Eternity's All,<br /> My Infinity's All<br /> And My Immortality's All."</p>
<p>My only Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> How can I win Your Heart?</p>
<p>"My child, by loving Me only<br /> And by needing Me only."</p>
<p>My only Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> How can I love You only?<br /> How can I need You only?</p>
<p>"My child, be punctual in your heart's<br /> Aspiration-cry.<br /> Be regular in your life's<br /> Dedication-smile."</p>
<p>My only Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> I have badly failed You this year.<br /> I have all along failed You unquestionably.<br /> But, my Lord, will I ever succeed?</p>
<p>"My child, you must and you will.<br /> Just sleeplessly illumine your mind<br /> And convince your heart<br /> That you are of My Eternity's Hunger only<br /> And you are for My Immortality's<br /> Satisfaction only."</p>
<p>My only Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> I know that my living death will be<br /> When You withdraw from me completely.<br /> But will You ever withdraw from me?</p>
<p>"My child, do not think of My withdrawal,<br /> But pray to Me to be with Me in My Boat<br /> To reach your supreme Destination —<br /> My complete Satisfaction in you, with you<br /> And for you.<br /> I have so far not withdrawn from you.<br /> But,<br /> My child, wake up!<br /> It is already very late.<br /> How long do you expect Me to hold<br /> My Golden Boat<br /> On this side of ignorance-ocean?<br /> You have to realise that either I am your All<br /> Or you are all for yourself<br /> And all by yourself."</p>
