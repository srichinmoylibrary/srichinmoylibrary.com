<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only one thing I can say. When I stepped onto the soil of America, joy and bewilderment, joy and bewilderment in measureless measure I felt.</p>
<p>The same thing I can say about Switzerland. Years later, when I first stepped onto the soil of Switzerland, I knew nothing about Switzerland. I only knew that Indians who suffered from cancer and other ailments came to Switzerland. That much I knew. I said to myself, “This is my land, this is my land, this is my land — Switzerland! This will be the land of my manifestation.” Then Kailash came. Now look at Switzerland, Germany and Madal Bal! This was my experience in Switzerland that evening. I was so delighted, so excited.</p>
<p>Both joy and fear I felt while walking on the street in New York — tremendous joy, and fear also. Such huge, huge human beings! I could not understand their language, although they were speaking English.</p>
<p>I had a friend who was so kind to me. He was from Brooklyn. His name was John Kelley. Alas, I could not understand anything he was saying. His accent was too much for me! Even now, Brooklyn pronunciation still puzzles me. Queens and Bronx pronunciation I understand, but in Brooklyn, their English is totally different.</p>
<p>I used to type 60, 65 or more words per minute in India. Then, for months I did not practise. A score of 33 was needed for the Indian Consulate, and I got less than 33. John Kelley was so kind, so kind, so kind. When he heard that I needed to practise typewriting, he immediately took me to get a typewriter. At the Ashram I used a Corona that had belonged to President Wilson’s daughter Margaret, whose spiritual name was Nishtha. Then Nolini gave it to me. Here in New York, John Kelley immediately got me a typewriter. I practised a little, and right away I went over 33 words per minute.</p>
<p>That night Mr. Mehrotra’s secretary, who was from the West Indies, phoned me up and said, “Ghose, tomorrow morning come and see Mr. Mehrotra at nine o’clock.”</p>
<p>The next morning Mr. Mehrotra said, “We shall take care of you.”</p>
<p>My friend John Kelley wanted me to study at the New School. Many years later I went to the New School to give a talk. I said to myself, “My friend wanted me to study at this place, and now I have come here to speak.”</p>  </div>
