<p>By this time I must realise that there are certain things in life that are not mine. Again, there are certain things which are entirely mine. The things that do not belong to me, how can I claim them? The things that do belong to me, how is it that I do not claim them?</p>
<p>Insecurity and impurity do not belong to me. How can I claim them? Security and purity, right from time immemorial, have been with me. How is it that I do not claim them as my own, very own?</p>  </div>
