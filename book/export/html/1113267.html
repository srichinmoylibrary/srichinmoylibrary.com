<p>Early in the morning, while I was reading the programmes on the bulletin board, Nolini-da happened to pass by. He said to me: "Your translation is done. You can get it from my room."</p>
<p>Immediately I went to his room and got it. I was deeply moved by his inimitable translation and my heart overflowed with gratitude. A few minutes later he came in. He asked me whether or not I liked it. My face, embodying the reflection of my heart's gratitude, gave him the most adequate reply. The translation was greatly admired by all those to whom I showed it.</p>  </div>
