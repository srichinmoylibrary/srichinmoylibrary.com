<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, if the body and the mind become the conscious instruments of the soul and say, “We shall work along with the soul,” then the soul’s perfection will automatically lead them toward their own perfection. If the mind, the body and the vital are not fully surrendered to the soul, then the soul’s full manifestation can not take place. And if the soul’s manifestation does not take place, it means that the soul is not fulfilled. It has to be fulfilled. Since it wants fulfilment, we will see that one day, the body, the vital and the mind will consciously obey the divine in us, our soul.</p>  </div>
