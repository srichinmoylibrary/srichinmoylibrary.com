<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people use only the word ‘will’, but I like to use the term ‘will-power’, because there is no difference between inner will and power. When I say ‘will’, I see a seed, and when I say ‘power’, I see a tree. If we say ‘power’ without using ‘will’, that power can be vital, destructive power. Power in itself does not have to be undivine, but immediately vital power may come forward. But if I say ‘will-power’, then I know that it is something divine. So I feel it is good to use ‘will-power’ instead of just ‘will’.</p>  </div>
