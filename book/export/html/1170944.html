<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Man will go there, or they will come here. It is like the Russians and the Americans. Previously, Russians could not come to America and Americans could not go to Russia. Now they are going in both directions. But when those beings come here, they will have to take human birth. Again, when man goes there, man will not be able to live in the physical. Man will be able to live there with the tangible subtle body. Human beings also have subtle bodies.</p>  </div>
