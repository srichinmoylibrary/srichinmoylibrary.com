<p>Once Shivaji went to a temple. To his great astonishment, he saw his Master at the temple gate begging for alms. People were giving him a little rice, some coins and so on. When the King saw his beloved Master reduced to begging, he wrote something down on a small piece of paper and put it in his Master's bowl.</p>
<p>Ramdas was curious to see what his disciple had written. He opened the note and read: "I am placing my kingdom at your feet. I am here and I want to be your slave."</p>
<p>Ramdas asked Shivaji, "Do you mean it?"</p>
<p>"I mean it," replied Shivaji. "I am not going back to my kingdom. I shall remain here at your feet. I am your servant. Please tell your servant what to do."</p>
<p>So Ramdas started ordering Shivaji about at random, saying, "Do this, do that." The King did everything his Master asked, even the most menial work.</p>
<p>Finally, Ramdas beckoned Shivaji to come to him. "Why are you doing this, my son?" he asked. "Do you not know that you are a king?"</p>
<p>Shivaji shook his head. "I am not a king. I am your slave now."</p>
<p>"But are you happy?" asked Ramdas.</p>
<p>Shivaji answered, "You cannot imagine my joy! To be at your feet and to listen to your command is the highest delight. You have made me the happiest person."</p>  </div>
