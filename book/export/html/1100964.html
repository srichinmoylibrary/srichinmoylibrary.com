<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you can do two marathons a month, I will be very happy. But I feel that three is too much. If some people can manage one a month, then I shall love them and adore them. Please make sure it is not one a week. Otherwise, I will be very upset. Your health must come first. Yes, to honour your Guru's anniversary is one thing; but your Guru will not be pleased if you ruin your health. I am saying this from my own personal experience. Look at what I have done to my leg! I used to run early in the morning, at three o'clock or four o'clock, mile after mile. Now I am paying the penalty.</p>  </div>
