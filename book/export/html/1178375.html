<p>When I came into the world<br /> And breathed in for the first time,<br /> My Lord Supreme granted me the boon<br /> Of breathing in the Fragrance of His Faith-Flower<br /> Inside my heart.<br /> Today He is smelling<br /> The fragrance of my gratitude-flower.<br /> I am happy<br /> Not because He has given me something,<br /> Not because I have given Him something,<br /> But because I see that His Eyes<br /> Are all Light<br /> And feel that His Heart<br /> Is all Delight.</p>
