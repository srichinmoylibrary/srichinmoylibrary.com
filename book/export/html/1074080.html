<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Detachment is one part of Yoga; it is not all. Everything has its own value, but if we are detached from the things that lower our consciousness, detached from the things that we are otherwise attached to, then we can make much faster progress. Attachment in the spiritual life brings in only untold sufferings. We should do everything to the best of our capacity and remain detached as to the result. Whatever result comes, we must place it at the Feet of God to make ourselves happy.</p>  </div>
