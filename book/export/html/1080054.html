<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one has great faith in his own religion, then he should cultivate the same type of faith in other religions, only he should not follow all the religions. Religion is like a road. If one tries to walk along all the roads while heading towards his destination, then his progress will be very slow. This moment he is on one road, the next moment he is on another road and the following moment he is on a third road. Each time he changes roads in order to reach the destination, naturally he is losing time. So the thing to do is to feel that each religion is true in its own way but that he prefers to walk along the path of the particular religion that he has. But all religions in God's Eye are equally significant and equally important.</p>  </div>
