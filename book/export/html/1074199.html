<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They like it. Do you mean that you don’t like to visit some other places? You don’t always have the means, but if somebody supplies you with the capacity, you will go. Suppose you don’t have money but somebody says, “I will give you money, come.” Then you will go with that person. Aren’t you curious to go to some other part of the world? Fairies are also curious. But they need tremendous purity. Otherwise, they won’t be able to stay in a new place. So I supply them with purity in the new environment so that they will be able to come and stay. Otherwise, they will die. It is my purity that is holding them here. But it is only for today. Then I will take them back safely.</p>  </div>
