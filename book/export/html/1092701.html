<p>Netaji never gave up and he never lost hope. When there was no possibility for him to fruitfully serve his beloved country from inside India, he went to Germany and then to Japan-at great personal risk. Immediately after the Japanese surrender in 1945, Netaji decided that he would go to Russia to carry on his fight from there. No land was too far for him to reach, no danger too great for him to brook. Even after the I.N.A.'s defeat in 1944 at Imphal, near the Burmese border in India, Netaji declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Since we are fighting for justice and truth and for the birthright of liberty, and since we are prepared to pay the full price of that liberty, freedom is bound to come if only we fight on.</p>
</blockquote>
