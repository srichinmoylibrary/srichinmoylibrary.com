<p>"Go and tell X that I would be happy if she could come to see me when she is free. I have something important to tell her."</p>
<p>I said, "Can I not ask her to come immediately?"</p>
<p>"Oh no. She is too sensitive. She is angry with the Mother. That is why she has not come to see the Mother even on last <em>darshan</em> day. I am very tired; otherwise, I would have gone to see her personally."</p>
<p>"Yes, she is great, but to us you are greater than the greatest with your compassionate love and concern for us."</p>
<p>He gave me a smile and said, "Stop, stop! Go and tell her that if she does not find it too inconvenient, then I would be glad and grateful if she could come and see me."</p>  </div>
