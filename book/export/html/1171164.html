  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: How many hours do you sleep?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes two hours, sometimes three hours. Some nights I do not sleep at all. But if I do not have to deal with too many problems, usually I sleep two or three hours a night.</p>
<p>Question: And you feel fresh?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes! I take lots of exercise. Every day I practise sprinting and, when the weather is good, I play tennis. To me, physical fitness is of paramount importance. I am not trying to be the world’s strongest man — far from it! I feel that if we are physically fit, then early in the morning we will be able to get up to pray and meditate. And during the day we will be able to accomplish many things. But if we are weak and sick, then how are we going to get up and go to work and do the needful?</p>  </div>
