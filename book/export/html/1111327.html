<p>Yesterday, while running near my hotel in Hawaii, I got lost for about fifteen minutes. Then again today, I got lost for about twenty minutes. But now I won't make a mistake. I know the name of the street well. If I can remember the name of my sister Lily, then I will remember the street name. Previously, I tried to remember where my hotel was by the small house with two trees in front. But then I saw that four or five houses had two trees in the front yard.</p>
