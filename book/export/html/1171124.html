<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The third eye, which is the vision-eye, is like the soul. In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna says the soul does not take birth, it does not die, weapons cannot pierce it, fire cannot burn it, wind cannot dry it, water cannot drench it and so on. That description can easily be applied to the third eye. But in my case, my third eye <em>can</em> be hurt in a different way â€” through sadness. If I see that my disciples are not doing the right thing, if I see that they are doing everything wrong, it hurts me badly. It hurts my central being. Definitely it hurts my third eye and also my Lord Beloved Supreme. So from a different point of view, my third eye can be hurt, but it is not as if somebody comes with a knife and strikes my third eye. No, it will not be hurt in that way. But by being identified with the wrong actions of my disciples and of humanity, definitely my third eye is being hurt every day.</p>  </div>
