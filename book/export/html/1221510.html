<p>I tried to become great;<br /> God laughed at me.<br /> I tried to become good;<br /> God laughed at me.<br /> I tried to become perfect;<br /> God laughed at me.<br /> Finally, I said to God,<br /> “My Lord, I shall become<br /> What You want me to become.”<br /> My Lord smiled at me and said,<br /> “My child, now you are truly Mine,<br /> And I am all yours.”</p>
