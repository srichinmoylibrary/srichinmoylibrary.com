<p>In Brazil there was a seven-mile or ten-mile race. I was tired, exhausted, since I had run eight or nine miles that morning, so I didn't join.</p>
<p>I saw a man with a dog near the start of the race and I said to him, "Excuse me, can you tell me how many miles they are going to run? I see there is going to be a race."</p>
<p>The man said, "I don't understand your English!" in a very abrupt way.</p>
<p>Immediately I saw that he was an American. I asked, "Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>He answered, "I come from Texas. Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>I said, "I come from New York."</p>
<p>He said, "Now I understand your English. Ask me again."</p>
<p>When I asked him, he said, "I am also a stranger, like you."</p>
