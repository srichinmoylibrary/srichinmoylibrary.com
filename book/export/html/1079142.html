<p>"My child, My sweet child, My divine child, I am always happy. Do you know why? I am always happy because I know that I am yours, only yours, and that I am made of your hope-life.</p>
<p>"But, My child, you are always unhappy. Do you know why? To My extreme sorrow, My child, you do not know and you do not want to know that you are Mine, only Mine, and that you are made of My Promise Breath."</p>
