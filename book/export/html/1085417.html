<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the broadest sense, the Christ was undoubtedly a poet, a painter and an athlete. He was a poet, for his utterances are all poetic, visionary and revolutionary. Each of the Christ's works is a seer-vision of the Father Supreme. He was also a painter. His mother was a painter, whether the world believes it or not; she was an excellent painter. She painted as we ordinary painters do. But the Christ was a divine painter. He painted the suffering of human life and the delight of the divine life, in and through his own life.</p>
<p>He was an athlete. He ran the fastest in thirty-three years. In the short span of his life, he completed his course according to the Vision-Dispensation of His Father Supreme. Again, he was a supreme athlete. He braved the buffets of human life and offered his oneness to the suffering and aspiring mankind.</p>  </div>
