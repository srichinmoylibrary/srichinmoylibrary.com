<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To be perfectly frank with you, I must say that the Western philosophers on the whole are not deeply spiritual. It seems that they wanted to expose uncertainty more than any other quality. Uncertainty is the right word. Their theory is that Truth exists, but you cannot say categorically where it exists. Eastern philosophy, on the other hand, will immediately say, “Just dive deep within and you will see the Truth.” In the search for Truth, Eastern philosophers give a more concrete answer.</p>  </div>
