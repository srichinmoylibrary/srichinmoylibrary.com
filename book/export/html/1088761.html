<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I was born in Bengal, India. At the age of twelve I went to Pondicherry, South India, and there I practised Yoga for twenty years seriously, devotedly, unreservedly and unconditionally. Then I got a message, an inner command, to come to the West to serve the seekers here. My Inner Pilot commanded me to come to the West, especially America, and be of service to Him inside the seekers here. Therefore, I am here trying to abide by the command that I received from my Inner Pilot, my Beloved Supreme.</p>  </div>
