<p>WHO HAS DONE THIS?</p>
<p>Who has punctured his eyes?<br /> Earth.<br /> Sorry, not earth, but earth-doubt.</p>
<p>Who has polluted his ears?<br /> Earth.<br /> Sorry, not earth, but earth-jealousy.</p>
<p>Who has damaged his nose?<br /> Earth.<br /> Sorry, not earth, but earth-impurity.</p>
<p>Who has ruined his life?<br /> Earth.<br /> Sorry, not earth, but earth-ignorance.</p>
