<p>There were two friends going to the market to buy and sell things. One of them was physically very, very strong and the other one was physically weak, but they were good friends. The weaker one said to his friend, "Can you give me ten rupees? I need money badly because I have to buy things."</p>
<p>The other one said, "Certainly I can give you ten rupees, but I do not give anything without security."</p>
<p>The weaker one had on his back a big load of merchandise that he was going to sell at the market. He said to the stronger one, "You give me ten rupees, and I will give you some of my merchandise. You can take that as security."</p>
<p>So the weak fellow took the ten rupees, and the fellow who was physically strong started carrying the load. When they came to the market, the weaker one said, "You gave me the money, and now I can return it. Give me back my merchandise."</p>
<p>The weak one gave back the ten rupees that he had received from the strong one, took his merchandise back and started selling it. The strong one had carried the whole load! So, one who is physically strong can be mentally weak, and one who is physically weak can be mentally very clever.</p>  </div>
