<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. Each attendant has some inner power — an inner power of aspiration, an inner power of surrender to God, an inner power of brotherhood that makes him feel that we are all spiritual brothers and sisters. These divine powers the attendant can immediately invoke when he sees something undivine taking place. If he shows his outer power, if he threatens or frightens someone, he may think that he will be able to solve the problem. But the problem is usually not solved this way. But if he invokes immediately his inner power, that is to say, his inner light, and if his inner light comes to the fore, then automatically the undivine forces that are creating problems right in front of him can easily be eliminated.</p>
<p>So each attendant has inner power. This inner power is the power of his aspiration. This inner power is the power of his self-giving. He wants peace, he wants harmony, he wants love. All these qualities he has in his inner being in abundant measure. If he invokes them soulfully, they are bound to come forward because it is their very nature to come forward. But it has to be done soulfully. Every sincere invocation is immediately answered by the Supreme. There is not a single attendant who is not aspiring according to his capacity. When necessity demands that he bring to the fore his inner power, do you think his Inner Pilot, who is holding infinite power, will delay? The Inner Pilot will immediately supply him with most adequate power to cope with the outer circumstances.</p>
<p><em>P:</em> I think I was looking for some sort of magic word that I could say to stop any wrong force.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If there is a wrong force right in front of you, then immediately repeat “Supreme'” very fast: “Supreme, Supreme.” But it has to be done very quickly. In a second try to repeat the Supreme as quickly as possible, hundreds of times. Let the other person feel that you are crazy. When somebody feels that you are crazy, automatically his power goes away. It is beneath his dignity to bother you. When you start repeating something you are invoking the Supreme not to protect yourself, because you are physically stronger than the other person. You are invoking the presence of the Supreme only to illumine the other person. But he is thinking that you are invoking someone out of fear. He feels, “All right. He is terribly frightened, so let me leave him alone.” Or he will feel that you are invoking some magic power and then he will stay away from you. “Supreme” is a foreign word to him, so he will leave you alone.</p>  </div>
