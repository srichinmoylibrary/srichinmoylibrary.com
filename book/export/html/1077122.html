  <h1 class="book-heading">The song of ego</h1>
  
 
<p>Adelphi University, Garden City, New York<br />April 15, 1970</p>

<p>My ego needs.<br /> My soul has.<br /> My ego tries.<br /> My soul does.<br /> My ego knows the problem that is.<br /> My soul becomes the answer that is.<br /> I am not alone.<br /> Within my unlit self:<br /> My ego, my naked death.<br /> I am not alone.<br /> Within my snow-white heart:<br /> My soul, and my Spirit's Flame.</p>

<p>Ego is the thief of thieves. Not to speak of ordinary experiences, even realisations are afraid of this intruder.</p>
<p>To feel the absence of ego is as difficult as to see God's constant presence in oneself.</p>
<p>Ego helps bondage grow. Bondage, in return, helps ego flourish or run amuck.</p>
<p>Self-pity, self-indulgence and egoistic emotional cries are but one shortcoming with different names.</p>
<p>O small ego, O big ego, don't worry. Both of you have God's Compassion at your disposal. As there is no difference between a rill and a river when they run into the sea, neither is there a difference between an ordinary man and an important man when they dive into the Sea of God's Compassion.</p>
<p>Ego is diversity in unfulfilling action. Surrender is unity in fulfilled action, fulfilled manifestation and fulfilled perfection.</p>
<p>Self-advertisement cannot even touch the feet of God-Realisation. God-Realisation cannot lower itself even to touch the head of self-advertisement.</p>
<p>To think oneself always great is to believe that toil and skill are unnecessary.</p>
<p>No doubt, man is infinitely superior to a wild beast. But he always drinks two bottles of poison: one bottle is ego and the other is doubt. Until he has done away with these two bottles, man is no more than a higher animal.</p>
<p>To strive to do something unique is undoubtedly good, but it is better to know whether that unique thing is what God wants you to do.</p>
<p>The difference between God and man is this: man is the determining I. God is the determined We.</p>
<p>Happy is he who has overcome all selfishness. Blessed is he who sees God emerging from the sea of his ego.</p>
<p>The moment we remove the minor of self-flattery from our eyes and hold up before us the minor of Truth, we see a half-animal jumping within and without us.</p>
<p>With your unlit and wild ego do not destroy yourself. Suicide is the worst possible barrier to the goal of self-realisation. If you destroy yourself, instead of starting your next life where you have left off in this one, you will have to go back to a much earlier point.</p>
<p>There is one defeat that brings us a greater triumph than even victory does. What is that defeat? The defeat of our ego by our soul.</p>  </div>
