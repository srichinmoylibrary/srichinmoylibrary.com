<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that moment fear entered into your physical and then into your stomach. Now, you have to know that Aum is the name of God. When you chant Aum, please try to feel that you are actually breathing in the Breath of the Supreme, the Infinite. But when you breathe in and chant Aum, it should not be done mechanically; at that time you should not feel that you are doing two different things. While you are breathing in and chanting Aum, the name and form should be coming inside you together. Then there will be no fear; it will be all joy and oneness.</p>  </div>
