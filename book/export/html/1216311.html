<p>The day I wanted to sail<br /> With doubt,<br /> Our boat did not start.</p>
<p>The day I wanted to sail<br /> With fear,<br /> Our boat sank when the journey<br /> Was three minutes old.</p>
<p>The day I wanted to sail<br /> With love,<br /> God immediately jumped into our boat<br /> And on we sailed.<br /> Both love and I just<br /> Slept, sang and danced in the boat.<br /> But God did something more:<br /> He led us all the way<br /> With His Nectar-light.</p>
