<p>On my last day in India, I went to the <em>Samadhi.</em> The man who was in charge of Sri Aurobindo's room was there. He said to me, "You are not planning to come to Sri Aurobindo's room this time? You must come."</p>
<p>I gave him a very sorrowful face. I had been coming to the <em>Samadhi</em> every day. But for Sri Aurobindo's room there is a fixed hour; only at eleven o'clock can you go there. That was the hour I was more interested in spending with my sister. I could not say anything. The man gave me some flowers. He said, "All right, if you cannot go, I understand."</p>
<p>I put the flowers on the <em>Samadhi,</em> and I was very, very happy.</p>  </div>
