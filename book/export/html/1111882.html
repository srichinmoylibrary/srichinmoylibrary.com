<p>After I saw the crazy lady for the last time, I went about four hundred metres farther, and whom did I see? Fred Lebow. He was practically a mile and a half ahead of me. He said, "Oh, Sri!" His face was so tired. I was not tired because I was walking.</p>
<p>After sixteen miles Saraswati saw him walking, but when I saw him, he was still running.</p>
<p>The humidity was unbearable, but Fred Lebow was encouraging me.</p>
