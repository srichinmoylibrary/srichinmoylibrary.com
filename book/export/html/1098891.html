<p>When S. K. Roy went back to India, we had a farewell party. As usual, I wrote a poem. Those farewell parties I shall always remember. Everybody used to mix together, chat, sing—all the staff members as well as our bosses and their wives. Ambassador B. K. Nehru came from Washington for the Consul General’s farewell party. He was Pandit Nehru’s cousin.</p>
<p>S. K. Roy’s wife was a Muslim, although he was a Roman Catholic. She was thinner than the thinnest, and she was a very strict disciplinarian, but she liked me very much. God knows what her husband had said to her about me!</p>
<p><em>Mr. B. Ramamoorthy: I clearly remember that when Guru recited his poem for the Consul General, S. K. Roy, at the Consul General’s farewell party, tears were flowing from the Consul General’s eyes. Most of these government officials do not get tributes. They work silently behind the desk. That is why Guru’s poem meant so much to him.</em></p>  </div>
