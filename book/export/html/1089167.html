<p><em>(Singers perform songs by Sri Chinmoy dedicated to Nakamura, including three songs to Nakamura's words.)</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy (to Seko):</em> How is your married life? You should have brought your wife here. There are so many of our girls here whom she could have met. Does she run?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> Yes. She won the corporate relay for the S &amp; B company. I am the so-called coach for the runners because my ankle has been injured.</p>
<p>/Sri Chinmoy: When are you going to run a marathon again?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> I am going to run a race next spring. Next year I will run possibly two marathons.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Will you run in Fukuoka?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> I haven't decided on which marathons, but I will run two.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Kobayashi:</em> Mr. Shintaku of our team won the Fukuoka Marathon on December 1st in 2:09:51.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> See how Mr. Nakamura's soul's blessings are working. <em>Mr. Kobayashi:</em> Mr. Seko and Mr. Shintaku are rivals from the same team.</p>  </div>
