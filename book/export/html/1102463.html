<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each seeker has his own level of consciousness. If someone has a very vast and illumined consciousness, then he may feel that he is representing a large section of humanity. The higher one goes, the more responsible one feels for the upliftment of human consciousness. Ultimately, God is responsible for everything and we are just His instruments. But if we become His conscious instruments, then according to our receptivity He can act in and through us most powerfully. It is through us that God will fulfil His own Dream.</p>  </div>
