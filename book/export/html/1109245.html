<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can maintain spontaneous delight by thinking of what you were and feeling gratitude for what you have already become. See the progress you have made and, on the strength of that progress, feel that you are running towards the goal. Feel a continuous flow of life-reality glowing inside you. When you are aware of this flow, then you can easily maintain your heart's spontaneous delight.</p>  </div>
