<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you enjoy experiences, it is like seeing my paintings. Four thousand I have done and they are all in my house, let us say. If you can go to my house, it is a question of whether I am willing to show you all the paintings. Then you can take your own time, a few hours, to see them. The paintings are there in my house and you can see them. But you have to know that I as an individual am the possessor. It is up to me whether I shall show you. So also in the soul's world, the soul is the possessor of all your inner experiences. It has everything recorded. If you can enter into the soul, the soul's reality, the soul can show you these experiences as I can show you the paintings in my house.</p>  </div>
