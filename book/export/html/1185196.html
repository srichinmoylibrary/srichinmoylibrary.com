<p>When Swami Vivekananda left the body, on July 4th, 1902, nobody, nobody cried as bitterly as Swami Brahmananda. Brahmananda said, "Now I have lost everything. In you, I found my brother, father, everything. Now I have lost all. How could you go and leave me alone? Today you have made me helpless, helpless."</p>
<p>Then he literally jumped on Vivekananda's dead body, crying and crying like a little child.</p>  </div>
