<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each Master has his own way. After getting a certain number of disciples, some Masters stop. In my case, I try to be of service to everyone who wants light. You can say I am greedy. No matter how many disciples I get, I say, "I am still hungry, I am still hungry." Some Masters like a small garden with just a few flowers. I like a big garden where many flowers can grow, with the hope that among them there will be a few flowers that will be most beautiful and most fragrant! That will give me so much joy!</p>  </div>
