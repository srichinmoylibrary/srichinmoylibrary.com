<p>One of my running routes, my hilly course, was marked off by Vinaya. This course is where Sanatan had the bicycle accident several years ago. Each time I run on the hilly course and reach that particular intersection, automatically I think of Sanatan and his accident. Either I think of Sanatan or Sanatan's soul thinks of me. Then, after that I continue. I have run there so many times. It is a very dangerous intersection!</p>
