<p><em>Sri Chinmoy offers U Thant a bouquet of flowers at a meeting with the Secretary-General on 29 February 1972, when U Thant said: "Whoever speaks to me about you is all appreciation and admiration, and I personally feel that you have been doing a most significant task for the United Nations."</em></p>
<p><em>At a meeting on 16 July 1976, Secretary-General Waldheim presents Sri Chinmoy with a silver medallion in appreciation of his work at the United Nations. The two met again on 7 March 1977 and on 24 October 1978. During their first meeting Mr. Waldheim remarked: "You are praying for peace. I know what you are doing for us. I know it. I can feel it."</em></p>
<p><em>Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar meditates with Sri Chinmoy on 13 January 1983, remarking later in the meeting: "I am indeed touched by your sincere expression of support for my efforts in the cause of peace and international understanding.</em></p>
<p><em>"In your meditation you see beyond the superficial distinctions of race, sex, language or religion, as the Charter encourages us to do. You concentrate on the truths and ideals which unite all mankind: the longing for peace, the need for compassion, the search for tolerance and understanding among men women of all nations.</em></p>
<p><em>"We must never forget that all our activities are aimed at fulfilling the lofty principles of the Charter. We must not lose sight of these objectives despite the frequent difficulties we encounter along the way. In recalling the fundamental goals which inspire our work, you are helping to re-affirm our commitment to the Organisation and its purposes."</em></p>

During the nearly twenty years that Sri Chinmoy and the Peace Meditation group have been offering programmes at United Nations headquarters, many messages of good will and mutual appreciation have been exchanged with the United Nations Secretaries-General and their office. The following selection of quotations and correspondence illustrates this relationship founded on mutual respect for service to the cause of peace.<a href="#fnref1">â†©</a></p></li>
