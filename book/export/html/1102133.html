<p>"My Lord, I know now that You are Kindness and Compassion infinite, but where were You before? Twenty-eight years ago You came to me with countless desires. Where were your Kindness and Compassion then?"</p>
<p>"My child, this is your false accusation. I did not come to you with endless desires. It was you who wanted to play constantly with your darkening and darkened brothers and sisters: desires. You did not care for your illumining and illumined brothers and sisters: aspirations."</p>
<p>"Forgive me, my Lord Supreme, I withdraw my shameless charge."</p>
