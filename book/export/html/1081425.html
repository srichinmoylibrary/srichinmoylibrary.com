<h2>Truth</h2>

<p>Truth is God's Treasure and man's property. Truth is God's eternal and constant Progress and man's energising success. Truth is God's Natural History and man's supernatural mystery.</p>
<p>Truth is original and essential when it comes from the soul. Truth is pure and sure when it comes from the heart. Truth is obscure and incomplete when it comes from the mind. Truth is undivinely dynamic and imperfect when it comes from the vital. Truth is weak and insignificant when it comes from the body.</p>
<p>The body is blind. The vital is wild. The mind is ignorant. The heart is aspiration. The soul is realisation. Out of His infinite Bounty, God offers His clearing Sight to the body, His embracing Might to the vital, His illumining Light to the mind, His transcending Height to the heart and His fulfilling Right to the soul. Truth is our inner attitude. Truth is our outer aptitude. Truth is our life's fortitude. When attitude, aptitude and fortitude play together and sing the song of aspiration, infinitude dawns on them, and soon they bathe in the eternal effulgence of infinitude.</p>
<p>In the world of desire, Truth is our mind's idea. In the world of aspiration, Truth is our heart's ideal. In the world of realisation, Truth is our soul's Goal.</p>
<p>Idea is the seed. ideal is the tree. Goal is the fruit.</p>
<p>Idea is self-expression. Ideal is self-expansion. Goal is Self-Union.</p>
