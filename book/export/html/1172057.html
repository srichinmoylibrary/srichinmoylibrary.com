<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the girls meditate for purity, they should try for a few seconds to breathe through the left nostril. If you are breathing through the left nostril, it will be easier for you to bring purity into the system. And if the boys can try to breathe in through the right nostril, then it becomes easier for them to develop purity. The left nostril is for softness, for the soft and sweet inner flow; the right nostril is for power and dynamism. So, in this way the girls can establish purity and the boys can establish purity. But the exercise that I just mentioned applies both to men and women.</p>  </div>
