<p>About a week ago, I was running along the track at Harbor View Gym. Another gentleman was also running. He was twice as big as me. He was running very slowly, but he saw something in me. When he stopped running, he started talking and talking to Databir. He told Databir that he deals with retarded children. He feels he is taking their karma. A while ago he had a mental breakdown. Now he has just started taking a meditation course.</p>
<p>Databir said to him, “Here is a meditation teacher.” Then Databir invited him to come that evening to our Wednesday night meditation. He came and brought his wife and I gave him a flower. Then he came to our New Year’s Meditation in Manhattan. As soon as he heard me playing my esraj, something happened. He started crying and crying and crying. He was so embarrassed. Right after the esraj, he left. His wife wanted to stay, but he said, “No, I am embarrassed. How can I cry in front of so many people?”</p>
<p>Look at his interpretation! His soul came to the fore and was offering gratitude to the Supreme because he was getting such light, such peace, from Above. But he thought it was unmanly to cry, so he disappeared.</p>
<p>Today he was here at the gym. He said to me, “Sir, how are you?” I smiled at him. Then, for forty-five minutes, he and Databir enjoyed a marathon conversation. I told Databir to tell him that his soul was deeply moved and that is why he cried.</p>
