<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we feel that some divine dreams will inspire us because for the past few days or weeks or months we have not been able to meditate well, then it is advisable to try to have divine dreams when we go to sleep. In this case, they will be an inspiration to help us meditate as well as we once used to. But if we are only carried away by the word ‘dream’ and want to have a dream for the sake of the pleasant feeling or pleasure it gives, then it does not help our spiritual life in any way.</p>  </div>
