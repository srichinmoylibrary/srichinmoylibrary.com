<p>Independence, independence, independence!</p>
<p>The human in me thinks that it is dependent on the persons it agrees with. It thinks that it loses its independence as soon as it sees eye to eye with others.</p>
<p>The divine in me thinks otherwise. It thinks that when it agrees with others, it enlarges its vision and establishes firmly its oneness with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The human in me feels that it loses its independence the moment it takes something from others or even expects something from others.</p>
<p>The divine in me feels otherwise. The divine in me feels that God's creation is for give and take. Give what you have and take what you need, for there is only one common Source, and that Source is God. This moment God is playing the role of the Giver through me, and the next moment He is playing the role of the Receiver through me. It is all oneness-game.</p>
<p>The human in me thinks that it loses its independence as soon as it starts thinking of others, whether they are good or bad. It feels the supreme necessity of thinking only of itself and not of anybody or anything else, because it feels that nothing belongs to it.</p>
<p>The divine in me feels otherwise. The divine in me thinks, feels and knows that the moment it thinks of God, it creates a thought-world that is the precursor of an action-world. Once we have established a reality in the thought-world, then the next step is to bring that reality into the action-world for manifestation. In our action-life only can we have true satisfaction.</p>
<p>The divine in me knows that there is and there can be no such thing as independence. It is all dependence, and inside dependence what looms large is the message of constant oneness. God gives us what He has-His Compassion. We give God what we have — our love. God gives us what He is — His Goodness. We give God what we truly are — our aspiration to become greater.</p>
<p>We depend on God for His Compassion. God depends on us for His Manifestation. This kind of dependence is actually mutual oneness playing different roles at different times, for constant satisfaction and constant perfection, for constant perfection and constant satisfaction.</p>  </div>
