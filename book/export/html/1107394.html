<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The disciples should try to go deep within and see what I actually want from them. "Disciple" is a very, very important word. If the Guru is important, so also is the disciple. In India they say that Gurus grow like mushrooms here, there and everywhere. But in order to get a true disciple, one has to cross the length and breadth of the world. Everybody can find many, many Gurus. But a true disciple is something very, very rare in God's entire creation.</p>  </div>
