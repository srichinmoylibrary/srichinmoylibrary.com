<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it is not possible. If somebody has a headache, then he needs some medicine. If somebody has a stomach upset, then he needs some medicine in order to cure himself. Similarly, we are wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance, so meditation is the only medicine that can cure us from the disease which we call ignorance, suffering.</p>  </div>
