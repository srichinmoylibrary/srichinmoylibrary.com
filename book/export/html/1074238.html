<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible to travel to other planets. The occultists usually use one process; the Yogis use another process. Again, there are some spiritually developed seekers who are neither occultists nor Yogis, and they use still another process. The mediums also use a means. Some people travel through the astral tube, which they develop through the practice of kundalini yoga and specific concentration on the chakras. But the Yogi usually does not do that. If he wants to do it, he can; but in his case, by virtue of his intuitive power, he can immediately enter and become one with the astral plane or any plane of consciousness. Because of his oneness with the universal Reality, he has a free access to the astral plane. Or if he uses his intuitive power, he sees that he is already there on the other planets. He does not have to go there. He does it through identification and oneness.</p>  </div>
