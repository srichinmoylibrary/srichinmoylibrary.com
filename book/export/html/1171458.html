<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a kind of experience that I am having!</p>
<p><em>Nils Lodin:</em> It is a tough experience.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is not a pleasant experience.</p>
<p><em>[Nils Lodin laughs.]</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I get two kinds of experiences. On the physical, vital and mental planes, I get the experience which you can call suffering. It is an unpleasant feeling. From the beginning to the end, the body is being tortured. Again, there is also the inner experience. I feel that the outer experience which I am going through is something that my Inner Pilot wants me to do, and I surrender the results. I know it will take me more than four and a half hours. But if I can offer the results to Him, then I am getting a divine experience, the experience of surrender. One experience I am getting on the physical, vital and mental planes, and another experience I am getting on the psychic plane. Whatever I achieve, cheerfully I will give to Him; this is my inner experience. The outer experience that I am getting is torture, right from the beginning to the end, but that also I am offering to Him. Both the inner and the outer experiences I am offering to God, my Inner Pilot.</p>  </div>
