<p>Once when we went to a circus in Venezuela, I saw that one of the young girl performers was an extremely evolved soul. I felt miserable that Saraswati was not there, because I wanted somebody to approach her. Later, I told Saraswati to go and give her gifts.</p>
<p>That girl was one of the two hundred most evolved female souls living on earth at this time. Such an evolved, receptive soul in the silliest possible circus!</p>
<p>Our circus is far better; only we don't have animals. But we don't need animals because we represent animals.</p>
