<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme did not decide to go through suffering. He wanted to go from Delight to greater Delight, and then to abundant Delight, greatest Delight. But then human beings started using their minds and created confusion. With their limited freedom they started running the wrong way and that wrong way led to eternal suffering. The Supreme did not want suffering. Only our minds created all suffering. The Supreme didn't do it; we did it. We did everything.</p>  </div>
