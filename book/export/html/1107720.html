  <h1 class="book-heading">The inner experience of peace</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Columbia University; New York, New York, USA</em><br /><em>St. Paul’s Chapel</em><br /><em>4 April 1973</em></p>

<p>The inner experience of peace is man’s supreme Necessity.<br /> The inner experience of peace is man’s transcendental Beauty.<br /> The inner experience of peace is man’s absolute Reality.</p>
<p>Necessity knows what the inner hunger is.<br /> Beauty knows what the inner feast is.<br /> Reality knows that it is the cook, the server, the eater and the enjoyer.<br /> It knows that they are four in form but one, eternally one, in spirit.</p>
<p>Necessity is the forward march towards the Source.<br /> Beauty is the upward march towards the Source.<br /> Reality is the inward march and return towards the Source.</p>
<p>Inspiration accompanies Necessity on the way.<br /> Aspiration accompanies Beauty on the way.<br /> Realisation accompanies Reality on the way.</p>
<p>Inspiration embodies the preparation-seed.<br /> Aspiration reveals the determination-plant.<br /> Realisation offers the Perfection-Tree.</p>
<p>God touches the preparation-seed.<br /> God blesses the determination-plant.<br /> God embraces the Perfection-Tree.</p>
<p>In God’s Touch man feels that he is God’s Dream-Boat.<br /> In God’s Blessing man feels that he is God’s Reality-Boat.<br /> In God’s Embrace man feels that he is God’s Fulfilment-Boat.</p>
<p>Unconditionally God plies His Dream-Boat between the shores of Compassion and Concern.<br /> Ceaselessly God plies His Reality-Boat between the shores of Love and Joy.<br /> Devotedly God plies His Fulfilment-Boat between the shores of Pride and Gratitude.</p>
<p>AUM</p>

<p>There is absolutely nothing as important as the search for peace in the outer world. Without peace the outer world is not only wicked to the backbone, but also hopelessly weak.</p>
<p>A wicked world has tremendous energy. Unfortunately, its energy is directed towards a false goal, a goalless shore. If this energy is directed towards the real Goal, the Golden Shore, the world will unmistakably and triumphantly reach its Destination.</p>
<p>The condition of a weak world is most deplorable. A weak world has no energy. For a weakling there is no Goal; there can be no Goal. To reach the Goal, energy is needed, strength is needed and dynamism is needed.</p>

<p>The Goal is for the strong. And who are strong?<br /> Strong are those who are awakened.<br /> Strong are those who love the world.<br /> Strong are those who serve God in mankind.</p>

<p>What are the things that prevent us from acquiring peace in the outer world? Our self-indulgence in the world of the body, our self-aggrandisement in the world of the vital, our self-doubt in the world of the mind and our sense of self-insufficiency in the world of the heart prevent us from acquiring peace in the outer world.</p>
<p>What are the things that can inspire our body, vital, mind and heart to have peace in the outer world?</p>
<p>Simplicity can inspire our body, humility can inspire our vital, sincerity can inspire our mind and purity can inspire our heart to have peace in the outer world.</p>

<p>What are the things that can expedite our achievements?<br /> Our love of the Consciousness-Light can and will expedite our achievement in the body.<br /> Our devotion to the Consciousness-Light can and will expedite our achievement in the vital.<br /> Our surrender to the Consciousness-Light can and will expedite our achievement in the mind.<br /> Our constant and inseparable oneness with the Consciousness-Light can and will expedite our achievement in the heart.<br /> In his inner experience of Peace, man discovers what he eternally is: Immortality.<br /> In his search for Peace in the outer world, man discovers what he eternally has: Divinity.</p>
