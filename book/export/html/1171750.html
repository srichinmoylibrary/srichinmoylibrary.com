    <title>David Rumsey: Over the last two or three thousand years, there have been periods of Western civilisation -— such as the times of the ancient Greeks and the Renaissance -— where it has been considered important to look at all the things that make up a completely rounded person, a whole man: intellectual life, sport, music and so on. Many people have spoken of you, with all your interests, as a kind of Renaissance man.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am jack of all trades, master of none!</p>
<h2>David Rumsey: I think it is not just a question of being a jack of all trades, though. It is something that you have been able to use, in a sense, to transcend yourself. You set yourself a certain goal and you move in a certain direction — just as, in music, you have taken up the organ only relatively recently. Previously, you have played the Indian esraj, the bamboo flute and many, many other instruments.</h2>
