<p>Ramdas Kathiya Baba realised God by repeating the Gayatri Mantra one million times at the foot of a banyan tree. Then he composed a sweet, soulful and fruitful song. It said, "I have realised God. My God-realisation is for the holy ones to believe and for the wicked ones not to believe. But I know, I know, I have definitely realised God."</p>
<p>True, a God-realised soul does not have to depend on man's belief or disbelief. But if people can believe in him, then he can without fail accelerate humanity's progress and Divinity's manifestation on earth.</p>  </div>
