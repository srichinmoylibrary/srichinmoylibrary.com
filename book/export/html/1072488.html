<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Read my books, read my books. Have you read the latest book, <em>The summits of God-Life?</em> Read, read, read that book. And again, please forgive me, but why do you ask such idle questions? When people ask me questions about realisation, <em>siddhi</em> and <em>samadhi</em>, the answers will be useless to them. You are asking about the top of the Himalayas when with greatest difficulty you may be able to come to the foot of the Himalayas. I am not discouraging you, but if you think about <em>samadhi</em> at this stage of your development, you will soon get discouraged. You will see that it is useless to think about these things, and you will just give up. Just climb up slowly, steadily and unerringly.</p>
<p>Some spiritual Masters used to say, “Don’t utter these words, ‘realisation,’ ‘liberation,’ ‘salvation.’ They should not be uttered at this stage of your spiritual development. Only use the words ‘aspiration,’ ‘dedication,’ ‘devotion,’ ‘love,’ ‘surrender.’ ” These are the things you should be thinking about right now. If somebody is studying in kindergarten and thinks of his elder brother who is completing his Master’s degree, a problem will start. He will be thrown into a sea of confusion and discouragement. Beginners should act sincerely. It is not that you will remain a beginner forever. One does not remain in kindergarten all his life. He goes to primary school, high school and then to college and university. But he has to know where he is. So you know where you are. Now is the time for you to think of your aspiration, love, devotion and surrender.</p>  </div>
