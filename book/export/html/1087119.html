<p>I am fond of bargaining. Whether I am an expert or not is a different matter.I have all kinds of belts to liberate me from my back pain-white, blue, black, green-it is endless. Two days ago I saw a belt in a store window. I was about to enter into the store when a middle-aged lady came rushing up to me and said in English, "I see you will have trouble. Let me help you."</p>
<p>How did she know that I didn't speak Spanish? All right, very good! Then both of us entered into the store and she started talking to the lady there in English. She was so excited about trying to help me that instead of speaking Spanish, she started speaking English.</p>
<p>I said, "What are you doing? You are speaking in English!"</p>
<p>Then she started speaking Spanish, and she really helped me.</p>
