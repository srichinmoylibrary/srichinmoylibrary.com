<p>Daughter, I have been<br /> Looking for you everywhere.<br /> Where have you been?<br /> What have you been doing?<br /> "I have been inside my mind."<br /> Ah, that is why I have been missing you.<br /> What have you been doing there?<br /> "I have been thinking<br /> Of how to create a better world."<br /> I see, daughter.<br /> Please do Me a big favour.<br /> When you create a better world,<br /> Make Me an honorary citizen of your world.<br /> Not only are you disappointed<br /> In My world,<br /> But I am also disappointed<br /> Far beyond your imagination's flight.</p>
