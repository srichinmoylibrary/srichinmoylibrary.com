<p>During the six-day race, a runner from Colorado came up to me and said, "Sri, I always feel for you. Whenever other people misunderstand you, I say, 'His philosophy is totally different.' I read your books.</p>
<p>"My wife is so nice. She says, 'As long as you don't get injured, you can run.' After eight days I am running another six-day race."</p>
<p>Then, after some time, he said to me, Sri, you have inspired me so much that I have already run three miles."</p>
<p>Cahit Yeter came up to me and said, I took a long rest, and as soon as I opened my eyes, I saw you." I hadn't seen him.</p>
<p>As soon as Stu Mittleman saw me, he started clapping. Don Choi gave me a little smile.</p>
<p>Kim Cavanough calls me "Guru " She said, "Guru, this is one of your races. Your people have made it into your race. I am getting the same feeling here as at your races."</p>
<p>Nathan Whiting came by and I said, "I have read the article about you."</p>
<p>Nathan said, "I have not read it."</p>
<p>I said, "It is excellent."</p>
<p>Nathan was begging me to give a spiritual name to James. Nathan is always so nice o me. I asked him how he survives. He said, "Oh, a difficult task! I work a little and then I run."</p>
<p>George Vallasi was also in a clever way trying to get me to give James a spiritual name. He was saying that James was not talking to the cameramen and that he himself wanted to speak to the camera people on James' behalf. So he asked me what he should say — what James' good qualities are.</p>
