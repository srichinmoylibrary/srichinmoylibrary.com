  <h1 class="book-heading">Punishment</h1>
  
 
<p>To be on my own side and not on God's side is not only an unpardonable crime, but also an unbearable punishment.</p>
<p>My Lord's punishment-dog cannot change me and my life. It is only the constant increase of my love for my Lord that can and will change me and my human life totally.</p>
<p>The punishment that I get from my Supreme Pilot when I disobey Him is next to nothing in comparison to the punishment that I inflict upon myself by separating myself from my sweetest and closest oneness with Him, in Him and for Him.</p>
<p>When I do something wrong, no matter how trivial and insignificant it is, my Lord Supreme, do punish me immediately, for that is what I richly deserve. But do love me even when You punish me, for Your Love is my aspiration-life's only soul and my dedication-life's only goal.</p>  </div>
