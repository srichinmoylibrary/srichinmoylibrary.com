<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No! In my philosophy, man and woman are one. Man and woman are both God's own creation, so there can be no difference. God is manifesting Himself in and through both man and woman. They are like children and God is their divine Father. He offers His children equal Love, equal Concern, equal Compassion, equal Blessings and equal Pride. To my dear ones, to my own men and women disciples, I always give the same opportunity, the same concern. I feel that they are equal; they are one. They are like two eyes. I need both eyes, left and right, if I want to see well. Similarly, if God wants to manifest Himself fully on earth, then He needs the dedicated service and surrendered oneness of both men and women.</p>  </div>
