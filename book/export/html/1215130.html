<p>In Vivekananda’s school days he knew what he was <em>not</em> going to be in his later years. He was a most brilliant student in all subjects save and except arithmetic. One day he was summoned by the headmaster. The headmaster affectionately enquired of Naren why he was not interested in arithmetic. Naren’s immediate reply was: “Sir, I am afraid I shall never work in a grocery store! Therefore, I am not required to be good in arithmetic.”</p>
