<p>This book presents a collection of some of Sri Chinmoy's oldest and some of his newest unpublished lectures. These talks range in date from 1967 to 1974 but are not arranged chronologically in this volume. All of them were delivered to the disciples at his San Juan, Puerto Rico Centre.</p>
<p>The talk entitled "My Seven Eyes" may seem familiar to those readers who are acquainted with Sri Chinmoy's early published works. A much-shortened version of it was printed in his book entitled <em>Songs of the Soul</em>, published in 1971 by Herder and Herder.</p>  </div>
