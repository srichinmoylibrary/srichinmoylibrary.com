<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the aspirant feels that he is not devoted enough, then he can do four things to increase his devotion. (1) He should try to love the Master more than he already does. (2) He should try to feel that the Master loves him infinitely more than he thinks. (3) He should try to develop more purity in his outer life. (4) He should try to feel that the highest Truth can and will come to him from the Master and through the Master alone.</p>  </div>
