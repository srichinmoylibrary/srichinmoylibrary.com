<p>This morning I could not do anything because of the pain in my legs. I went to Annam Brahma Restaurant to receive some treatment from Dr. Chu. When I am walking, I am unable to straighten my leg because it hurts so badly. Afterwards I was joking with one of the disciples that the condition of my legs is as bad as the condition of her soul.</p>
<p>Today I told Ketan that I want to lift six planes as soon as possible. The sooner the better for me. They should be between 2,700 and 3,200 pounds. I may have to go out of town very soon and I have so many other things to do. So I would like to lift them in one day if I am allowed.</p>
