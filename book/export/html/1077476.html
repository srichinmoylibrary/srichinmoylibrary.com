<p>The Occultist says, “God is a deer.”</p>
<p>The Yogi says, “God is also a tortoise.”</p>
<p>The Occultist says, “God is Power.”</p>
<p>The Yogi says, “God is also Peace.”</p>
<p>The Occultist says, “In my victory, God Himself applauds.”</p>
<p>The Yogi says, “In my victory, God’s Face is a sweet smile.”</p>
<p>The Occultist says, “To me, fear has no existence.”</p>
<p>The Yogi says, “To me, even impossibility has no existence.”</p>
<p>The Occultist says, “My strength is God’s dynamic Will.”</p>
<p>The Yogi says, “My strength is God’s all-sustaining Poise.”</p>
<p>The Occultist says, “My speciality lies in my one-pointed Will.”</p>
<p>The Yogi says, “My speciality lies in my transformed consciousness.”</p>
<p>He is truly a divine warrior who uses not only his occult power as a sword, but also his spiritual power as a shield.</p>
<p>The occult powers used by most primitive tribes are those capacities lying latent in man’s unlit vital nature. They are used to propitiate and battle the beings and elements of the vital worlds. As human evolution is now proceeding along mental lines, most men are no longer interested in the vital plane and have lost the capacity to function there. Generally, they are no longer fascinated by the spell of the vital worlds. Humanity now cares little for the powers below the mind, aspiring, as it does, for a truth and light far above it.</p>
<p>Oh, Black Magician, to me, you are a snake-charmer! If you know the art, the snake becomes your toy. If you err, its venom will reduce you to a piteous victim.</p>
<p>What exactly is ‘black magic'? It is a violent art which has nothing to do with the Divine Will. It can never elevate man’s consciousness, even by a fraction. On the contrary, it ruthlessly harms and blights the consciousness, first of the victim, and later of the magician himself.</p>
<p>Just as it is impossible for a man to square the circle, so is it impossible for an occultist to live always in the sea of divine Peace.</p>
<p>Look at the eyes of an Occultist. He is likely to look care-laden. Look at the eyes of a Yogi. You are likely to observe that peace and serenity flood his atmosphere. Where indeed is the choice between the Occultist’s intensity and the Yogi’s immensity?</p>  </div>
