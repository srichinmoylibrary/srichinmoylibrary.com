<p><em>CHARLIE (Bansidhar):</em> To me, the philosophy of Sri Chinmoy means to constantly, completely, consciously and unconditionally surrender to the infinite Consciousness, so that the Light of the Supreme may permeate our total being.</p>
<p>To me, Sri Chinmoy's philosophy is the door by which all of us will enter into the Supreme. He has taught us that we will come to realise God through him and we will come to be one with Him. And not only do we need God but also God needs us to be complete.</p>  </div>
