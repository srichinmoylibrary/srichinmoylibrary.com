<p>Today I was wearing the grey Bill Rodgers running suit that Nemi gave me a year ago. I said, "This is Nemi's uniform. Nemi should see me wearing it."</p>
<p>O God, I had not gone even 600 metres when I saw Nemi driving by in a car. I said, "Look at this! Here I am saying Nemi should see this, and she comes by in the car!"</p>
<p>So God fulfils that kind of desire!</p>
