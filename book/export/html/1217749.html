 <p>
The following questions were asked on 13 August 1966, at the first session of the Summer series on Yoga, held at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Virgil Gant, 467 Central Park West, New York City. The talks given at these classes will be published later.</p>
<h2>Question: In order to come into closer contact with one's self, to know the mysteries of one's inner self, what is the correct procedure? I believe that meditation is where answers will be given about one's inner self. Is this correct?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. In meditation and concentration. Both will help. If you want to know about your inner self and the inner mysteries of your life and the universal life, then you need meditation and concentration.</p>  </div>
