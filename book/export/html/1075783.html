<p><em>(On reading Sarojini's appeal in the </em>Bande Mataram/ of August 18, 1908, for funds for the defence of Aurobindo, two patriots are walking to Sarojini's residence, at 6, College Square, Calcutta.)/</p>
<p>1st PATRIOT: We must not rest satisfied with our own contributions. However large the expenses, the country must meet them.</p>
<p>2nd PATRIOT: That is my feeling, too. We most work our hardest to collect funds from door to door.</p>
<p>1st PATRIOT: Yes, we must.</p>
<p>2nd PATRIOT: We have to plan an organised effort.</p>
<p><em>(Enter the two patriots and greet Sarojini)</em></p>
<p>PATRIOTS: We have brought in our humble mite. <em>(Each handing to Sarojini a hundred-rupee note)</em> We are planning a door-to-door collection.</p>
<p>SAROJINI: That's all to the good. So far I have received less than half the sum required. Sixty thousand, that's the estimate of legal experts. The amount so far received is twenty-three thousand.</p>
<p><em>(Enter a Punjabi postman)</em></p>
<p>POSTMAN: <em>(Handing a ten-rupee note to Sarojini)</em> Mataji, please accept this poor man's offer. Aurobindo Babu is our god. We pray for his victory.</p>
<p><em>(Enter a bearded muslim cabman)</em></p>
<p>CABMAN: Baji, [fn:8] Babuji has used my cab many, many times. I have received higher and higher Bakshis every time. I have wept and prayed to Allah for his release. Allah, Allah, help him out of the trouble! Kindly take this petty sum for his defence. <em>(Handing a five-rupee note to Sarojini, with a salaam he goes out.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter a street cooli of Oriyan origin. Tears rolling down from his perspiring face.)</em></p>
<p>COOLI: <em>(Placing a half-rupee coin on Sarojini's table, with folded hands)</em> This wretched cooli has nothing more to give. Jagannath Prabho, save our country's jewel.</p>  </div>
