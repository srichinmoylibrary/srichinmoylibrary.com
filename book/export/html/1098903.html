<p>A few years ago, when I went to Marine Midland Bank, a little black boy, three or four years old, came up to me and grabbed me. He said, “Kaku, kaku!” Now ‘Kaku’ means ‘uncle’ in Indian language. So I said to myself, “What is this? How can I be his uncle?”</p>
<p>O my God, then he ran to his father who was standing ten metres away and I saw that this man was one of my colleagues at the Indian Consulate, Mr. Macwan. He is a Gujarati. I asked him, “When did you get married?” Then he told me all about his wife. “She is so good, who cares for colour?” he said.</p>
<p>He sent his little boy to call me, “Uncle, uncle!”</p>  </div>
