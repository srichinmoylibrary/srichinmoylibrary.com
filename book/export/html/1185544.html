<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I see a person who wants to become my disciple, even before he asks the question about being accepted, the answer is already there. So I wish to tell you that I accept both of you wholeheartedly. Before you formed the question I knew this. When I ask seekers to send me a picture and short resume, in a fleeting second after I open it I make the decision whether to accept or reject them. The Supreme in me makes the decision.</p>  </div>
