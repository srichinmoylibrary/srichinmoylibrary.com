<p>There was an orphan boy.<br /> His name was Madal Chinmoy.<br /> He hailed from a wee village, Shakpura.<br /> He became his Family’s <em>ananda fuara</em>.</p>
<p>He lost his Father at the age of eleven.<br /> The following year, his Mother<br />           was summoned by Heaven.</p>
<p>At the age of twelve, he came to Pondicherry<br /> To be a passenger of his Master’s Ferry.<br /> Sports he liked and became a mountain-champion,<br /> But neglected not his dream of God-union.</p>
<p>One night his Guru Supreme<br /> Entered into his sweetness-dream,<br /> Said:<br />           “Get up to meditate. Get up to meditate.<br />            In years to come you will have to navigate<br />            The birthless and deathless mankind’s sorrows<br />            To the Golden Shore of Tomorrows.<br />            Give due importance to your body, vital,<br />                        mind, heart and soul<br />            To help the world reach its destined Goal.”</p>
<p>Madal, kettledrum of the cosmic Gods,<br />           Became Chinmoy Consciousness-full.<br /> God’s Compassion-Eye made him<br />           A teacher of His inner School.<br /> His student-life he took as his life’s bondage-night.<br /> Therefore, his heart pined for Freedom-Light.</p>
<p>Now that he is a teacher of the inner School,<br /> He realises that he is an unspeakable fool.<br /> Humanity’s transformation-fate<br /> Is a completely closed iron gate.<br /> He breathlessly cries to God,<br />           “Save me, my Lord, save!”</p>
<p>“For you, no rest. Sunlit Path you needs must pave.<br /> For you, no rest, no rest, not even a fleeting rest<br /> Because in you I have found My Heart’s Satisfaction-Nest.”</p>
<p>“O Lord, I am crying, bleeding and dying.”</p>
<p>“Who prevents you from smiling and flying?”</p>
<p>The whole world came to him.<br />           He desperately wanted to hide.<br /> His Absolute Lord commanded him<br />           all-where with Him to ride.</p>
