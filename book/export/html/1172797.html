<p>The heart says to peace, “Peace, I need you.”</p>
<p>Peace says to the heart, “Heart, I need you.”</p>
<p>Both the heart and peace need each other. Without peace, the heart is fruitless. Without the heart, peace is homeless.</p>
<p>The inner heart of the United Nations is flooded with peace. The outer heart of the United Nations is trying to spread peace all over the world.</p>
<p>The outer existence of the United Nations is a colossal hope. The inner existence of the United Nations is a fulfilling reality.</p>
<p>The heart of the United Nations has peace. The mind of the United Nations seeks peace. The vital of the United Nations needs peace. The body of the United Nations is for peace.</p>
<p>The presence of peace in the heart is divine oneness. The presence of peace in the mind is divine illumination. The presence of peace in the vital is divine dynamism. The presence of peace in the body is divine satisfaction.</p>
<p>The goal of the United Nations is peace, world peace. The secret of the United Nations is sacrifice.</p>
<p>There are two types of people: one wants peace, the other does not. Many nations have formed the outer body of the United Nations. Peace is expected from each nation in abundant measure. The Supreme loves all nations, because all are marching towards the same Goal. But if any nation wants to surpass other nations ruthlessly, then that particular nation will never be claimed by God’s Pride, Heaven’s Delight and earth’s gratitude as their own. When all nations work together devotedly and untiringly, then only can they embody universal oneness and reveal universal love.</p>
