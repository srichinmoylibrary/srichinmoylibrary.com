<p><em>On 28 November 1998 Sri Chinmoy was interviewed by CBS radio about his weightlifting demonstration at York College the previous evening. Sri Chinmoy's feats included lifting the equivalent of his own bodyweight overhead in each arm simultaneously, doing a standing calf raise with 1,500 pounds and a seated calf raise with 740 pounds.</em></p>  </div>
