<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I take the Holy Spirit as the connecting link between the Father and the Son. On the one hand, the Holy Spirit represents earth's climbing cry. This climbing cry from the depths of the Son's heart passes through the Son and carries him to the Father. Again, the Holy Spirit is also Heaven's descending Smile. It brings the Father's highest Consciousness down to the Son's earthly consciousness. The Father and Son are being united by the Holy Spirit.</p>  </div>
