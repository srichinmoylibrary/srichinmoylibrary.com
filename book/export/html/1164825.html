<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your body tells you this because the body always, like other ignorant forces, makes irrational demands. First, the ignorant forces make demands, then they feel that these are their most legitimate rights. The best thing you can do is give up your friendship with ignorance altogether.</p>  </div>
