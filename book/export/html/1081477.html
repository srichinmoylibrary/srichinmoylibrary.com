    <title>Question: Why is it that in all the world there are only a few spiritual seekers? And why is it that only perhaps a few of those will ever see God?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everybody will see God sooner or later. Everybody has to. God will never be satisfied unless and until each individual has realised Him. That is His will. But it is a long, arduous process. Today somebody becomes perfect, tomorrow somebody else becomes perfect, and the day after, a third person becomes perfect. God's Cosmic Game has to be consciously played by everyone. And in this Cosmic Game everybody has to become perfect. Unless and until everybody becomes perfect, God's Game will never be completed. Just because it is difficult, we can't say that we shall not be able to complete the Game.</p>
<p>A kindergarten student will naturally find it impossible to get a Master's degree immediately. It may take him twenty, twenty-two, twenty-four years, but one day he will also get a Master's degree. Here we are all seekers. Even those who are wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance, if they have a sincere belief in God, are seekers in their own way. Not only those who are praying to God and meditating on God but also those who have faith in God are seekers. If someone has faith that God can do something for him, although He may not be doing it right now, that person is an unconscious seeker. The very fact that someone has belief in God is a sign of that person's God-acceptance. In the course of time, those aspirants will become like us. They will feel that mere belief won't do, that they have to consciously try to manifest their belief, which right now is vision, and transform it into reality. When they have that kind of inner feeling, at that time they become conscious seekers.</p>
<p>When we become conscious seekers, devoted seekers, unconditional seekers, we accelerate our spiritual progress. Then God-realisation does not remain a far cry. But we have to start. Something seems difficult when we have not consciously started. Once we consciously start something, we have to know that that thing will not always remain difficult. If we start something <em>unconsciously</em> today, tomorrow we will not know that we actually started and, after a while, we may totally forget about the thing. But if today we pray to God soulfully and consciously, and if tomorrow we again do it consciously and soulfully, and if we continue in this way, then nothing will remain difficult.</p>  </div>
