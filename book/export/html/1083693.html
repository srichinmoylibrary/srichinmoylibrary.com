<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Golden Boat willed never get rusty precisely because it will always sail. The Inner Pilot will always sail the Golden Boat even if there is only one seeker left out of millions and trillions of human beings. If one single solitary human being wants to sail in the Golden Boat, God will use His Boat to bring that person to the Golden Shore of the Beyond. Since it will be in constant use, the Golden Boat will never get rusty.</p>  </div>
