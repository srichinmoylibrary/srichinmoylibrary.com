<p>O my earth-life<br /> You want beauty<br /> To be the captain of your body.<br /> That is perfectly fine with me.</p>
<p>You want purity<br /> To be the captain of your vital.<br /> That is perfectly all right with me.</p>
<p>You want luminosity<br /> To be the captain of your mind.<br /> That is excellent with me.</p>
<p>You want divinity<br /> To be the captain of your heart.<br /> That is more than perfect with me.</p>
  </div>
