<h2>Question: Could you please tell us the spiritual significance of your chanting?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have chanted a few Sanskrit verses which I set to music. These verses were composed by the Vedic and Upanishadic seers. The Vedic seers had opened their Third Eye, the Eye that sees the Real. With our earthly physical eyes we do not see the Real. The ultimate Real can be seen only with the Third Eye, the Eye of Vision.</p>
<p>If one consciously accepts the spiritual life, the inner life, then naturally one will aspire and meditate; one will always try to elevate one's consciousness to the highest. When we chant, our psychic being, which is the representative of the soul, is fed. A mother feeds her child whenever the child is hungry. Similarly, we have to feed the soul, the divine child within us, by chanting or meditating. When the soul is constantly fed, it comes to the fore and the soul-bird gets the opportunity to fly in the sky of Infinity and Eternity.</p>  </div>
