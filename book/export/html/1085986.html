<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have already started making the sound that pleases the Supreme most. Do you know what that sound is? That is the sound of self-giving, devoted, cheerful, soulful and unconditional self-giving.</p>
<p>Again, there can be no end to your inner and outer progress. Do you know why? The reason is very simple: the supreme Dreamer in you is constantly in your heart of aspiration-plane and in your life of dedication-train dreaming His cosmic Dream in order to manifest His Divinity's Light, Eternity's Height and Infinity's Love here on earth.</p>  </div>
