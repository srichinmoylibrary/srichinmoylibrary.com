<p>It is really surprising that a man at times doubts the authenticity of a thing even after being an eye witness. But the moment he runs his eyes over that very event in a newspaper, he finds considerable truth in it. So often it is found that newspapers are not only news-suppliers, but also news producers with the help of an unfathomable sea of imagination. In the words of Napoleon,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Four newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tagore’s view on newspapers is also worth remembering, especially for the writers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No one has achieved Immortality by writing for newspapers.”</p>
