<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can instil a spiritual feeling in the work that you do if you keep in mind that you are working not just to please your boss but also to please the soul of the United Nations. You must please your boss, without fail, but your ultimate goal is to please the soul of the United Nations. In order to do that, every day you should try to increase your own aspiration. Your own aspiration will automatically convey its strength to the people you work for.</p>
