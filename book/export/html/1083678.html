<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If God assumes a human body and looks at human beings, and if His human eyes need glasses to see other people or other objects, if it is purely the need of the physical, then He will accept material objects, for the physical body and the material world must go together, just as the spiritual and the material must go together. The physical is His and the material world is also His. Therefore, He has to abide by the laws of the material world, the physical world. In the inner plane He does not have to use glasses because He uses His third eye. His third eye pierces the length of the past, present and future all at once. It covers the past, present and future at His sweet Will. Therefore, it is not necessary for Him to wear glasses for His third eye. His third eye is all Vision, all-pervading Vision.</p>  </div>
