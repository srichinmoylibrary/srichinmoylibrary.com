<p>Right beside me was another man who was also coming from Japan, like me. He had a small Japanese umbrella. On the top it was tied with something plastic that looked like a snake.</p>
<p>The customs man said, "This is something dangerous."</p>
<p>The man said, "It is only an umbrella," but the customs officer would not believe him. Then the customs man spoke to another officer, who was a little bit superior. He was an inspector.</p>
<p>The inspector said, "They are dangerous things." He asked the man to follow him into a room off to the side. Meanwhile the accused man was shouting and insulting the inspector in Tamil. This happened in Delhi, which is Hindi-speaking.</p>
<p>It took them practically ten minutes to finish their examination of his umbrella. In the meantime, I was sitting in the lounge, waiting for the final boarding call.</p>
<p>When he came out, he said, "Look at these idiots!"</p>
<p>I said, "My flute became a gun and your umbrella became such a dangerous weapon."</p>
