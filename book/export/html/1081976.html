<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no significance. It is just that their hour may be the same. Suppose a great Avatar and another Master were born at the same moment. The astrologer may pay much attention to this. But if you inquire when this Avatar was born, you will see how many millions of cats were born at the same hour. So what does this signify? The Avatar and this other teacher who dies at the same time do not have any direct link. It is just that both their hours have come.</p>
<p>In the Cosmic Game, if two people are very spiritual, then their existence on earth together may have some significance. But if ordinary people, who are great in their own field, appear on the world scene at the same time, we cannot connect them with the spiritual Masters.</p>  </div>
