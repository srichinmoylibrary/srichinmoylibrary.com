<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When that happens it is not the body, but the physical mind that is speaking. Even if you sleep for twenty hours, the physical mind will say, "I am tired, I am tired." Finally, when you do get up, that same physical mind will tell you, "Now it is too late to meditate. The time is past."</p>  </div>
