<p>Another incident happened during this third lecture. At one point I chanted Aum. As usual, I was chanting in my own way. At the end of the meeting, instead of asking me a question, a lady stood up and said that my way of chanting Aum was absolutely wrong. She had learned the correct way from Sanskrit scholars.</p>
<p>I said, “Here is the proof that I am not a scholar! Definitely mine is wrong.” Then, twenty minutes later, she asked me to chant it again and again so that she could learn it my way.</p>
<p>Such funny, funny incidents happened in Minneapolis, right from the very first night. But I liked the place. It became our second or third centre. I am offering Ida Patterson my heart’s most soulful affection and love.</p>  </div>
