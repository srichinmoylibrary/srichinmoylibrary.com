<p>Now I had completed my two miles and I was wondering, "Shall I go back the same way and make it four miles or shall I continue walking in the same direction and go to Hillside?" Then I remembered that if I went to Hillside, I would have to climb up 150th Street, so I started going back.</p>
<p>Right in front of the courthouse, I saw a little girl. She was three or four years old. She was wearing white. She said to me, "Sir, would you like to have a piece of candy?" Such a sweet, little girl!</p>
<p>Then her brother came. He was a little older than his sister. He said to me, "No, you have to give me a dollar." I did not feel like giving a dollar to the boy for the piece of candy, so I walked away. Then I heard somebody running behind me. I turned around and saw that it was the little girl. She said, "I want to give you the candy free."</p>
<p>Immediately I put my hand inside my pocket and took out three one dollar bills. Quickly I gave them to her. Then her brother came. I gave him a dollar. I was holding the candy in my hand. I said to her, "Will you make me happy? Please take it. I am on a strict diet."</p>
<p>She said, "I do not want money from you. I want to give it to you for free." Her name was Eva. She was so nice.</p>
