<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each religion has its own ideals. All religious ideals cannot be of the same type and the same standard. Also, the meditation cannot be of the same height and the same standard in every religion. So the result will depend on the type of meditation and the height of the ideal of the particular religion. If the ideal is high and, at the same time, if the meditation is very soulful, then the result will be extraordinary.</p>  </div>
