<p><em>Sri Chinmoy came to New York on 13 April 1964. From June that year until June 1967, he worked as a Junior Consular Assistant in the Passport and Visa Section of the Indian Consulate General in New York City.</em></p>
<p><em>Although almost three decades have now passed by, Sri Chinmoy has often enchanted his disciples with his extremely sweet and vivid memories of those years. He recently said, “In those days I was poverty-stricken, but my heart was full of joy. In those days I used to play in the hope-garden; my heart of hope was blossoming.”</em></p>
<p><em>This volume presents some of Sri Chinmoy’s recollections about his colleagues, friends, early apartments and subway experiences.</em></p>  </div>
