<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are really heavy beyond necessity, your consciousness carries a heavy load. Lethargy enters into you most powerfully. When you lose unnecessary weight, excessive weight, your outer capacity increases and your inner beauty comes forward and grows in the physical.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>Politics and spirituality: can they go together?</em>, Agni Press, 1977<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/plsp-31</p></small>    </div>  </body>
