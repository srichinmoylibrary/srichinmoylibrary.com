<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How can you do it? Through more sincere aspiration. Every time you say to yourself, “Don’t do this!” just don’t do it. And when you say, “Do this!” then do it, no matter how hard it is. Suppose an individual is weak in the vital world; let us say that individual is emotionally weak. So he has to pay more attention on the vital plane than on any other plane. If someone is very insecure, that person should say, “No, why should I have that feeling of insecurity? Let me have the feeling of security.” And how can he or she maintain the feeling of security? Through loving oneness. So always try to stand on the other side, the positive side.</p>
<p>If you have any weakness, try to stand on the other side. If you have jealousy, then try to feel friendship and oneness. In that way only you can do it. See the other side, which is the positive side. Then you can do it.</p>
<p>Our difficulty is that we think more of others than of ourselves — not of their dedication but of their achievements. We always think that they have achieved something grand. No matter what we have achieved, even if it is infinitely superior to others’ achievements, we see our own achievement as useless, useless. Others’ achievements are far better, we feel. So all the time we are seeing and thinking of others — others’ achievements, others’ capacities. But your capacity as an individual is what I will be pleased with when I am dealing with you. I will not be pleased with borrowed capacity, and I will not be pleased if you think of others’ capacity. I will be satisfied only with your capacity as an individual.</p>  </div>
