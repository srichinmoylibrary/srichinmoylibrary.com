<p><em>Introduction</em></p>
<p>I read the Gita. Because it is the Eye of God. I sing the Gita. Because it is the Life of God. I live the Gita. Because it is the Soul of God.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Arjuna is the ascending human soul. Krishna is the descending divine Soul. Finally they meet. The human soul says to the divine Soul, “I need you.” The divine Soul says to the human soul, need you, too. “I need you for my self-manifestation. You need me for your self-realisation.” Arjuna says, “O, Krishna, you are mine, absolutely mine.” Krishna says, “O, Arjuna, no mine, no thine. We are the Oneness complete, within, without.”</p>
<div></div>
<p>The inspiration of Hinduism is the Soul-Concern of the Gita. The aspiration of Hinduism is the Blessing-Dawn of the Gita. The emancipation of Hinduism is the Compassion-Light of the Gita. To pronounce that the Gita is the sole monopoly of Hinduism is absurdity on the face of it. The Gita is the common property of humanity.</p>  </div>
