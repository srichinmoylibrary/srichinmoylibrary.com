<p>Twenty-seven thousand<br /> Aspiration-plants:<br /> Indeed, the distance is too long.<br /> But my Beloved Lord Supreme<br /> Says to me,<br /> "My child, the distance is too short.<br /> In top secrecy I am telling you:<br /> I shall walk with you<br /> All the way."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185638" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2</h1>
  
 

<p>Every day my entire being<br /> Receives a blessingful Boon<br /> From my Lord Supreme,<br /> And that boon is<br /> A beauty-flooded dawn of joy.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185639" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3</h1>
  
 

<p>Choice is my unnecessary imperfection<br /> In my desire-life.<br /> Choice is my indispensable perfection<br /> In my aspiration-life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185640" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4</h1>
  
 

<p>I am a chosen instrument<br /> Of my Lord Supreme<br /> Not because I have done<br /> Something great for Him,<br /> Not because I shall do<br /> Something good for Him,<br /> But because He wants to do<br /> Something divinely great<br /> And supremely good<br /> In and through me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185641" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5</h1>
  
 

<p>I shall become a purity-prayer<br /> So that my heart<br /> Can safely climb up to God.</p>
<p>I shall become a luminosity-meditation<br /> So that God's Delight<br /> Can easily enter into me.</p>

<p>Since God has not given up<br /> His Vision-Transcendence-Dance,<br /> How can you give up<br /> Your God-manifestation-song?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185643" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7</h1>
  
 

<p>You are useless!<br /> Therefore you do not fight<br /> Against ignorance the intruder.</p>
<p>You are stupid!<br /> Therefore you do not want<br /> God the Lover to fight for you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185644" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8</h1>
  
 

<p>A soulful cry, where is it?<br /> Inside my heart.<br /> A powerful smile, where is it?<br /> Inside my soul.<br /> A bountiful blessing, where is it?<br /> Inside my life.<br /> And where am I, myself?<br /> Inside God's unknowable Vision-Eye.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185645" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9</h1>
  
 

<p>If you and your mind are afraid<br /> Of a silence-life,<br /> That means you are nowhere near<br /> God's Transcendental Throne.</p>

<div id="node-1185646" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10</h1>
  
 

<p>Yesterday<br /> My mind was fond of<br /> God's Greatness.</p>
<p>Today<br /> My heart is fond of<br /> God's Goodness.</p>
<p>Tomorrow<br /> My life shall be fond of<br /> God's Oneness.</p>

<p>My Lord, how can I be pleased with You<br /> When You do not give me<br /> What I want?<br /> "My child, I cannot be cruel to you.<br /> You want from Me<br /> The bondage of the finite.<br /> I want to give you and I shall give you<br /> Only the freedom of the Infinite."</p>

<p>O Inspiration-Runner,<br /> I love your running.<br /> It is so beautiful.</p>
<p>O Aspiration-Climber,<br /> I love your climbing.<br /> It is so soulful.</p>
<p>O Realisation-Diver,<br /> I love your diving.<br /> It is so powerful.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">13</h1>
  
 

<p>In the morning<br /> My Lord gives me<br /> A powerful concentration-arrow.</p>
<p>In the evening<br /> My Lord gives me<br /> A beautiful meditation-bow.</p>
<p>At night<br /> My Lord asks me to kill<br /> My ferocious ignorance-tiger.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185650" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14</h1>
  
 

<p>My mind's brooding doubt-sea<br /> Versus<br /> My Lord's ever-illumining Patience-Sun:<br /> Who can unmistakably<br /> Predict the result?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185651" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15</h1>
  
 

<p>God and His Infinity's Power<br /> My mind wants.<br /> God and His Immortality's Love<br /> My heart needs.</p>

<div id="node-1185652" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Do unlearn quickly!<br /> O my heart,<br /> Do learn soulfully!<br /> O my soul,<br /> Where are you hiding<br /> Sleeplessly and calmly?<br /> O my God,<br /> I am here!<br /> I need You only,<br /> Desperately!</p>

<div id="node-1185653" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17</h1>
  
 

<p>The Vision-Eye<br /> Of my Beloved Supreme<br /> Thinks of me.</p>
<p>The Compassion-Heart<br /> Of my Beloved Supreme<br /> Loves me.</p>
<p>The Forgiveness-Life<br /> Of my Beloved Supreme<br /> Immortalises me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185654" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18</h1>
  
 

<p>My prayer-cry is making my heart<br /> Beautiful and soulful.<br /> My meditation-smile is making my life<br /> Powerful and fruitful.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185655" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19</h1>
  
 

<p>My Beloved Supreme never reminds me<br /> Of my tiny ant-promises.<br /> Alas, why do I remind Him every day<br /> Of His mighty Lion-Promises?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185656" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20</h1>
  
 

<p>O my stupid mind,<br /> Do not dare to challenge<br /> My heart's sleepless<br /> And breathless faith<br /> In my Lord Supreme.<br /> Also, do not dare to challenge<br /> My soul's birthless<br /> And deathless oneness<br /> With my Lord Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185657" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">21</h1>
  
 

<p>During my morning God-Hour meditation,<br /> My Beloved Supreme said to me:<br /> "My child, your heart-ecstasy's<br /> Fountain-Source<br /> Is not a secret treasure<br /> But always a sacred,<br /> Supremely sacred, treasure."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185658" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">22</h1>
  
 

<p>When I am inside my mind,<br /> I am a helpless sigh<br /> Of utter failure.</p>
<p>When I am inside my heart,<br /> I am a mounting flame<br /> Of divine love.</p>
<p>When I am inside my soul,<br /> I am a translucent smile<br /> Of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185659" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23</h1>
  
 

<p>Yesterday my success-life<br /> Made me godless.<br /> Today my progress-heart<br /> Has made the world speechless.<br /> Something more,<br /> My Beloved Supreme now tells me<br /> That my life has become totally flawless.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185660" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24</h1>
  
 

<p>You have blindfolded your vision-eye<br /> Completely.<br /> Yet when, out of His boundless Bounty,<br /> God comes to your rescue,<br /> You blindly refuse to accept<br /> His unconditional Help.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185661" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25</h1>
  
 

<p>I call it life.<br /> My soul calls it beauty's temple.<br /> I call it death.<br /> My soul calls it purity's shrine.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185662" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">26</h1>
  
 

<p>You are a chosen child of God,<br /> Yet you envy.<br /> Whom do you envy?<br /> You envy your own totally forgotten<br /> And astonishingly unrecognised<br /> Boundless oneness-self.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185663" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">27</h1>
  
 

<p>In my life's battlefield,<br /> At long last my world-division-mind<br /> Has unconditionally surrendered<br /> To my God-oneness-heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185664" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">28</h1>
  
 

<p>If you do not become<br /> A conscious God-lover,<br /> Then you will always remain<br /> A stranger to your own<br /> Absolute vision-heights.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185665" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">29</h1>
  
 

<p>Do you know that I am<br /> A very special member<br /> Of God's immediate family?<br /> Do you know that at every moment<br /> I am being guided, moulded,<br /> Perfected and liberated<br /> By God's fondest instrument-child:<br /> Compassion?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185666" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">30</h1>
  
 

<p>What is my human mind<br /> If not a life of sheer nothingness?<br /> What is my human heart<br /> If not a life of fragile littleness?<br /> What is my divine soul<br /> If not a life of supernal newness?<br /> Who is my Supreme Lord<br /> If not the Life of Universal Oneness<br /> And Transcendental Fulness?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185667" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">31</h1>
  
 

<p>The God-lover who prays<br /> With a sincere mind,<br /> Meditates with a soulful heart<br /> And serves with an unconditional life<br /> Is a hero-warrior<br /> Of God-Immortality's infinite Delight<br /> Who is journeying home.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185668" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">32</h1>
  
 

<p>You know that it takes time<br /> For the mind to become<br /> Sincerely spiritual.<br /> How is it that you are unwilling<br /> To give your life the needed time<br /> To become perfectly perfect?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185669" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">33</h1>
  
 

<p>Right from the day I was born<br /> I have been maintaining a very strict diet<br /> Of God's very special food:<br /> His Eternity's Compassion<br /> And<br /> His Immortality's Love.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185670" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">34</h1>
  
 

<p>Secretly you enjoy climbing<br /> The staircase of despair.<br /> Openly you enjoy gathering<br /> Your life's incapacity-sighs.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185671" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">35</h1>
  
 

<p>My prayer wants to conceal<br /> The impurity of my unnatural sound-life.<br /> My meditation wants to reveal<br /> The beauty of my Lord's<br /> Natural Silence-Life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185672" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">36</h1>
  
 

<p>Your aspiration tells you<br /> That God you can have.<br /> Your dedication tells you<br /> That God you already have.<br /> Your realisation tells you<br /> That God you always have been.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185673" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">37</h1>
  
 

<p>My constant happiness entirely depends<br /> On the quality of my gratitude-heart<br /> And on the quality of my surrender-life<br /> To the Will of my Inner Pilot.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185674" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">38</h1>
  
 

<p>Nothing is as eternally beautiful<br /> As my life's surrender-dance.<br /> Nothing is as infinitely fruitful<br /> As my heart's gratitude-song.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185675" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">39</h1>
  
 

<p>I deeply admire<br /> Your three astonishingly<br /> Sincere confessions:<br /> You have not prayed to God<br /> Even once in your entire life<br /> Unconditionally.<br /> You speak ill of God the creation<br /> Secretly.<br /> You serve God and help man<br /> Quite unwillingly.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185676" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">40</h1>
  
 

<p>You do not want to live for others.<br /> That is fine with me.<br /> You do not want to live with others.<br /> That is fine with me.<br /> You do not want to live for me.<br /> That is fine with me.<br /> You do not want to live with me.<br /> That is fine with me.<br /> But if you do not want to live<br /> For God's full Manifestation on earth,<br /> I shall never be pleased with you.<br /> And if you do not want to live with<br /> God the Lover and God the Beloved,<br /> I shall not only be displeased with you,<br /> But I shall never forgive you,<br /> Never!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185677" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">41</h1>
  
 

<p>O my heart,<br /> Can you not become<br /> A climbing sun?</p>
<p>O my life,<br /> Can you not become<br /> An expanding sky?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185678" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">42</h1>
  
 

<p>As a doubting mind<br /> Finds no comfort on earth,<br /> Even so a loving heart<br /> Finds no comfort in the grave.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185679" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">43</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> You are both<br /> The Creator and the creation.<br /> Why is it so difficult for me<br /> To thank You as the creation?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> Because of the capacity<br /> I have given you<br /> To serve My creation,<br /> You are thanking Me, the Creator.<br /> Because of the opportunity<br /> My creation has given you<br /> To serve Me,<br /> Can you not thank Me, the creation?"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185680" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">44</h1>
  
 

<p>You are not<br /> What others think you are.<br /> You are not<br /> What you claim to be.<br /> Others think of you<br /> As a useless human being.<br /> You claim to be<br /> A perfect human being.<br /> Now I shall tell you<br /> What you actually are.<br /> You are an eternal pilgrim<br /> Walking along the road of aspiration<br /> Toward the destined goal:<br /> Perfection.<br /> And your perfection is another name<br /> For God's complete Satisfaction.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185681" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">45</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord, every day I see those<br /> Who are creating so-called happiness<br /> Through self-deception.<br /> They think and feel<br /> That they are absolutely perfect.<br /> What can I do with them?<br /> What can I do for them?</p>
<p>"My child, you do not have to do<br /> Anything with them or for them.<br /> Just remain silent.<br /> Your silent indifference<br /> Will be the most severe punishment."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185682" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">46</h1>
  
 

<p>Only a mind<br /> That has learned a bitter lesson<br /> Realises what an extraordinary sacrifice<br /> The aspiring heart has already made for it<br /> And how many more sacrifices<br /> Are yet to follow.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185683" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">47</h1>
  
 

<p>A mind of wandering thoughts<br /> Will sooner or later have to face<br /> Life-devouring worries and anxieties.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185684" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">48</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord, do not tell me<br /> What Your Will is.<br /> Without knowing Your Will<br /> I shall try to fulfil it.<br /> Why?<br /> Because, my Lord,<br /> If I first learn Your Will<br /> And then execute it,<br /> Who knows,<br /> I may not be as happy.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185685" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">49</h1>
  
 

<p>My Master's race<br /> Has already begun,<br /> And I shall make<br /> The perfect choice:<br /> My heart shall be with him<br /> And my life shall be for him alone.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185686" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">50</h1>
  
 

<p>I may not be<br /> A great truth-seeker.<br /> I may not be<br /> A great God-lover.<br /> But not to tell the world<br /> About God's Compassion-Eye<br /> And Forgiveness-Heart<br /> Would be a destructive<br /> And unfortunate mistake.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185687" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">51</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord, do examine me.<br /> Do examine the extravagance<br /> Of my doubting mind.<br /> Do examine the sincerity<br /> Of my heart's climbing cry.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185688" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">52</h1>
  
 

<p>Your heart lives<br /> In a remote land<br /> Of hope.<br /> Your mind lives<br /> Inside a devastating flood<br /> Of fear.<br /> But yours is the soul<br /> That will never give up<br /> Until it has indisputably won<br /> The God-manifestation-race.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185689" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">53</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> This time I shall be<br /> A good seeker.<br /> I shall definitely<br /> Spare You the torment<br /> Of waiting for me any longer.</p>

<div id="node-1185690" class="section-2">

<p>Mind, my mind,<br /> Are you not ashamed<br /> Of walking every day<br /> Along the stupidity-street?</p>
<p>Heart, my heart,<br /> Are you not tired<br /> Of walking every day<br /> Along the insecurity-path?</p>
<p>Soul, my soul,<br /> I definitely know<br /> You will accompany me<br /> When I start walking consciously<br /> Along Eternity's Road.</p>

<p>To consume the poison<br /> Of your suspicion-mind,<br /> What you need<br /> Is a new inspiration-start<br /> And a new aspiration-journey.</p>

<div id="node-1185692" class="section-2">

<p>God is not ashamed<br /> Of what you say and do.<br /> Therefore,<br /> You do not have to be ashamed<br /> Of what you are.<br /> Just give God cheerfully<br /> As many chances as He needs<br /> To correct and perfect you.</p>

<p>The winter of my life's lethargy-night<br /> Is over.<br /> The spring of my soul's action-delight<br /> Has come.<br /> Now God has given me<br /> The capacity to reveal His Satisfaction<br /> Through my perfection-life.</p>

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> There was a time when I did many things<br /> To please myself.<br /> Now I am doing only one thing,<br /> Not for me but for You.<br /> I am watering my life's<br /> Gratitude-plant<br /> With my gratitude-tears.</p>

<p>My vital is so stupid<br /> That it thinks it does not need compassion<br /> Either from earth or from Heaven.</p>
<p>My body is so lethargic<br /> That it enjoys ignorance-sleep<br /> All the time.<br /> Therefore, it does not even know<br /> What compassion is.</p>
