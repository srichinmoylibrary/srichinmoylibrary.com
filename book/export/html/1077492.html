  <h1 class="book-heading">Character</h1>
  
 
<p>Among the fearless soldiers that fight for your victory in life, character has no equal.</p>
<p>Character is the colossal hope of human improvement within and without.</p>
<p>Character is blazing sunshine in the soulâ€™s abode, the body.</p>
<p>A perfect society is built upon mutual trust. Character is the source of that trust.</p>
<p>Character is just what we inwardly are and outwardly do.</p>
<p>The secret of inner success is constancy to our highest character.</p>
<p>A true aspirant is one who feels more and more cautious of the least ignorance and limitation in himself.</p>
<p>Character gives the key to open the most beautiful doors of life: Peace of Mind and Delight.</p>
<p>Self-discipline is the foundation of a moral human life on earth. Self-sacrifice will be the foundation of a supramoral life on earth.</p>  </div>
