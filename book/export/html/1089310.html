<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For the Supreme, there is no such thing as capital punishment. On the one hand, it is He who receives the punishment in and through His creations. He is infinitely kinder than any human being. On the other hand, it is always He who dispenses Justice-Light in particular cases, for there is no other way to bring about a better society. "As you sow, so you reap": the Supreme believes in this particular theory. If somebody has done something extremely bad, then he has to meet with the punishment which comes as a consequence of his actions. Cause and effect must go together.</p>  </div>
