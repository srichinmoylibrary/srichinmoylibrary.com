<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> During meditation, please try to feel that you are not the body, not the mind, but the soul. By all the time thinking of the mind, you are having problems. The mind is not listening to you. If you constantly are thinking of the mind, then you will never get rid of the mind; it will never leave you. But if you think of something that is not the mind, something that does not require the mind and, at the same time, has infinitely more illumining capacity than the mind, you will be able to go beyond the mind. And what is this thing that is infinitely higher and more powerful than the mind? It is the soul. So when you pray and meditate, please feel that you are not the body, you are not the mind, but you are the soul, which embodies boundless light. During your meditation, please try to consciously invoke the soul or feel that you have become the soul. Do not pay any attention to the mind, but pay all attention to the soul, which you eternally are.</p>  </div>
