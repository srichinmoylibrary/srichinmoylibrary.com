<p>Every month X makes me a special cake or pie, which I give out as prasad. But this month I was out of town, so she did not give me any.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, just as I was going out to run, I was thinking, "Just because I was not here, she did not give me prasad."</p>
<p>Then, when I came back, she and Y were waiting there in the car. This is called the soul's connection.</p>
