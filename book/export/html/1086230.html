<p>Tonight we shall have a performance. It will be a competition. Choose your partners wisely. Be merciless! If you think only of your friendship, then you will run into serious difficulty. Do not say, “I have to select my friend!” By selecting your friend as your teammate if you get no votes for your performance, then your friendship will be of no avail.</p>
<p>Please choose someone who is either of your own standard or of a higher standard. Friendship will not help you at this time. If you feel that you have to choose your friend, then you may be the loser. Keep your friendship inside your pocket, not in the competition.</p>
<p>At the Sri Aurobindo Ashram I saw what happened when people chose their teammates for friendship’s sake. In the tug-of-war you may select your friends, only to lose. As soon as the competition starts, you may be dragged away. That kind of friendship will prove to be nothing other than lack of wisdom.</p>
