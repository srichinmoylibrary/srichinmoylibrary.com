<h2>Question: Does the inner world affect the outer world?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. It is through the inner world that our outer world can be fulfilled As you sow within, so shall you reap without. If, early in the morning I offer to God one divine thought, one spiritual thought, I will see that during the day I receive the fruits of that divine thought. If I pray for, or meditate on, Divine Love, or Joy, or Peace, during the day I will enjoy the fruits of my prayer and meditation in the form of Love, or joy, or Peace or whatever I am crying for.</p>
<p>So, to come back to your question, the inner world can and must affect the outer world â€” for the better.</p>  </div>
