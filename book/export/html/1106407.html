  <h1 class="book-heading">My daily routine</h1>
  
 
<p>Last night I went to bed at ten minutes past three. I slept for a little and got up just before four o’clock. I took stretching exercises for an hour, then I did eight different machine exercises, all without using the video. I was taking lots of exercises. At five o’clock I used the video and started taking my main exercises.</p>
<p>Every day I select some songs to play. The Invocation is fixed and then I choose six or seven more. Then I had to call so many disciples all over the world.</p>
<p>So this is my routine work. That is why during the day I may sleep for a few minutes.</p>
