<p>Yesterday I had my dog problems again. At a certain place along my running route here in Tobago, if you run, they bark. If you walk, they bark. What can you do?</p>
<p>As soon as you come in sight, three or four dogs come from their houses. You have to walk as slowly as possible, pretending you are not even walking. Then they become frightened. Silence conquers sound; here is the proof. While you are running, they chase you. While you are walking, they bark at you. But when you stop walking, they also stop. This is the proof that our silence can conquer sound.</p>
