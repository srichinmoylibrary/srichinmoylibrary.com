  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: What is your view of Indian philosophy?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I studied a little philosophy in India, both Indian philosophy and Western philosophy. But, fortunately or unfortunately, I have completely forgotten both Eastern and Western philosophy. I do not feel that I am missing anything, because philosophy is all in the mind. Now the only philosophy I study is the philosophy of the heart. I only want to live in the heart. I feel that my heart-garden is in finitely more beautiful than my mind-jungle, so that is where I want to remain. The mind-life I tried to live, but it did not give me the satisfaction that I wanted or needed. Now I am getting real satisfaction from my heart-life, my life of aspiration.</p>  </div>
