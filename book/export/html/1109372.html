<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes seekers want to get some tangible thing or some tangible reality from the Master. On the inner plane they have felt their soul or grown into some reality. Inner food they have got while meditating with me, but it is not enough. They also feel the need of outer food. They want something on the outer plane which will convince their physical minds. They feel that the outer offering also has conscious power. So I give them blessingful prasad, sanctified food, which has been blessed by my inner Pilot, who is everybody's Inner Pilot. Outer nourishment they get when they come into physical contact with me. So, when they get both inner and outer nourishment, their satisfaction is complete.</p>  </div>
