<p>I have seen God's Smiles.<br /> To my sorrow,<br /> They are not as beautiful<br /> As God's Eyes.<br /> Truth to tell,<br /> His Eyes are infinitely more beautiful<br /> Than His Smiles.</p>
<p>I have devoured God's Eyes.<br /> To my sorrow,<br /> They are not as delicious,<br /> As nutritious,<br /> As illumining,<br /> And as fulfilling<br /> As God's Heart.<br /> His Heart was, is<br /> And will always remain<br /> Without a second.</p>
