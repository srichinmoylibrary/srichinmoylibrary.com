<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each uniform is an inspiration not only to the one who wears it but also to the one who sees it. Again, each uniform helps the rest of the world know where to look for a particular person or a particular thing. If you see someone wearing a policeman's uniform, you will run to him if you are being threatened. You will not go to him if you have physical ailments. If a professional man wears his uniform, he expedites his fulfilment of others' needs.</p>  </div>
