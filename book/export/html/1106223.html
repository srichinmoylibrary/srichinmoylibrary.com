<p>I have never seen any Briton with such a kind, sympathetic oneness-heart. I used to always say that the British are measured; each word they say is measured. But for Jim Smith there is no measurement. It is all immeasurable — a spontaneous flow right from the beginning.</p>
<p>Jim Smith’s concern for me and his constant encouragement are really something. Jim Smith and Bill Pearl — one from America and one from England — have offered me constant, constant encouragement and inspiration.</p>
<p>When I told Jim that I am now aiming at 1,300, he said, “No, no, not 1,300 — 1,500! 1,300 is not necessary. Now that you have gone beyond what the mind can comprehend in your weightlifting, you can do what the mind can’t even imagine!”</p>
<p>— 16 November 1986</p>  </div>
