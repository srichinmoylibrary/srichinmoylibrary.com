<p><em>Good evening, Master Chinmoy. It is marvellous to have you here with us again in Puerto Rico. I have been informing our audience that this is the seventh time, I believe, that you have come to Puerto Rico, and you are with the Aum Centre group here, orienting them in their spiritual progress. I would like to ask you a few questions if I may.</em></p>  </div>
