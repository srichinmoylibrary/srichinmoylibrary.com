  <h1 class="book-heading">A Brahmin In Bali</h1>
  
 
<p>I went into a shop in Bali. A young man who was working in the shop said to me, "Are you a Hindu? I am a Hindu."</p>
<p>I asked him, "What is your name?"</p>
<p>He said, "My name is Normand."</p>
<p>I said, "Normand is not a Hindu name."</p>
<p>He said, "You do not know? There are four castes, and I come from the Brahmin caste. So Brahmins can have the name Normand."</p>
<p>I said, "Although I am not a Brahmin, I know the Indian caste system well. I have read the scriptures and there is no such surname."</p>
