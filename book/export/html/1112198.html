<p>I am extremely grateful to and extremely proud of those who ran our half marathon this morning. You are really brave soldiers. It was so cold! I ran four miles and walked four miles. That was enough. Many years ago in Boston I had frostbite. My nose was seriously affected. So I was getting frightened that again I would have frostbite. You are all really brave! Ninety-five non-disciples came to run in this weather! I am so grateful to them.</p>
