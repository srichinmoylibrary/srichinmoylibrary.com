<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation, if it is real meditation, transcends all astral travelling. Real meditation means conscious oneness with the Absolute. When we have conscious oneness with the Absolute, we do not have to travel anywhere, because the Omnipresent and Omniscient are within us. The highest meditation will offer us the Omnipresence of God. And while we are in His Omnipresence, there is no necessity for astral travelling, for the entire universe is within us. That is what meditation can and does give us.</p>  </div>
