<p>Self-mastery comes not from exercising our mental will-power. Self-mastery comes from God-obedience. Self-mastery comes through constant and conscious self-giving to the Will of God. There can be no fulfilment of God on earth if we do not have self-mastery. But this self-mastery has to come from our God-obedience, God-dependence, God-surrender, God-willingness and God-fulfilment. We can never develop or acquire the power of self-mastery unless our goal is God-discovery. Self-mastery is the very, very first step and God-discovery is the very, very last step of our God-climbing ladder.</p>
