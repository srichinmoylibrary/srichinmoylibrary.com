<p>During one of the times that I went to London secretly, without telling the disciples that I was going, I went out running. Suddenly I heard someone call, "Guru!"</p>
<p>I said, "Who could that be?" Then I saw Shankara. I said, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>She said, "I am going to school."</p>
<p>Another time when I went there secretly, a car started following me while I was running. I started to get annoyed because the car was following me. I didn't know there were disciples inside. Finally, the driver came out and said, "Are you Guru?" It was Devashishu's parents, Kaivalya and Bhavani, who live in London. At that time they had just joined our path.</p>
