<p>Belief is a blessing, Einstein realised. This supreme blessing expedites man’s inward, onward and upward journey. Each individual believes in something in a unique way, and achieves something that is also unique. What is his achievement? A feeling of oneness.</p>
<p>On being asked if there is anything in which a person can believe, the supreme lover in Einstein offered this special message to the world at large: <em>“I believe in the brotherhood of man, the uniqueness of the individual.”</em> When asked to prove his belief, Einstein declared, <em>“The mind can proceed only so far upon what it knows and can prove. There comes a point where the mind takes a leap — call it intuition or what you will — and comes out upon a higher plane of knowledge, but never can prove how it got there. All great discoveries have involved such a leap.”</em></p>  </div>
