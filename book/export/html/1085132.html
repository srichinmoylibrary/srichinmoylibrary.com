<p>The Supreme and your soul are not going to please your body, vital, mind and heart with the hope that in return your body, vital, mind and heart will please your soul and the Supreme. If you have an iota of wisdom, then start threatening your idle body, aggressive vital, suspicious mind and insincere heart.</p>
<p>Just think for five minutes of what you were before you joined the spiritual path. Just think for ten minutes of what you have become on the spiritual path. Just think for an hour of what you will become in the future if you leave the spiritual path.</p>
<p>May this calamity-month be transformed into a prosperity-month for those who are doing extremely well and are trying most sincerely to please their Beloved Supreme in His own Way.</p>  </div>
