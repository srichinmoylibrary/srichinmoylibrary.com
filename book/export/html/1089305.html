<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If someone suffers misfortune and seeks compensation through the law, then he is undoubtedly doing the right thing. Whether this will interfere with the working of his future karma or his past karma is of no consequence. If someone has been a victim of injustice, then he has every right to take shelter in the force of law. Otherwise, he will always remain a victim of the undivine forces.</p>  </div>
