<p>Later that day I went back to the USAir terminal to give the elderly black lady a big scarf. She knows I am a big shot because she has seen my picture with Sudhahota. But this time I also took the blue book, which mentions all our different activities. I took Govinda as my assistant, along with Sagar and Databir.</p>
<p>When we arrived, the lady who had been so nice to me was busy. From her counter she kept running into the plane and back again. I was wondering when she would be free. When she finally was free, I gave her the scarf.</p>
<p>She said, "Oh, you shouldn't have done it!"</p>
<p>I said, "You were so kind to me. You found something very valuable to me."</p>
<p>Again she said, "But you should not have done it." She was very happy.</p>
<p>I had also brought gifts for the others who had helped me, but I felt miserable because I had not brought anything for the innocent Puerto Rican who got such a scolding. When I was leaving USAir, he happened to walk by, and he raised his broomstick. He did not know that we had found the notebooks. So I said to him, "Gracias, gracias!" Next time I go, I will give him something very nice.</p>
