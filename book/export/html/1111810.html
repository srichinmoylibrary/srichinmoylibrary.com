<p>At one point in today's run, there was an old man standing by the side of the street with his dog. I was running quite fast, but perhaps I had a tortured look on my face because of my injury. Anyway, when he saw me he said, "You don't look like a runner!"</p>
<p>I said, "You are right. I am not a runner."</p>
<p>God was speaking through that man. The man should have told me, "You should give up running and be a non-runner like me."</p>
