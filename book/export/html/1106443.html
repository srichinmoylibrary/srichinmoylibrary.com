<p>Now my bodyweight is 165 pounds. I know fat is not strength, but when I see my muscles bulging up, my mind sees it as strength. My stomach has become quite large, but as soon as I am standing under my 300-pound dumbbells, I feel my stomach is all strength, not weakness. Fat does not register there.</p>
<p>When I lifted up 200 pounds in each arm, I weighed 162 pounds. So I have gained only three pounds for 200 pounds more total weight.</p>
