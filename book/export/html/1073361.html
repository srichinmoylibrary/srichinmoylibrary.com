<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you see social injustice the best thing is to go deep within and ask the Inner Pilot if and how you should deal with the problem. You have to dive deep within and get the inner message about how to deal with that particular case. Otherwise, on the spur of the moment, your emotional vital or your intellectual mind may come to the fore and give you the wrong message, The really right thing you will know only when you have a free access to your soul. If your soul offers you the message, then you can take immediate action.</p>  </div>
