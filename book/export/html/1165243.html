<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you get a new soul, it is like having another friend stay at your house. But instead of inviting in a new soul, it is also possible to bring down the quality of another person into someone. If one person is lacking in a quality, you can borrow this quality from someone else.</p>  </div>
