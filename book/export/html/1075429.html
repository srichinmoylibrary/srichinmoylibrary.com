<p>What is real, Lord?<br /> "Daughter, your aspiration is real."<br /> What else is real?<br /> "My Compassion is real."</p>
<p>Lord, what are we supposed<br /> To do with my aspiration<br /> And Your Compassion?<br /> "Daughter, we are supposed<br /> To unite our possessions<br /> So that we can sing the song<br /> Of perfect Perfection<br /> Together."</p>
