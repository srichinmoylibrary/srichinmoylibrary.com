<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The intellect is very limited, but the soul is unlimited. For this reason an aspirant dives deep into the inmost recesses of his heart, where the soul abides, in order to discover the Truth. The Truth can be known only through the heart's aspiration. The attributes of God are Peace, Light, Bliss and Power. These attributes all exist in boundless measure in the heart of Eternity. Only the seeker of Truth who aspires to go beyond the domain of the intellect can enter into the Light, Peace, Bliss and Power of the highest Absolute. Not intellect but psychic aspiration is needed in order to know and realise the attributes of God.</p>
