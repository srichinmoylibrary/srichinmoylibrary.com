<p>My dear God, my dearer God, my dearest God,<br /> My sweet Lord, my sweeter Lord,<br /> My sweetest Lord,<br /> At my journey's start You blessed me<br /> Most compassionately and most affectionately<br /> With quite a few divine qualities.<br /> My life's God, my heart's Lord,<br /> In the future if once more I displease You,<br /> Then You may take away<br /> All the divine qualities<br /> Save and except one:<br /> Please, please, please keep with me<br /> My obedience-heart<br /> To breathe prayerfully, happily<br /> And gloriously<br /> In my mind, in my vital and in my body.<br /> My life's God, my heart's Lord,<br /> This morning my soul, that represents You<br /> Divinely, supremely and eternally,<br /> In soundless sound has told me<br /> That if I continue displeasing You,<br /> Either consciously or even unconsciously,<br /> Then mine will be the life<br /> Of utter failure-tears<br /> At the end of my journey's close.<br /> My life's God, my heart's Lord,<br /> May my outer life of dedication<br /> Become Your absolute Commander-Will-<br /> Obedience-perfection.<br /> May my inner heart of aspiration<br /> Become Your absolute Commander-Will-<br /> Obedience-satisfaction.</p>
