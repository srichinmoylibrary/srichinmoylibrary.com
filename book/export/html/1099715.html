<p>My maternal uncle was my father's greatest friend and admirer. He was so fond of our family. All our requests he used to fulfil. My father was also very fond of him.</p>
<p>One day my father's bank was robbed by my mother's nephew â€” her sister's son. My father and mother had brought this boy up, and when he robbed the bank my maternal uncle felt miserable. He felt miserable because the bank had been robbed by a close relative. He also thought that because our bank had been robbed, my father would become poor. My father said, "We have plenty of money in other banks and also property."</p>
<p>But my uncle eventually became insane because he had such affection for all the members of our family. He finally committed suicide by jumping under a train. My mother was thin and weak, but when she heard that her brother had died, it was such a shock that she practically turned a somersault in the air! That day such spirit entered into my mother. She had the energy of a three-year old. She cried so bitterly. They were so close to each other. What kind of suffering!</p>
<p>On the day my uncle died, my father went to the crematory hall. When everything was over, my father's eyes were flooded with tears.</p>
<p>When he was alive, my maternal uncle used to beg my father to give up smoking. My father would always do anything that my maternal uncle asked, but in this matter of smoking my father didn't listen. When my uncle died, my father was so sad. He said, "I could not fulfil your request while you were alive. But today I have to listen to you." On that day my father gave up smoking.</p>  </div>
