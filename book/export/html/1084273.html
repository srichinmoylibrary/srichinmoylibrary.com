<p>My imagination tells me<br /> That my God is far, very far.<br /> My inspiration tells me<br /> That although my God is very far,<br /> I shall be able to reach Him<br /> Someday, somewhere, somehow.<br /> My aspiration tells me<br /> That I shall ascend one step<br /> And God will descend ninety-nine steps,<br /> And then we shall be together<br /> And become one.<br /> My realisation tells me<br /> That I do not ascend<br /> and God does not descend.<br /> He just comes out of my dream-reality<br /> And<br /> I just come out of His Reality-dream.<br /> My revelation tells me<br /> That God and I together reveal<br /> Eternity's cry,<br /> Infinity's smile<br /> And<br /> Immortality's light.<br /> My manifestation tells me<br /> That we manifest only two things on earth:<br /> The promised land<br /> And<br /> A perfect life.</p>
