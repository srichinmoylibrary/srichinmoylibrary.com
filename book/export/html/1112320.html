<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Humanity will exist forever, but in a better way. We believe in the process of evolution. Previously our souls were in the stone life. Then we entered into the plant world, then the animal kingdom and finally into the human life. The day will come when we will enter into the divine life. At that time, humanity will have a better consciousness and a more illumining life.</p>
<p>A day may come in the process of evolution when human beings will be totally transformed. They will have so much light inside them that they will do many, many, many good things for God on earth. As far as we can see, God is not going to destroy or demolish this planet earth. Human beings are very weak, but God has a very special Affection and Love for human beings, and very special Blessings, Love and Fondness for this planet earth.</p>  </div>
