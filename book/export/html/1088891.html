<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> The person who has a hard time accepting the discipline, the person who finds it really difficult to give up smoking or drinking or sex life and yet still wants to meditate â€” is it hopeless for that person?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not hopeless at all, if the person is sincere. If he prays to God for His boundless Compassion, then God will give him the necessary capacity to discipline his life. He has only to pray to God for God's infinite Compassion. God's Compassion-Light will be able to illumine him, and his weaknesses and shortcomings will not be able to remain with him forever.</p>  </div>
