<p>The Divine in Mahatma was perfectly aware that it was Subhas Chandra's bottomless frustration, caused by Mahatma's followers — specially by Mahatma himself — that made Netaji resort to leaving India.</p>
<p>Netaji decided to fight against the British Government by forming an indomitable army outside the boundaries of India.</p>
<p>When Subhas made his sudden and startling disappearance, the B.B.C. — in order to demoralise his supporters — spread a rumour that he had died in a plane crash. No news was heard from him for over a year. Then Netaji began broadcasting to India from Germany.</p>
<p>It was Netaji who first called Gandhi-ji the Father of the Nation. In 1944 from his headquarters in Burma, Netaji broadcast a message to Gandhi-ji:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Father of our Nation! In this holy war for India's liberation, we ask for your blessings and good wishes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the end he looked upon Gandhi-ji as the Father of the Nation. He maintained his nobility-flooded demeanour towards the elders in spite of repeated arguments and frustrations.</p>  </div>
