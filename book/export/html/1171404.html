<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything has to have a heart because the soul remains inside the heart. Here is a wooden table. Inside it there is a soul, but the soul does not live directly inside the wood. Inside the wood there is a heart, and inside the heart the soul resides. Without the heart, the soul cannot breathe. The soul-consciousness can be everywhere, but the soul has to have a proper place to live, and that place is the heart.</p>  </div>
