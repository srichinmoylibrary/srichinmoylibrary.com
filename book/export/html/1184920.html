<p>Proclaim this perfect man<br /> Whom humanity has knocked down.<br /> He is rising,<br /> He will rise,<br /> He will forever rise.<br /> He has become the governor of his own life.<br /> His own power of prayer has made him<br /> The best instrument of his eternal<br /> Inner Pilot Supreme.</p>
