<p><em>(Surat Congress. The Moderates, the Nationalists, the Revolutionaries and the members of the different parties. Tilak, Lajpat Rai, Aurobindo, Rash Behari Ghosh, Surendranath Banerjee and many other leaders. A wild uproar arises over the Presidential election. At last they decide on their respective voting strength. Suren Banerjee, leader of the Moderate Party, stands up.)</em></p>
<p>SUREN BANERJEE: I propose Dr. Rash Behari Ghosh to the chair.</p>
<p>TILAK: <em>(Getting up)</em> I propose Lala Lajpat Rai to the chair.</p>
<p>THE MODERATES: <em>(Addressing Tilak)</em> Sit down, please sit down.</p>
<p>THE NATIONALISTS: How dare you, you fellows? One more shout at our Tilak Maharaj and you get the lesson of your life.</p>
<p>THE MODERATES: Don't yell. Your force is in your throat; ours in our arms.</p>
<p><em>(Chairs and tables are hurled about by the Moderates. The Nationalists, too, hit them back. Amid a greet uproar there starts an exchange of blows.)</em></p>
<p>TILAK: I declare the Congress closed.</p>
<p>THE MODERATES: Shut up, you deliberate breaker of the Congress.</p>
<p><em>(One could read on the self-composed face of Sri Aurobindo his poignant thought.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Alas, is this the India of my dream?</p>
<p><em>(The police come in to restore order. In silence Tilak, Aurobindo and some of the leaders leave the spot)</em></p>  </div>
