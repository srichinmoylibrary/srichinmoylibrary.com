<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spiritual reality is not bound by any reality. It is inside all the realities that we see, but it is not bound by any of them. It is like God. God is not bound by anything, but out of His infinite Compassion He is within you, within me, within her, within everybody. God is omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient; He is under no obligation to do anything for us. But, out of His infinite Bounty, at every moment He is working in and through us on our behalf. Spirituality is God's language; it is an inner language that we learn. Therefore, it is also unlimited, but it works in and through us for our joy and perfection.</p>  </div>
