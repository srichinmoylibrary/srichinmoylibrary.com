<p>Today at my 700-metre mark on 150th Street, two Puerto Rican boys drove by in an old red car. Their hands and heads were sticking out of the car. They were not in a good consciousness.</p>
<p>I was limping, so they shouted, "Look at this sick guy!" They were enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>Later, after I had crossed Main Street, again I saw the same car with the same boys. And the same message I got: "Look at this sick guy!"</p>
