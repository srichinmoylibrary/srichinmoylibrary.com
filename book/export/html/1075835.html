<p><em>(1940. An eminent Indian political leader and a well-known disciple of Sri Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>LEADER: What does your Guru say about the outcome of the War?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: He says the Allies will win and he is doing his best to see that they win.</p>
<p>LEADER: The Allies despite their series of reverses and their ineptitude? And, even if they win, won't their victory reinforce and perpetuate their imperialism?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: None knows the Allies, their ins and outs, more than Sri Aurobindo, and none has given the British Empire a greater shake-up than he.</p>
<p>LEADER: And yet he lends them his support? Indeed, it is a puzzle to me.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: No puzzle. He has given his crystal-clear and far-reaching reasons for his stand.</p>
<p>LEADER: Tell me, please.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: The Allies will stand for freedom and progress, whereas the axis-powers for world domination. And the axis-powers in the ascendant will throw the world back into serfdom. He has written, speaking for the Mother and himself:</p>
<p>"We feel that not only is this a battle waged in just self-defence and in defence of the nations threatened with the world-domination of Germany and the Nazi system of life, but that it is a defence of civilisation and its highest attained social, cultural and spiritual values and of the whole future of humanity. To this cause our support and sympathy will be unswerving whatever may happen; we look forward to the victory of Britain and, as the eventual result, an era of peace and union among the nations and a better and more secure world-order.</p>
<p>LEADER: Those who know Sri Aurobindo well may share his view but the multitude ...</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: <em>(Interrupting)</em> The Seer and the multitude ... When did they ever see eye to eye?</p>  </div>
