    <title>Question: When I first began meditating at three o’clock in the morning, I used to have very good meditations and I was very inspired. But after a few days, I didn’t have the same inspiration and it became very difficult.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we start something for the first time, we get inspiration. Anything that is new gives us tremendous inspiration, just because it is something new. But if we continue doing it we do not have the same enthusiasm, the same impetus, the same inspiration. We want to get something very deep, very high and very sublime, something most illumining from our early morning meditation. We are like a long distance runner. When the starter fires the gun, at the very beginning he is really inspired and he starts running very fast. But after about two or three miles, he becomes very tired: running becomes tedious and difficult. Now if he gives up running just because he is tired and because his inspiration is gone, he does not reach the goal. But if he continues running he will finally reach the goal. Then he will definitely feel that it was worth the struggle and suffering of the body.</p>
<p>It is like that in the spiritual life also. When you start your journey at three o’clock in the morning, feel that tomorrow is the continuation of that journey. Do not take it as a new beginning. And on the third day, feel that you have travelled another mile. Every day feel that you have travelled another mile. The day you start your spiritual journey is actually the most important. At that time you will have the most inspiration. But if you can feel that each morning during your meditation you are travelling a little farther, you will know that one day you will reach your Goal. Even if your speed decreases, you have to continue running and not give up on the way. When you reach the Goal you will see that it was worth the struggle. So every day when you meditate, it will help you if you think that it is a continuation of your previous day’s meditation. By taking one step at a time you reach the Goal.</p>  </div>
