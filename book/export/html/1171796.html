<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this world, we see others through our own eyes. If I have something, then I see the same thing in others. If I have jealousy, meanness, fear, doubt and other things, I see in others also the same thing. In your case, you have cuteness. Therefore you see cuteness in me, as if you are standing in front of a mirror. The disciple and the Master are always the same â€” one indivisible consciousness, one and inseparable.</p>  </div>
