<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can keep your mind pure by feeling constantly that you do not have a mind at all; you have only the flower-heart of a child. If somebody asks you, "What is in your mind?" you will say simply, "I don't have the mind. I have only the heart of a child." You don't have to keep your mind pure if you don't have a mind. In that way you can solve your problem immediately.</p>  </div>
