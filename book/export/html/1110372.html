    <title>Question: Sometimes when I stand next to certain people I feel a great warmth and energy exchange, a merging of hearts, as it seems, and a certain degree of excitement. Is this something that I should be cautious of or something that I should throw myself into, or should I just let it happen as it will happen?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The expansion of the heart is very good, very necessary. But we have to know that sometimes what we are expanding is our lower vital instead of our heart. When you have this experience that you are describing, please be very conscious. Expansion of the heart, the psychic heart, the pure heart, is very good. But very often the impure vital comes to the fore instead.</p>  </div>
