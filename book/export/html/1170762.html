<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em>: Nobody wants somebody else to go beyond him. The Puranas are flooded with stories of Parvati's jealousy and insecurity. She is a cosmic goddess; people worship her. But every second Parvati is dying for more beauty or cursing someone! Look at her human aspect! Again, we pray to Parvati for our illumination, for our liberation, for everything.</p>  </div>
