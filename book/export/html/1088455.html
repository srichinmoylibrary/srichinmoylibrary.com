<h2>The Vedic Seers</h2>

<p>The Vedic seers saw the Truth with their souls, in their Heavenly visions and in their earthly actions.</p>
<p><em>Satyam eva jayate nanritam</em></p>
<p>"Truth alone triumphs, not falsehood." This Truth teaches us how to be true brothers of mankind, conscious and devoted lovers of God and perfect masters of nature.</p>
<p>Each Vedic seer is a poet and a prophet. In the case of an ordinary poet, his poems are quite often based upon imagination. In the case of the Vedic poets, it was intuition that gave birth to their poems. This intuition is the direct knowledge of Truth.</p>  </div>
