<p><em>Bholanath: One time Guru lost a tooth. It was a lateral tooth in his upper jaw. I was training to be a dental technician, so I said that I would try to make him a new tooth if we could get an impression. I took Guru to a dentist to get an impression, but this dentist did not want to do it. According to him our procedure was not strictly correct. Anyway, I took Guru to the apartment of another friend of mine who made the impression, and then I set about making the tooth. I had never made a tooth before and quite a few people helped me and gave advice. Eventually Guru was fitted with this tooth.</em></p>  </div>
