<p>I wore my pilot’s costume again to lift the jet. These clothes are cute and they give me joy, but I do not get immediate strength from them the way I do when I wear my regular pants and top. When I wear these pilot’s trousers, I feel they are so weak, almost feminine. They are not adding to my strength at all. As a matter of fact, I feel I am giving strength to them. And when I put on the shirt, the colour is weak, everything is weak. When I use my natural clothes, I get so much strength. My regular clothes blend with my body.</p>
