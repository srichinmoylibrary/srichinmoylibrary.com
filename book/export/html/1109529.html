<blockquote>
<p>"Rome was not built in a day."</p>
<p>Virgil</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Rome was not built in a day.</em><br /> I have been telling this all along<br /> To my impatient son,<br /> Impatience.</p>
<p><em>Rome was not built in a day.</em><br /> I have been telling this constantly<br /> To my despondent daughter,<br /> Despondency.</p>
<p><em>Rome was not built in a day.</em><br /> I have been telling this year after year<br /> To my doubting friend,<br /> Doubt.</p>
<p><em>Rome was not built in a day.</em><br /> I have been telling this tirelessly<br /> To my mocking enemy,<br /> Mockery.</p>
