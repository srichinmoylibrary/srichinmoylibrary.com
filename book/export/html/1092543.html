<blockquote>
<p>"What is it: is man only a blunder of God, or God only a blunder of man?"</p>
<p>— Nietzsche</p>
</blockquote>
<p>s</p>
<p>We know that neither man nor God is in fault. Voltaire helps us to assert the existence of God in a unique manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The world embarrasses me, and I cannot dream That this watch exists and has no watchmaker."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How lucidly true is it when Tagore says: "It is a mere tautology to say that God is unknowable, when we leave altogether out of account the person who can and does know Him. It is the same thing as saying that food is uneatable when the eater is absent. Our dry moralists also play the same tricks with us in order to wean our hearts away from their desired objects." <em> — Personality</em></p>  </div>
