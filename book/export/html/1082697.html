<p>A few days later, Nag Mahashay came back alone. Sri Ramakrishna asked Nag Mahashay to fan him because it was a hot day. Nag Mahashay was so thrilled that the Master had asked him to perform this service. Then Sri Ramakrishna asked Nag Mahashay what he did for a living. Nag Mahashay explained that he had studied to be a doctor, but he had to give it up owing to financial problems. He then studied and got his degree in homeopathy, which is less expensive.</p>  </div>
