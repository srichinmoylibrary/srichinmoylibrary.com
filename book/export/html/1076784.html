<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, they do act differently; that is to say, they act divinely when they function with the light of the soul. With different eyes they see the truth, with different hearts they feel the truth. Always they function differently in the sense that they are tinged with Godâ€™s Light. Their act of seeing and feeling is done through the play of energy. This energy is totally different from the usual physical energy. That is why we call it spiritual energy or cosmic energy. Cosmic energy is totally different from physical energy. When we draw in cosmic energy even for four or five minutes, we can overcome the need for rest or sleep most effectively. It is also the cosmic energy that quenches our inner thirst for Truth and Light most adequately.</p>  </div>
