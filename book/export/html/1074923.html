<p>Mother's Day is great<br />        Because<br /> At least once a year<br /> Children allow their minds<br /> To think of their mother's heart<br />        And<br /> Allow their hearts to house<br /> And treasure their mother.</p>
<p>Father's Day is great<br />        Because<br /> At least once a year<br /> Each father tells his children<br /> That he really wants to equal the<br /> Heavenly Father in Compassion and Concern.</p>
