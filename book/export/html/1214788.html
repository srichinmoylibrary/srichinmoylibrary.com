<p>Four are the most special gifts that humanity received from U Thant’s colossal soul: concern-sun, sympathy-sea, dedication-realisation and compassion-perfection.</p>
<p>Unlike U Thant, we wrap ourselves in the cocoons of self-concern, self-sympathy, self-dedication and self-compassion.</p>
<p>U Thant’s soul knew that he was of all. U Thant’s heart felt that he was for all.</p>  </div>
