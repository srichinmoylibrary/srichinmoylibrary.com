<p>I watch before I pray. I watch and see if there are undivine thoughts trying to assail my mind. Needless to say, I do not surrender to these undivine thoughts.</p>
<p>I watch before I pray. I watch and see if there are divine thoughts trying to inspire my heart. Needless to say, I welcome these thoughts with my open mind, open heart and open arms.</p>
<p>I pray, and then I watch. I watch and see if the jealous world is trying to rob me of the peace, light and bliss that I have acquired from my prayer. Needless to say, my conscious awareness prevents the jealous world from robbing me.</p>
<p>I pray, and then I watch. I watch and see if there are sincere seekers who would like to have the peace, light and bliss that I have acquired from my prayer. Needless to say, to them I immediately offer my peace, light and bliss devotedly, soulfully and unreservedly.</p>
<p>God watches me pray. Through my prayer He expects me to change for the better: to have a better consciousness, a better aspiration and a better realisation.</p>
<p>God watches me pray. Through my prayer He expects me to become a more soulful instrument of His, Him to serve unconditionally in His own Way.</p>
<p>God watches me pray. Through my prayer He wants me to become an unconditional seeker, an unconditional server and an unconditional lover.</p>
<p>Before God created this world, He watched and measured the ascendance of His Silence-Height. Now that God has created the world, He watches and measures the excellence of His Sound-Might.</p>
<p>I pray, I watch, I accept and, finally, I embrace the Feet of my Beloved Supreme with my heart’s purity. God meditates, accepts and, finally, embraces my heart with his constant Self-giving Reality and Self-giving Divinity. </p>
