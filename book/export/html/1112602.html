<p>After the movie I presented Zatopek with the book I had written about him. It seems that Zatopek does not like to read anything. Perhaps he thinks it is a waste of time. I do not blame him. His wife reads on his behalf. He turns the pages, but he doesn't read. But his wife reads everything carefully. She will read my book and tell him about it. He liked very much the songs and also the movie we made for him.</p>  </div>
