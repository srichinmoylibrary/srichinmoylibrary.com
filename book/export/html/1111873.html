<p>It was so cold this morning while I was running that I saw almost nobody outside. Only two men greeted me. One said, "Good morning." The other said, "Hi!"</p>
<p>I was dying from the cold. Databir told me to take thick gloves, but I took thin ones. Then I had to put my hands in front of my chest to keep my fingers warm. I haven't run for a few days because I have been afraid of the cold. That means that today I was a brave man.</p>
