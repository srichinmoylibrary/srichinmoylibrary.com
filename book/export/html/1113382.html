<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When sweetness is lacking, politeness should be encouraged. When politeness is lacking, sincere self-expression is to be encouraged. In order to acquire sweetness, one can mix with children for a few minutes a day. No matter how restless a child is, his spontaneous sweetness is bound to come to the fore. The seeker doesn't have to talk to the child. Just by observing the spontaneous quality of the child, which is sweetness, one can acquire sweetness.</p>
<p>Sweetness is of great importance in the spiritual life. So try to mix with children. When you mix with children, automatically your own childlike heart comes forward. A childlike heart embodies many divine qualities, and the quality of sweetness is foremost.</p>  </div>
