<p>President Premadasa has always been a great peacemaker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Premadasa and I first met 38 years ago because of our common interest in Singhalese poetry. I had criticised a poet, and the poet got really annoyed. Premadasa thought that the best thing he could do was to bring the two of us together and make us friends."</p>
<p>His Excellency Ananda Guruge</p>
<p>Ambassador to UNESCO and to France from Sri Lanka</p>
