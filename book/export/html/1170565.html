<p>Inside my Art-life<br /> There are two great art-lovers:<br /> The ancient art-lover and<br /> The modern art-lover.<br /> Once they had a very serious quarrel.<br /> Each one wanted to declare <br /> His supremacy.<br /> I was dumbfounded. <br /> Finally, I told them:<br /> "As far as I am concerned,<br /> I do not care to know<br /> Who is superior and<br /> Who is inferior.<br /> I am only concerned with<br /> That art-lover inside me<br /> Who is teaching me<br /> The supreme Art â€”<br /> The Art of unconditional surrender<br /> To God's Will<br /> In all my activities."</p>
