<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right! What we have to conquer is our ignorance. By conquering others only the ego gets joy. The world does not need another Hiroshima or Nagasaki; it has got that experience. Now if you go to these places you see monuments to peace. Wisdom has dawned. Once upon a time we thought that destruction would bring joy. Now we see that joy comes only from peace, which is founded on the feeling of oneness and the realisation that we belong to one world-family. If you care for peace, you have to care for oneness. Oneness cannot be taken away from peace. They are like the obverse and reverse of the same coin.</p>  </div>
