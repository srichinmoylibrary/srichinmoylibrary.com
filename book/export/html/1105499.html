<p>Inside the elevator<br /> the cashier of the hotel and I<br /> were stuck on the seventh floor.<br /> Both of us were generous enough<br /> to exchange smiles.</p>
<p>"Mr. Ghose, how old are you?" he asked.</p>
<p>"My human father says I am<br /> thirty-eight years old.<br /> My Divine Father says I am<br /> older than Heaven and Earth combined."</p>
<p>"Who is your human father?<br /> Who is your Divine Father?"</p>
<p>"My human father is aspiration.<br /> My Divine Father is realisation.</p>
<p>My cashier friend continued:<br /> "What is realisation? What is aspiration?"</p>
<p>"Realisation is my room<br /> on the tenth floor.<br /> Aspiration is the Chinese restaurant<br /> in the basement."</p>
<p>My hotel friend<br /> became my aspiration and<br /> realised my realisation.</p>
<p>Lo, the elevator did not want<br /> to lag behind.<br /> It displayed its proud velocity:<br /> its soul-ascending<br /> and<br /> soul-descending<br /> capacity!</p>
