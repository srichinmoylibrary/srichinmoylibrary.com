<p>Death, here on earth we have telephones.<br /> Do you have telephones in your country?<br /> "Yes, we do."</p>
<p>I am so delighted to hear that.<br /> Now, do you make long-distance calls<br /> As we do from America to Russia?<br /> "Yes, we do.<br /> At every moment<br /> My assistants make thousands<br /> Of long-distance calls<br /> On my behalf."</p>
<p>Thousands of calls?<br /> Good gracious!<br /> To whom do they make so many<br /> Long-distance calls?<br /> "They speak to Heaven and hell on the phone.<br /> At every moment,<br /> Thousands of human souls<br /> We have to dispatch<br /> Either to Heaven or to hell.<br /> We inform Heaven and hell first<br /> Before we send them new members.<br /> We throw those members down,<br /> Who are meant for hell,<br /> And we push those members up,<br /> Who are meant for Heaven."</p>
