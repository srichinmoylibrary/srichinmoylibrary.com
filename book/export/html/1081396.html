<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one thing beautiful about the mind: eventually it does come to realise that light is necessary, that the feeling of oneness is necessary, and at that time it recognises and confesses its countless mistakes. This realisation, recognition and confession are themselves a true form of inner beauty.</p>  </div>
