<p>I am grateful to the world because it has given me the opportunity to serve the Supreme. I am grateful to the world because it has given me the opportunity to invoke my Supreme and offer Him to the world at large. I am grateful to the world because it has given me the opportunity to make it feel that God is the only Life, the only Reality, which is humanity's eternal choice and which will eventually become humanity's divinised, perfected and immortalised voice for the Supreme. I am grateful to the world, not because the world has given me what it has — aspiration — but because the world has accepted me as I am. Nothing more, nothing less than what I am, the world expects from me.</p>  </div>
