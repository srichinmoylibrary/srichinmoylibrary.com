<p>Sona desperately tries to talk to me in an absolutely human way! In Sonaâ€™s case, human incarnation is granted.</p>
<p>Now, does Kanu want a human incarnation? Kanu has come from the planet worlds, from Neptune. Look how peaceful Kanu is. When Kanu starts crying, he cries in a particular key, in intervals, as though he were playing a musical instrument.</p>
