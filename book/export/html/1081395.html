<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. According to one's inner achievement one appreciates the outer beauty. Again, he who has realised the Highest has a different way of appreciating beauty. He sees the past, present and future at a glance and he determines the value of beauty according to the soul's already achieved reality.</p>  </div>
