<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Suffering usually comes because of our previous actions. But sometimes we get suffering from the undivine forces around us. We are not responsible for this suffering. The world is still imperfect, the world is full of ignorance, and sometimes we are victims to these forces. So we can't say that all suffering is because of our own actions. Again, sometimes we unconsciously identify ourselves with others' sufferings. In the case of spiritual Masters, they consciously identify with mankind and then they suffer. From humanity they get inner arrows that try to kill their peace, light and bliss. But they cannot separate themselves from humanity and they consciously become part and parcel of humanity. In the case of ordinary individuals, unconsciously they share others' sufferings.</p>  </div>
