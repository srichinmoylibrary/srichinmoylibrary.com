    <title>Guru Chinmoy, you were speaking about the vision without the mind. Is this what is known as intuition? Or is intuition something else?</title>

<p>You may call it either intuition or the direct perception of Truth, which needs no mental help. It is knowledge without thought or mental form. It is direct and spontaneous. It makes you feel what it is. Normally, you see something and then you give it a mental form, saying "This is what it is." But intuition simply makes you feel its true existence at once. Intuition houses the depth of Vision and the wealth of Realisation all together.</p>  </div>
