<p><em>(Manicktolla Garden. The revolutionaries are engaged in a twofold activity: attending classes on the Gita, and preparing bombs and practising the use of firearms. Barin is their leader. Attired in ochre clothes like a regular Sannyasin, Upen explains the Gita to them. It is no camouflage. They are as serious in their study of the Gita as in their revolutionary work.)</em></p>
<p>BARIN: Nolini, will you please go to Sejda's place to bring him here? He has said to me me that he will come here to see our activities.</p>
<p>NOLINI: <em>(Pride and delight brighten up his face.)</em> I, I to bring him?</p>
<p>BARIN: Yes, you go. You know, he is at the residence of Raja Subodh Chandra Mullick.</p>
<p>NOLINI: Yes, Barinda, I'm off.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Nolini)</em></p>
<p>BARIN: <em>(Turning to the revolutionaries)</em> So, Sejda is coming to-day. I hope he will be pleased with our revolutionary activities.</p>
<p>REVOLUTIONARIES: We hope so. Even if otherwise, we shall have his directions and guidance. Besides, his presence will be our inspiration.</p>  </div>
