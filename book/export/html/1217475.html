<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The power that can be found in a smile varies. If you are talking about the divine power in a divine smile, it is something most significant. The smile itself is a power. Like a fresh flower, petal by petal this power can blossom inside the seeker. During this year of newness <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, this divine power can easily create newness inside the seeker if newness is not already there. If the seeker has been attacked by negative, unhealthy, uncomely forces, the divine power in a divine smile can immediately cancel these forces. In a twinkling it can also take away the suffering of the seeker who has been suffering for months, even years, provided the seeker sincerely wants a new light, a new heart and a new way to make fast progress.</p>
