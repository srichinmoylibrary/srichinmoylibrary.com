<p>In his childhood<br /> He slept.<br /> Therefore<br /> He does not sleep now.</p>
<p>In his childhood<br /> He smiled.<br /> Therefore<br /> He does not smile now.</p>
<p>In his childhood<br /> He saw<br /> The face of darkness.<br /> Therefore<br /> He now sees the face of Light.</p>
<p>In his childhood<br /> He played<br /> With ignorance and its brood.<br /> Therefore<br /> He now plays with God and His children.</p>
