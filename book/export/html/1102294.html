<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The United Nations is like a garden that has many beautiful plants, fragrant flowers and trees with most delicious fruits. If there is a most beautiful garden in my yard, even if I do not own it, still I will treasure it. I will feel that the flowers and trees are like my own children and that their beauty and fragrance are increasing my own divine qualities.</p>
<p>The United Nations is a most beautiful garden that is inside the heart of New York. The good qualities of this garden will eventually come to the fore. And once these divine qualities come to the fore, New York will definitely get the benefit.</p>
