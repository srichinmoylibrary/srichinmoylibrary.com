    <title>Question: What if your child is very active and his energy is taking away from your energy? You really can’t speak to him, because he doesn’t understand, so what do you do to try to calm his vibrations?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Play some spiritual music. If your child is very active, making noise and so on, he will see music as a friend, as somebody to talk to. When he hears spiritual music, you will see that he is playing with the music. He will feel that he has a friend just beside him, a friend that is as dynamic as he is. So, when the two friends are playing together, then the mother can go into some other room to pray and meditate. Music is the best thing.</p>  </div>
