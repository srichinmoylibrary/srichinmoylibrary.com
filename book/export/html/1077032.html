<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you have a dream of exhilarating flying, you have to know that that dream has actually taken place in the vital world â€” not the lower vital but the higher vital plane, where our vital actually flies. We do not fly on the mental plane or any other plane, but only on the vital. When we become part and parcel of that vital plane, we do fly. And when you become a Yogi, then if you fly in the vital plane, you become aware that it is your vital being that is flying and you can convince your physical mind of this. Otherwise, you may think your flying is a coincidence or a mere stroke of fate or luck. But when you realise God, you feel that your own capacity, your own light, is enabling you to fly.</p>  </div>
