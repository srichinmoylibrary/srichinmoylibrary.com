<p>"Chinmoy, here is a telegram for our Pagla (mad) Sudhir-da." (Sudhir Sarkar, who was Nolini-da's lifelong intimate friend, was all love and admiration for his Nolini.)</p>
<p>I took the telegram to Sudhir-da. As he read it, tears of joy flowed from his eyes. He embraced me and showed me the telegram: "Arrived safely. Pray for Mother's blessings, Bhai."</p>  </div>
