<p>Today before I lifted 320 pounds, double my body weight, I knew immediately that something special was going to happen. I said to myself, “Today I am going to make history.” Then, while I was holding up the weight, inwardly and outwardly I was feeling that this was an historical achievement, a new creation in my life.</p>
