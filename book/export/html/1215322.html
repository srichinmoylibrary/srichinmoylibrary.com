<p>From time to time I go to Queensboro College to walk. I have two 'disciples' there. They are elderly Japanese ladies. They observed me for a few days walking on my toes and then walking backwards. Now they have started doing the same thing. They also walk forward and backwards on their toes. They have become my perfect disciples!</p>
<p>The one that is much older is a hunchback. She tries to imitate the younger one. The younger one can walk backwards ten metres or so. Then she starts jogging backwards. The old one tried to do the same, but she stayed in the same spot. She was jogging, but she was not going anywhere.</p>
