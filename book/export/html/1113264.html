<p>"Nolini-da, in the <em>Puna Daily News</em> there is an article severely criticising X. and his ashram."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I have heard all about it. Don't read that type of thing. It only lowers your consciousness, that's all. Now go to the I dispensary and get some ointment for my leg."</p>
<p>Immediately I went to the dispensary and got his ointment. After I gave it to him he said: "Chinmoy, <em>Janata</em> needs an article from me. Can you get me an article from my old file? Ranju will mail it to them as soon as you find it. They need it for the Puja issue, so try to get it as soon as possible. Durga Puja is approaching fast."</p>  </div>
