<h2>Question: What is your message for Guatemala?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yesterday I was so fortunate to receive blessings from the Archbishop of Guatemala. He was telling me that this is a most significant period. Now people are coming out of suffering into a new life. They are accepting a new life. It is most inspiring and most encouraging for me to be here at this time.</p>
<p>My prayerful message to the heart, to the soul and to the life of Guatemala is very simple: after suffering, there is always joy and love and happiness. The suffering has ended. Now a new life, a new joy and a new bliss will enter into the heart of Guatemala.</p>
