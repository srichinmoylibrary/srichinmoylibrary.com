<p>We know that there is something which we call God. We know that there is something which we call the soul. In his immortal essay entitled "Circles," the great American philosopher Emerson writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"St. Augustine described the nature of God as a circle whose centre was everywhere and its circumference nowhere."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can definitely say that this centre is man's soul.</p>  </div>
