<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>“No mind, no form, I only exist; Now ceased all will and thought. The final end of Nature’s dance, I am it whom I have sought.</p>
<p>I barter nothing with time and deeds; My cosmic play is done.”</p>
<p>— from <em>The Absolute</em> by Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>When one’s cosmic play is done, he enters into <em>nirvana</em>. If one is a tired soul and wants to go permanently beyond the conflict, beyond the capacities of the cosmic forces, then <em>nirvana</em> is to be welcomed. <em>Nirvana</em> is the cessation of all earthly activities, the extinction of desires, suffering, bondage, limitation and death. In this state one goes beyond the conception of time and space. This world, earth, is the playground for the dance of the cosmic forces. But when one enters into <em>nirvana</em>, the cosmic forces yield to the ultimate highest Truth, and the Knower, the Known and the Knowledge or Wisdom are like three angels blended into one. At that time one becomes both the Knower and the Known.</p>
<p>If one does not have the experience of <em>nirvana</em>, he usually cannot know what illusion is. According to some spiritual teachers, the world is <em>maya</em>, an illusion. When one enters into <em>nirvana</em>, he realises what illusion is. <em>Nirvana</em> is the static oneness with God. There, everything comes to an end in the static Bliss. This Bliss is unimaginable, unfathomable, indescribable. Beyond <em>nirvana</em> is the state of absolute oneness. This oneness is the dynamic oneness with God.</p>
<p><em>Nirvana</em> is a very, very, very high state. However, it is not the highest state for the divine worker. If one wants to serve God here on earth, then he has to come back into the world again and again to serve the Supreme in humanity. If one wants to manifest the Supreme in the field of creation, then he has to work in the absolute dynamism of the Supreme, and not take rest in <em>nirvana</em>. This does not mean that the divine worker cannot have the experience of <em>nirvana</em>. The experience of <em>nirvana</em> is at the command of all God-realised souls. But permanent <em>nirvana</em> is for those who want to be satisfied with the static aspect of the supreme Brahman. If one wants to embody both the static and dynamic aspects of the Supreme, then I wish to say that one should go beyond <em>nirvana</em> and enter into the field of manifestation.</p>  </div>
