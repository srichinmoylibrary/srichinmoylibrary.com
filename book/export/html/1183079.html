<p>She ran a church and had quite a few disciples. Once she invited the Master to come and give a talk to the disciples. But then she saw that if her disciples met the Master, they would all leave her. So she asked the Master to bless her privately and she told her disciples that the Master was sick and had cancelled the meeting.</p>
