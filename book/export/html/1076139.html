<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, from there they wonâ€™t take any kind of human shape or anything, and they are not going to be transformed. Only there they remain. The Universal Consciousness is very vast, infinite; so easily they can remain there. Again, one day, the things in this Universal Consciousness also have to be transformed. Because we care for the perfection of the entire universe, they have to be transformed. But right now we are concentrating on the transformation only of the people who are aspiring consciously.</p>  </div>
