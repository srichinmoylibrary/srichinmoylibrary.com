<p>After the Foliage Run I went into a bakery to buy prasad for all my helpers. The shopkeeper had a good soul. I asked her to put four pastries in one box and six in another. She said, "Yes, I will do it. I am pretty good in counting."</p>
<p>I said, "Only last week when I was in Woodstock a lady gave me less than what I had paid for."</p>
<p>The shopkeeper laughed and laughed. Then she gave me seventy-six cents change. I gave it back to her and said, "This is for you."</p>
<p>She said, "This is awfully kind of you. I have been working here for five years, and I have never gotten any tips. You are such a nice man."</p>
