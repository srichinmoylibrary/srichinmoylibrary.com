<p>As you know, my weightlifting has attracted a few critics. When I was trying for my God-realisation, it was only between God and myself. But now that I am trying for God-manifestation, there are some critics.</p>
<p>Ramakrishna told Vivekananda a story about an elephant walking to the market. All around it dogs were barking, but the elephant looked neither to the right nor to the left. It just went straight ahead to the goal.</p>
<p>I was a lion in my last animal incarnation. Bill Pearl was also a lion. So we are two lions who are able to roar. The dogs can bark because the lions are quiet. But if the lions should start to roar, then the dogs will disappear immediately.</p>
