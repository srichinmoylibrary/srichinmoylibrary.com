<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When one is dogmatic one uses his earthbound mind or his demanding vital in order to convince others that this is the truth incontestable and unalterable. But when one is divine, he sees that what he believes is true and what others believe may also be true. He accepts the fact that each has to believe in his own experience and realisation. What he feels is right for him; he does not try to force upon others who may feel that their belief is equally right. He feels that his faith in his own beliefs is like staying in his own room for his own safety. He does not say to others, "Either you have to stay in <em>my</em> room or you will be devoured by the tiger." He says, "You are right and I am right, but I wish to remain in my own consciousness. I am not condemning your realisation, but I wish to live by my own realisation. "</p>  </div>
