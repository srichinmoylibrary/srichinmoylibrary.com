<p>Yesterday when I was running, a little girl called me an idiot. She was in a car. She put her hand out of the window and said, "You are an idiot!"</p>
<p>I said, "Thank you, thank you!"</p>
<p>Her mother, who was driving, felt sorry, She said, "Sorry, sorry, Mr. Sri." Perhaps the little girl saw me as an old man dying of exhaustion, so she was saying, "You are an idiot. Why do you have to run?"</p>
