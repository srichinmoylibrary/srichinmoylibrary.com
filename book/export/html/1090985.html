<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are not in meditation, you will see that each thought or idea is composed of words. You are having an idea, and if you enter into the idea you will see that you are formulating the idea with words â€” words inside your mind or outside your mind. One, two, three, four words come and form a sentence, and there you have an idea. But during meditation, if the meditation is deep, you do not need words in order to form an idea. In deep meditation the idea comes in a flash. Words will not convey it. The idea will come in the form of Light, or Light will bring an idea right in front of your vision. You will see immediately the incident or the truth that you want to envision in your life.</p>  </div>
