<p>My Beloved Lord Supreme, my Beloved Lord Supreme, will I ever be able to become a perfect instrument of Yours?</p>
<p>"My child, you will without fail become not only a perfect instrument of Mine but a supremely perfect instrument of Mine at My choice Hour. How can My own Divinity's transcendental Vision in you, with you and for you fail? No, My Vision is bound to succeed, My child.</p>
<p>"But you can do one thing every day devotedly and soulfully. You can repeat hundreds of times daily, 'My Lord, You are my mind-sincerity's All, You are my heart-purity's All, You are my life-duty's All.' This will expedite our joint victory."</p>
