<p>Sweetest Father, Lord Supreme,<br /> What was wrong with You on Saturday?</p>
<p>"On Saturday<br /> Mother Earth phoned Me<br /> Early in the morning<br /> And insulted Me ruthlessly.<br /> She has come to learn of My secret plans,<br /> And to My sorrow She has dispensed<br /> With My job here on earth.</p>
<p>"Sweetest children, this is Sunday.<br /> Today I have come to see you all<br /> For the last time,<br /> And to offer you<br /> My Compassion-Sea, My Concern-Sky,<br /> My Love-Moon and My Blessing-Sun."</p>
