<p>People who are in the body-world are so generous! Although, as a bodybuilder and weightlifter, I am a newcomer, there are bodybuilders who have been practising for 30 or 40 years who say such nice things about me. I have just given a drop, but the ocean is appreciating the drop like anything. Look at the way this world is receiving!</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have written hundreds of books, composed thousands of songs and painted thousands of paintings, but those worlds have not received me the way the bodybuilders and weightlifters have. Such big hearts they have! They could have been jealous. They could have said, “This fellow is an upstart. He has only just started. What is he doing?” They could have belittled my achievements. But Mr. Universe, Mr. Olympia, the British Registrar of Records — all have said such kind and encouraging things.</p>
