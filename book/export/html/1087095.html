<p>Once I was running in Florida in the early morning when I saw a store that advertised "All T-shirts $2.99." They even mentioned some very good brands. But the store was not yet open.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I went there again to run. This time the store was open. I said to myself, "Let me buy quite a few T-shirts for $2.99." Then I thought, "I have to run. Why take so many T-shirts? I will buy one now and send Savyasachi back for more later."</p>
<p>I gave the saleslady $5.00 and stood waiting for my change. She was looking at me like I was an idiot.</p>
<p>I said, "It is $2.99."</p>
<p>She said, "No, that is a very old sign."</p>
<p>As I was going out, I saw some old men looking at the sign-$2.99.I did not have the heart to tell them that the sign was false.</p>
<p>I was so disgusted that I ran home very fast!</p>
