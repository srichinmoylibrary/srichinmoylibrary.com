<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, try to remain near the tree, then try to remain always at the foot of the tree and not at a distance. Once you are at the foot of the tree, try to look up and see how far your vision can go. If I see that you are really trying to heighten your vision, then Grace will descend from the Supreme, who is your Guru, my Guru, everybody's Guru. This Grace is like a magnet; but, the magnet will operate only when it sees that you are anxious to be pulled by it. So, if you go to the foot of the tree and then look up towards the top of the tree, the Grace-magnet will come and pull you up. This is the only way a disciple can reach the height of the Master. Grace will only descend after you have made your own contribution by coming and touching the foot of the aspiration-tree.</p>  </div>
