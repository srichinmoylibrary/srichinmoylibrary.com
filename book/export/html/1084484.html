<p>  You say<br /> He has a sharpened mind.<br />  I say<br /> He has a darkened mind.<br /> Perhaps we both are right.  You say<br /> His heart is all love for humanity.<br />  I say<br /> His heart is all love for Divinity.<br /> Perhaps we both are right.  You say<br /> His soul is of God.<br />  I say<br /> His soul is for God.<br /> This time no "perhaps";<br /> We both are unmistakably right.</p>
