<p>I had with me a silly Indian camera. The first person who escorted me to give the prizes took my camera and gave it to one of his friends.</p>
<p>Later, my friend from Thailand came up to me and said, "Let us have our picture taken together." A photographer who was there took our picture.</p>
<p>My friend said, "Can we have our pictures developed?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am ready to pay, but I don't want to go to the photograpber."</p>
<p>So he went to get the photograpber, and brought him over to me. I asked, "How much do you want to print the pictures for us?"</p>
<p>The photographer said, "Ten rupees."</p>
<p>I said, "I will be leaving tomorrow morning. If I give you 200 rupees, will you bring my copies to the hotel by 9:30? Then I will leave some for my friend."</p>
<p>The photographer agreed. But the next morning, 9:30 came and went, and finally it was twelve o'clock and I had to leave. So I had to write a note for my friend, who was staying at another hotel, telling him that the photographer never came.</p>
<p>I said, "What am I going to do? He didn't care for 200 rupees."</p>
