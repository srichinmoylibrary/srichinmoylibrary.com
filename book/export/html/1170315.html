<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My hands have a function and my legs also have a function. But my legs will not tell my hands, “Come, let us change our respective jobs.” It is not necessary. My hands are satisfied and my legs are satisfied. When it is time for my hands to work, they work; and when it is time for my legs to work, they also work. But both hands and legs are part and parcel of the same reality, the body. When the disciples merge into the Master’s consciousness, they become inseparably one with the Master’s existence. The disciples are the limbs and the Master is the body; each needs the other. In this way the Master and the disciples go together.</p>  </div>
