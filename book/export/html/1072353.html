<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Who created us? Since God created us, will He not take care of us? If you have a dog, it is your bounded responsibility to take care of the dog. So, like that, God is the Creator and we are His creation. We are helpless. If the Creator does not take care of His creation, then how can we live on earth, how can we survive?</p>  </div>
