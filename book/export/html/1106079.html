<p>My Lord, my Lord, my Lord Supreme,<br /> I think of You.<br /> You do not think of me.<br /> Alas, why?<br /> My Lord, I look at You.<br /> You do not look at me.<br /> Alas, why?<br /> My Lord, I come to You.<br /> You do not come to me.<br /> Alas, why?<br /> "My child, I, too, think of you.<br /> I, too, look at you.<br /> I, too, come to you.<br /> My child, when I think of you,<br /> You are not inside your mind.<br /> When I look at you,<br /> You are not inside your eyes.<br /> When I come to you,<br /> You are not inside your heart-home.<br /> My child, if you want to know<br /> When I think of you,<br /> Then keep your mind empty of thoughts.<br /> If you want to see Me<br /> While I am looking at you,<br /> Then keep your eyes pure, absolutely pure.<br /> If you want to see Me<br /> While I am coming to your heart-home,<br /> Then keep your heart-home-door wide open<br /> Only for Me.</p>
