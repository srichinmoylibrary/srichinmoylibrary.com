<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you feel that a particular person is standing in your way, refer the situation to me. I will deal with that person inwardly. I will see if he or she can receive my light. If I deal with that person outwardly, he or she may reject my advice. But when I act inwardly, that person may be able to receive my illumination and he will even think that it is coming from himself. He will believe that he has made a new discovery, and that he is the discoverer. But it is actually I who have inspired him and offered him this inner understanding.</p>
<p>If advice comes to him from a third party, such as yourself, immediately jealousy will start. If it comes from me, he will accept it. But if it comes from within, he will feel himself to be a real discoverer. If I cannot inwardly convince a person, then I may speak to him outwardly. But normally I will be misunderstood. This is why I prefer to deal inwardly.</p>  </div>
