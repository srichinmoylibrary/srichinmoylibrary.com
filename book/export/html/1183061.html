<p>When her husband ran away with her best friend, she felt miserable. She felt that it was all the Master’s fault. Why did the Master allow her husband to be so undivine? The Master sympathised with her and assured her that she would get a better husband if she stayed with the path.</p>
<p>She said to the Master, “If I stay on your path, I won’t be able to take any revenge. I want to marry a fool to prove to my husband that I don’t give any importance to scholarly life. Let him stay with his head-factory. I shall stay with my heart-garden.”</p>
<p>So she left.</p>  </div>
