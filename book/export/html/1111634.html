<p>The second-best marathoner in the world now is our great friend, Robert de Castella. Yesterday he ran the famous Fukuoka Marathon in two hours, eight minutes and eighteen seconds — only five seconds behind Alberto Salazar's world record.</p>
<p>While his wife was away in Canberra, he had to cook for himself. So he consulted our Sri Chinmoy Cookbook." He liked the recipe he used very much. So the world's second-best marathon champion eats our food. His father also likes us very much and reads my books.</p>
