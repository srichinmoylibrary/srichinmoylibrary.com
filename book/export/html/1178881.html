<p>My Beloved Supreme lovingly<br /> And compassionately whispers,<br /> "My child, are you Mine,<br /> Are you only Mine,<br /> Or are you for ignorance-night as well?"<br /> The human in me tells my Lord Supreme,<br /> "O Lord, give me some time<br /> To think it over and decide."<br /> The divine in me immediately responds,<br /> "My Beloved Supreme, I am for You,<br /> Only for You.<br /> Throughout Your own Eternity<br /> I shall be for You, for You alone.<br /> Do mould me, shape me and guide me<br /> To fulfil Yourself in and through me<br /> In Your own Way."</p>
