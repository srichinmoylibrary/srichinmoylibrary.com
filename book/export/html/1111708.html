<p>Last night a little after twelve-thirty I went running. After five and a half miles or so, when I was on my way back, I saw a car that was making absolutely unthinkable, unbearable noises. Luckily, I was on the other side of the street, so I was quite safe. Then that same car went ahead, made a U-turn and came to my side. It was still making such noise! So I jumped onto the sidewalk, and continued running quite peacefully.</p>
<p>Suddenly the car stopped right alongside of me. It was a red car with a black hood. Two young girls were inside. One of them said, "Excuse me, excuse me, are you Sri Chinmoy? Are you Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>She said, "We are so happy to see you. We saw you on television two days ago." They were so excited to see me at that hour. So I thanked them.</p>
<p>They were very, very nice girls, but what were they doing in that car at that hour?</p>
