<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, I did not discover this philosophy. It was discovered by our Vedic seers four thousand years ago. Our most important books are the Vedas. Nobody can claim that he founded this philosophy. And philosophy in its Sanskrit concept means the direct vision of God, the vision of Truth, of unity in all. Each individual has his own personality, his own illumination. With this illumination the person tries to supply the proper method to be followed by his disciples. So I have my own way of working with my disciples, spiritually, inwardly and with my writings about spirituality.</p>  </div>
