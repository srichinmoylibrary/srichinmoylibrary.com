<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The teacher can always offer her heart to her students provided she feels that she is not just teaching ignorant students. She has to feel that what she is actually doing is pleasing her beloved Supreme and serving her beloved Supreme in His own way by serving the students.</p>  </div>
