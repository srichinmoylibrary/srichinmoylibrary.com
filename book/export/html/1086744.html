<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is up in the sky and He is also on earth. Why is God up in the sky? This is your question. It is the books we read about God, especially in the Western world, and your parents who have taught you that God is up in the sky. I wish to say that God is up in the sky, but He is also here on earth. If you read the inner book inside your heart, then you will see that God is also on earth. He is not only in the Heavens. Since you are on earth, I tell you that although He is all-pervading, the God-consciousness on earth is infinitely more important for you than God who is in the sky, in Heaven.</p>  </div>
