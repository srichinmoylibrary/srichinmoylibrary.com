<p>Savyasachi and I went to a sports store in Florida. Right at the counter were some 15-pound dumbbells. The man said they cost $36.</p>
<p>I asked, "Don't you have 25 pounds?"</p>
<p>The man said, "I don't now, but tomorrow I will be able to get them." He said they would cost $56.</p>
<p>The next day we did not go, but the day after that we went to see if they had gotten the 25-pound dumbbells. The man who had previously waited on me was not there. Another man came and said, "I will see if we have 25 pounds in stock." When he brought them, we asked the price. The man said, "It is $36 for 25 pounds." We thought it was a mistake.</p>
<p>Then the other man came and said, "No, $56!" Then they had a serious argument. The nice man said, "I will take the responsibility." Luckily he was in charge, so we paid only $36 for the 25-pound dumbbells.</p>
