<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As a sincere seeker you must know that your music has to please the Supreme, who is our eternal Guru. You are quite young. You have to play music that brings inspiration to the heart and not excitement to the vital. You must not play music that will only arouse excitement in the vital. When you play any particular piece, you have to feel whether it is the right music for your own spiritual progress and inner growth. Play only music that inspires you, that comes from the very depth of your heart and illumines your consciousness.</p>
<p>You have to know that each seeker-musician has a golden opportunity to please the Supreme with his music. Whenever you play any music, you have to know whether or not that music is going to please the Supreme. If it pleases you and you feel it will please Him, then play it. If you feel it does not please Him, then never play it. Playing lower vital music to get appreciation from the public can never please the Supreme. If an ordinary person who has not launched into the spiritual path plays that kind of music, he is doing the right thing according to his own standard. But if a seeker plays that kind of music, he cannot make any progress.</p>
<p>A sincere seeker who has already accepted a path of his own should play only spiritual music, psychic music, music that elevates his consciousness and the consciousness of others. When you play this kind of music, you will see that in each note God Himself is blossoming like a lotus, petal by petal. When you play divine music, please feel that God is unveiling His own inner music and fulfilling Himself in and through you.</p>  </div>
