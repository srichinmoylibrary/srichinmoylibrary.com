<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just for a second think of your past, what you were five years ago. Just have a vision, and see all the undivine things that you did because of your ignorance, What has changed your life in the last five years is your aspiration. You have given up many undivine things just because you had a little aspiration. If you had not had any aspiration, you would not have given up the life of ignorance.</p>
<p>How can you increase this aspiration? You have tried through your own personal effort, but still it does not increase. You can increase it only by constantly feeling that it is not yours, that it belongs to somebody else. It is inside you, true, but somebody else gave it to you, and that person was the Supreme. The thing that you are crying for, the thing that you want, the Supreme has in boundless measure. So if you want Him to give it to you, naturally you try to please Him.</p>
<p>There are quite a few ways you can please the Supreme, but there is one way which is most significant and which will give you the result sooner than any other way. When the father gives his child a nickel, if the child offers him an immediate smile of gratitude, immediately the father gives him a dime, or even a dollar. In your case, if you want to be consumed with burning aspiration, try to feel that you do have aspiration, the aspiration of one dollar, let us say, which you were given by your Eternal Father, the Supreme. Just because you have this aspiration, you show Him your utmost gratitude. At that moment He gives you ten, twenty, fifty dollars. You are not consumed with burning aspiration all the time, but just because you do have aspiration, you show gratitude to the Supreme. There are millions and billions of people on earth who do not have the aspiration that you have. They are wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance. If the Supreme has given you one dollar's worth of aspiration, he can also give you a million dollars' worth. So if you offer gratitude for what you already have, then your aspiration will increase and become constant.</p>  </div>
