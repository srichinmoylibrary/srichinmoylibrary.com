<p>The 24-Hour Pepsi-Cola Bicycle Marathon in Central Park was held over the Memorial Day weekend in May 1977. More than 9,000 cyclists entered. From the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team 135 cyclists participated.</p>
<p>Despite severe leg cramps, Sri Chinmoy reached a total of 175 miles. The Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team pedalled a total of 22,530 miles and won the prizes for the best riding team and for best uniform. The team had only begun practising two weeks earlier.</p>
<p>In the last half hour of the marathon, Sri Chinmoy led the entire team in a victory lap around the five-mile course. A photo of the victory lap appeared in The New York Times on Monday, May 30, 1977.</p>  </div>
