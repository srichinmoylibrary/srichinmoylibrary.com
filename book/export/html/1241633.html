<p>The day Sona left, around three-thirty in the morning, I stood behind him and touched him and blessed him. I said, “Now, Sona, you can go.”</p>
<p>His soul said to me, “No, I do not want to go, I do not want to go.”</p>
<p>I said, “You are suffering, suffering, suffering. I have kept you on earth. You have been so kind and compassionate to me.”</p>
<p>He said, “Then, all right. I will go with your blessings.”</p>
<p>I told him, “My blessings, love, gratitude and gratitude, and pride and pride will stay with you.”</p>
<p>Then, after leaving the body, again he was sad. He wanted to be on earth. I said, “Now you have left the body. If I wanted you on earth, I would not have allowed you to die. I wanted you to go, and you have left. With my blessings, joy and pride you have left.”</p>
