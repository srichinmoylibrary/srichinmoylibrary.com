  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Why is darkness impermanent and light permanent?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Light is permanent precisely because our Source is all Light. Since our Source is Light, we also have to grow into Light. We come from Light, in Light we grow and through Light we fulfil ourselves. God is the eternal Source and we are His children; eventually, we have to grow into His very Image. God-realisation, the flood of infinite Light, is our birthright.</p>
<p>Right now we are enveloped by darkness because we have been sleeping for a few years or a few incarnations. But a day will come when the infinite Light will dawn inside us and make us feel what we truly are. At that time our inner sun, which is infinitely brighter than the physical sun, will dispel our ignorance-night of millennia.</p>
<p>The more we go deep within, the easier it becomes for us to realise that there is something within us that is everlasting. If we can live in our inner existence, even for one minute a day, we will see and feel Light in abundant measure and feel the possibility of growing into the effulgence of Light. So let us try to go deep within and enter into this inner cosmic sun. There we shall see the infinite, permanent Light waiting for us and crying for us. It needs only our conscious approval and cooperation to come to the fore.</p>
<p>What is Light? Light is Delight and Delight means Nectar, the immortal Nectar. In one of our Upanishads it is said that all human beings come into the world from Delight. Again, Delight is Light, God the Light. Although at every moment we are growing in Delight, we do not see or feel Delight right now because we are living the surface life in the meshes of ignorance. But we shall continue to grow and, at the end of our journey's close, we shall again enter into the effulgence of Delight. "We came from Delight, we grow in Delight and, at the end of our journey's close, we shall retire into Delight."</p>
<p>This experience of Delight we get only when we meditate, for only then do we get inner peace or peace of mind. Delight is visible, palpable and tangible only when we have peace of mind. Unfortunately, the modern, intellectual, doubting and sophisticated mind does not care for Light and Delight. It cries for outer information or it cries to achieve the Truth in its own way. But even while achieving the Truth, it negates the Truth. The mind sees the Truth for five seconds and then, when it is about to achieve the Truth, it doubts the possibility and potentiality of Truth. Then who is the loser? It is the mind. But if we live in the heart or in the soul, which is within the heart, then we identify ourselves with the Truth and immediately become the Truth. At that time there is no doubt; there is only a flood of certainty.</p>
