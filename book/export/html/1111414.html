<p>In our Oregon race, a man in a wheelchair stood first. He defeated the first runner, a top-ranking runner, by sixty metres. I couldn't believe how fast the man in the wheelchair was going. Then Dayal told me it always happens like that.</p>
<p>The prizes were so cute. The winners got big pies, which were the same size as their medals. They had a special prize for me, which I wanted to give to the man who was in the wheelchair. When I went near him, he immediately started shedding tears. He was so moved that I was giving the prize to him.</p>
