<p>At the check-in counter in the Delhi airport, I was carrying two very small handbags. One of them was smaller than the smallest.</p>
<p>There was a very long line. When I finally got to the head of the line, the man asked me where was the tag for my little grey bag.</p>
<p>"For such a tiny one you need a tag?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Yes, you need it," he said. So he sent me back to get a tag.</p>
<p>When I came back to the line, I said to the man who was second in line, "Perhaps you saw me earlier. I was already at the head of the line."</p>
<p>"Yes, I saw you," he said. "And even if you had not been here before, I would have allowed you to enter the line because you are an old man."</p>
<p>I think he was about my age.</p>
