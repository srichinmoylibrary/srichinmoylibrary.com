<p><em>Madal:</em></p>
<p>Chinmoy, do you have any disciple who is <em>depraved</em>?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>Madal, you must know that God is not so unkind to me. He has not given me and will never give me, anyone who is <em>incorrigibly</em> evil. To be sure, God has not created anybody whose nature cannot be changed and who cannot be made into a perfect instrument of His manifestation on earth.</p>  </div>
