<p>The first year I ran the New York Marathon in 1979, I became so tired after fourteen miles. Then I saw Lavanya. She was doing stretching exercises, but I didn't have the capacity even to bend. Then she went ahead.</p>
<p>As soon as I would come near Radha, she would take off. Then she would relax. When I would catch her again, she would run faster.</p>
