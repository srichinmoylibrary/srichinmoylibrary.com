<p>Once I entered into the plane, I took my seat in the ambassador class section and was getting ready to write poems. In five minutes' time the same man came to me with a pillow and a blanket and said, "God, take this!"</p>
<p>Previously he was mad at me, but this time he was joking. I didn't say anything to him. I just smiled. God didn't accept his offering, but God was grateful to him.</p>
<p>Then he put the pillow and blanket on the seat next to me.</p>
