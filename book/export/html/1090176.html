<p>When I saw<br /> Age in his face<br /> I cried and cried<br />     Because<br /> It was I who was responsible<br /> For the age in his face.</p>
<p>When I saw<br /> Ages in his face<br /> I danced and danced<br />     Because<br /> It was I who had helped him<br /> And made him the possessor of ages.</p>
