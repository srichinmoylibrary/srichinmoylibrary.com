<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, but not the philosophy of the mind. If you take philosophy as a way of life, then that way of life has to come from your inner aspiration and inner guidance. When your inner guide tells you something, then you must take it as something most important in your life. Your inner guide will tell you how to live on earth and be of service to God and to mankind.</p>
<p>If you take the word philosophy and put it inside your heart, then you will see that the philosophy of the heart, the inner philosophy, is absolutely necessary and extremely important.</p>  </div>
