    <title>Question: Why is it that you accepted me as your disciple when I was unaspiring, outwardly at least? I was unaspiring practically up to the very second you initiated me.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your aspiration is like a stove. You have to turn the gas up to a certain point before it ignites. If the knob is even a fraction of an inch below that point, then nothing happens, even though the gas is flowing. In your case, your aspiration was just a fraction of an inch away from coming to the fore. When I accepted you, I gave you the additional aspiration you needed to ignite your inner flame.</p>  </div>
