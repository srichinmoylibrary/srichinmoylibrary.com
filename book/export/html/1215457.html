<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is not a single nation that is completely divine. Just like human beings, some nations are more divine than others because they have more good qualities. Similarly, some nations may have more bad qualities than other nations. But when it is a matter of an absolutely perfect nation, there is not a single nation that is absolutely divine.</p>  </div>
