<p><em>King Shibi was great. He had many divine qualities. He was noble and just. He was pure and kind. When the strong attacked the weak, he would invariably and immediately protect the weak. He loved men and animals equally. He gave his life to save the life of a dove. He was spiritual in the strictest sense of the term.</em></p>
