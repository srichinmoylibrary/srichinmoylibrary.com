<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, one can enter the spiritual world through constant meditation. It is inevitable. In fact, that is the very reason why we aspire. We aspire only to enter into the spiritual world, the inner world. You have already entered it thousands of times with your aspiration and meditation. But right now you do not have the capacity to distinguish the inner world from the outer world.</p>
<p>In the physical world, one person is on the animal level, another is on the human level and a third is on the divine level. In the spiritual world also there are grades; there is a ladder of consciousness. When you enter into the spiritual world with your sincere aspiration, a day will dawn when you will be able to recognise these planes of consciousness. There are seven higher worlds and seven lower worlds. When you are about to have your Self-realisation, or when your psychic being comes and tells you, you will know which world you are in. You can enter into these inner worlds and recognise them on the strength of your meditation.</p>  </div>
