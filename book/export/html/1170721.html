<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In one incarnation one cannot develop a very close connection with someone. The closeness and intimacy that some disciples have with one another, or with their Master, in most cases is due to connections made in previous incarnations. Closeness with the Master can be the result of a few or more close incarnations, or the result of the fastest progress that an individual made in one or two incarnations.</p>  </div>
