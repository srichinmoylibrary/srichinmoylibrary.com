<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on the individual case. Ordinarily, people commit suicide because they cannot face reality; they have emotional problems or their desires are not fulfilled. But each case is different and only God can decide. In the case of spiritual Masters, they can leave the body at will. But they do not harm the physical; they do not shoot themselves or anything. The soul leaves occultly and spiritually. But first they take permission from the Supreme.</p>  </div>
