<p>While I was shopping in London, an Indian really proved to have a good heart. I was buying some saris, and I wanted to pay the owner in American dollars. I was telling him that to simplify things, I would say that two dollars equals a pound. The owner said, "Do you want to make me very rich?"</p>
<p>I said, "Why?"</p>
<p>He said, "It is a dollar eighty-five, and you want to give me two dollars. I don't want you to make me rich!"</p>
<p>Since I was offering, he could have easily agreed. Then he was begging me to drink some juice because it was very hot. I said no, because I had to leave.</p>
<p>He said, "At least take some handkerchiefs from me. Do you have any handkerchiefs?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, I don't have any handkerchiefs."</p>
<p>So he forced me to take three handkerchiefs.</p>
