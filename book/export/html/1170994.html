<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul embodies all types of divinity, so inside the soul’s divinity one may feel cuteness or sweetness. But although the soul embodies all the divine qualities, and sweetness or cuteness may be present, we cannot say this soul is sweet, that soul is cute and so on. All the souls are divine. Inside their divinity it is we who try to see sweetness and cuteness. We say, “This child is cute, that child is sweet,” but our perception is on the physical or mental level. It is not like that in the soul’s realm. We cannot put a human being and the soul on the same footing. The reality of the soul is on a totally different plane.</p>  </div>
