<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a great joy not only in succeeding but also in trying. If we offer the result to the Supreme, then the greatest joy, the all-illumining joy we receive. Whenever we are doing something, we should offer our gratitude to the Supreme. We should feel really grateful that we have been given the opportunity to serve Him, whereas others have not been given this divine opportunity.</p>  </div>
