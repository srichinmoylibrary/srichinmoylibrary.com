<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the United Nations body feels that Americaâ€™s Bicentennial is the birthday of its own brother, then naturally it will want to congratulate the brother. This act of congratulation demands cheerful participation in the Bicentennial activities. Needless to say, in doing so the United Nations body will derive not only much joy but also great benefit.</p>  </div>
