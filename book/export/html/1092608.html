<p>Vedanta's head is always held high. Vaishnavism's head is always bent low. So they are as opposite as sky and earth. But these two heads never knock at each other in Rabindranath. He has housed them peacefully and synthesised them perfectly. The devout Vaishnava through him sings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Thou, make my head bow down at the dust of Thy Feet."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Vedantin with absolute monism through him declares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As far as my ken can go Thou and I have the self-same nature."</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
