  <h1 class="book-heading">Human will</h1>
  
 
<p>Our human will is nothing but continual empty starvation. Our Divine Will is continuous, gradual, sure and ultimate Self-realisation. Our human will can grow into our Divine Will if we know whom to love, why to love and how to love. Whom should we love? God. Why should we love Him? Because He is All-Love. How should we love Him? Just by feeling that we are entirely God's and shall remain His and His alone through Eternity.</p>  </div>
