<p>You do not appreciate it<br /> When someone compels you<br /> To break your promise.<br /> Then why do you compel God<br /> To break His Promise?<br /> His Promise to you and your soul<br /> Is that He will give you what He is<br /> Only when you give Him what you have.<br /> What He is,<br /> Is Satisfaction.<br /> What you have<br /> Is aspiration.<br /> Delay not in giving Him<br /> Your possession,<br /> Since He has been waiting<br /> At your heart's door<br /> For such a long time<br /> With His Possession.</p>
