<p>Today is the end of my weightlifting for this year. I started with 40 pounds once, and today I have done 40 pounds 40 times with strict military press style.</p>
<p>Next year my Inner Pilot has to decide whether I will continue with heavy weights. Perhaps He will allow me to practise with light weights. I don’t know. But today my weightlifting officially closes for this year.</p>
