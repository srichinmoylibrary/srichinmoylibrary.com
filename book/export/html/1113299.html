<h2>1 January</h2>

<p>Sumantra's mother came with Munnu's little sister and said: " <em>Bonne année"</em> to Nolini-da. Nolini-da was extremely pleased with the child's French pronunciation. Himangshu Niyogi touched Nolini-da's feet and made his most respectful pranam. The poet Sundaram came with a Gujarati lady and offered something to Nolini-da. Dinesh came and made his pranam to Nolini-da. Rajen-da came with some beautiful flowers, which Nolini-da asked me to take upstairs.</p>
<p>Udar came with Lilu and gave twenty-five copies of the new diary to Amrita-da. Amrita-da said: "Udar, please don't cover Lilu. I want to appreciate her sari. She looks so beautiful today."</p>
<p>Udar moved aside saying: "Look, Amrita-da, look and appreciate Lilu's beauty."</p>
<p>In the afternoon Sisir-da came and said: "Nolini-da, please give me ten New Year's calendars."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "Ten! Sisir, I can't give you ten."</p>
<p>"But I need them."</p>
<p>"Then tell me the names of the people you need them for."</p>
<p>Sisir-da started giving the names. When he mentioned Sisir Ghose of Shantiniketan I said: "He is in Missouri in America."</p>
<p>Sisir-da said: "That I know. He will be back in March. On his return he will definitely expect one from me." He then mentioned a few more names.</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "Enough enough, and handed ten calendars to Sisir-da with a smile.</p>
<p>Then Sisir-da said: "Please give me ten copies of the New Year's message which you have translated into Bengali. I wish to send them to some of my acquaintances in Calcutta."</p>
<p>"What will they do with that?"</p>
<p>"Why? I am sure they will appreciate God's Hour."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "Do you think that outsiders believe in what we say and do here? Sometimes it seems to me they don't believe in our spiritual activities at all."</p>  </div>
