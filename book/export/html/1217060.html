<p>Today is a very happy day. The Saviour came to bless us, so let us remember him always with gratitude. He also suffered, and his end was so painful. Again, when spiritual Masters come to earth, they may suffer, but they leave behind happiness, infinite happiness, for the world. This happiness always comes from our inspiration and aspiration.</p>
<p>Today is the Birthday of Jesus Christ the Saviour. He left the body at the age of 33. Poor me, I am double his age. I am 66. What I have accomplished and what I have not accomplished, God alone knows! Can you imagine? I am exactly double his age.</p>
