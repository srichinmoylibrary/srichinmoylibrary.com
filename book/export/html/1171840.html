<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At the United Nations there are many nations united together. The United Nations is like a lotus that has many petals. Each petal is necessary in order to form the lotus. Each nation has something to offer to the world at large. Twice a week we offer our devoted and dedicated service to the soul and the body of the U.N. We go there to invoke the presence of the soul of the U.N. We try to elevate the consciousness of the delegates, representatives and members of the staff. The delegates and representatives are trying to bring to the fore the good qualities of each nation in a political way. They want to bring about Peace, Light and Bliss in infinite measure so that the world will not surrender to war, but to love. Through our prayer and meditation we are trying to do the same thing, so that the world will not surrender to war, but to love. Through our prayer and meditation we are trying to do the same thing, but our approach is the inner approach. We are not saying that our approach is better. Far from it. But we feel that if we sow the seed, then it will eventually become a tiny plant, and finally it will grow into a banyan tree and produce flowers and fruits. This is our way. We feel that the seed has just germinated. They feel that the tree is already there, that the flowers and fruits are there, and that it is up to the world to accept the fruits, to eat the fruits and become energetic and dynamic.</p>  </div>
