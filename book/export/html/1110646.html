<p>To be an honest person, to tell the truth, to do nice things that others may follow, to have a wonderful heart, a noble character: this is virtue. But the greatest virtue lies in the embodiment of Truth. This is not the ordinary truth, but the real Truth which says, "I am the Truth." The ordinary truth says, "Now I am telling lies, now I am telling the truth." But the real Truth is something different. The real Truth holds the entire creation. At present we separate Creation and Truth. We say Creation is here; Truth is there. But when we speak of the real Truth, it is all oneness. The Ultimate Truth is absolute oneness with everything in the universe. And that Oneness we all have to become.</p>  </div>
