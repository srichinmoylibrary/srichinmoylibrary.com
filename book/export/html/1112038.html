<p>The other day I was walking to the tennis court. On the way an elderly Indian man came out of his house and said, "May I speak to you?"</p>
<p>I said, "Why?"</p>
<p>He said, "You are a great man. My daughter is getting married this Friday. I wish to invite you and your disciples. I wish to honour you."</p>
<p>I said, "Your daughter is getting married. This is her day. Why do you have to honour me?"</p>
<p>He said, "If you come to our house, you will bless our house and bless us."</p>
<p>I said, "You have my inner blessings."</p>
<p>He said, "I want your outer blessings."</p>
<p>"Please forgive me," I said, "I will not be able to come."</p>
<p>Then we shook hands and I went on.</p>
