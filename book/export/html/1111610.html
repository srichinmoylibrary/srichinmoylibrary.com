<p>During our seventy-mile race the young son of George Gardiner, the American record-holder for one hundred miles on a track, came up to me and said he wanted to talk to me privately. Then he told me, "You are a good person," and he congratulated me on the sixth anniversary of my writing "Transcendence-Perfection." He had his arm around my shoulder. Then, when Bhashwar took our picture, I put my arm around him. His name is John.</p>
