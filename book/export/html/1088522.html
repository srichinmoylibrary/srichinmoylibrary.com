<p>The great political leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was one of the right-hand men of Gandhi. Everybody admired him; he had tremendous will and was known as the Iron Man of India. He encouraged and inspired millions of people to fight against the British rule.</p>
<p>Once he was giving a talk about the freedom of India. In the middle of the talk, a messenger came to Vallabhbhai Patel and gave him a telegram. He opened it only to learn of the unexpected death of his wife. But Vallabhbhai Patel did not say a word to anyone. He continued lecturing for an hour or so. Then he answered everyone's questions with utmost calm and quiet.</p>
<p>Afterwards, tears were flowing from his eyes. Everybody came up to him, asking, "What happened? What is the matter?"</p>
<p>He showed them the telegram. Then he said, "Duty comes first. My Motherland comes first. My wife was dear to me, but my Motherland is infinitely dearer."</p>  </div>
