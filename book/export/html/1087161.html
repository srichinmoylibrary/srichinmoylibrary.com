<p>While shopping today in Oita, which is about an hour away from Beppu, I saw three young girls selling sticky candy. God knows what those girls saw in me, but they started smiling and smiling at me. They would put two or three candies inside the package, and then they would look at me and smile.</p>
<p>They didn't know English and I didn't know Japanese, but they were saying so many things to me!</p>
