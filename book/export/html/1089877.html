<p>Today's realisation is tomorrow's revelation. What is revelation? Revelation is manifested realisation. What is realisation? Realisation is tomorrow's fulfilled manifestation. God has revealed Himself in you and through you. Now you have to reveal God in and through your totally surrendered and dedicated life.</p>  </div>
