<p>I was about to cross the street when a small school bus stopped in the middle of the street. One of the disciples saw me waiting there and came running to carry my bags. Then I saw a thin man take off his hat and bow down. This kind of thing only the Harry who works at P.S. 86 used to do. When I came nearer I saw that it was Harry, so I also bowed down.</p>
