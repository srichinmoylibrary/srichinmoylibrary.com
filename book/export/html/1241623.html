<p>Quite often when I sleep, Kanu has to sleep between my two knees. I could squash him, but he is not afraid.</p>
<p>Today, when I went upstairs, the first thing Kanu did was to lie down with his head on my feet. Then, after two or three minutes, he got permission to change position. So he lay down right on my head!</p>
