<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Before the parents accepted the spiritual life, their prayer was always: “Please, God, grant that our children listen to us.” Then, when the parents become sincerely spiritual, they do not pray to God with that kind of prayer. They simply say: “Please fulfil them in Your own way. Please let my children do the right thing; not what I want from them, but what</p>
<p>You want from them. I want nothing from them. I want everything from You.” When they pray that their children should do the right thing, then automatically detachment comes.</p>  </div>
