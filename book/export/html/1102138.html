<p>"My Lord, twice I get joy: once when I see You, and once when I think of You. Which one is more important?"</p>
<p>"My child, you have forgotten that you get joy four times. Two you have mentioned; the other two I am going to tell you about: when you work for Me, and when you feel that you are of Me.</p>
<p>"By devotedly seeing Me once a day if you get joy, then for that joy I shall give you seventy out of a hundred. By constantly thinking of Me if you get joy, then for that joy I shall give you eighty out of a hundred. By soulfully working for Me if you get joy, then for that joy I shall give you ninety out of a hundred. But by devotedly, constantly, soulfully and inseparably feeling that you are of Me and of Me alone, you get one hundred out of a hundred. Finally I want to tell you what I get, My child. I get joy one hundred and one out of a hundred when I see that you have really understood My inner history and My higher mathematics."</p>
