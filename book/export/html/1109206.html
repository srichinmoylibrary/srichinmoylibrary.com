<p>To search for peace is a supreme honour. By no manner of means is it abject humiliation. High idealism the United Nations has within. Vast reality it will reveal without. Indeed, this is the glorious vision of the Secretary-General:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The United Nations has advantages which are, first, its permanence, all the more necessary because wars are more protracted, second, its neutrality, which it must jealously preserve, and lastly its idealism, which makes the search for peace an honour and not a humiliation."</p>
