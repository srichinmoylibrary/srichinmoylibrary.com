<p>During the race at least 12 people recognised me. They called out, "Sri, Sri!" They said I could make it.</p>
<p>There was a girl from our Montreal Centre who kept going ahead of me. Sometimes I would come very close to her. Then she would get tremendous inspiration and run ahead and disappear.</p>
<p>When I had completed five miles, a very nice black man who was watching came up to me to give me special advice. He told me, "Inhale, exhale three times. If you do that, then you will be able to beat that sissy!" He was encouraging me, telling me to defeat her.</p>
