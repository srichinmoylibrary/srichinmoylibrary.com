<p>The greatest Mogul Emperor was Akbar. It was he who wanted both the Hindus and Muslims to be united. He was generous to the extreme and just to the extreme. Among the Mogul Emperors, he was the true ideal.</p>
<p>One day Akbar was walking incognito in the street. He was incognito because he wanted to be alone. Always people were around him and he never had his freedom. But this time he was all alone.</p>
<p>While he was walking, he saw an old lady holding a dagger. He asked her, "What are you doing with a dagger? Let me see what it looks like and how sharp it is."</p>
<p>The old lady gave him the dagger and he held it for a few seconds. "Oh, I am so sorry," she said. "Had you been the Emperor, then this metal dagger would have been transformed into a gold dagger. Now it is just a metal dagger, but I had a dream that if ever the Emperor touches it, then definitely it will be transformed into gold. I have been waiting and waiting for the Emperor to appear. I am praying to Allah that he will come. For years I have been here, waiting in the street for Akbar. I am so sorry that still I have not been blessed with Akbar's presence."</p>
<p>The following day Akbar summoned the old lady to the court. Now he was wearing his robes and his crown. He said, "Here is Akbar. He does not have the capacity to transform a metal dagger into a gold one, but he does have the capacity to change your life for good. How much money do you want?"</p>
<p>The lady was overwhelmed. She couldn't believe her eyes; she couldn't believe her ears. She told the Emperor that she wanted a particular amount of money. But Akbar gave her much, much more, saying, "I don't have the capacity to turn metal into gold, but I have another capacity."</p>
<p>So the lady became extremely rich because of Akbar the Great.</p>  </div>
