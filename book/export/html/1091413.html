  <h1 class="book-heading">Non-Violent Revolution</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> We saved the country because of what we did. We call it a non-violent revolution.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, the Father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi, taught us that non-violence is the greatest weapon.</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> And then we were able to drive the dictator away through non-violence. We were just praying and praying, fasting and fasting — imitating Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Mahatma Gandhi used to say that nonviolence is the power of the soul, the power of our inner existence. The power of the inner existence is much greater than any man-made problems which we have created for ourselves.</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> God's greatest gift to humankind is freedom. So man is always praying to be free.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Inwardly man is already free. Man is like a bird that can fly away at any moment. But we put the bird in a cage and then we say that the bird cannot fly. Who put the bird inside the cage? It is we human beings who have put the bird inside the cage, and then we blame the bird. Our ignorance is a cage. We have allowed ignorance to bind us, and then we say, We can't be free, we can't be free!" But it is we who have allowed ignorance to bind us; it is we who have bound ourselves.</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> There are also people who are outwardly free, but who are still enslaved by their own greed and vices. So they are not really free because they are controlled by their vices.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They are possessed by their own possessions. The possessor is possessed by his possessions — as you mentioned, Father, by his material greed.</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> Money is a necessary evil, but we cannot allow money to control us. We should be the ones to control money. What happens, however, is that money becomes the enslaver of humankind; it becomes our God. That is wrong. There are so many things to reflect on in this world. People should reflect and meditate.I wish to thank you for your presence tonight.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am most grateful to you. I have come here to be blessed by you and to be in your blessingful presence.</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> We should bless one another. You bless me and I will bless you.</p>  </div>
