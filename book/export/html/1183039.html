<p>She was an elderly woman, extremely devoted to the Master. One day she came to the Master crying and weeping. Her son-in-law, a policeman, had been severely wounded by a bullet and was in the hospital. She came to the Master to ask whether her son-in-law would survive. The Master said, “I do not know.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know? Then why do you claim yourself to be a God-realised soul?”</p>
<p>The Master said, “A God-realised soul does not have to know everything, and sometimes he prays to God to give him the capacity to unlearn most of the things that he has learned.”</p>
<p>This dry philosophy of the Master did not satisfy the old lady. She said, “Since you cannot read the future, how am I going to place my future at your feet?”</p>
<p>She left.</p>  </div>
