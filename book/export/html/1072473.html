<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In our Centre, we have first class disciples, second class disciples, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh class disciples. We even have eighth class disciples. Some souls are like first class disciples. They are determined to manifest and reveal the Supreme on earth. Others become one with the vital. They come to earth to enjoy. Sometimes first class souls come here with the intention of spreading light, but then darkness enters into them from the temptation of the world and they surrender to darkness. These are weak souls. Each soul does have the divine spark in it. But we have to know how capable the soul is of manifesting the light, and how much it has consciously or unconsciously accepted the ignorance of the world.</p>  </div>
