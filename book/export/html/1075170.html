<p>THE GUESTS</p>
<p>A gold possessor<br /> Is a welcome guest.</p>
<p>A silver possessor<br /> Is an acceptable guest.</p>
<p>A man with no gold<br /> And no silver<br /> Is an unwanted guest.</p>
<p>But<br /> When I went to visit God,<br /> He asked me,<br /> "Son, do you have gold with you?"<br /> Sorry. No, Father.</p>
<p>"I am so happy, son, that you do<br /> Not have gold.<br /> Son, do you have silver with you?"<br /> Sorry. No, Father.</p>
<p>"Son, I am so happy that you do<br /> Not have silver.<br /> Son, what actually have you brought for Me?"<br /> Father, unfortunately, nothing.</p>
<p>"Son, you do have something for Me.<br /> You have brought Me<br /> Your bold nothingness-pride.<br /> Son, give Me your pride<br /> And I give you My All."</p>
