<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we use the word “strength,” we usually refer to the physical strength, the vital strength, the mental strength or even we go as far as the inner strength. When we use the word “power,” we try to indicate a divine power which is the night-chasing capacity and the soul-fulfilling capacity of one’s inner being. In the spiritual life, it is always better to use the word “power” instead of “strength.” For power, unlike strength, immediately gives us the feeling of an essential aspect of God. Strength is bound in the physical and it can be used only in the physical world. Power too can be used in the physical, for the physical, but it is not bound there. Its home is high, very high, in the loftiest regions of the infinite Consciousness.</p>  </div>
