<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please do not be afraid of me. I am not a tiger, I am not a lion. I am the son of God and, at the same time, I am your eternal spiritual Father. So please do not be afraid of me. Please forgive me, but we have to run far â€” very, very far. When you are not afraid of me, when there is no fear inside you, when you are all love and surrender to the Will of the Supreme, at that time you will run the fastest. So please feel that the Supreme is operating in and through you. Then you will be able to run much faster.</p>  </div>
