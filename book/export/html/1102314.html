<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do envisage the creation of a second chamber at the United Nations, but it does not have to be composed of non-governmental organisations or of the so-called wise men of nations. This new creation must be composed only of selfless, dedicated workers — true servers and lovers of mankind — who do not merely remain on the theoretical plane but also come down to the practical plane and offer practical, effective answers to mankind.</p>  </div>
