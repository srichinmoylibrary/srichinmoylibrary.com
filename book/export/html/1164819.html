<p>Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p>14 March 1992</p>
<p>O Queen of the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>My most esteemed sister Raisa Maximovna,</p>
<p>It was most kind of you to autograph for me your immortal book <em>I Hope</em> with your deep and compassionate affection. I shall treasure it inside the very depth of my gratitude-heart. My German student Petra Menge was so fortunate to have met with you and to have been able to offer you a rose, which I wanted her to give you from me. Like me, everybody must treasure your invaluable book.</p>
<p>I was extremely happy to meet with your dearest daughter, Irina, in New York last month. While I was talking to her, I was so clearly feeling and seeing her parents' infinite wisdom, light, compassion and sacrifice.</p>
<p>You are a supreme authority on art. In May there will be an art exhibit in New York of my paintings which will last for about a month. I am going to dedicate this exhibit to you. I shall be so deeply honoured and grateful if you could come and bless the exhibit just for fleeting five minutes. It will mean so much to me and to my students from all over the world.</p>
<p>I am praying to my Lord Supreme most fervently for your good health and for an extra supply of dynamic energy for you.</p>
<p>With my heart's warmest compliments and gratitude,</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy</p>  </div>
