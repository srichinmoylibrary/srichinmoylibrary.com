<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every morning you will pray for God to give you the strength and obedience you need to listen to your parents. You will pray to God to bless both you and your parents every morning. You will ask God to come to you and to be with you and around you twenty-four hours a day. Always think of God as being your own age. If you are four years old, He is four years old. If you are five, He is five. He is of your own standard. If you feel that He is neither inferior nor superior to you, He can then tell you how you can be good.</p>  </div>
