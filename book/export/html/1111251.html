<p>Yesterday I was running in Flushing Meadow Park when an old, fat lady came from behind me and with her left hand gave me a very good push on my shoulder. A thin old man dressed very smartly in a running outfit was approaching us and observing the scene. He said to her, "Street nuisance!" O God, I thought that I was about to enjoy seeing a very good fight. So I increased my stride and ran away quite fast.</p>
