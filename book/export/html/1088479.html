<p><em>Sarada Devi:</em> Now that my Kali — Ramakrishna — is about to pass behind the curtain of Eternity, an excruciating pang is torturing my heart. <em>(She begins to cry bitterly.)</em></p>
<p><em>(To everyone's surprise, Sri Ramakrishna raises himself slightly.)</em></p>
<p><em>Ramakrishna:</em> Why do you weep so bitterly? I leave your Naren with you.</p>
<p><em>Sarada Devi:</em> Yes, my Divine Lord, it is true. You are the seed sown in the world soil, and our Naren is the bumper crop which humanity shall reap. Thakur is the inspiration, his Naren is its expression. So humanity will have both inspiration and expression as its peerless possessions. <em>(She bows down to Sri Ramakrishna.)</em> Glory to you, O Thakur. To you we offer our deepest homage. Our hearts feel that what you possess is the Infinite, and that the Infinite is your heart's Eternal Home.</p>
<p><em>(Sri Ramakrishna leaves the body.)</em></p>
