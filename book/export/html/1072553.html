<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When your aspiration starts to slip, you have to cry like a child. When a childâ€™s favourite object is taken away by somebody forcefully, the child cries. On hearing his cry, his father comes and brings him back his favourite object. If you also cry in the same way when your aspiration is taken away by the hostile forces, then the Supreme, the Eternal Father, will bring you back your aspiration.</p>  </div>
