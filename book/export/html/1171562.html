<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Feel that you are offering them your heart's pure fragrance, and you are hoping that their heart will receive it. Also, you will pray to God at that time to give extra purity and extra beauty, divine beauty, to your heart and to the heart of the person to whom you are offering the flowers.</p>  </div>
