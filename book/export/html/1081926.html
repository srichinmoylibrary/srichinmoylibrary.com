<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dream and reality go together. They are at the same place. Inside dream is reality. There are only two different names of a single reality. We call it dream when we look up, and when we look down it is reality. We stand at a particular place and look at a mountain. When we look at the top of the mountain we call it dream, and when we look at the foot of the mountain we call it reality.</p>  </div>
