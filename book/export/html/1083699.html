<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the inner world everybody makes mistakes. I also make mistakes. My first mistake was to be born. My second mistake was to enter into the spiritual life. My third and last mistake was to come to America. How am I going to rectify these three mistakes? I came here to be a donkey. These three mistakes are killing me. If God can tolerate these three mistakes, then how is it that He cannot tolerate your mistakes?</p>  </div>
