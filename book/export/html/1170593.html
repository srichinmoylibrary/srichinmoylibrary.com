<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My most favourite flower is the lotus.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Davis:</em> I chose the lotus as a symbol of my life because I want to stay grounded in water with the fluid motion around me. It goes deep. I tell people that I chose it as a symbol of my life because I want to be grounded in my family and God.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Water means consciousness.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Davis:</em> When I meditate in the morning, I go to the water.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy [offering some books]:</em> For me there is only one religion: love of God. You can be Christian, I can be Hindu, but our love of God is the only religion.</p>  </div>
