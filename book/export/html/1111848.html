<p>Many times while I was running I thought that no disciples were near me. Then I would turn around to find some of the disciples only 50 or 60 metres behind me.</p>
<p>At one point I saw Shephali right ahead of me, almost touching my elbow, but she never saw me.</p>
<p>At another point I saw Pranika going ahead of me after she had been behind me for a while.</p>
