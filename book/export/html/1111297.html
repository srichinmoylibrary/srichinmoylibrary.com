<p>After I finished, I waited around for practically an hour. I was enjoying watching the people coming in after me. I thought that I was one of the most unfortunate runners, but people kept coming in.</p>
<p>One man who came in was a rogue. He was about sixty. He came in quite fresh and did three somersaults. He was so happy.</p>
<p>He was jumping — one, two, three. Most of the people didn't believe that he had run the whole course. His number was missing, but he said that he had the number. God knows!</p>
