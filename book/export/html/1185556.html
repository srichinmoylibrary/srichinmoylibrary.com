<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. We use the terms “unconditional surrender” and “constant surrender.” Sometimes we make complete surrender. It is complete for five minutes and at that time it is unconditional. Then, when five minutes are over, at that time unfortunately it becomes conditional. At that time we cannot expect to realise God. For five minutes we can make unconditional surrender, constant surrender. But at the end of five minutes it becomes conditional. So surrender has to become permanently established in our life. First it has to be temporary, then conditional and then permanent and unconditional. When surrender is unconditional and constant, we will see Light, infinite Light, within ourselves.</p>  </div>
