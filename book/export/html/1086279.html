<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you were working at our gallery, no matter how tired you were, if I asked you to get me something to drink, you just ran. Why? There are two reasons. One is that people were there to appreciate you if you did the thing, and because you wanted appreciation, you did it. The other reason is that you felt the inner need to do it. If you remain in the physical and vital, you do something because people will appreciate you. But if you remain on the soul's level, then you will do it out of inner devotion, inner need.</p>
<p>If I spend four hours playing volleyball, then I will develop some capacity; but that capacity I cannot apply to ping-pong. So try to develop some capacity to meditate in the same way that you have developed the capacity to do other things.</p>  </div>
