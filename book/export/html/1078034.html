<p>Drunk with power<br /> I came to my Lord.<br /> He ignored my power.</p>
<p>Drunk with beauty<br /> I came to my Lord.<br /> He ignored my beauty.</p>
<p>Drunk with surrender<br /> I came to my Lord.<br /> He offered me<br /> His Throne of Light,<br /> His Crown of Delight,<br /> His Palace of Truth,<br /> His Kingdom of Love.</p>
