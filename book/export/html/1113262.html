<p>Early in the morning I went to Nolini-da and made my most devoted pranam to him. He was very pleased. At noon I went to Amrita-da and told him that I would like to have a group picture with him and Nolini-da.</p>
<p>Amrita-da said: "With Nolini? Has he agreed?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he has agreed. Only now I need you."</p>
<p>"Is Nolini ready?"</p>
<p>"He is," I said.</p>
<p>"If Nolini is ready, I am already ready. Come along. Let us make you immortal or let you make us immortal on your birthday."</p>
<p>Indeed, it was a classic picture. Nolini-da and Amrita-da were sitting in chairs. I was standing behind Nolini-da and Kalipada-da was standing behind Amrita-da.</p>  </div>
