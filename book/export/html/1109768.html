<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, no, not in the proper proportion. If you just hear the news in the morning, or watch something instructive on TV, then there is nothing wrong in it. But if you listen to rock and roll for hours, or watch all kinds of silly things on television, then you are just squandering the little light that you have been able to receive during your meditation.</p>  </div>
