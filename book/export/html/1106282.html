<p>The first time I tried to call Mahasamrat today, he was not there. I was telling Agraha, “They have gone out for breakfast.” I know that they rarely go out for breakfast.</p>
<p>Then, when I finally spoke with Mahasamrat, I asked him, “Where were you?”</p>
<p>He said, “We went out for breakfast.”</p>
<p>Mahasamrat’s whole gymnasium is flooded with my pictures. All the different lifts that I have done he has collected. As you know, he has given most beautiful and inspiring comments about each one. Now he says that there is nothing more in the outer world that he will be able to tell me. In the outer world, everything he has said. Only he will be able to tell me things in the inner world.</p>
