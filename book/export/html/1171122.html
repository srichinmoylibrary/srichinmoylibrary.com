<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> An American can do quite a few things to help a Russian. To start with, either consciously or unconsciously, an American will not belittle the Russian, he will not ignore the Russian, he will not suspect the Russian and he will develop conscious trust in the Russian. He will take the Russian as a true member of America’s universal oneness-family. If an American can do all this, then definitely he is helping the Russian most, both in the Russian’s inner life and in his outer life. While helping the Russian in his inner life and outer life, the American will also be amply rewarded, not only by the soul of Russia, but also by the soul of America. The soul of Russia will reward him with gratitude, and the soul of America will reward him with pride, divine pride.</p>  </div>
