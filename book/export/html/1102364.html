<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know that patience itself is dynamism; it is a mistake to separate them. In patience and in dynamism there is confidence. We can safely say that confidence is the hyphen between patience and dynamism. Dynamism is found in the vital proper, patience is found in the heart and confidence, let us say, is found in the mind. If the mind is inundated with confidence, if the heart is inundated with patience and if the vital is inundated with dynamism, then we can easily have a far-reaching vision of the United Nations.</p>
<p>At that time, we will know that we embody patience because our heart is aspiring. We will know that we have confidence in our mind because constantly the mind is striving for a higher reality than what it has already achieved. That means the mind already has some capacity, which we call confidence. And we will know that our vital is flooded with dynamism rather than aggression because we have dedicated ourselves to serving the United Nations.</p>  </div>
