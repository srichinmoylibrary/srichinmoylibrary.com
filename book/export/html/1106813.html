<p>The New Year is the year of our mind's inspiration, our heart's creation and our soul's manifestation.</p>
<p>Inspiration will march onward to the Source.</p>
<p>Creation will sit at the pinnacle of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Manifestation will at once prove its divinity and immortality.</p>
<p>The New Year is the year of acceptance and transformation.</p>
<p>The human in us will try to accept the divine in us unconditionally.</p>
<p>The divine in us will transform the human in us untiringly and unconditionally.</p>
<p>In the New Year, every day will be an opportunity for the God-believer to see the truth-light.</p>
<p>In the New Year, every hour will be an opportunity for the God-worshipper to achieve the truth-light.</p>
<p>In the New Year, every second will be an opportunity for the God-lover to become the truth-light.</p>  </div>
