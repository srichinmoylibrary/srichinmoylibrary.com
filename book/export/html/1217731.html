  <h1 class="book-heading">Man</h1>
  
 
<p>Creation is proud of Man, its crown and peak. Man is proud of his eminence and fulfilment. But in God's vision, even a self-realised man is only the child of the superman to come upon earth.</p>
<p>Man is the son of an ape! But he will be the father of a superman! But how? Both his fast-mounting yearning and the evolving wheel of Life will be responsible for this mighty transformation.</p>
<p>Man is synonymous with impotence. His goal is a far cry from his natural experience. His present is dead in ignorance. But his future will be dead to ignorance. Today brutality gambols within him; tomorrow Divinity.</p>
<p>Alas, man is not aware of the fact that his sweetness and humility go far, yet cost practically nothing.</p>
<p>Man, in essence, is not ugly. But hard is it for a man to appear beautiful, for he has lost the contact with his soul, the child of All-Beauty.</p>
<p>What is it, after all, that gives to a child his charm and beauty? Is it not the soul's glow? When that touch gets fainter and is finally lost, he becomes a dull and cautious adult.</p>
<p>Man is by nature a lover. Only he has yet to discover the real thing of love. This quest awakens him to the fulfilment of his real Self.</p>
<p>Who is man after all? The one whose eye will make him Eternal, the one whose heart will throb with Immortality.</p>
<p>The man who is a sincere seeker of the Infinite must needs always say: "So little done, so much to do."</p>
<p>Man has two weapons: hope and despair. With hope he tries to kill the stagnation of incapacity. With despair he tries to kill the birth of the golden future.</p>
<p>If man's life is given for living, then Truth can have its inevitable reason for existing.</p>
<p>Man's joy in forgiving is a joy worth having. Man's joy in being forgiven is a joy worth aspiring for.</p>
<p>Neither admiration nor critical penetration can make one see the secrets of another's life. Self-sacrifice alone can do it.</p>
<p>Man's unseen strength is in his uncertain hopes. His hope's strength is in his sacrifice. His sacrifice's strength is in God's Grace. His Grace's strength is the All-Fulfilling Delight.</p>  </div>
