<p>Howard was going to this side and that side to check if people were walking properly. He was very serious. While he was moving around, so many articles of clothing he took off: his trousers, jacket, red tie and hat!</p>
<p>Howard would show the walkers a particular card when they were not walking properly. If he showed them a card with a "V" on it, it meant they were out of the race.</p>
<p>Poor Subarata got one or two warnings. She was ahead of me, but she was nowhere near the other walkers. They were up to eight miles and perhaps she was struggling at one or two miles. Still, she got a warning. Then her husband also got a warning.</p>
