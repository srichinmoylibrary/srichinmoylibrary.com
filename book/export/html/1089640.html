<p>There was a teacher who taught a class of young boys. One day he asked his students a very simple question: "Can you tell me where God is?"</p>
<p>Quite a few students raised their hand. One said, "God is in Heaven."</p>
<p>Another boy stood up and said, "God is everywhere, except in hell."</p>
<p>A third boy stood up and said, "My mother told me that God is only in good people, not in bad people."</p>
<p>A fourth student stood up and said, "God is in everybody. My grandmother has taught me that God is in everybody, good or bad."</p>
<p>Still another one stood up and said, "My grandfather has told me that God is everywhere and in everybody. Even in hell, God is there."</p>
<p>The teacher said, "All right, all of you have given excellent answers. Is there anybody who has anything new to say?"</p>
<p>Finally one little boy stood up and said, "Teacher, they are all wrong. I know where God is. God is in our kitchen! Every morning my father comes into the kitchen and says to my mother, 'My God! Are you still cooking? It is so late!' "</p>  </div>
