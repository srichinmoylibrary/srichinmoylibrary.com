<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why do you have to think about your soul at this stage of your spiritual development? You have me permanently and eternally, so you do not have to think of your soul. I shall deal with your soul. Just think of the Supreme and pray to the Supreme. Right now you cannot see your soul; God alone knows when you will be able to see your soul. But you can see me. If you believe in me, then I will be able to take you directly to the highest Absolute. If you ever see how your soul meditates on my transcendental photograph, you will say, "Why do we have to do anything as long as we have this picture?" The higher and deeper you go, the more value you will give to my transcendental photograph.</p>  </div>
