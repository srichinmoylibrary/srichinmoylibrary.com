SCA 656-658. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in San Francisco on 15 March 1991.</p>
<h2>Question: Now that I have become your disciple, should I continue with some of my outer activities, such as flying and tennis?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are enjoying flying, then you should do it. When we are up in the sky, at that time we think, “How beautiful the ground is.” While we are on the ground, we think, “How beautiful the sky looks.” This is the human mind. When we are up, at that time we like the world that is below. When we are below, we like the world that is above. If you can feel both are beautiful, that is the best. While you are on the ground, do your duty as soulfully as possible. While you are in the air, do your duty there with equal devotion. Try not to make any comparison between the two.</p>
<p>Wherever you are, you have to try to be the best person, the best seeker. Whether you are in the air or on the ground, you are praying to the same God. The same God is in the plane and on the tennis court. At this moment you are in one room, at the next moment in another room. Do not make any comparison that this room is far better than the other room or that flying is more enjoyable than playing tennis. No, if you want to be a good tennis player, as you are, then pay attention to tennis, and while you are flying, pay attention to flying. At that time do not think of tennis strokes. If you think of topspin you will spin!</p>  </div>
