<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I prefer to advise my disciples to meditate, but I have given <em>mantras</em> to a few of them. Each <em>mantra</em> offers a particular result. While using a <em>mantra</em>, we invoke a certain aspect of God or a certain cosmic god to give us Peace, Light, Bliss or something else that we want or need. But if we can meditate well for ten or fifteen minutes, this serves the same purpose because we enter into the infinite expanse of Peace, Light and Bliss, where our soul can drink whatever it needs or wants.</p>
<p>When aspirants cannot enter into their deepest meditation because the mind is restless, this is their opportunity to utilise a <em>mantra</em>. 'Supreme', 'AUM' or 'God' can be repeated by anyone for a few minutes before he actually starts his meditation. The <em>mantra</em> should be repeated slowly and aloud.</p>
<p>If you want quick results in your inner spiritual life, you should repeat a <em>mantra</em> every day without fail, for a least half an hour: fifteen minutes in the morning and fifteen minutes in the evening. There can be no <em>mantra</em> more powerful than the mother of all <em>mantras</em>, AUM.</p>  </div>
