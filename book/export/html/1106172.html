<p>Yesterday when I tried to lift 350 pounds for the first time, 350 was responding so nicely. I told some of the disciples that it was a matter of days, not a matter of weeks, before I would be able to lift it. Then I asked them to guess how many days it would take. Some said three, others four or five and one said two. Inwardly I knew that I would lift it today, but nobody guessed one day.</p>
