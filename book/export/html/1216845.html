<p>I went to our new Florida Centre for a rest. Between book stores and sports stores — that was my rest!</p>
<p>One funny story Dristi was telling about a lady she met. They were talking about spiritual matters, and the lady asked Dristi the name of her guru.</p>
<p>Dristi said, "Sri Chinmoy."</p>
<p>The lady said, "My guru is also Sri Chinmoy."</p>
<p>Dristi is the head of our Centre, and she had never seen this lady before. But the lady said that every day for the past ten or eleven years she has been meditating on my picture. She said, "The bald head."</p>
<p>A little bit painfully and hesitantly, Dristi admitted, "Yes, he has a bald head."</p>
<p>The next day the lady brought a picture of the person she was meditating on to prove that Sri Chinmoy was her guru.</p>
<p>It was a picture of Ramana Maharshi. Bald-headed people are all brothers!</p>
