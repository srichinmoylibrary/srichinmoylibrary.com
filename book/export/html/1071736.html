<p>When your friends say that you are the greatest aspirant, be sure to correct and perfect them. When your enemies say that you are the lowest aspirant, don't hesitate to correct and perfect yourself. Remember, in either case you are not the loser. In your own perfection your enemies do not derive any benefit. When you make your friends perfect to assess you properly you don't lose anything. Be correct and perfect; you will be able to fulfil God in you. Correct and perfect others, you will fulfil them in God.</p>
