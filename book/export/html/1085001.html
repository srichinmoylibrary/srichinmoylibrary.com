<p>A young aspirant was sitting at the foot of a tree in the summer heat. Fortunately or unfortunately, the tree he happened to be sitting under was the Kalpataru tree, the tree that fulfils all desires, but he did not know this. After a while the heat became scorching and he said, "How I wish somebody would come and fan me!" Right away a young boy came and started fanning him. First he was very surprised. Then he began to think that whatever he wished for would be granted. So he said, "This is a young boy. I don't want him. Let me have a beautiful girl." Immediately a beautiful girl came and started fanning him. After a while he said, "Now I would like to have food here. I am very hungry." The young girl went and fetched food for him. He ate his fill and then said, "Oh, how beautiful this place is. But I don't see any animals here. I am in a forest, but how is it that there are no animals? A forest should always be alive with animals. How I wish to see at least one tiger in front of me!" In no time a tiger appeared â€” only to devour him!</p>
<p>So, as George Bernard Shaw said, "There are two tragedies in life. One is not to get your heart's desire, the other is to get it." In this story, the young aspirant got it!</p>  </div>
