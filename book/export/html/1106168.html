<p>Yesterday, on my calf machine, I lifted a total of 106 tons, and afterwards my legs were hurting like anything.</p>
<p>Later, when I went to the United Nations, I met with a great Bengali novelist in the office of Ambassador Chowdhury of the Bangladesh Mission. The novelist is of my age, but immediately he wanted to touch my feet. At least three times during our meeting, with great difficulty, he went to touch my feet. I felt extremely sorry for him, and I desperately wanted to bend down and lift him up, but because of my leg pain, I could not do it.</p>
