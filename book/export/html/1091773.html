<p>The Prime Minister and the other Ministers were jealous of Birbal because he was Akbar's favourite.</p>
<p>One day, in front of the Emperor, the Prime Minister said to Birbal, "Well now, the Emperor and I have decided to give you a job. We feel that you will be able to do this job better than anybody else."</p>
<p>The Minister asked, "May I know what the job is?"</p>
<p>"From now on you will be the master of all the dogs in the Empire. You will be in charge of them, and they will have to obey you."</p>
<p>Immediately the Minister said, "Since you have given me this post, let me ask you to stand up. I am the master of all the dogs in the Empire, and you also belong to that group, so you have to listen to me. Stand up then!"</p>
<p>Akbar was most amused by this reply.</p>  </div>
