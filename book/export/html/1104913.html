<p>My Lord,<br /> I wish to know from You personally<br /> The differences that exist<br /> Between You and me.</p>
<p>“My child,<br /> There are countless differences<br /> But I shall name only three:<br /> Unlike Me, every day<br /> You have a very tight schedule.<br /> You have no time to write to Me.<br /> You have no time to speak to Me.<br /> You do not even have the time<br /> To speak to me over your heart-phone.<br /> I write to you every day.<br /> I try to speak to you every day.<br /> But alas, alas and alas,<br /> I get no response from you.<br /> Now the second difference is this:<br /> I constantly make fun of myself.<br /> Alas, you have not yet learnt<br /> This particular art,<br /> And I have no idea whether<br /> You will ever be able to learn this art.<br /> The third difference is this:<br /> You think and you feel<br /> That you are indispensable<br /> There in Heaven and here on earth.<br /> In My case, I am absolutely sure<br /> That not only this world,<br /> But also all the worlds<br /> That are in existence,<br /> Can live without Me.<br /> In a sense, you are badly needed<br /> Here, there and all-where.<br /> In My case, nobody wants Me,<br /> Nobody needs Me.<br /> I am left all alone.”</p>
