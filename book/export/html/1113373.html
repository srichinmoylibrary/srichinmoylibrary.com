<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes they are not beings at all, but only the souls of deceased relatives. Sometimes they are old and friendly acquaintances from the previous incarnations. Sometimes they are fate-making angels or deities. Sometimes they are fruitful imaginations of the seeker's soulful aspiration.</p>  </div>
