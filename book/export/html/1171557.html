<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My philosophy is oneness. The life-tree has so many branches. I am a bird, seated on one branch of the life-tree, and you are another bird, seated on another branch. Like that, we are all seated on different branches, but we all claim the life-tree as our own. It is your tree, and it is also my tree. You and I are seated on different branches, but these branches cannot be separated from the tree.</p>  </div>
