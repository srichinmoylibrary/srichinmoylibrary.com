<p>His soul does not know<br /> How to tell a lie.<br /> His heart knows<br /> How to tell a lie<br /> But it will not do so.</p>
<p>He asked God if he should<br /> Love them equally.<br /> God said to him he must,<br /> For God Himself<br /> Loves them equally.</p>
<p>Because of God's love for his soul,<br /> God did not burden it<br /> With falsehood-load.<br /> Because of God's love for his heart,<br /> God warns and cautions it<br /> Against falsehood-net.</p>
