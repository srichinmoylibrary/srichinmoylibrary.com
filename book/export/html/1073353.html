<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is a truth which must be experienced. If you go deep within, you will see that you are of God and for God. We are all playing God’s divine Game. When we realise the Highest, we will see that we are conscious parts of God. You yourself will one day realise that God and you are one and inseparable.</p>  </div>
