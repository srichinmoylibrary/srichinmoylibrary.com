<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is true in a certain real sense. The spiritual Master or the cosmic god does not create a new physical form, but rather he acts in and through people or other forms to achieve something or inspire someone. A new physical form is not created, but instead the consciousness of the cosmic god or the Master enters into an individual so that he may act as an instrument.</p>
<p>Also, a Master can reveal different faces or make his own features appear as someone elseâ€™s face. I had a disciple in Puerto Rico who invoked me so soulfully and devotedly that others used to see my face while looking at her. I am male and she is female, but they used to clearly see my face on hers.</p>  </div>
