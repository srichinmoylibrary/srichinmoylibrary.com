<p>My Lord, I miss You.<br /> “My child, I miss you too.”<br /> My Lord, I love You.<br /> “My child, I love you too.”<br /> My Lord, I need You.<br /> “My child, I need you too.”<br /> My Lord,<br /> Will I ever be able<br /> To become like You?<br /> “My child,<br /> That is My only Dream,<br /> My only Dream,<br /> My only Dream.<br /> I want you to be like Me,<br /> Another God.”<br /> My Lord,<br /> Will I be happy then?<br /> “My child,<br /> That I do not know<br /> And I do not want to know.”<br /> My Lord,<br /> Will I be miserable then?<br /> “My child,<br /> That I do not know<br /> And I do not want to know.”<br /> God, my Lord, my Father,<br /> My Eternity’s All,<br /> Such being the case,<br /> I do not want to be another God.<br /> You remain what You eternally are<br /> And please allow me to remain<br /> What I am.<br /> I want to mingle<br /> With the dust of Your Feet<br /> Throughout Eternity.</p>
