<p><em>(Evening. Barin, with some of his friends, experiments with a Planchette. Aurobindo keenly observes it. They invoke the spirit of Ramakrishna. The Planchette moves.)</em></p>
<p>BARIN: Thakur, Thakur, through your infinite kindness you have appeared before us. Please tell us whether our freedom movement will be a success or not.</p>
<p><em>(The spirit of Ramakrishna remains silent.)</em></p>
<p>BARIN: Thakur, pray give us your advice. We shall obey you.</p>
<p><em>(Ramakrishna continues silent.)</em></p>
<p>BARIN: It seems you are displeased with us. We are helpless, blind human beings. Show us the way to fulfil our ideal.</p>
<p><em>(The Planchette writes out the sentence: "Mandir gado, mandir gado" ["Make temples, make temples"]. The spirit disappears.)</em></p>
<p>BARIN: Sejda, Ramakrishna has at last said, "Mandir gado, mandir gado." What does it signify?</p>
<p>AURO: I believe Ramakrishna Paramahansa wishes us to establish temples in our hearts.</p>
<p>BARIN: What for?</p>
<p>AURO. Barin have faith in Ramakrishna, He was the dearest child of Mahakali. He was God manifest in a human being. We shall in the years to come realise the significance of making temples in the inmost recesses of our hearts.</p>  </div>
