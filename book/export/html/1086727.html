<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is asking your Guru to tell you what you were in your previous incarnation. In your previous incarnation you were born in Australia. You were a school teacher. You used to strike the students; therefore they hated you. But then later on you gave up beating. You showed your students love and affection and they loved you most dearly.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>I am telling you a great secret: you are a fantastic Dream of God</em>, Agni Press, 1974<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/gsdg-17</p></small>    </div>  </body>
