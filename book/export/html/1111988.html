  <h1 class="book-heading">A young admirer</h1>
  
 
<p>As I was walking in front of my house at 1:30, a young man came out of a car and said, "Run and become, become and run." He was not joking. He was showing tremendous admiration for me and sympathy with my pain. He was asking, "How did you get hurt?"</p>
<p>He said, "I tell my friends about you, and they don't believe that you live in that house. I tell them that the picture on the Santana and John McLaughlin album was taken right in front of your house. They don't believe me."</p>
<p>Then I came back and told Databir, who was in front of my house, to go and talk to him. The young man had said that he was a pianist, so Databir told him about Haridas.</p>
<p>Databir also told him about the Cologne concert. Then he asked Databir, "How can a famous person like Sri Chinmoy walk all by himself in a poor community?" He lives in Manhattan. He had a good conversation with Databir. Databir came to my house to get a book for him.</p>
<p>All of a sudden he got a call on his beeper, so he left to call his company. He said, "Tell him I will definitely come back."</p>
