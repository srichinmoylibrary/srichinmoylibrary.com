<p>Today I went for a haircut. The last time I went, the barber was telling me how strong I am. This time also he said I am very strong. After he had finished, I stood up to go. He put his hand on my arm and said, “Sandow! Sandow!”</p>
<p>I said, “Why are you calling me Sandow?”</p>
<p>He said, “I watched you on television. You are another Sandow.”</p>
<p>Then he was cutting jokes with me. He said, “Do you want me to trim your eyebrows?”</p>
<p>I said, “Why? Do you want me to go to jail?”</p>
<p>In India, we feel that if you shave the eyebrows you look totally different. Thieves do it to change their appearance. So I did not want him to alter my appearance.</p>
