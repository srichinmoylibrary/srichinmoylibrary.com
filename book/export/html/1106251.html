<p>Now I have lifted a total of more than 228 tons on the standing calf raise machine in a single workout — in 39 minutes! True, all the muscles in my shoulders and back are crying! But for those who have been my witnesses, an unprecedented feat of strength has been performed right in front of their eyes — inside this room and inside their hearts.</p>
