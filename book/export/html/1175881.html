<p>O my vital,<br /> I followed you closely.<br /> At the end of your path<br /> What I discovered was frustration.</p>
<p>O my mind,<br /> I followed you closely.<br /> At the end of your path<br /> What I discovered was contradiction.</p>
<p>O my heart,<br /> I followed you closely.<br /> At the end of your path<br /> What I discovered was illumination.</p>
<p>O my soul,<br /> I followed you closely.<br /> At the end of your path<br /> What I discovered was perfection.<br /> It was there that God blessed me<br /> With His most powerful<br /> Reality-Existence-Smile.</p>
