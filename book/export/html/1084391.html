<p>I saw the feet of a thief.<br /> I felt sorry for them<br /> Because<br /> They have no rest.<br /> Even during the night<br /> Ignorance compels them to run.</p>
<p>I saw the feet of a saint.<br /> I felt sorry for them<br /> Because<br /> They have no rest.<br /> Even when he is in his own room<br /> His followers cannot live<br /> Without touching and polluting his feet.</p>
