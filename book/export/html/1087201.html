<p>In Japan, Maral told me that he had found an instrument that he thought I might like. He said, "Guru, it is very expensive, but if you like it, I will buy it for you." But I didn't like the instrument, so I told him not to buy it.</p>
<p>The store also had some Western flutes. I said, "I would like to buy one," but the man wouldn't allow me to try the flutes because they were too expensive.</p>
<p>I said, "Without examining the flute or playing it, how can I buy it?"</p>
<p>The man said, "No, good musicians don't need to play the flutes. I won't allow it."</p>
<p>We had pamphlets that said I play the flute at my concerts, but the man couldn't read English. So we went to another store and found a Yamaha keyboard. I said, "Maral, just buy it."</p>
<p>Then I left the place and Maral bought it.</p>
