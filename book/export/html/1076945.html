<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. In each incarnation we are given more opportunity and a better situation for our spiritual development. In the case of a spiritual person, he will be born into a spiritual family where he will be inspired and encouraged to live the spiritual life from his very birth.</p>
<p>Each incarnation is a stepping stone towards our ultimate God-realisation. When one has consciously aspired in his last incarnation, his future birth will hold more opportunities for his spiritual progress.</p>  </div>
