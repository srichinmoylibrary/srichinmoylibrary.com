<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At night, nature is fast asleep and everybody wants to sleep. Your children are sleeping. They are not making a noise. This is the time spiritual people use for their work, since it is the best time to create. At night, nature is helping you with her peace. You are getting additional power. So you have to be very wise. Create at night when the forces are best for you.</p>
<p>The feeling of being old signifies wisdom. You have wisdom at that moment, whereas others don't have it. A certain maturity has given you wisdom and the sense of being an experienced, wise soul.</p>  </div>
