<p><em>(</em>Dharma/ and the <em>Karmayogin</em> Office. Aurobindo and Nolini. Time: evening.)/</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Nolini, have you any desire to learn European languages, French, for instance, to start with?</p>
<p>NOLINI: <em>(Taken aback)</em> If you are pleased to help me, most certainly.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: The National College [fn:9] has a stock of my books, I have lent them to it. <em>(Handing him a short note)</em> Take this to the College Library. They will give you a volume of Moliƒçre's works.</p>
<p><em>(Nolini goes out with the note and returns with the book.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(Selecting </em>L'Avare/)/ Start here.</p>
<p>NOLINI: <em>(Overwhelmed with surprise)</em> Such a big leap for a beginner!</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(Smiling)</em> Shake off old ideas. Come along with me. Read as I do.</p>
<p><em>(Sri Aurobindo reads, Nolini follows — the former occasionally correcting the latter in pronunciation.)</em></p>
<p>Pronunciation well learnt, the thoughts and sentiments will present no difficulty. I will facilitate your understanding by writing the English meanings of difficult words in the margins.</p>  </div>
