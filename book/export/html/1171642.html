<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, science is not my fort√©. I am totally ignorant of scientific developments. Since I know nothing about science, it would be the height of folly on my part to say anything about it. Only I know a little about the inner life, being a God-lover and Truth-seeker.</p>  </div>
