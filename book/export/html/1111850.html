<p>After finishing the New York Marathon, Toshiko D'Elia was so disappointed with her time. She asked Tina to tell me. Toshiko was so grateful to Tina for helping her after she finished. She was in terrible agony. Everyone was giving her this and that to drink. Tina massaged her and helped her like anything.</p>
<p>She is now quite old. She started running at the age of 40. Her daughter inspired her. Before that she could not run even one block. That means she was not a faster runner than I was when I started. Now, in a few years she has become such a great runner. She is a world record holder for women over 40. So still I can have hope. The best thing for me is not to give up.</p>
