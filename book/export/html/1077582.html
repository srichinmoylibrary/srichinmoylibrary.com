<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, in the soul’s world there are significant events, but there is no manifestation. There can be progress, but not in the sense of evolution. If one soul is mixing with a higher soul, a more illumined soul, then naturally the very presence of the higher soul will be a great inspiration for it. If you are beside a spiritual Master, a very great spiritual person, in the soul’s world, then naturally you will benefit.</p>  </div>
