<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em>: When we dream, our souls visit many different planes of consciousness. Our soul is like a bird. Today it sits on one branch, tomorrow it can sit on another branch and the day after tomorrow on a third branch. Every time we have a dream, there is the possibility for our soul to enter into different planes of consciousness. If the soul wants to, it can enter one particular plane many times. But, like us, the soul enjoys variety. It likes to visit different states of consciousness. Novelty gives us joy; so also in the case of the soul. By visiting new planes of consciousness it acquires more light and, at the same time, offers light from its own self. There is mutual giving and taking.</p>  </div>
