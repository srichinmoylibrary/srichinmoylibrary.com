<p><em>Sri Chinmoy gave the following inspirational talk at a memorial service for former Ambassador Allard Lowenstein held at the United Nations.</em></p>
<p>Because I need God's Love,</p>
<p>God's Compassion saves me.</p>
<p>Because I need God's Compassion,</p>
<p>God's Forgiveness illumines me.</p>
<p>Because I need God's Forgiveness,</p>
<p>God's Satisfaction inspires me.</p>
<p>Because I need God's Satisfaction,</p>
<p>God's Oneness liberates me.</p>
<p>Because I need God's Oneness,</p>
<p>God gives me His Eternity's Boat,</p>
<p>His Infinity's Sea</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>His Immortality's Shore.</p>
<p>Because I need God's Boat, God's Sea</p>
<p>And God's Shore,</p>
<p>God gives me two things that He loves most</p>
<p>In His entire creation:</p>
<p>A sleepless cry and a deathless smile.</p>
