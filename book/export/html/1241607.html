<p>This morning Savyasachi was holding Sona as I was walking to the car. Three dogs happened to pass by, and Sona started barking. One German lady who is so nice to me tried to console me. She smiled and said, “All dogs bark.”</p>
<p>Then a gentleman greeted me. The man was laughing. He said, “I am sorry he is barking, but he is the boss!”</p>
