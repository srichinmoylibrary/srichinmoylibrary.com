<h2>Question: Is there a coordinated effort in all countries to study Yoga, philosophy and transcendental truth, searching for a spiritual approach to God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To some extent, there is. Most countries are aspiring and praying to God according to their own capacity. What I spoke on today was based on Indian philosophy, spirituality and yoga. Here, at the same time, I must say that when I use the term "Indian", it is not that I come here to preach Indian thought and Indian ideas. Far from it. God-realisation, spirituality and yoga are for each individual and for all countries. But there are specific methods we apply to realise God. As far as aspiration is concerned, the entire earth is aspiring. At one particular place we can notice that the aspiration is intense, whereas in some other places, the aspiration may not be so intense. Mother Earth is aspiring, whether we believe it or not. Whether we are conscious of it or not, Mother Earth is constantly aspiring to embody the highest Truth, to manifest the highest Truth here on earth. So aspiration is all-encompassing and all-pervading, and, at the same time, its mounting radiance is an ever-burning flame.</p>  </div>
