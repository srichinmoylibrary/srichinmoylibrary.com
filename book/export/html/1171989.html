<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to do it seven times, that is more than enough. But it need not be seven. If you can do it soulfully, once is more than enough. When it comes to, "I am Thy glowing Grace," if you can feel this, then all your problems will be solved. That particular line is your salvation: "I am Thy glowing Grace." If you can sing that line soulfully and feel actually that you are the Supreme's glowing Grace, then all your problems can be solved.</p>  </div>
