<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The things you print can carry more of my vibration, dear Vishma, if you can convince yourself that you are working only to please the Supreme in me. Before you take up any job, meditate on the Supreme in me; while you are working meditate on the Supreme in me, and once you have finished your work also meditate on me. At your journey's start, during your journey's course and at your journey's end, if you can think of me even for a few fleeting seconds, then definitely the things that you print will be able to carry my vibration to a considerable extent.</p>  </div>
