<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the Master is the right one, then the student is bound to feel the truth in the Master's words, because the Master is the disciple's own higher reality. If somebody is my Master, I have to know that my Master is my own illumined reality. He is not a different reality. No! Just because he is my higher, more illumined reality, I have to listen to him. If he is a different person, a different reality, then naturally I won't be able to listen to him all the time and subscribe to his views. This moment he is telling something right, but the next moment he may tell me something totally wrong. But if he is my reality, which is infinitely more illumined, then how can he be different from me? And it won't be difficult for me to listen to my highest reality.</p>  </div>
