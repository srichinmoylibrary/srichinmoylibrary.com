<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is your unconscious mind or subconscious mind. In the unconscious mind nothing is clear. Things seem to be clear to you but actually they are not at all clear. If you are entering into a dark room, you may think that everything is in order. But when someone else who has more light enters into the room, you see that it is all chaos and confusion and you are unable to pick out anything.</p>  </div>
