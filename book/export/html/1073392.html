<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> <em>Moksha</em> is liberation from ignorance and bondage. When a person attains liberation, his inner being is flooded with divine Peace. Outwardly he may throw himself into multifarious activities, but his inner being is constantly surcharged with the highest Silence, Peace and Bliss. He becomes like the vast ocean. On the surface you will see waves and agitation, but deep within it is all peace.</p>  </div>
