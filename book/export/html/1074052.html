<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The extension of consciousness means the extension of the dream-reality of the parents. Parents are constantly dreaming in and through their child, so the soul of the child is consciously assimilating the dream-reality of the parents. When the child assimilates the parents dream-reality in the inner world, then in the outer world we will see the extension of the parents’ consciousness in the child.</p>  </div>
