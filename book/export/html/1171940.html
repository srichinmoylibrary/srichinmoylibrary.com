<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As a student you come to a school and see the teacher and the students. If they satisfy you, if you feel an affinity with them, then you go to that particular school. Similarly, you come to a spiritual Master and see his students and hear about his path. If you feel an affinity with the path, then it is meant for you. When you see a Master, if he gives you intense joy, if you feel he can easily solve your problems or has the capacity to illumine you, if you experience a feeling of oneness, then undoubtedly he is your Master. If you don't feel an affinity with the Master and his students, it doesn't mean that you are insincere. No, you <em>are</em> sincere, but he is just not the Master for you.</p>  </div>
