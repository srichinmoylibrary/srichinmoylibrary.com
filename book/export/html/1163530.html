<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Delight is God, the ever-transforming Reality. If you ask me, "Who is God?" my answer will be Delight. If you ask me, "Why is God?" my answer will be Delight. If you ask me, "How is God?" my answer will be Delight. There can be no question on earth that cannot be answered by using the one supreme word, "Delight." For any question you ask, only one answer is correct, and that answer is Delight.</p>  </div>
