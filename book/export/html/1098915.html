<p>One evening at our Brooklyn apartment, somebody left the candles burning on the shrine by mistake after the Centre meditation was over. I was in my own room and suddenly I saw smoke entering. I ran into the meditation room. By that time the fire was very serious. The whole place was ablaze. The curtains were completely burnt and the flames had reached the top of the shrine.</p>
<p>I went outside the room and stood on the roof. The distance between the place where I stood and Mother Kali’s picture was only thirty feet or so. From there I uttered the name of the Supreme three times very loudly from my inmost consciousness.</p>
<p>Then a miraculous thing happened. When I chanted “Supreme” three times, the fire calmed down like an obedient child. Although the fire had reached my Mother Kali’s picture, the picture itself was not burnt. But the glass was shattered and the picture frame and the cardboard behind the picture were reduced to ashes. X was searching for water, but she could not find the kitchen because there was so much smoke.</p>
<p>Then the fire brigade arrived and covered everything with water. They also began throwing things out of the window. So many things were destroyed. They caused so much damage.</p>
<p>At four o’clock in the morning, when it was all over, I saw my Mother Kali vividly with my naked eyes. She was dancing. She said, “Let the house be burned to ashes, but I have saved my children!”</p>
<p>My Mother Kali is my dearest, she is my everything. She is the protector. Thousands and millions of times she has saved me. It is her Feet that can give us our liberation and our salvation sooner than at once. Immediately she can give us everything that God possesses.</p>
<p>Many years later, Mahavishnu made the throne in my meditation room and he put that picture of Mother Kali on top of the throne. If you look closely, you can see that it is singed around the edges.</p>  </div>
