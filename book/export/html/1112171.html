<p>A few days ago, as usual, I went to USAir to run. After I had done my running, I went to my favourite gift store, where I go every day. The man who works there comes from Pakistan. He welcomed me.</p>
<p>I bought a copy of Time magazine and a British newspaper, The Sun. It had an article about somebody who had heard the voice of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Every day I buy a piece of candy for whoever drives me. I usually do not eat any myself, but today I wanted to have some. So I said to myself, "Today I must buy something really new."</p>
<p>I saw something new that looked like chocolate with birds on it. It looked very nice. I said, "One for me and one for Maral!"</p>
<p>Then I said to myself, "Yesterday I promised Saroja that the first thing I would eat today would be one of her brownies." She had baked them for her birthday and left one for me in the refrigerator at my house.</p>
<p>I said, "I have to be a sincere person at least one time." So I decided not to eat the candy until after I ate her brownie.</p>
<p>When I got home, I ate Saroja's brownie and then I said, "Now let me have this candy." But when I opened it up, I saw it was not candy at all. It was a bunch of cards with the pictures of basketball players, saying how great the players were.</p>
<p>O God, this was the candy I got for Maral and myself!</p>
