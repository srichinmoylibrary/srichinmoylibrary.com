<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have an automobile, take it as part of your physical body. Whatever attitude you have toward your body, take the same attitude toward your car. If you neglect the body, you will die. Then you cannot realise or manifest God. The body is of paramount importance, but it is not for luxury. My disciples are not millionaires, and they are not using their cars to enjoy themselves or to wallow in the pleasures of ignorance. But in this modern age, especially in America, a car is a necessity.</p>
<p>In America we are fighting against time. If we live in an Indian village, then we can make friends with eternal time. But here every second counts. If we can do two things in one second, then why should we do only one thing? If we have a car, it does not mean that we will not walk or run or take exercise. But if our office is in Manhattan and we are living in Connecticut, then what will we do?</p>
<p>Since it is a necessity, we must keep the vehicle in good shape. It helps us considerably in fighting against time and achieving things sooner than at once. In this case, we have to give due importance to a vehicle that is more than ready to help us.</p>  </div>
