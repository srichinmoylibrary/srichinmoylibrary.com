<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Early in the morning God asks His Vital-horse to go and play with His Heart-deer. In the evening He asks His Vital-horse to eat with His Soul-lion. Now in the morning, God's Heart-deer inspires His vital-horse to run the fastest and reach the farthest Goal. And in the evening, God's Soul-lion inspires His Vital-horse to devour the universal ignorance so that God can manifest His immortal and supreme Love upon earth.</p>  </div>
