<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme, I do not think of You. Yet You forgive me.</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme, I do not pray to You. Yet You forgive me.</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme, I do not meditate on You. Yet You forgive me.</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme, I do not serve You. Yet You forgive me.</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme, I do not love You. Yet You forgive me.</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme, I do everything wrong and I say everything wrong. Yet You forgive me at every moment. Why, why, my Lord Beloved Supreme?</p>
<p>"My child, I am the eternal Dreamer and you are My Eternity's Dream. In My Existence-Consciousness-Reality I am dreaming in and through you at every moment. You want satisfaction. By not thinking of Me, by not praying to Me, by not meditating on Me, by not serving Me, by not loving Me, you will never have satisfaction. You can have satisfaction only by loving Me and claiming Me as your own, very own.</p>
<p>"In My case, too, I cannot get satisfaction, full satisfaction, unless I can make you a perfect seeker and a perfect human being. Throughout Eternity I have been longing for humanity's perfection. This perfection needs My infinite Compassion and My birthless and deathless Forgiveness. If necessary, I shall wait throughout Eternity to make each creation of Mine perfectly perfect, for this is My Eternity's Dream.</p>
<p>"I forgive you because I know there shall come a time when you will become a choice instrument of Mine. Not only that, you will become My representative here on earth. In you and through you I shall bless the world with a special Message: the Message of universal oneness.</p>
<p>"My child, do not be sad that you do not think of Me, that you do not pray to Me, that you do not meditate on Me, that you do not serve Me and that you do not even love Me. Do not be doomed to disappointment. There shall come a time when you will be awakened, fully awakened. My unconditional Compassion will awaken your entire being, your earthly life. Then you will think of Me sleeplessly, pray to Me breathlessly, meditate on Me soulfully, serve Me self-givingly and love Me unconditionally. That golden Hour is fast approaching. I am all Love and you, My child, must be fully prepared to receive Me with all your heart's love and love, gratitude and gratitude."</p>
