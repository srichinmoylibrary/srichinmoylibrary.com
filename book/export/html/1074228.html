<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes they do. I have personal experiences of some witchcraft in Florida, where I came across an occultist who was expert in all these undivine things. Those who are black magicians also have all kinds of undivine forces around them or in their room. Only occultists will see something on the physical plane. But ordinary people may feel tremendous uneasiness if these things take place around them.</p>  </div>
