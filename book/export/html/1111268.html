<p>This morning a fat lady, my neighbour-friend, was standing with her two dogs near my house. She saw me run by and then she started walking slowly across the street. By the time she reached the other side, I was back from running around the block. She said, "You run so fast. One, two, three, and you are here!" She could not cover fifteen metres in the time I took to run 400 metres.</p>
