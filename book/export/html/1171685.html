<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is very beautiful, but I would like you to add one line at the bottom to make it clear that this restaurant is part and parcel of a high vision. In this way, your customers will know the purpose of the restaurant. Otherwise, there are millions of restaurants on earth which do not have a divine purpose. This restaurant exists to expound our philosophy. So I feel you should make it very clear in your brochure that this restaurant exists to awaken and serve mankind in accordance with our worldwide philosophy and vision.</p>  </div>
