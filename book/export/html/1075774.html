<p><em>(Calcutta. Aurobindo's residence. Aurobindo and Sudhir Sarkar, a young revolutionary and a great admirer of Aurobindo, living as a member of his family.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Can you do one thing for me?</p>
<p>SUDHIR: Certainly. Please tell me what.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Take this note to Sundari Mohan Das. Just read it.</p>
<p>SUDHIR: <em>(Reads aloud)</em> "The bearer is my friend, Sudhir. Kindly give him your opinion by word or in writing." <em>(Turning towards Aurobindo)</em> I am not your equal. How on earth could I ever be called your friend? In learning, in intelligence and in age, in what respect am I your equal?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Why can't you be my friend? You love the country, so do I. Our ideal is one. So we are friends.</p>
<p><em>(Young Sudhir has the first taste of humility of the great, and his admiration for Aurobindo grows a hundredfold.)</em></p>  </div>
