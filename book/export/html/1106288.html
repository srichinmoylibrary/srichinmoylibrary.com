<p>One owner of a gym in San Francisco has become very devoted to me. He says that one day I will be able to lift up 20,000 pounds. He has even drawn a sketch of the apparatus.</p>
<p>One girl could not lift something in his gym. He asked her to meditate on my picture. Then, after she meditated, she was able to lift the weight. Some people who lift weights in his gym say my name: “Sri! Sri!”</p>
