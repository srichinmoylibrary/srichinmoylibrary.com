  <h1 class="book-heading">Nichole’s conversation with God</h1>
  
 
<p>God says, “Nichole, you are so happy. What makes you so happy?”</p>
<p>“God, today my Guru has come to my house. He has blessed me. That is why I am so happy.”</p>
<p>“Where does your Guru live?”</p>
<p>“He lives in America. He comes to Jamaica two or three times a year. My Guru has come to my house! My Guru has blessed me today! My Guru!”</p>
<p>“What do you feel Nichole, when your Guru blesses you?”</p>
<p>“When my Guru blesses me, I feel that I have become as good as he is. When I look at myself, I feel that I have become as great as my Guru is.”</p>
<p>“I am so proud of you, Nichole. Now tell Me, do you want to be always as good and great as your Guru is?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, please tell me how I can be always as good and great as my Guru is.”</p>
<p>“Then every day when you meditate before your Guru’s picture, try to feel that your Guru constantly speaks to Me about you.”</p>
<p>“God, that is extremely easy. From today I shall feel that my Guru constantly speaks to You about me.”</p>
<p>“Then I tell you for sure that you can be as good and great as your Guru.”</p>
<p>“Oh God, I thank You, I thank You.”</p>  </div>
