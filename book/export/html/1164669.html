  <h1 class="book-heading">Nothing</h1>
  
 
<p>Nothing is really powerful. Therefore I do not appreciate.</p>
<p>Nothing is really beautiful. Therefore I do not admire.</p>
<p>Nothing is really meaningful. Therefore I do not learn.</p>
<p>Nothing is really permanent. Therefore I do not keep anything.</p>
<p>Nothing really pleases me. Therefore I feel that my Beloved Lord Supreme is fast approaching me.</p>
<p>Nothing is really going to be perfect. Therefore I do not waste my time in the imaginary perfection-world.</p>
<p>Nothing really increases my love of God. Therefore I do not look around. I just dive deep within and try to depend on my Beloved Lord's unconditional Compassion to increase my love for Him.</p>  </div>
