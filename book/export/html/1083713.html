<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme has been singing only one song, and that is the song of Perfection. Only that one song gives Him satisfaction, and that one Perfection-song He has been singing eternally. But inside that one song, we have to know that countless songs are being sung. It began with one song, but then it entered into myriad songs. A tree is one. But when we look at the hundreds of leaves and flowers and fruits, we see many. Inside the one we are seeing many. Similarly, there is only one song that the Supreme is singing, and that is the song of Perfection. But inside that song there are many songs, countless songs.</p>
<p>When the Supreme sings, He is not using His Mind; He is not using His Heart. He is using His Vision. According to our vision, when two and two become four, that is perfection. But in God's Vision, two and two may become seven, or anything. God's Vision is not bound by the mind. The mind says, "It is this way; it has to be this way. It is not that way." But the Supreme does not want to be bound.</p>
<p>The Supreme's Freedom is not like a mad elephant. He does not use His Freedom to lord it over the world, as we do. His Freedom is His spontaneous movement, from which He comes to get the highest Delight. In each movement He wants to derive the utmost Delight, which He once upon a time derived while creating His creation. He wants to enjoy Himself as the supreme Delight. He wants to enjoy Himself not as the owner of the ocean but as the ocean itself. Again, He wants to enjoy Himself as the tiniest drop in the ocean. He can take the form either of the tiniest drop or of the boundless ocean. Here, the ocean is the one embodying the many. If we look at the ocean, we can call it one. Again, if we individually count the drops, we see it as many. But we know that the drops have a source, and vision will say that the source is one.</p>  </div>
