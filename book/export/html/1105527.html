<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day you can make your surrender to the Supreme in me. Before you make a decision, before you do something, before you even think of something, always have the feeling that there is someone who is inwardly concerned at every moment about your real progress, your real success, the real fulfilment of the Divine in you. When you feel that your Master is all concern inwardly for what you are saying, for what you are doing, for what you are thinking, then you can easily make your constant surrender to the Supreme in me.</p>  </div>
