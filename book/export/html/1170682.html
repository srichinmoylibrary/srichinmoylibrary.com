<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At every moment we have to surrender to God's Will. This surrender has to embody readiness, cheerfulness and willingness â€” the readiness of the mind, the willingness of the heart and the cheerfulness of life itself. At every moment we have to surrender our will to God's Will, and inside our surrender we have to feel the mind's readiness, the heart's willingness and the life's cheerfulness. If we can do this, then definitely we will become a most devoted and most perfect instrument of our Lord Supreme.</p>  </div>
