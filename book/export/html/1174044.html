<p>You may not go<br /> As far as you want to go.<br /> You may not dive<br /> As deep as you want to dive.<br /> You may not fly<br /> As high as you want to fly.<br /> But God can and will<br /> Come to you immediately<br /> The moment you soulfully long for Him,<br /> Only Him,<br /> To visit you.</p>
