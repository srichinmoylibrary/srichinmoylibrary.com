<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Somebody went to a doctor and asked how to lose weight. The doctor said, "Eat as much as you can for as long as you can."</p>
<p>The person said, "Then how am I going to lose weight?"</p>
<p>The doctor said, "If you eat too much, then you are not going to get up. You will just lie in bed all the time. Then you won't go to work and your boss will fire you. If your boss fires you, you will have no money to buy food. Then automatically you will lose weight!"</p>
<p>To lose weight, do not have a long-range goal. Say you have to lose forty pounds. Never think of forty pounds. Only think of five pounds as your goal. You cannot climb up the Himalayas overnight.</p>  </div>
