SCA 1139-1145. Questions asked by children and parents on 21 October 1988 at The Oneness-Family School in Washington, D.C.</p>
<h2>Question: Are you a famous painter?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Good boy, I am not famous, but I paint. I have painted my inner life and now I will paint my outer life.</p>
<p>It took me hundreds and thousands of years, thousands and thousands of years to paint the inner life. And now I have started painting the outer life. God alone knows when I will complete painting my outer life.</p>
<p>With my inner painting I cried and cried for God the Creator. With my outer painting I am smiling and smiling at God the creation. We are all God's creation, you and I and all of us.</p>  </div>
