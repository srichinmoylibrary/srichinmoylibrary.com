<p>When Mr. Mehrotra was transferred to Moscow as First Secretary in the Indian Embassy, he was succeeded by Alan Nazareth. Mr. Nazareth was very young, promising, dynamic and energetic.</p>
<p>He came when I was about to leave the Indian Consulate and so I only saw him for a short time. Strangely enough, our paths have crossed many times in the intervening years.</p>
<p>He and his wife came to our programme at the United Nations in 1987. Two years later, in December 1989, I happened to be in Cairo. Mr. Nazareth was then the Indian Ambassador to Egypt. He graciously attended our Peace Concert and gave a most moving introduction. Afterwards he invited me and some of my students to come to his residence. There we had a long conversation.</p>  </div>
