<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The difference between experience and realisation is this: a realised person can say, “I and my Father are one,” or “God and I are one,” whereas an aspirant who has had many spiritual experiences can only feel that he is slowly but inevitably growing into the realisation of God. Conscious union with the Highest is called realisation. But if we get just a glimpse of the highest Truth, this experience is infinitely inferior to realisation. Experience tells us what we will eventually become. Realisation makes us conscious of what we truly are: absolutely one with God, forever, through Eternity.</p>
<p>It is good to have an experience, but we have to know that experience does not last. It is better to have realisation, even if this realisation is not total realisation and does not completely change our nature. Realisation is infinitely better than experience. Experience is a fleeting joy; realisation is a lasting joy. But even this lasting joy does not necessarily have all the divine qualities, such as Peace, Power and Wisdom. When we embody the Vision in its totality, we go one step deeper. The embodiment of Truth gives us infinite confidence in our inner life as well as our outer life. Again, mere embodiment is not enough. We have to reveal the Vision. Someone may have power, but unless he brings this power to the fore and reveals it, it cannot fulfil him either here on earth or there in Heaven. Again, even though we reveal without what we have within, revelation is not the final stage. The final stage is manifestation. What we have and what we are must be manifested here on earth. When manifestation is accomplished, then all is done.</p>  </div>
