<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes it happens that you are under the impression that someone is making real inner progress, but it may not be so at all. Some people try to show off about their inner progress or they deceive themselves. Sometimes you see someone who is all the time praying and meditating. You get the impression that he is making wonderful progress. But God alone knows what he is doing, whether he is thinking of God or just deceiving himself. But if someone really makes progress, then rest assured that his outer life will also undergo considerable change.</p>  </div>
