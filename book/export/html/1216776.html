<p>When I was waiting on line in the immigration area here at Kennedy Airport, a young girl behind me gave me a smile and started talking to me. She said, "Do you mind? I am behind you but I am very tired, very exhausted. Can I go before you?"</p>
<p>She was a young girl of 23 or 24 years, and I am an old man. She was not an American, because we were both in the alien area, but I thought perhaps she was a French girl. There were many people on line, but she asked only to go ahead of me. After me, she couldn't go forward anymore because I was at the front of the line. I didn't see if she was actually behind me on line to start with. Perhaps this is how she got to the front of the line from somewhere near the back.</p>
