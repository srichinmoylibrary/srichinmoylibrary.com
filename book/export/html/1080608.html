<p><em>Peter (Leonard Bernstein's assistant):</em> Can you wait a second?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I am waiting, infinitely patient. <em>(Taking Haridas' hand)</em> Olivier, c'est incroyable, ce que tu as fait! <em>(They continue speaking in French.)</em></p>
<p><em>Haridas:</em> Mr. Bernstein just said that Guru writes divine counterpoint.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> He has no idea he is writing counterpoint. <em>(To Sri Chinmoy)</em> If I say 'counterpoint' to you, you will ask what that is. <em>(To the group)</em> But he has written a counterpoint like Bach. Every phrase goes with every other phrase, so that no matter what you do, you can't miss. That doesn't mean he <em>(indicating Haridas)</em> has not worked very hard to make the right things go with the right things. I am so impressed, I can't say! My ego is not impressed at all, but my musical spirit is very, very deeply impressed.</p>
<p>It is incredible the way you sing. And not one embarrassed face! That is what I was looking for. Usually when people come to sing for me, they blush, they look embarrassed, they kick their shins, they worry if they sing a wrong note. But you are all just so incredibly relaxed and full of breath! You are very lucky people; you know that, of course. I am very lucky now, too.</p>  </div>
