<p>I will never forget my 5-kilometre race today in Caracas. I am such a useless runner! Towards the end Nayana was behind me. I knew she had been struggling, but I thought she had finished and that now she just wanted to run with me. I said, "No, I do not want to run with anybody."</p>
<p>But she said she had pulled a muscle and she was still running the race. She was smiling and running. I thought she was coming to sympathise with me.</p>
<p>Last week I walked a mile and a half during a race. Today I had to walk four or five times, but the rest of the time I ran.</p>
