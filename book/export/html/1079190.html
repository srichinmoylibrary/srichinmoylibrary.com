<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Intrinsically, and by the very fact of your created existence, you are God and you have God. But since you are not consciously aware of it, at the same time you want God and you need God. What you really want and need is not God Himself, but conscious and constant knowledge of God and union with God.</p>  </div>
