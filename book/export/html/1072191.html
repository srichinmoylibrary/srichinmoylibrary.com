<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In your case, it is not that you are actually creating. If the music is not spiritual or divine, then what can you create? If you want to create something with it, you are only adding your capacity to ignorance. At that time you are not expected to create anything. The best thing you can do is try not to be affected by the unspiritual music and remain in a high consciousness. Your best creation is not to be affected by something which is trying to lower your consciousness. Your creation is to maintain your spiritual height. If you can remain in your aspiration, that aspiration itself is creation.</p>  </div>
