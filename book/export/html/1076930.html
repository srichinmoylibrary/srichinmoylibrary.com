<p>Yes, you can develop it daily, if early in the morning, when you get up, you say your prayer to God, "Oh, God, in your creation I only want to see good qualities in others. If bad qualities are around me, or if people are bothering me, then please try to give me the necessary patience so that I can remain full of peace in my outer life. They have done wrong things to me but let me offer them my patience.</p>  </div>
