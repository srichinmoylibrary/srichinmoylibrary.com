<p>This is a story about Calcutta deception. I went to a store to buy cloth to be made into trousers. I selected four or five materials and said, "Please give me two metres of each one."</p>
<p>Then I went browsing in the store. When I was ready to pay, I asked again if they had cut off two metres and they said that they had.</p>
<p>The following day when I took the material to a tailor in Pondicherry, he said, "How can I make trousers for you? This material is not even one metre 75 centimetres."</p>
