<p>"Chinmoy, go to Nolini Sarkar and tell him to give you the synopsis of <em>Dada Thakur.</em> We are going to watch that movie tonight."</p>
<p>I went to Nolini Sarkar for the synopsis. He said that he had already given it to Ranju-da On the way to the Ashram post office I met Ranju-da and told him that Nolini-da wanted the synopsis. He happened to have it in his hand, so he gave it to me and I gave it to Nolini-da. Nolini-da started reading it and noticed that there were many words missing.</p>
<p>Nolini-da said to me: "Chinmoy, everybody thinks that I have a free access to the intuitive world."</p>
<p>I said: "I subscribe to their view wholeheartedly."</p>
<p>"You are all wrong. Anyway, I am not going to waste my intuitive power, which you all feel I have, in filling up the blanks. Go to Nolini Sarkar and tell him that he can use his own intuitive power this time, so that I can preserve mine!"</p>  </div>
