<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are talking to a seeker, just imagine his heart. You don't have to look at his chest or his body in order to see or feel his heart. Just imagine the seeker's heart and then try to feel that what you have is only a heart. Make yourself feel that you do not have a body, you do not have a vital, you do not have a mind what you have is only a heart. Then feel that you, the heart, are becoming one with the heart that is beside you. Two hearts are conversing, and while conversing they are deriving much delight from each other. This delight is the most important thing, not only in God-realisation but also in God-manifestation.</p>  </div>
