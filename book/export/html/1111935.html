<p>When we started the race, I was absolutely the last person. A young girl went ahead of me and told me that she was not going to be last. What an insult! But after two or three hundred metres, she surrendered.</p>
<p>Then, after 600 metres, whom did I see? Vince! He was my first rival. I was watching him and watching him, following him very faithfully. After 1200 metres I saluted him and passed him.</p>
<p>Then I saw Sarama just before we came to a hill. The hill was my worst enemy. I said, "Perhaps those two will go ahead of me." But fortunately they did not go ahead of me.</p>
