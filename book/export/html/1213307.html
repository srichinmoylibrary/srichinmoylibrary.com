<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can overcome the ego and have total humility if one can feel constantly that he is not indispensable, only God is indispensable. God is constantly standing in front of an aspiring individual as a golden opportunity. One has to feel that this opportunity is the only thing that he needs. If he feels that God needs him for a particular purpose which he alone can fulfil, then he is totally lost. One has to feel that his spiritual aspiration itself is the greatest blessing that he can receive from God. There are billions of people on earth who do not care for the spiritual life, who are still spiritually fast asleep. Why is it that one particular individual is conscious of the spiritual life while the others are still sleeping? The moment one is conscious of the spiritual life, he has to feel that he has received the greatest boon from God.</p>  </div>
