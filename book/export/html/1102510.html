<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We all need guidance. The body is our guide; the vital is our guide; the mind is our guide; the heart, which has more knowledge than the other members, is our guide; and the soul, which has infinitely more knowledge and wisdom than the other members, is our inner guide.</p>
<p>If we want to make a comparison, we can say that the vital offers a little more guidance than the body, the mind offers more guidance than the vital and the body put together, and the heart's guidance far exceeds the guidance of the body, vital and mind. Again, the light of the soul offers infinitely more guidance than all the others put together.</p>
<p>Here on earth, millions of people are guided by the body, and millions are guided by the vital and the mind. Until we take the soul or God as our supreme Guide, we get the guide that is most accessible to us.</p>
