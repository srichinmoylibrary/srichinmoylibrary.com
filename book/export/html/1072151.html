<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sport means joy. Sport means delight, inner delight. You know that we came from delight, we grow in delight and at the end of our journeyâ€™s close we enter into delight once again. The greatest gift of art is joy, and joy is the revelation of sport. They go together. But if you achieve joy through art, the joy is different. There the joy is coming in the mental and vital plane, whereas if you achieve joy through sport, it is coming on the physical and vital plane. But the goal of art and the goal of sport are the same. Both embody the same ultimate goal and have the same goal. Inside art is greatest joy and inside sport is greatest joy.</p>  </div>
