<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have reached a certain height and you feel a block? Suppose you have meditated for fifteen minutes or half an hour, and you feel frustration that you are unable to go higher. On that day give up but remember that height, and try to remember the joy of that height. Feel happy that you reached a considerable height, and keep up the ecstasy and joy. The next day you do not have to start from the beginning and climb all the way up again. Just by using your willpower and your previous experiences, you can start very high â€” almost from where you stopped during your previous meditation. You know how far you went up yesterday, and from there you can try to go higher. Keep up your joy about the height you reached the previous day, and the following day make an attempt to go beyond it right from the start.</p>  </div>
