<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God makes thunder by His indomitable Will. Thunder, compared to his indomitable Will, is like a tiny insect compared to an infinite number of tigers, lions and elephants.</p>
<p>How does God talk to souls? God talks to souls with His Light, with His Vision. What is Light? Light is something that is everywhere. And what is Vision? Vision is the capacity of the Light. It is like a lamp and a flame. God's Light is the lamp and His Vision is the flame.</p>  </div>
