<p>When he plays truant from earth,<br /> He fails to learn<br /> The wisdom of sacrifice-light.<br /> When he plays truant from Heaven,<br /> He fails to learn<br /> The vision of God's Silence-height.<br /> When he plays truant from his inner home<br /> His life becomes<br /> A forest of ignorance-night.<br /> When he plays truant from his outer life,<br /> His life becomes<br /> The dance of destruction-fight.</p>
