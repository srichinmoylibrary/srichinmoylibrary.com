<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First you have to ask yourself whether your suspicion has helped you in any way. The answer will be no. It has not helped you at all. On the contrary, it has only lowered your consciousness and lowered your aspiration. If you are wise, you will discard anything that stands in the way of your God-discovery and your soul's manifestation on earth.</p>
<p>Then you have to know where your suspicion comes from. There can be suspicion in the physical and in the vital, but the suspicion that exists in these places is negligible. But the suspicion that is in the mind is like a mountain. So you have to enter into the mind and tell your suspicion, "Look, I have got nothing from you except misery, so why do I need you? For a long time I considered you to be my friend, so I allowed you to remain inside my mind. But now I see that you are only my enemy, so you have to leave. This is my house, absolutely mine! Here you have no place."</p>
<p>Again, you have to realise that nobody and nothing can remain an eternal enemy. Nothing can always remain undivine, for God's Vision is eventually to make everything divine. But in the meantime, you have to cast aside those things that stand in your way inwardly and create problems for you. You have to tell them to remain far away so you can reach your destination. Then, from the destination, you can bring infinite light to them. Or you can say, "Once I reach my destination, if you want to come and visit me, I shall allow you because at that time I shall have the capacity to transform you." Once your mind is illumined, either suspicion will come to you for its transformation and illumination, or your illumined mind shall enter into suspicion to illumine it.</p>
