<p>The Delta Air Lines terminal used to be my favourite place to walk in cold weather. All the workers there liked me. One time the main guard even came up and told me that I would get better exercise if I walked at a difference place in the terminal.</p>
<p>But the assistant manager did not want me to walk there, and he threw me out. He said that I was running, but it was not true.</p>
<p>When I used to go there, I would always see two old ladies who worked in the terminal. Every time they saw me, they would talk to me.</p>
<p>Just the other day one of the ladies saw me. She asked, "Why do you not come anymore?"</p>
<p>I told her, "I am not allowed to come. But now I am going to the USAir terminal. They are very nice to me there."</p>
<p>She was so happy that I had found somewhere to walk.</p>
