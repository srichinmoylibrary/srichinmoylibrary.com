<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Oneness itself is beauty. There cannot be any beauty higher or more illumining and fulfilling than oneness. Just because the world is lacking in oneness, the world is suffering. When there is oneness, beauty is automatically there. God has the universal Consciousness at His disposal; that is why He is all Beauty. When there is inseparable oneness, that oneness itself is beauty. It is the self-revealing light of the divine within us.</p>  </div>
