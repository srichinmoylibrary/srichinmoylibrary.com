<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A real Guru always inspires and also aspires in and through the disciple. His task is to inspire outwardly and aspire inwardly, in and through the disciple. I aspire when I meditate on you in the morning in a secret way, an occult way. But when I am in front of you in the physical form, I inspire you. If you see that I am in a very high, exalted mood, then it inspires you. At the start of your aspiration, you feel that I am inspiring you. Aspiration is already there, but my inner being is illumining your outer being or outer consciousness. Then my aspiration adds true inner growth, inner light. Again, when I am not in the physical form in front of you, then you are bound to feel that while you are aspiring, I am aspiring in and through you. It is like a private teacher who is teaching the student privately what he has to learn. But in this case the student feels that his teacher is his eternal Father, unlike the school teacher.</p>
<p>So, when you are in front of me, mostly it is inspiration that you get from me. Of course, when I am meditating, your aspiration increases. But when I am not with you physically, you have the opportunity to feel that I am aspiring inside you to elevate your consciousness, to take you to the ultimate Goal. This is how a spiritual Master aspires and inspires.</p>  </div>
