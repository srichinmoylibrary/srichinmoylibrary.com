<p><em>(The steamer leaves Calcutta in the small hours of the morning of April 1, l910. Bijoy and Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>BIJOY: Now you are Jyotindranath Mitter, and I am Bankim Chandra Basak. Are we justified in passing ourselves off as other than we are?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: No, not in the eyes of the moralists.</p>
<p>BIJOY: I am the last fellow to go in for morality. But why, of all places, Pondicherry?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: It is His choice.</p>
<p>BIJOY: But how long will you be there?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: As long as He wills.</p>
<p>BIJOY: What will be your plan of work there?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: I will follow whatever plan He reveals to me.</p>
<p>BIJOY: I am afraid your work will be much more inward than now.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: I feel so.</p>
<p>BIJOY: Then we have no place there.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: How? My work will be for all, for all the world.</p>
<p>BIJOY: The purpose?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Supreme Transformation of the world.</p>
<p>BIJOY: Of what nature??</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Ascent of man into the Spirit, descent of the Spirit into man.</p>  </div>
