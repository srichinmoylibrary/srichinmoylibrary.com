<p><em>(May 4, 1908. Aurobindo's residence â€” 48 Grey Street, Calcutta. Aurobindo is asleep. It is 5 a.m.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Sarojini rushes into Aurobindo's room.)</em></p>
<p>SAROJINI: <em>(Waking up Aurobindo)</em> Sejda, Sejda! Police! Police!</p>
<p><em>(Aurobindo gets up. Enter Police Superintendent Creagan and party.)</em></p>
<p>CREAGAN: Are you Mr. Aurobindo Ghosh?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Yes.</p>
<p>CREAGAN: <em>(Pointing to the police)</em> Handcuff and tie him up, ransack the whole house. <em>(Turning to Aurobindo)</em> They say you are a B.A. Is it not beneath your dignity to sleep in such a small, unfurnished room?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: I am poor, and live a poor life.</p>
<p>CREAGAN: <em>(At the top of his voice)</em> Then to become rich you have done all this? Now take the consequences. <em>(To the police)</em> Wait, I'm coming back.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Creagan)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(To himself)</em> Poor obtuse Englishman, how can you appreciate the values of self-imposed poverty and of self-dedication to the cause of one's Motherland?</p>
<p><em>(Enter Krishna Kumar Mitra, Editor of </em>Sanjibani/, uncle of Aurobindo, and solicitor Bhupen Bose. His uncle is unable to resist tears.)/</p>
<p><em>(Re-enter Creagan)</em></p>
<p>BHUPEN: <em>(Addressing Creagan)</em> You are not entitled to treat Aurobindo like that. Take off the handcuffs and the rope.</p>
<p><em>(Creagan orders removal of the handcuffs and the cord.)</em></p>  </div>
