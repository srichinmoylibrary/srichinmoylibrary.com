<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I started my career as a runner, it was as a sprinter. But there is such a difference between your speed and my speed.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Jordan:</em> That's all relative.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Is it not true that your best time for 100 metres is ten seconds?</p>
<p><em>Mr. Jordan:</em> 10.2 for 100 metres, but not any more.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Jesse Owens' best was also 10.2.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Jordan:</em> Yes. In fact, his record was the record that I equalled when I ran 10.2.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Could you kindly tell me your best timing for 200 metres?</p>
<p><em>Mr. Jordan:</em> My best for 200 metres is 20.5, which is not as good by world-class standards. But when I did it, it was close to the record, which was in the neighbourhood of 20.4, I believe. I really don't watch the records as much as I watch the competition with people. The challenges and the records take care of themselves.</p>  </div>
