<p>Today I went walking at St. John's University. Coach Hart came up to me to say hello. I asked him, "Are you Coach Hart?"</p>
<p>He said, "Yes, Sri."</p>
<p>Then I said, "Has Agraha spoken to you?"</p>
<p>He replied, "No problem, no problem! You look fine, you look great!"</p>
<p>I am so grateful to Coach Hart. He is the one who has given me written permission to walk on the track at St. John's.</p>
