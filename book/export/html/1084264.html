<p>Is it his impatience<br /> That scolds<br /> The disciples of his inner circle?<br /> Who can answer?<br /> Not he, not he!<br /> Perhaps God.<br /> Is it his sense of duty<br /> That scolds<br /> The disciples of his inner circle?<br /> Who can answer?<br /> Not he, not he!<br /> Perhaps God.<br /> Is it his unconscious attachment<br /> That scolds<br /> The disciples of his inner circle?<br /> Who can answer?<br /> Not he, not he!<br /> Perhaps God.<br /> Is it his supreme promise<br /> To the Absolute Supreme<br /> That compels him to scold and perfect<br /> The disciples of his inner circle?<br /> Ah, at least he knows how to answer this question.<br /> He needs no God to answer this question,<br /> For his very existence on earth<br /> Is his unmistakable answer.</p>
