<p>God-love is one thing.<br /> If you do not stick to that very thing,<br /> How can God love you,<br /> How can God transform you?<br /> Keep one thought, one will, one soul, one goal.<br /> Then God will not only love you and need you,<br /> But claim you immediately, for Eternity,<br /> As His very own,<br /> His very own.</p>
