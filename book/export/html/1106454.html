<p>Today I lifted 900 pounds on my seated calf raise machine for the second day. This time it was really high. All the sides were clear. When it came down, it made such a sound!</p>
<p>What am I going to do? My present machine cannot go any higher. I shall have to ask Bishwas and Sumadhur to add more weight.</p>
<p>Today is Grandfather’s Day. You are seeing that this Grandfather has so much strength!</p>
