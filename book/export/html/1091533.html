<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The role of the subconscious is to disturb our inner peace, inner joy, inner light. We have to bring down Light and Purity from above into the subconscious plane to illumine it. Otherwise our subconscious and the unconscious parts always stand in the way of our spiritual achievement.</p>
<p>In the subconscious plane everything is chaotic, unillumined, unlit and fearful. It is important in the spiritual life to clear the jungle of the subconscious plane. But how can we do it? We can do it through constant aspiration and dedication to the Light that is ever descending from above. Each individual seeker has to illumine the darkness in his subconscious world, or the subconscious will continue to stand as an obstacle to his pursuit of God-realisation.</p>  </div>
