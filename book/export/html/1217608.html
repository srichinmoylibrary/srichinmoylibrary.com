<p>Jesus came. The world heard. Jesus went. The world saw. Jesus smiles. The world becomes.</p>
<p>Jesus wanted. The world gave not. The world wanted. Jesus gave. In addition, He became.</p>
<p>Jesus had the chance to tell the world the matchless virtue of Forgiveness. Jesus did not have the chance to tell the world the unavoidable necessity of the Sword.</p>
<p>Jesus human birth was the Question. His Divine Death was not only an Answer, but The Answer.</p>
<p>God was more than successful in sending down His Son to the earth. Humanity suffered worse than Defeat in not receiving the Son.</p>
<p>Jesus had. The world needed. The world had. Jesus accepted.</p>
<p>Jesus did. He unveiled Himself. The world did. It veiled Itself.</p>
<p>God smiled through Jesus' eyes. Humanity cried through Jesus' eyes.</p>
<p>Jesus was Mary's earthly creation. Mary was His spiritual creation. She protected the Plant. The Tree sheltered Her. And She within herself shelters His Father's entire creation.</p>
<p>Sensuality cannot live in Purity. But Purity can live in sensuality. Mary's Purity touches not only the ceaseless flow of human impurity, but also its fount: Ignorance.</p>
<p>Human impurity knows only how to cry out. Mary's divine Purity certainly listens to its cry. But Her dynamic wand must wait for the Hour of God. Furthermore, the receptivity of every individual is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>Jesus' body showed the earth how to rise. Jesus' soul showed the Heavens how to descend.</p>
<p>Earth's blunders are great. God's Compassion is greater. Jesus knew it. He prayed for this blessing: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."</p>
<p>God is both Reason and Faith. Protestantism wants to see God through His immaculate Reason. Catholicism wants to see God through His implicit Faith.</p>
<p>Catholicism feels that Christ eternally Was. Protestantism feels that Christ gradually Became.</p>
<p>Who is our peerless friend? One who consciously or unconsciously helps us to fulfil God's Will within and without. Jesus knew it. "Friend," he addressed Judas. The significance of Judas' kiss Heaven knew, but the earth has yet to know.</p>
