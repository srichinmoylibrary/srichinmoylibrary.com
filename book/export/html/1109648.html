<h2>The outer running and the inner running</h2>


<p>The outer running is a powerful struggle<br />   For a great independence.<br /> The inner running is a soulful cry<br />   For a good interdependence.<br /> Independence brings to the fore<br /> What we have unmistakably deep within:<br />   A freedom-smile.<br /> Interdependence makes us conscious<br /> Of what we eternally are:<br />   A oneness-satisfaction.</p>
<p>The outer running is a burning desire<br /> To achieve everything that we see here on earth.<br /> The inner running is a climbing aspiration<br /> To receive from Above a vast Compassion-Sky<br /> And to give from below a tiny gratitude-flame.</p>
<p>The outer running is an extraordinary success<br />   On the mountain-summit.<br /> The inner running is an exemplary progress<br />   Along Eternity’s sunlit Road.<br /> Success is the ready and immediate acceptance<br /> Of the challenges from difficulties untold.</p>
<p>Progress is the soulful and grateful acceptance<br /> Of the blessingful joy from prosperities unfathomed.</p>
<p>The outer runner and the inner runner:<br /> Two aspects of the seeker-runner.</p>
<p>The outer runner does.<br />   Therefore, he succeeds.</p>
<p>The inner runner becomes.<br />   Therefore, he proceeds.</p>
<p>When he succeeds,<br />   The seeker-runner gets a new name:<br />        Glorification.</p>
<p>When he proceeds,<br />   The seeker-runner gets a new name:<br />        Illumination.</p>
<p>The seeker-runner's glorification is a beautiful flower<br />   That charms and inspires his entire life.<br /> The seeker-runner's illumination is a fruitful tree<br />   That shelters and nourishes<br />        His entire earthly existence.</p>
<p>The outer running is a colossal satisfaction,<br /> Although at times it may be quite oblivious<br />   To the existence-reality of a quiet perfection.</p>
<p>The inner running is a perpetual satisfaction<br />   In and through a blossoming perfection.</p>
<p>The seeker-runner has a shadowless dream<br />   Of his full realisation-day<br />        In his outer running.</p>
<p>The seeker-runner has a sleepless vision<br />   Of his God's full manifestation-hour<br />        In his inner running.</p>
<p>The outer runner challenges<br /> The Himalayan pride of impossibility.<br /> The inner runner smilingly arranges a feast<br /> Not only with impossibility<br />   But also with Immortality.</p>
<p>The outer runner runs through the golden gate<br />   And arrives at the sound-kingdom.<br /> The inner runner enters into the unique palace,<br />   Runs up to its highest floor<br /> And places himself at the very Feet<br />   Of the Silence-King.</p>
<p>Finally, the seeker-runner's outer running<br />   Says to his inner running,<br /> “Look, I am giving you what I now have:<br />   My majesty’s crown.”<br /> The seeker-runner’s inner running<br />   Says to his outer running,</p>
<p>“Look, I am giving you what I now am:<br />   My beauty’s throne.”</p>
