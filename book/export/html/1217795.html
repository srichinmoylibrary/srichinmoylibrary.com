    <title>Question: When we think another&#039;s thoughts, we let ourselves &#039;tune-in&#039; to his &#039;psychic&#039; agitations. However, if we &#039;tune-in&#039; to one whom we believe to be grounded in the source of his being, his soul, would this be a valid practice, at least until one&#039;s own spiritual unfolding developed?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, let us be clear about the use of the word 'psychic.' As I use it, 'psychic' is not a synonym for 'occult', but pertains to the psychic being. There is no agitation in the psychic being, which is a divine spark, to say the least. We usually let ourselves 'tune-in' to others' vital or mental agitations. Certainly it is a valid practice to 'tune-in' to an enlightened soul. That is what one should do in the beginning or until one has the capacity to unfold oneself spiritually. That is why we say that if you remain calm and quiet and allow the Divine thoughts of your spiritual Guide to enter into you, you will become flooded with Peace. This kind of 'tuning-in' is not only a valid and correct practice, but is essential for one who has placed himself under a spiritual Master.</p>  </div>
