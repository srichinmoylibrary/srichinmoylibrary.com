<h2>Question: You said that we are all evolving and progressing. But where did this whole process start? Was there a beginning?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We came into existence from God's Delight. When we entered the creation, we evolved through the lower stages: mineral life, plant life, animal life. It is true that we are constantly progressing. Although we have now entered into the human life, we are still half animal. There are some who want to kill or hurt others, and exhibit all kinds of animal and destructive tendencies.</p>
<p>But in the case of a spiritual aspirant, it is different. He tries to dispose of all the lower, animal parts of his nature and aspires to be aware of and live in his divine nature where he experiences all Peace and Joy and Love. In the beginning we came from Delight; we are now growing in Delight; and we shall consciously return to Delight.</p>  </div>
