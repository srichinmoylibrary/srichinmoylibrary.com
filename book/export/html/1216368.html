<p>I was alone in the night.<br /> Do you know who came to see me?<br /> My old friend, Doubt, venom-Doubt.<br /> I was alone with the light.<br /> Do you know who came to see me?<br /> My present friend, Faith, nectar-Faith.<br /> I was alone with God.<br /> Do you know who came to see me?<br /> My bosom friend, Love, Eternity's Love.</p>
