<p>I give, you take. You give, I take. It is this reciprocal self-giving that we all immediately and eternally need. As the individuals, even so the nations must play this inevitable, nourishing and fulfilling role. Our Secretary-General is all praise for those who cheerfully give and soulfully receive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The men and women serving in the peace-keeping forces, and the troop-contributing countries that provide them, have set a course for the future, a course full of promise and exemplifying a vision and courage far out of the ordinary."</p>
