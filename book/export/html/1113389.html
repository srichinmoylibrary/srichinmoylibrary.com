<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything in life is difficult before it is achieved. But once you have achieved it, you feel that it was the easiest thing to achieve. In your case, you have already made substantial progress. But in order to continuously make substantial progress, you have to have more faith in your soulful, self-giving oneness with the Supreme in your Master.</p>  </div>
