<p>Where is the ignorance-king? He is at work. Where is the desire-man? He is at work. Where is the Compassion-God? He is at work.</p>
<p>The ignorance-king, the desire-man and the Compassion-God want me to be their witness. If you want to know how they work, I am more than willing to tell you. The ignorance-king works untiringly. The desire-man works unconsciously. The Compassion-God works unconditionally.</p>
<p>The ignorance-king wants to devour the world. The desire-man wants to possess the world. The Compassion-God wants to illumine the world.</p>
<p>The ignorance-king says, “I do not want to love anything. I do not want to love anybody, but I want to be loved by the desire-man and by the Compassion-God.”</p>
<p>The desire-man says, “I want to love the temptation of the ignorance-king and I want to love the forgiveness of the Compassion-God.”</p>
<p>The Compassion-God says, “I want to love My own awakening evolution in the ignorance-king. I want to love My own aspiring evolution in the desire-man. I want to love My own all-transcending and all-illumining evolution in My own Dream-Boat and Reality-Shore."</p>
