<p>ONE DAY</p>
<p>One day<br /> Everybody will turn against him.<br /> He knows it,<br /> Yet he loves them.</p>
<p>One day<br /> Everybody will hate him.<br /> He knows it,<br /> Yet he loves them.</p>
<p>One day<br /> Everybody will leave him.<br /> He knows it,<br /> Yet he loves them.</p>
<p>One day<br /> Everybody will try to end his life.<br /> He knows it,<br /> Yet he loves them.</p>
<p>One day<br /> Everybody will destroy his breath.<br /> He knows it,<br /> Yet he loves them.<br /> And after that<br /> Everybody<br /> Will love him dearly,<br /> Adore him unreservedly<br /> And<br /> Claim him soulfully.<br /> Alas, this is the common story<br /> Of this uncommon world.</p>
