<p>When I had my first audience<br /> With my Inner Pilot,<br /> He said to me,<br /> "You are indeed your fruitless doubt."</p>
<p>When I had my second audience<br /> With my inner Pilot,<br /> He said to me,<br /> "You are indeed your soulless faith."</p>
<p>When I had my third audience<br /> With my inner Pilot,<br /> He said to me,<br /> "You are indeed your goalless life."</p>
<p>When I had my fourth audience<br /> With my inner Pilot,<br /> He said to me,<br /> "You are indeed your sleepless aspiration."</p>
<p>When I had my fifth audience<br /> With my inner Pilot,<br /> He said to me,<br /> "You are indeed your selfless dedication."</p>
<p>When I had my sixth audience<br /> With my inner Pilot,<br /> He said to me,<br /> "You are indeed your endless surrender."</p>
<p>When I had my seventh and last audience<br /> With my inner Pilot,<br /> He said to me,<br /> "You are indeed My breathless Satisfaction."</p>
