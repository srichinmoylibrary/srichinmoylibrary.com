<p>We arrived at Madras Airport at 5:30 a.m. At 7:30 the plane was supposed to leave. Around 7:00 they announced that the plane would be delayed by three hours. A delay of three hours can easily become five hours. I knew that if I missed this flight, I would not get the connecting flight from Calcutta to Bangkok. So, as you can see, everything was going wrong.</p>
<p>But one of the workers, the deputy manager of the airline, liked me very much. He said, “Mr. Ghose, I will do my best to send you to Calcutta by another plane.”</p>
<p>So we went to Dominea Airlines. He was from Air India, but he was begging the Dominea people to help. They said they would help. They were all sincere people. At 8:30 they had a flight to Calcutta and if I could catch it, I would be able to get my connecting flight. Five or six times he was begging them in front of me.</p>
<p>There was a young man from Dominea, a Muslim named Mohammed Isman. He was also saying I could take their flight, but he would only be able to offer me a seat after eight o’clock. Right then he could not.</p>
<p>Once I tried to give 400 rupees to the deputy manager. It was only because of him that I had hope. He said, “No, I can’t accept that.”</p>
<p>I said, “Nobody is watching.”</p>
<p>He said, “Nobody is watching, but my heart is seeing it. I can’t do that.” He was such a nice man.</p>
<p>I said, “Then give me your card.”</p>
<p>He said, “You can take my card, but I can’t take any money from you.”</p>  </div>
