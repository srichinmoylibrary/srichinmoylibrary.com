<p>Who is a real Guru?<br /> A real Guru is he<br /> Who does not call you stupid,<br /> Undivine and useless.<br /> A real Guru is he who says:<br /> "You have knowledge,<br /> But you need more knowledge.<br /> Try, you certainly can!"<br /> A real Guru is he who says:<br /> "You are divine,<br /> But you can be more divine.<br /> Try, you certainly can!"<br /> A real Guru is he who says:<br /> "You are useful,<br /> Infinitely more useful<br /> Than you ever can imagine.<br /> But you can be more useful.<br /> Try, you certainly can!"<br /> A real Guru is he who says:<br /> "You are God's chosen instrument.<br /> You are useful,<br /> You are fruitful,<br /> You are indispensable<br /> To the divine Vision of God."</p>
