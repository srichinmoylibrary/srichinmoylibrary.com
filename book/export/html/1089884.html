  <h1 class="book-heading">Sincerity</h1>
  
 
<p>Sincerity God gives us only when we feel that we shall forever remain God's divine children. Everybody is sincere according to his own sense of sincerity, but a seeker has to be sincere at every moment in what he says and what he does in order to grow into the very image of God. His sincerity has to be constant and continuous. His life he must not separate from sincerity even for a second.</p>  </div>
