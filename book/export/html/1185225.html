<p>Tagore and Gandhi were good friends. They loved each other deeply. They admired each other unreservedly. Once, however, they entered into a very unpleasant conversation, a terribly heated argument. Indeed, it was a shocking experience to their followers and admirers. Some took Tagore's side, while others took Gandhi's side.</p>
<p>A follower of Gandhi pleaded with the great artist Nandalal Bose to take one side. He immediately expressed his utter incapacity: "I am an artist. I like all the colours deeply and equally. To me, these two supremely great souls are like two Vision-Eyes. I cannot prefer one Eye to the other. I love them deeply and need them equally."</p>  </div>
