<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I take exercise for each part of the body: arms, legs, back and whatever muscles are required to keep the body fit. I do at least 20 different exercises daily for my upper and lower body. Then I come here every morning to do calf raises and play tennis. If there is time in the afternoon, I play tennis again. At least three hours I spend on weightlifting and bodybuilding. Running is now out of the question because of my knee, but if I am able to jog some days, then I feel really happy.</p>  </div>
