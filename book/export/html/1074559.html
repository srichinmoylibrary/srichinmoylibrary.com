<p>The divine manifestation and our human aspiration have to go together. They are like two eyes. If one eye is functioning and the other eye is not functioning well, then we are half-blind. We have to use both eyes, aspiration and manifestation. Both are equally important; like day and night, one has to be followed by the other. This moment we need aspiration, the next moment, manifestation. Again, real aspiration itself is manifestation and real manifestation is aspiration. They are one and inseparable.</p>
<p>We can unite aspiration and manifestation in two ways. While we are praying and meditating, we have to feel that we are manifesting; and while we are doing selfless service we have to feel that this is also real meditation. It is absolutely true.</p>
<p>Each year we can increase our aspiration and accomplish something very significant to offer at the Feet of the Supreme. Let us not repeat the mistakes that we have committed this year in the coming year. The good, divine things that we have done, let us try to repeat and multiply. There are innumerable good things we can do for the Supreme. These good things will automatically come to the fore if we are really sincere in our aspiration and in our cry for divine manifestation. Each month, each day, each minute is most significant. It is up to us to use our time either in a divine way or in an undivine way. If we don’t use our time wisely, if we just wait to see what is going to happen in our life, in others’ lives or in the rest of God’s creation, then merely watching with a curious eye is equivalent to doing something undivine. So the best thing for us is to do the divine thing all the time through aspiration and manifestation. While we are going up we are spreading our light. What else is manifestation if not this? And while we are doing dedicated service, immediately like a magnet something from above is pulling us up: that is our mounting aspiration. So in this way we see that manifestation and aspiration have to go together; they are inseparably one.</p>  </div>
