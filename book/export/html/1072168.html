<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Aspiration is the supreme form of art. There cannot be any art superior to aspiration. If one aspires wholeheartedly, then God is most pleased and, at the same time, fulfilled. Nature’s aspiration, individual aspiration, universal aspiration are what satisfy God most. If the entire being aspires — body, vital, mind, heart and soul, then God is most pleased, satisfied and most fulfilled.</p>  </div>
