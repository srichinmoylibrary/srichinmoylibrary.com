<h2>Question: How can we keep the heart’s door open all the time?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can keep your heart’s door wide open all the time if you can value the presence of God. You have to feel that without the conscious presence of God you cannot exist, not even for a fleeting second. If you can feel that you can exist on earth without drinking water or without eating food or without breathing, if you can feel that there is nothing on earth which is essential to your life except to consciously feel God’s presence inside your heart, then you can easily keep your heart’s door wide open. Feel that if you do not consciously feel His presence inside your heart, that is worse than death. You need Him desperately; you need Him at every second of your life. If you don’t have that kind of need or urge, then you cannot keep your heart’s door open. But when you come to realise that nothing is indispensable in your life except God, then your heart’s door will automatically remain open.</p>  </div>
