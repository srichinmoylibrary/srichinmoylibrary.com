<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I am praying and I am meditating. I do not separate my outer life from my inner life. Before I lift, I pray. While lifting I pray. And, at the end, after I have completed the lift, I pray again and offer my gratitude to the Supreme. I give not 99 per cent but 100 per cent credit for my weightlifting to my Lordâ€™s Compassion. It is His Grace alone that is enabling me to be of inspiration to my brothers and sisters in the world like this.</p>  </div>
