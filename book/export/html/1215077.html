<p>How can we make God smile? We can make God smile by pleasing Him in His own way. How can we please Him in His own way? We can please Him in His own way only when we can feel that without God we are absolutely nothing, worse than useless; and with God we are more than perfect, we are Perfection itself. Let us always ask ourselves: Without God, what will we become? And with God what will we become? We have to feel that with God what we will become is the Reality-Existence. Then God will give us a divine Smile.</p>  </div>
