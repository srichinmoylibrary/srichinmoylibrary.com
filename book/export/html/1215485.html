<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation is something that goes beyond the mind. The mind is limited. It always thinks of “I,” “my” and “mine.” But meditation is unlimited. When we meditate, we become aware of our universal Reality, of our universal Oneness. At that time we become one with our self-giving heart. A tiny drop wholeheartedly gives its reality, its finite existence, to the mighty ocean. When it surrenders its separate existence, it becomes one with the ocean itself. So, when we give, we get infinitely more in return. Self-giving is God-becoming. The moment we give ourselves soulfully, devotedly, unreservedly and unconditionally to the Infinite, we become the Infinite Itself. When we offer our little earthly existence to our Beloved Supreme, we become inseparably one with His universal and transcendental Reality.</p>  </div>
