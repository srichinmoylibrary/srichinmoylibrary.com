<p>Peace is not the sole monopoly of the elite. Peace is not the sole monopoly of the chosen few. Peace is for all human beings who are walking along the world-path. Peace is nothing other than a spontaneous flow of humanity's life-river. How beautiful and fruitful are the revelations of the U.N. architect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Peace is not a matter only for statesmen, soldiers and diplomats, but also for peoples themselves. Peace is not just the outcome of Government decisions. Peace is a dynamic process which each individual can impede or promote. As a French philosopher once said: 'Peace is built from day to day,' and we, my dear friends, are the builders."</p>
