<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> These beings are fought with occult power — with occult power that you manifest. They don’t have physical form, but they can damage physical objects. We fight them with occult and vital power: subtle vital power, which is not on the physical plane. We fight entirely with energy, yet people can hear the sound several blocks away. No human being could produce that kind of sound; only vital beings can do it. These subtle beings don’t have physical form, but they can take any form they want. They don’t have a human appearance, but they do have some appearance.</p>  </div>
