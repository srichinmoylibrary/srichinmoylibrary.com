<blockquote>
<p>“Nature has always had more force than education.”</p>
<p>— Voltaire <em>Life of Moliere</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nature is a flow of harmony that infallibly unites the within and the without, the what is and the what-is-to-come. No insincerity or blunder is to be found between Nature’s action and Nature’s law. Tagore will now show us what God actually does through Nature and the human soul:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is said that Nature is the field through which God manifests His Power, while through the human soul He manifests His Love. In Nature He asserts Himself through Power, while in the human souls He gives Himself away through Love.”</p>
