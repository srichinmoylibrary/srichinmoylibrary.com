<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My relationship with the disciples is that of a teacher and a student. I am the teacher, and those who have come here have come to learn something from me. But when it is a matter of who is the real Master or Guru, I always say it is the Supreme. I am not the Guru. The Supreme is the only Guru. But here I am the leader, the representative for my disciples, for those who follow my path. I am the boatman, the captain. These are the students who want to learn from me. Whatever I get from the Supreme I offer to them.</p>  </div>
