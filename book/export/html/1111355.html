  <h1 class="book-heading">Long strides</h1>
  
 
<p>This morning, around five o'clock, I was running near the corner of our street. Somebody drove up to the corner, stopped and started honking. I knew that he wanted someone to come out of the building, so I paid no attention to him. I was running and running, practising short stride and long stride.</p>
<p>At one point he came out of the car. He was a very nice black gentleman. Finally I saw a lady come out of the building. He was telling me he would like me to teach his son how to run.</p>
<p>I was smiling and laughing, and telling him that I am the wrong person to teach his son.</p>
<p>He said, "No, your stride is pretty good."</p>
<p>Occasionally I take long strides and fool people.</p>
