<p>The automatic camera takes away all my joy. Before I lift I am all concentration, but when I have to turn the camera on, all my concentration goes away. The switch is near my left ear.</p>
<p>Dhanu has told me that it will photograph for not more than 12 to 14 seconds, and it takes 6 pictures per second. I said to myself, “Before I lift the weight, perhaps the camera will stop.”</p>
<p>Then I lifted the weight so quickly that the camera was still going after I finished. It sounds like a printing press — so much noise! It is like a hostile force. How can you concentrate when there is so much noise near you?</p>
