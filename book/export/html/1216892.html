<p>I have been on airplanes many, many times, but only two or three times have I watched the movie. On a flight from Florida to New York, I was sitting in my seat drawing when they announced that it was time for the movie.</p>
<p>They were going to show George Burns in <em>Oh God.</em> I hadn't liked the movie when we showed it at the Centre, but I said, "To kill time, let me see it."</p>
<p>So I paid two dollars for the earphones and turned the switch to channel 9. With my right hand I was holding the earphones to my ear, and with my left hand I was trying to draw. Of course, I couldn't draw very well with my left hand, since I am right-handed.</p>
<p>The stewardess saw me and said, "Why are you not using the headphones?"</p>
<p>So she showed me how to put the headphones on my head. Then she asked, "Where do you come from? India?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>She said, "Oh, that's why!"</p>
<p>I said, "I have been here in the States for 20 years." I didn't have the heart to tell her how many times I have been on airplanes. But if you don't use things, you don't know the proper way.</p>
