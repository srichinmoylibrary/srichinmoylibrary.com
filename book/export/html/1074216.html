<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Demons do manifest on the physical plane. Sometimes these undivine forces attack our disciples, and sometimes the disciples leave the Centre. If I see that somebody has been attacked, I use power. Then it frightens the demons and they hide. But I try to trace them and fight against them and, by the Grace of the Supreme, I try to transform them. For demons, like other undivine creations of God, are meant for transformation, not destruction. The very purpose of Godâ€™s creation is transformation, not destruction. No creator wants his creation to be destroyed. But the Supreme definitely wants His creation to be transformed, illumined and perfected.</p>  </div>
