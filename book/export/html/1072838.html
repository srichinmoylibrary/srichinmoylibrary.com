<p>I shall learn and learn<br /> Until I have awakened my body fully.</p>
<p>I shall learn and learn<br /> Until I have disciplined my vital<br /> Unreservedly.</p>
<p>I shall learn and learn<br /> Until I have mastered my mind<br /> Unmistakably.</p>
<p>I shall learn and learn<br /> Until I have fed my heart<br /> Satisfactorily.</p>
<p>I shall learn and learn<br /> Until I have seen my soul smiling at me<br /> Powerfully.</p>
<p>I shall learn and learn<br /> Until I have heard my Beloved Supreme<br /> Calling me His chosen child<br /> Compassionately.</p>
