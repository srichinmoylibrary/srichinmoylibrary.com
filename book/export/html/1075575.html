<p>Lord, Lord,<br /> Do You think of me?<br /> "My child, I do think of you."</p>
<p>Lord, Lord,<br /> How often do You think of me?<br /> "My child, I think of you<br /> Always, always and always."</p>
<p>Lord, Lord,<br /> Only You can say this<br /> Because You are<br /> Far beyond the domain<br /> Of Sincerity<br /> And<br /> Far above the skies of Truth.</p>
<p>Lord, Lord,<br /> Do You love me?<br /> "My child, I do love you."</p>
<p>Lord, Lord,<br /> How often do You love me?<br /> "My child, I love you<br /> Always, always and always."</p>
<p>Lord, Lord,<br /> I should have known long before<br /> That a life of sincerity<br /> Does not mean anything to You.<br /> "My child, go deep within<br /> And discover My Palace of Truth."</p>
<p>Lord, Lord,<br /> Anyway, I can't make<br /> You sincere.<br /> You be what You want to be.<br /> Only give me the strength<br /> To remain sincere<br /> ALWAYS.<br /> To me, Sincerity and Reality<br /> Are inseparable.</p>
<p>Lord, Lord,<br /> Please answer my last question.<br /> Who am I, after all?<br /> "You are My universal Child<br /> Of My Eternal Life."</p>
