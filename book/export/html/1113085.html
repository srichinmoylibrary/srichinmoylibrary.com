<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> After one has realised God, one can reveal and manifest Him. Again, one may take rest, providing it is God's Will. There is no hard and fast rule as to what will happen to that individual. It is like playing a game of football. If you have played extremely well, God may tell you that you don't have to play any more; you can take rest. Again, after you have taken rest, if He wants you to play again, you can participate. It entirely depends on God's Volition, God's Wish, God's Choice.</p>  </div>
