<p>Joe and Jack, Supremacy and Ambition, fought,<br /> Though two hearts thicker than oneness.</p>
<p>Triumph smiled at Supremacy;<br /> To poor Ambition, the face of Victory denied.</p>
<p>Morning shows the day, but not every day:<br /> Fate played its unfathomable part.<br /> It commanded Supremacy a wonder-heroic death.<br /> It threw Ambition up to touch the pinnacle.<br /> Ambition won the ultimate race.</p>
<p>The entire world saw and felt the truth.<br /> But Ambition's loving admiration for Supremacy<br /> And his oneness with his childhood "Supreme,"<br /> No one fully knows, Save God.</p>
