<p>SLOW RUNNER: “Why are you running so fast towards God?”</p>
<p>FAST RUNNER: “I am running so fast because I want to experience God’s Pride in me. Why are you running so slowly?”</p>
<p>SLOW RUNNER: “I am running so slowly towards God because I want to experience God’s Patience and experience His Compassion for me, if He has any.”</p>  </div>
