<p>Last week I went to a candy store and bought the Post. It was not the <em>Enquirer</em> so luckily I was saved! My disciples always tell me I should not be seen buying the Enquirer, although reading it always amuses me. As I was buying the paper, a man with a moustache and beard asked me, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I smiled at him.</p>
<p>He continued, "Are you really? I have come to your meditations at PS 86 on Parsons Boulevard."</p>
<p>I was carrying a bag over my shoulder, so he said "Now you are carrying a bag."</p>
<p>I said, "Now you see the difference from the way I am at meditation."</p>
<p>He said, "No difference!"</p>
<p>While I was paying for the newspaper, he was telling the shopkeeper, "He is Sri Chinmoy."</p>
<p>When I was coming out of the store, he was still gazing at me.</p>
