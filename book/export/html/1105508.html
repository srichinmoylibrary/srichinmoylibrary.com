<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can have grateful surrender to the Will of the Supreme if you can just feel that not only is He doing everything for you, but He has already done everything for you. We show our gratitude to someone who has done something for us or who is going to do us a favour in the long run. Every day, while you are offering your gratitude to the Supreme and your surrender to the Will of the Supreme, please feel that everything that is fulfilling, everything that makes you a perfect instrument and an immortal divine soldier of the Supreme, has already been done for you.</p>
<p>When you think of grateful surrender, please feel that everything has been accomplished by the Supreme, for you and in you. When you read the book of universal knowledge, you have only to turn the pages; the book has already been read by the Supreme. It is His book and He has also given you the knowledge. The only effort you have to make is to turn the pages and feel that the Divine Supreme has already read the book. He has not read it for Himself; He has read it only for you.</p>  </div>
