<p>This afternoon, around two o'clock, I was running near the school opposite Lavanya's street. Three or four little children came out of the school. One of them, a little girl of five or six, got the inspiration to run with me. So she crossed the street, since I was on the other side, and came running up to me with her books, saying, "Sri Chinmoy, I want to jog with you." She had perfect pronunciation. For her, it was 'jogging'. I had been running quite fast, but as soon as she started jogging, I had to slow down. She ran with me for forty metres and she was so delighted.</p>
<p>When she stopped, I gave her a smile and I continued my run.</p>
