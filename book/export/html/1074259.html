<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good, very good. It means that your vital can fly. In the subtle vital plane you can fly very high, higher than the airplane. And that vital plane is the divine vital plane, not the lower vital plane. When you are on earth, you have to walk; but when you are in the inner world, you can fly. Here in the physical, the vital does not get the opportunity to fly. But when you are in the subtle vital, at that time God lets you fly. Very good!</p>  </div>
