<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In some cases, they are especially chosen by some higher forces to work at the United Nations. In other cases, it is mere chance. But no matter what brought someone to the United Nations, if he works here devotedly and soulfully, then by virtue of his selfless service he becomes a chosen instrument of the soul of the United Nations.</p>  </div>
