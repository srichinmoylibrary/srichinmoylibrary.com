<p>When I was giving out the prizes for our Plainsboro marathon, the girl who came in third came up to me with such devotedness! Then, she was dying to have her picture taken with me. She came up with such respect and then she was waiting for a picture. Bhashwar took one, so I will send it to her with my autograph.</p>
