<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very often we see that the mind wants to do one thing and the body, or physical consciousness, wants to do something else. The mind is inside the body; but right now it wants to watch a movie, whereas the body is tired and wants to sleep. The mind is inside the body, but the body has its own consciousness, which wants to assert itself, and the mind has its own consciousness. The mind and the body can walk together. If the body wants to listen to the dictates of the mind, it <em>can</em> listen. Again, the body can revolt. Very often the body listens to the mind, but sometimes it does not. So we can say that they are one when they agree to go together and they are two when they disagree.</p>  </div>
