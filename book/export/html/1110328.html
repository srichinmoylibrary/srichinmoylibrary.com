<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to get rid of your bad karma, the first thing you have to do is to forget about it. If you think of it, unconsciously you are cherishing it. But if you think of good karma — that is to say, aspiration, concentration and meditation — then you are walking along the right path.</p>
<p>What you did yesterday is not at all important now. What is of paramount importance is what you now want to be. We have to know that we are not the children of the past, but the children of the Golden Future. Yesterday did not give you realisation. Yesterday did not give you fulfilment. You have to know that if you look backward, you will remain where you were or where you are. But if you look forward, one day you will reach your Goal.</p>
<p>So in order to get rid of bad karma, you should enter into the field of concentration and meditation. The only medicine to cure bad karma from the past is meditation or, if that is too difficult, concentration in the form of aspiration.</p>  </div>
