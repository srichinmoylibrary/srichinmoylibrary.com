<p><em>On March 25, 1969, Sri Chinmoy delivered his first lecture at Harvard University, on “The Vedanta Philosophy.” Since then he has served this illustrious institution of higher learning by giving a number of additional talks and conducting meditations for the University community. In the spring of 1975, Sri Chinmoy continued his devoted service to the University by offering a series of seven talks on the spiritual life in Andover Hall at the Harvard Divinity School. These talks Sri Chinmoy soulfully dedicates to the memory of a most distinguished and beloved son of Harvard, the late President John F. Kennedy.</em></p>  </div>
