<p>Be happy<br /> You will grow into God's greatest blessing, His highest pride.</p>
<p>Be happy<br /> Yesterday's world wants you to enjoy its surrendered breath.<br /> Today's world wants you to enjoy its surrendering breath.<br /> Tomorrow's world wants you to enjoy its fulfilling breath.</p>
<p>Be happy<br /> Be happy in the morning with what you have.<br /> Be happy in the evening with what you are.</p>
<p>Be happy<br /> Don't complain. Who complains? The blind beggar in you.<br /> When you complain, you dance in the mire of ignorance-condition.<br /> When you don't complain, all conditions of the world are at your feet, and God gives you a new name: aspiration.<br /> Aspiration is the supreme wealth in the world of light and delight.</p>
<p>Be happy<br /> Do you want never to be poor? Then be happy. Do you want ever to be great? Then be happy.</p>
<p>Be happy<br /> You will get what you like most. You will be what you like best.</p>
<p>Be happy<br /> When you are happy, you and God command each other.<br /> God commands you lovingly. You command God hastily.<br /> When you are unhappy, the hostile forces command you ruthlessly, doubt commands you openly, bondage commands you triumphantly and fear commands you unconditionally.</p>
<p>Be happy<br /> God sees in you His aspiring Creation, His transforming Realisation, His illumining Revelation and His fulfilling Manifestation.</p>
<p>Be happy<br /> God sees in you another God. God sees you as another God. God sees you and He as One.</p>
