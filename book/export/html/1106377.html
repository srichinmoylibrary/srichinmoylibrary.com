<p>This morning I lifted 300 pounds with one arm ten times. But there was no seriousness involved. I strongly feel that I am not using my full capacity. I am only giving 70 per cent of my attention. I do not know why, but I am not getting any inspiration or joy from this lifting. Today I did not want to lift even four times with each arm, but I did it five times. That shows my mind was not there.</p>
