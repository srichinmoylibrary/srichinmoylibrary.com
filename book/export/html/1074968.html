<p>Mother Mary, Please tell me, where is your son?<br /> I have been searching and searching for him<br /> In the ecstasy-sun of Heaven.<br /> I have something most important<br /> To discuss with him.</p>
<p>"Son,<br /> Are you here?<br /> For the last ten years<br /> My Jesus has been searching and searching for you<br /> In the ignorance-sea and hell-fire of earth.<br /> He has left me a note saying<br /> He has a piece of urgent business<br /> With you on earth."</p>
