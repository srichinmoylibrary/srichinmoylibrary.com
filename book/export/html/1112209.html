<p>When I went out running this morning, I said, "At least there will be nothing open, so I do not have to take money." So I put only 10,000 rupiah in my pocket. I was walking and meditating. All of a sudden, I saw a little shop there in the sand. When I enquired, the man said that everything was fixed price. The Balinese man who owned the little shop spoke English. I wanted to buy three or four things. Each time he said that something was a fixed price, I bargained with him. Finally, when I said, "All right, then I will not buy it," he lowered the price. This happened with each item. So I took 10,000 rupiah with me and I spent it all.</p>
