<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on my mood. Sometimes I appreciate bodybuilding and sometimes I appreciate weightlifting. While lifting up weights, one has to feel that weightlifting is more important. Again, while one is taking exercises to build sound muscles, then one has to feel that bodybuilding is more important. We have to pay utmost attention to whatever we are doing at the time and appreciate and value it much more than other things.</p>  </div>
