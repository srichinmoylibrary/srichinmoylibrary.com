<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on how much will-power you have that can create receptivity in the body. If your will-power can create receptivity in the physical consciousness, then only one or two hours, or even less, is necessary. If you can't create receptivity, then it is always advisable to take rest. Otherwise, the consciousness does not function properly. If the consciousness does not function, then we are worse than animals. It not only does not function; what is worse, it becomes destructive. Destruction takes place in the form of negative feelings towards everything, towards your own existence. If you cherish negative feelings, that is real death.</p>  </div>
