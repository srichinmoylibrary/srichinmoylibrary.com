<p>I wish to say that no elder brother has been so indulgent to his younger brother in God's entire creation. In my literary life, call it poetry or prose, or my athletic life — if I have done anything in this life — his constant prayer, meditation, encouragement and so forth are always there. Unconditional service is quite possible when I think of my brother Chitta. Absolutely no disciple of mine has ever done unconditional service and perhaps none will ever do, but this brother of mine has proved that unconditional service is possible and he has proved it to his younger brother. Unconditional love and unconditional service my brother showed me all his life. He never expected a thing from me. He only desired one thing: my happiness.</p>  </div>
