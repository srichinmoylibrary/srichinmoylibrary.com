<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes and no. Not in their political capacity. But when they come to me as seekers, since I myself am a seeker, I can talk to them on a spiritual level â€” but not on a political level. Politics is not my forte, whereas I know a little bit about spirituality. So, when the politicians come to me as seekers, I try to offer light to them.</p>  </div>
