<p>This book consists of four lectures that Sri Chinmoy delivered while visiting Hawaii in March 1980, and a radio interview he gave there a few months earlier. Inspired by the beauty and power of the islands, he composed a song [cite:WING 1] which portrays the inner qualities of Hawaii.</p>  </div>
