<h2>What is my God doing?</h2>

<p>What is my God doing in Heaven? He is dreaming.</p>
<p>What is my God doing on Earth? He is struggling.</p>
<p>In His Dream He is His Goal.</p>
<p>In His Struggle He is His Soul.</p>
<p>What is Heaven doing? Heaven is descending with God's Feet of Beauty.</p>
<p>What is Earth doing? Earth is ascending with God's Eye of Purity.</p>
<p>What is my God doing to please Heaven?</p>
<p>He is dancing.</p>
<p>What is my God doing to please Earth?</p>
<p>He is crying.</p>
<p>What else is my God doing? He is carrying me to the Head of His Heaven to show me the embodiment of His highest Height which He is going to share with me unconditionally. He is carrying me into the Heart of His Earth to show me the embodiment of His deepest Depth which He is going to share with me unconditionally.</p>  </div>
