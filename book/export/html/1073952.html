<p>If you think that my happy face is a mask covering my true unhappiness, then you may be right. If you think that our Beloved Supremeâ€™s happy Face is a mask covering His true unhappiness, then you are totally wrong. But if you want to see His happy Face, then you have to become first a happy heart. There is no other way.</p>  </div>
