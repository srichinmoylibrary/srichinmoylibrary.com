<p>I went to two spiritual Masters<br /> And begged them to grant me some peace.<br /> I needed peace so desperately.</p>
<p>One Master said to me:<br /> "Go deep within."<br /> The other said to me:<br /> "Pray to God."</p>
<p>I said to the first Master:<br /> "Can't you go deep within<br /> On my behalf?"</p>
<p>"Certainly I can,<br /> But you have to give me permission."</p>
<p>To the second one I said:<br /> "Can't you pray on my behalf?"</p>
<p>"Certainly I can,<br /> But you have to give me the authority."</p>
<p>I gave them<br /> My permission and authority.<br /> Lo, I am now swimming<br /> In a sea of peace.</p>
