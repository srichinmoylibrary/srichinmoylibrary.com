<p>A cosmic god had a horse. The horse was beautiful and also it had many good qualities. But it wanted to be more perfect in every way. It especially wanted to become beauty unparalleled.</p>
<p>One day the horse said to the cosmic god, "O Lord, you have given me beauty. You have given me other good qualities. I am so grateful to you. But how I wish you could make me more beautiful. I would be extremely, extremely grateful if you could make me more beautiful."</p>
<p>The cosmic god said, "I am more than ready to make you more beautiful. Tell me in what way you want to be changed."</p>
<p>The horse said, "It seems to me that I am not well proportioned. My neck is too short. If you can make my neck a little longer, my upper body will be infinitely more beautiful. And if you can make my legs much longer and thinner, then I will look infinitely more beautiful in my lower body."</p>
<p>The cosmic god said, "Amen!" Then immediately he made a camel appear in place of the horse. The horse was so disheartened that it started to cry, "O Lord, I wanted to become more beautiful. In what way is this kind of outer form more beautiful?"</p>
<p>The cosmic god said, "This is exactly what you asked for. You have become a camel."</p>
<p>The horse cried, "Oh no, I do not want to become a camel! I wish to remain a horse. As a horse, everybody appreciated my good qualities. Nobody will appreciate me as a camel."</p>
<p>The cosmic god said, "Never try to achieve or receive more than I have given you. If you want to lead a desire-life, then at every moment you will want more and more. But you have no idea what the outcome will be. If you cry for a longer neck and legs, this is what will happen. Each thing in my creation has its own good qualities. The camel is not as beautiful as you are, but it carries heavy loads and has a tremendous sense of responsibility. You stay with your beauty, which is absolutely needed. Beauty is definitely one of my divine qualities. And let the camel remain with its sense of responsibility, which is another divine quality of mine. Do not ask me for anything more. If I decide to give you something on my own, then it will not create any problems. It will only add to what you have. But when you are the one who asks me to add to what you already have, then you are bound to run into serious difficulties."</p>  </div>
