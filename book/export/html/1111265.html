<p>I will never allow the Centre to sponsor a race with the same kind of hilly course that we had in today's ten-mile race. Even my road crew driving alongside me in a car knew what we were going through. Each mile had at least one hill or even more, and there were three hills that were almost insurmountable.</p>
<p>When I saw one particular hill, my reaction was immediately to collapse. Then I saw two of my girl disciples running together in front of me, literally running and jumping up the hill.</p>
<p>I said, "If they can jump like that, why can't I drag my body up the hill?" And I did finally reach the top.</p>
