<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Nobility comes from the expression of divinity. The higher you go, the more you become conscious of your divinity, the easier it becomes to express nobility. In your case, you are showing the majesty of the King, but your divinity is missing. Rama is showing his divinity by making his solemn promise to go into exile, and then Lakshmana is showing his divinity by following his elder brother. The third son is also behaving in a divine way. Now, all the sons saw divinity in their father Dasharatha. They are your sons. So your divinity has to be expressed along with your majesty. Through your own concentration you can bring forward nobility.</p>  </div>
