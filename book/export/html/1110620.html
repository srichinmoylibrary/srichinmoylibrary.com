<p>Light and darkness. Darkness makes us feel that we are nothing and can do nothing, that we are useless. Light makes us feel that we are everything, that we can do everything, that we can become everything. Now where is Light, real Light? Real Light is not in the physical; it is not in the mind. It is deep in the soul. Wherever there is Light, there is expansion. Expansion of what? Expansion of Truth. Light is the constant expression of Truth. Light and Truth go together. Darkness and conflict go together.</p>
<p>The light that we say we get from friends, relatives and worldly people is no real light. It is only a chain of thoughts and ideas, which we give value to. We always feel that others have more understanding and more knowledge than we. But I wish to say that you will have more light than anybody when you stay in the soul. Your soul has infinitely more light than anybody who is giving you intellectual information or outer knowledge.</p>
<p>Now how can you enter into the soul in order to see, feel and utilise the Light? You can reach the light by throwing off fear, the fear that is around you, in front of you, behind you and ahead of you. You are the victim of fear both in your own life and in the life of your loved ones: fear about your children, your friends, your country, your earth. If you have fear, you cannot enter into the soul and get the soul's Light. So please try to discard fear from your outer and your inner life. Then you will see that you are constantly being nourished by your soul's Light. A sincere aspirant also receives light when he enters into the Master's consciousness. The Master's consciousness is always inundated with spiritual Light, the Light of the Beyond.</p>
<p>Light and aspiration go together. Light reveals and manifests life only when aspiration ceaselessly feeds our inner hunger.</p>  </div>
