<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all let us know who God is. God is He who is the sole object of our love. He has become the sole object of our love because He is His own Source. His Father, who is He Himself, is infinite Compassion. In our case, we cannot be both the journey and the goal. In His case, He is both the Journey and the Goal. When he is the journey, He is the Son; when He is the Goal, He is the Father. God the Son is infinite Love. God the Father is infinite Compassion.</p>  </div>
