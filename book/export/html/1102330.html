<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on what kind of world government you are speaking of. If it is a government that wants to govern nations with the inner messages that come directly from the heart, if it is a government that wants to govern in an unprecedented, self-giving way, then there is every possibility that some day the Absolute Supreme will give the United Nations the supreme opportunity to govern the world.</p>
