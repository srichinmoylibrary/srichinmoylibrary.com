<h2>Question: For a long time people have been meditating for the good of humanity, but there does not seem to be any positive sign that humanity is advancing along the right path. Do you feel that meditation can expedite world-progress?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First we have to start with ourselves. Our progress entirely depends upon our heart's cry. If I, as an individual, can become good, divine and perfect on the strength of my own heart's cry and God's Grace, then at least one individual will be liberated from ignorance-bondage. And if one person is sincerely crying and striving for peace and perfection, then that person's inspiration, aspiration and inner illumination will automatically spread to others. At that time, they also will be inspired to strive for peace and, eventually, the entire world will be inundated with peace.</p>
<p>But this is a long process. We cannot get a Master's degree overnight. We may study for years and years before we finally get the degree. In the spiritual life also, one has to practise meditation for many years in order to achieve liberation; sometimes it takes quite a few incarnations. We need utmost patience and perseverance. Just because we cannot have most delicious food every day, we do not give up eating.</p>
<p>Similarly, just because we cannot maintain our peace of mind every day, we must not give up meditation or spirituality. If in one day I cannot achieve abiding peace, then I will strive for it the next day as well. And I shall continue striving until I am blessed with peace in abundant measure.</p>
<p>Not in vain did God, our compassionate Father, create the universe. He and peace are one and the same. They are the obverse and reverse of the same coin. It is His Vision for the entire creation to be inundated with peace. Therefore, we should not give up hope. If we continue to pray and meditate, there shall come a day when instead of inner and outer conflict, peace and delight will reign supreme in this world of ours.</p>
