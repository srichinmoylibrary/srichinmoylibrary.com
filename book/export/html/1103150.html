<p>My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme,<br /> My soul has placed its victory-crown<br /> At Your Lotus-Feet<br /> Lovingly, prayerfully and self-givingly.<br /> May my heart, mind, vital and body<br /> Do exactly the same.<br /> My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!</p>

<p><em>[After completing the lift:]</em></p>
<p>My Supreme, at long last I have done it, with Your boundless Grace. It is not my capacity, it is Your Compassion that has enabled me to lift up 120 pounds. It is Your Compassion, Your Compassion, Your Compassion and not my capacity.</p>

<p><em>20 October 1998 11:25 p.m. Before successfully lifting 120 lbs with each arm simultaneously.</em></p>  </div>
