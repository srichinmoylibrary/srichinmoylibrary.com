<p>A husband and wife had a small child only three or four years old. The parents were very, very happy with this beautiful little child.</p>
<p>One day the father was engrossed in reading a novel. He was getting so much joy from the story. All of a sudden the child started crying. The mother was ironing clothes, cooking and doing all kinds of work in the house, so she was unable to pay attention to the child.</p>
<p>The wife said to the husband, "Please, please take care of our child. He is bored. You are just reading, but I am working. I am unable to pay any attention to him. At least take him out for a few minutes. Perhaps the fresh air and the sun will do him good."</p>
<p>The husband was not listening. He was still reading, reading and reading. Then the child started crying very loudly. The wife said, "Please take him out! I am doing all this work. You are doing nothing! You are just reading."</p>
<p>The husband said, "What? How can you ask me to take him outside? It is thundering and raining heavily. A storm is raging, and you are asking me to take our child outside? He is our only child. He will fall sick and die. Do you want our child to be killed in this storm? Can you not see? The trees are all trembling. Are you a fool? At a time like this I have to take our only child outside?"</p>
<p>The wife said, "All right." Then she took the child outside. The sun was shining brightly. The mother stayed outside with the child for a few minutes until he became very calm and quiet. Then she brought the child back inside.</p>
<p>The father said, "How could you take our child outside when it is raining so heavily? Such a storm is raging!"</p>
<p>The mother said, "You idiot! Where is the storm?"</p>
<p>The father said, "I can prove that it is raining heavily outside."</p>
<p>Then he showed her the book. He said, "It is written here." In the novel it said that it was raining very heavily. He showed it to his wife to prove that the weather outside was so bad. That was why he did not take the child outside.</p>  </div>
