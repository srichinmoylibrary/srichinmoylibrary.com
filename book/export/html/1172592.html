<p><em>(In Heaven, the first two minor gods are hiding in shame and the third god is dancing with joy.)</em></p>
<p>THIRD GOD: I knew it! I knew that Shibi has no equal either on earth or in Heaven. The depth of his heart is unfathomable. The height of his soul is immeasurable. His life is the fully manifested compassion of the Supremeâ€™s supreme Perfection.</p>  </div>
