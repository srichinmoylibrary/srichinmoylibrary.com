<p>When Agraha and I were shopping in Madrid, we saw a Chinese instrument with two strings. The sound was good, but the price was not good.</p>
<p>They said, "12,030," or something like that. So I wanted to say, "10,000."</p>
<p>But Agraha, the great Spanish scholar, told them 9,000.</p>
<p>"Agraha!" I said.</p>
<p>They said, "Impossible!"</p>
<p>I asked Agraha why he didn't say 10,000. He said, "Since you like bargaining, I said 9,000 so you can go up." Then he offered 10,000, but the man still said, "Impossible."</p>
<p>Agraha said, "11,000," but the man would not come down. They were greedy and they thought that we might again go up.</p>
<p>They were greedy and we were cheap, so we didn't buy it.</p>
