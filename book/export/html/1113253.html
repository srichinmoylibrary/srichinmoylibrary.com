<p>Nolini-da said: "Chinmoy, you have to do something today. I want to prepare a book on the great men of the West. The title will be <em>Pashchatyer Kabi O Manishi</em>. Make a collection of all my writings on these great men."</p>
<p>I said: "You do not want to have a book on the great men of the East also?"</p>
<p>"Well, if you want to, you can also do that. My article on Pascal has to be translated into Bengali. Whom do you suggest?"</p>
<p>"May I try it?"</p>
<p>"You? You don't write in Bengali. You have been translating my Bengali writings into English."</p>
<p>"I have already translated your book <em>The Malady of the Century</em> into Bengali."</p>
<p>"How is it, then, that you have not shown it to me?"</p>
<p>Quite apologetically I said: "I needs a little bit of revision."</p>
<p>Nolini said: "In that case, if you translate it I don't have to worry.</p>
<p>That afternoon I left on his table my Bengali translation of one of his English poems.</p>  </div>
