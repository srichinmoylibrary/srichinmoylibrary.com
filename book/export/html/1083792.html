<p>You know what to do.<br /> You wait and watch God<br /> Drinking His Nectar-Sea.</p>
<p>You know what to do.<br /> You admire and adore<br /> God's capacity.</p>
<p>You know what to do.<br /> When God asks you<br /> To drink with Him,<br /> You always accept His invitation;<br /> You never decline.</p>
<p>You know what to do.<br /> Therefore<br /> You are God's first choice;<br /> You are God's best voice.</p>
