  <h1 class="book-heading">A life of blossoming love</h1>
  
 
<p>A seeker’s life is his blossoming love. A seeker’s blossoming love is his illumining light.</p>
<p>A seeker’s life becomes the many and the One. A seeker’s love becomes the One and the many.</p>
<p>A seeker’s life is at once dependent and independent. His is the life boundlessly dependent on God. His is the life sleeplessly independent of ignorance.</p>
<p>A seeker has belief, he has faith, he has conviction, he has realisation. God does everything: this is his faultless belief. God is everything: this is his spotless faith. God is all Love: this is his peerless conviction. God is His own Eternity’s Silence, God is His own Infinity’s Sound, God is His own Immortality’s Satisfaction: this is his ageless realisation.</p>
<p>A true seeker’s life and his gratitude-heart are always inseparable. By virtue of his gratitude-heart he sees the invisible, he feels the unimaginable and he achieves the impossible. He sees the invisible perfection within and without him. He feels the unimaginable satisfaction in his entire being. He achieves the impossible: God’s God-Heights and God’s God-Depths.</p>
<p>A seeker’s life embodies two supreme realities: his conscious, constant and soulful self-giving prayer and his loving, devoted and unreserved God-becoming meditation. </p>
