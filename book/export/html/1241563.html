<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The divine results came. In my case, I knew my height. In your case, your spiritual height is perhaps a little lower. Why did I do it? Because Sri Aurobindo told the Mother that I had to do it, and my love for Sri Aurobindo was like that. Sri Aurobindo accepted the Mother as his Shakti. My physical mind may not have welcomed this job at first, but as soon as I thought of the Mother, I asked myself, "Who is representing whom? She is representing Sri Aurobindo." When I thought of Sri Aurobindo, my mind stopped.</p>
<p>Then again, I had to go beyond everything. I had to go to the Supreme. The physical said, "I cannot do it! I find it very difficult," so I went to the Supreme. Once I went to the Supreme, my complaints were finished! Perhaps sometimes I failed; I did not do it happily or cheerfully. But the Divine Mother compelled me to do it. As a student, I may at times have failed; but luckily I was saved because my God-realisation was inside my pocket!</p>
<p>This delivery job I did when I was twenty-five or twenty-six years old. By the time I was twelve or thirteen, I knew well who I was and what I was. You have to know what you are first. Then you can decide to do something or not to do it. Right now, you have not come to that spiritual standard, the standard that I had at that time. This was the experience Sri Aurobindo and the Mother gave me, even knowing my standard. This is how spiritual Masters try to compel you to break your likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>You can do service happily, cheerfully. Go beyond your likes and dislikes! Then you will make tremendous, tremendous spiritual progress — tremendous! At that time progress becomes fast. Otherwise, it is very difficult.</p>
<p>My brother was a Sanskrit scholar, a great scholar. His job was to carry heavy, heavy pots from the kitchen to the dining hall, about fifty metres. They were so heavy — vegetable pots, curries and all that. His job was to carry them. He was a great scholar, and that was the job he got. Then he had to wash bananas. He and somebody else had to wash the bananas every day. At the Ashram there were so many people who had not gone to school, even, but they did not have to do that kind of job. My brother had to wash the bananas and carry heavy, heavy pots. It was the Mother's order: he had to do it. At the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, you could be a professor, you could be a scholar, and they would still ask you to wash bananas. The first thing that happened was that the Ashram changed your profession. Again I say, go beyond your likes and dislikes!</p>  </div>
