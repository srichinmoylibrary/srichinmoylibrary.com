<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Contemplation shows us God in both His personal and impersonal aspects. If we want to see the personal God, then we will see Him face to face. He will stand in front of us in a most luminous Form. If we want to see God's impersonal aspect, we will enter into the impersonal God as an infinite expanse of Peace, Light and Bliss. Again, we can know God in both aspects. Just as one may want to have milk today and tomorrow ice cream, the same person may like to see the personal God with form today, and tomorrow the formless, impersonal God.</p>  </div>
