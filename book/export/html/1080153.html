<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The United Nations is a place where humanity can talk, learn and become. Humanity can talk of lasting peace, learn the secret of love and become the delight of oneness. Because of this, the United Nations is unmistakably the greatest in terms of vision-capacity, which will eventually be manifested as the most fulfilling Reality-perfection and Immortality-satisfaction.</p>
<p>According to our limited body, curious vital, searching mind and crying heart, the United Nations is no less than a miracle. But we have one more member in our family: the soul. The soul has quite a different story to narrate. It reveals to us and tells us that there is no such thing as a miracle. Anything that is uncommon, unusual and unfamiliar in this world we call a miracle. But there are many higher planes of consciousness where these so-called miracles are common occurrences.</p>
<p>God the Creator and God the creation are one. We see God the creation here, there and everywhere. But we find it difficult to realise or accept God the creation so easily, not to speak of so lovingly and devotedly. When God the Creator reveals an infinitesimal iota of His Light and Power through a human life from a new realm of consciousness to which we do not have a free access, we are quite often ready to regard it — that is to say, God's visible and tangible Compassion-Gift — as a miracle. But just because God the creation is always visible and available, our ignorance-familiarity is badly wanting in appreciation capacity. Otherwise, we would feel that God the creation is undoubtedly as much of a miracle as God the Creator.</p>
<p>Let us see eye to eye with our soul's revelation that there is no such thing as a miracle. Although we are not aware of something or although something has not yet manifested on earth, it can easily happen that we may become aware of it tomorrow or it may become manifested tomorrow. So there is no need to call it a miracle, for its existence-reality has already been discovered by the highest and greatest member of our own family, the soul.</p>
<p>Needless to say, miracle-power does not and cannot elevate our consciousness. It is our reality's spontaneity that can and will elevate and illumine our consciousness and fulfil unreservedly the Real in us. And what is the Real in us? The universal oneness of the Transcendental Height. Truth to tell, the soul of our dear United Nations embodies this all-loving Reality's all-fulfilling divinity.</p>
<p>With your soul's kind permission, I am bringing this answer to the personal level. I have had the opportunity to hear a good many speeches by a good many speakers. <em>No hyperbole, you top and far outshine the galaxy of my heroes.</em> My searching human mind tells me that each speech of yours is nothing short of a miracle; nay, it is a miracle itself, for it embodies and reveals most striking depths and heights. But my flying soul-bird, which has a free access to the higher planes of reality, tells me unmistakably and shows me convincingly the actual reality which your soul so spontaneously and so beautifully reveals through your aspiration and dedication-life. If I believe in my soul and your soul, which I shall eternally do, your invaluable gifts to the United Nations and to the world at large are <em>not</em> miracles, but a spontaneous self-offering to the Absolute Pilot Supreme on the strength of your aspiration-vision and dedication-mission.</p>  </div>
