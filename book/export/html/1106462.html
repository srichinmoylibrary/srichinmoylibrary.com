<p>Today I did the clean and press up to 85 pounds with one hand. Then I pumped it eleven times. How difficult it is to take this weight from the ground! The other way, with a power rack, is safe. If you cannot do it, you cannot. Here you need strength plus balance plus timing. A very strong grip is needed to grab it and lift it. Then you have to use so much control to bring it down to the ground again. Others can bend but I cannot bend, so it is harder for me.</p>
