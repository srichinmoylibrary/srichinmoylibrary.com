<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When a destructive thought comes, immediately you have to know that it was founded with destruction. If people continue to do something wrong for two or three days of a month, then negative forces become self-asserting. They say, "What right do you have to throw us out?" Then another thought comes. Inwardly the disciple says to the Master, "If you really care for me, then how is it that you did not prevent me when I started mixing with wrong forces? How is it that you did not stop me? How is it that these things have happened in my life?" That is the most destructive negative force, when the disciple cherishes that kind of thought about the Master. At that time the human in him blames the Supreme for everything.</p>  </div>
