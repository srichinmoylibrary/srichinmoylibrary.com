<p><em>(Satyavama and Durvasha at the river.)</em></p>
<p>SATYAVAMA <em>(sarcastically, to the river):</em> If Durvasha hasn't taken anything to eat for several years except a few blades of grass, then please, Jamuna, calm down. <em>(The waters subside. Satyavama is surprised and angry.)</em> Durvasha, your Lord is a liar and you are a liar! I am caught between two liars. But at least I am able to go home.</p>
