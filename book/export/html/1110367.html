    <title>Question: I have been told by my spiritual Master that vital enjoyment and the spiritual life can go together. But I find that when I follow this philosophy my meditation as absolutely rotten. How can vital enjoyment and meditation go together?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You must ask your Guru to help you solve this problem. Perhaps you do not understand what he meant by enjoyment. You should write to him or ask some spiritual brother of yours in whom you have faith, what his philosophy actually says concerning vital enjoyment. Since you are his disciple you should follow his path and his philosophy. If you find that your Master's philosophy does in fact allow this kind of vital enjoyment, and you still feel that you cannot reach fulfillment by following it, then you should leave the Master's path and find one which can lead you farther in your spiritual life.</p>  </div>
