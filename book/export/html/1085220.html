<p>Humayun promised his father on his father's deathbed that he would always be kind to his brothers. When Humayun became Mogul Emperor, his brothers turned very greedy. They betrayed him many, many times and wanted to dethrone him, but Humayun forgave them time and again. When his only son, Akbar, was a baby, one of Humayun's brothers, Carmen, set a cannon in a tricky way in order to kill the child. But when Akbar's nurse came to know of it, she shielded and protected the child, saving his life by giving up her own.</p>
<p>Akbar would one day become the greatest of all Mogul Emperors. In his court there were many Hindus with high posts, and he even married a Hindu Princess. It was he who made the Hindus and Muslims one. He ruled his Kingdom with compassion and truth. In every way he was the greatest of all Mogul Emperors.</p>
<p>Everybody wanted Humayun to kill Carmen for the attempt on baby Akbar's life, but Humayun said, " I have forgiven my two brothers Carmen and Hindal many times. This time also I have to forgive him." But his subjects said, "No, this time you have to listen to our request. We are so faithful to you. We offer you our constant admiration and adoration. It is your duty to listen to us."</p>
<p>Finally the Emperor said, "All right, what do you want?"</p>
<p>His subjects said, "Blind him, so that he cannot be of any harm to us any more."</p>
<p>Humayun said, "I am ready to send him into exile, but it would be so difficult for me to blind him."</p>
<p>But they said, "No, if you send him into exile, in some tricky way he will escape and form an army to attack you. So the best thing is to blind him."</p>
<p>Humayun finally listened to his subjects' request.</p>
