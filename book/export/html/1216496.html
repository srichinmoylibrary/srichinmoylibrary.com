<p>I wrote a book on Satan.<br /> He wanted to read my book<br /> But unfortunately,<br /> Time was hostile to him.</p>
<p>I wrote a book on man.<br /> Man had the time<br /> But<br /> He did not care to read it.<br /> Unfortunately, he did not want<br /> To waste his precious time.</p>
<p>I wrote a book on God.<br /> God immediately read it,<br /> And then<br /> He smiled and cried.<br /> He smiled at my moon-white<br /> Sincerity;<br /> He cried at my sun-vast<br /> Stupidity.</p>
