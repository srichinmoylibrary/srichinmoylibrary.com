<p>I tell you once and for all:</p>
<p>Simplify your life-pilgrimage.<br /> God will be proud of you.</p>
<p>Intensify your heart-pilgrimage.<br /> God will be proud of you.</p>
<p>Purify your mind-journey.<br /> God will be proud of you.</p>
<p>Cancel your vital-journey.<br /> God will be proud of you.</p>
<p>Expel your body-journey.<br /> God will be proud of you.</p>
