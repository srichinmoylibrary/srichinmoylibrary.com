<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are absolutely right. Good will is love in action and it has to be fostered and pointed out to mankind. But in order to point it out to mankind and foster it, we have to know where good will comes from. Does it come from the physical mind? No. Does it come from the dynamic vital? No. Does it come from the alert body? No. Good will comes only from the crying heart, the heart that cries to see its Beloved Supreme in itself and in all other hearts. So the source of good will is man's aspiring heart. This good will that comes from the aspiring heart is undoubtedly love in action. And without fail it has to be fostered and pointed out to mankind in order to accelerate humanity's progress.</p>  </div>
