<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, creation continuously renews itself and, at the same time, it is in constant evolution. Creation is evolving; that is to say, God is evolving in and through His own creation. In our own life we make constant progress, which is our gradual transformation. So in God's creation we see constant transformation, we see gradual progress.</p>  </div>
