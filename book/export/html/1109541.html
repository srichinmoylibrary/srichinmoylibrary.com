<blockquote>
<p>"All Americans lecture. I suppose it is something in their climate."</p>
<p>â€” Oscar Wilde</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All Indians procrastinate too long.<br /> I suppose it is something<br /> In our climate.</p>
<p>All Englishmen think too much.<br /> I suppose it is something<br /> In their climate.</p>
<p>All Canadians follow too far.<br /> I suppose it is something<br /> In their climate.</p>
<p>O American friend of mine,<br /> I wish to hear you lecture.</p>
<p>O Indian friend of mine,<br /> Let us not sleep anymore.</p>
<p>O English friend of mine,<br /> I am sure you know<br /> There is something far beyond thinking.</p>
<p>O Canadian friend of mine,<br /> Your own goal<br /> Is infinitely more beautiful<br /> Than the goal of others.</p>
