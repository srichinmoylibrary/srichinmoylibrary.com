<h2>The excited Cardinal</h2>

<p>As you know, on the 18th of June, at seven o'clock, I was supposed to meet with the Pope. At five-thirty they wanted me to be present. I came at five-thirty on the dot and stood not at the Vatican Gate, but about twenty or thirty metres away. A Cardinal was waiting for me but he could not see me, and he was very excited because he thought I was late. When he finally saw me, he took my papers and led me inside.</p>  </div>
