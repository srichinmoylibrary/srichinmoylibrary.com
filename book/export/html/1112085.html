<p>Luckily some disciples joined the racewalk today. Otherwise, there would have been only five or six walkers. We contributed nine walkers. The organisers said, "We are so happy. Today we have the largest number of participants in this race."</p>
<p>Our people were singing songs very loudly right in front of the counters. Five or six girls were singing "Aspiration-Sky" and other songs to inspire the walkers. I thought they would be scolded by the organisers, but nobody said anything.</p>
