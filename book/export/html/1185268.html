<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Aspiration is in each part of the person. The central aspiration comes from the soul, but the body, the mind, the vital and the heart also have aspiration. When the aspiration of all the members of the being go together, then only do you run the fastest. Otherwise, when the heart wants to pray in the morning, the body wants to remain fast asleep. And when the body is ready to meditate, the heart may not be aspiring. Instead, the heart is cherishing jealousy, the vital is cherishing insecurity, the mind is thinking of school or the office. Then what are you going to do? But when the heart says, “I am pure,” when the body says, “I am ready, alert,” when the mind closes its door to doubt, at that time you will be able to run the fastest.</p>  </div>
