<p>At the Holiday Inn in Kuching, Borneo, there was an Indian restaurant. When I went there, they did not want to let me in because I was uncivilised-wearing shorts.</p>
<p>I said, "I am an Indian. You won't allow me in?"</p>
<p>The girl said, "Let me go and speak to the boss."</p>
<p>The boss said, "All right, as long as you aren't wearing sandals." Fortunately, I was wearing my running shoes.</p>
<p>Then I showed the girl what I wanted on the menu. Half an hour later the food still had not come. When I asked the girl what was going on, she said, "You have not ordered." She had forgotten!</p>
<p>I got mad at her and the boss scolded her. Then she came to me for consolation. I said that I forget things every day and told her that I was not angry.</p>
<p>The poor girl had been working there for only two weeks. She was so happy that I had forgiven her.</p>
