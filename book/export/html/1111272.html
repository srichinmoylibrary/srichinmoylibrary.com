<p>Early yesterday morning around seven o'clock, as I was running towards Parsons Boulevard, I saw an elderly man sitting on a chair across the street. As I came by he raised his hand and said to me, "Hey, your style is beautiful. You look beautiful. You are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!"</p>
<p>When I came back from running around 7:30, one of the disciples came to my house to drive me to the playground. As soon as she opened the door and saw me on the porch she said, "Guru, you look so beautiful!" She used the same words as the old man. So in silence I blessed the soul of my laundress for my beautiful outfit.</p>
