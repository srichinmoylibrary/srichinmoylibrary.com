<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Beauty as such is useless. It is the purity of the kitchen that affects the food. A flower is beautiful and, at the same time, it is pure. If something embodies both beauty and purity, then it will be most helpful. If you bring into the kitchen most beautiful dolls or pieces of furniture, they will be useless; they won't be of any help to the consciousness of the food. But if you bring in flowers, which have both purity and beauty, then naturally it will help the food.</p>  </div>
