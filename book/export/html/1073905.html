<p>Shortly afterwards, this uncle committed suicide by jumping into the path of a moving train. The train severed his head from his body. The train authorities placed the body inside the railway station in a glass cabinet, with the head on top, as if the uncle were still alive. Ganapati’s older brothers and sisters were horrified and shocked when they saw this. They did not allow Ganapati’s mother to see her brother because they knew she would have fainted.</p>
<p>Later Ganapati’s father went to the crematory hall. When everything was over and he came back home, his eyes were flooded with tears.</p>  </div>
