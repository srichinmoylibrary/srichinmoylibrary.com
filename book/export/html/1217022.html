<p>When I was in the Bangkok Airport en route to India, I saw a very fat, middle-aged man standing on one side watching everything. He was the supervisor. As soon as he saw me, he said, "I remember you, I remember you, I remember you!"</p>
<p>I said, "From where?"</p>
<p>He said, "I have seen your picture in the newspaper, and I have also seen you on television. I am sure it is you."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, yes."</p>
<p>Then he said, "What are you doing nowadays?"</p>
<p>I told him, "Just yesterday I set a new record; I lifted a man weighing 317 pounds."</p>
<p>He said, "So much weight? No good for your heart! No good for your lungs! Don't do this anymore!" With such concern he was advising me.</p>
<p>Then I smiled and thanked him and went away.</p>
