<p>A few minutes later, the Gujrati lady called the stewardess again. She said to the stewardess, "I need aspirin. I am not feeling well."</p>
<p>"Only aspirin?" the stewardess asked. The stewardess brought two aspirin, and gave her one of them.</p>
<p>The lady cried, "I need four at least!"</p>
<p>The stewardess told her, "I am not authorised to give you four. I can give you at most two. I gave you one, and I am giving you one more."</p>
<p>"No!" said the lady. "You have to give me as many as I want."</p>
<p>"No, I cannot do that," the stewardess said, and she left.</p>  </div>
