<p><em>This book contains the first of a series of short stories which Sri Chinmoy is writing on the subjects of gratitude and ingratitude. The incidents in these stories are based on experiences which he has had with his own disciples, or which he knows other Masters have had with theirs. Remarkable though some of them may seem, they are all part of the daily experience of a true spiritual Master whose boundless love and compassion for mankind is sometimes rewarded with gratitude and sometimes with the most deplorable ingratitude.</em></p>  </div>
