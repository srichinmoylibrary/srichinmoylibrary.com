<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here on this side is darkness, confusion, suffering, pain, misunderstanding, negativity and uncertainty, to say the least. On the other side is peace, light, understanding, delight and oneness with God the Creator and God the creation. When one reaches the Highest, one can at once become one with God the Creator and God the creation. I am part of God's creation, you are part of God's creation, everyone is part of God's creation.</p>  </div>
