<p>Today my bodyweight is 142¼ pounds. The funniest thing is that yesterday I ate and ate and still I lost 1½ pounds! My ultimate goal is 140. My secret desire is that my body-boat shall ply between 140 and 145 pounds. Now I feel very, very, very light.</p>
<p>This morning I gave my right arm a complete rest because the palm of my right hand is full of pain and I am unable to push against the bar. I am sure that in two or three days this pain will go away.</p>
<p>When it came to my one-arm lift, I did fifty pushes with 120 pounds using only my left arm. I feel sorry for my left arm!</p>
