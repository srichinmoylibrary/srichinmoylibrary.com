<h2>Question: Do you see God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have seen God and I see God at every moment. I first saw God at the age of twelve. That was my first concrete, solid and permanent experience of God. Now I see God constantly. For me, God is a Reality which is nearer than my own nose or eyes. When I see a physical object, my eyes are one thing and the object is something else. One is vision, one is reality. This moment I have to become vision in order to see the reality. But when I see God or think of God or speak about God, at that time the reality and the vision are one. Right now, you are the vision and I am the reality, or I am the vision and you are the reality. But when I see God, vision and reality are located at the same place. If I am the vision, then I am the reality as well. If I am the reality, then I am the vision as well. For God-realised souls, the vision and the reality are at the same place.</p>  </div>
