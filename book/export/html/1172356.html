<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The <em>turiya</em> consciousness is the Transcendental Reality. It is not a form of samadhi in the accurate sense of the term. When an individual soul establishes permanent and constant union with the Supreme Being, we say that he is enjoying the <em>turiya</em> consciousness. The possessor of <em>turiya</em> consciousness usually does not come down for manifestation because he likes to remain immersed in <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda</em>, Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. Here the seeker reaches the absolute height of evolution. This loftiest realisation has no direct link with <em>sahaja</em> samadhi.</p>
<p><em>Sahaja</em> samadhi holds the <em>turiya</em> consciousness. A possessor of <em>sahaja</em> samadhi embodies the <em>turiya</em> consciousness, and it is he who challenges earth-ignorance with a view to transforming it into the perfect creation. He embodies the highest transcendental Truth, Light, Peace, Bliss, Power and all divine qualities in boundless measure in his being, and he manifests these divine qualities in the easiest and most effective way in his multifarious day-to-day activities. In his outer life he acts like a divine child who has Eternity’s Height and Infinity’s Light at his disposal, sharing them with aspiring humanity cheerfully and unreservedly.</p>  </div>
