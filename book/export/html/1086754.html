<h2>Question: How does God know everything about me?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God knows everything about you because He has created you. When you do something, you know everything you have done because it is you who have done it. If you have drawn a picture, you will know from the very beginning what you have done; therefore, if I ask you how you have done it, you will be able to tell me everything in detail. Similarly, God has created you. Since He has created you, He is bound to know everything about you.</p>  </div>
