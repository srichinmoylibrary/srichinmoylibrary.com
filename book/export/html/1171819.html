<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do feel the responsibility to help all men. But help is a very big word. Only God can really help. I want to serve. With some people I feel that I can be of service on the physical plane. I am their spiritual leader, and I know that I will be able to deal with their material and spiritual problems. But with others, if I speak to them and try to help them on the physical plane, I will only create confusion. With them, I feel that my prayer, my concentration, my meditation will be more effective.</p>
<p>You have to know that there are different ways to serve the world. In the Himalayas, there are spiritual figures who live in caves and see no one. Yet, through their meditation, they send a divine vibration to the entire world. Here in the physical world I am unable to accept all and sundry as my disciples. I do not have the capacity. But those whom I do not accept as my own on the physical plane, I am not rejecting. I am helping them in the inner world. Starting at two o'clock every morning, I concentrate on humanity, on the universe. In the inner world I send my love and blessings to all. This is how God expects me to help or serve the world.</p>  </div>
