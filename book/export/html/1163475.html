<p><em>(Prince Siddhartha is walking in the garden in a contemplative mood. All of a sudden a bird falls down in front of him.)</em></p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Ah, poor bird! My heart is bleeding for you. Who has done this? Who has hurt you? Who has aimed this arrow at you? Poor, innocent bird! Let me take the arrow out of your body. <em>(He removes the arrow.)</em> Now let me try to cure you.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Devadatta)</em></p>
<p>DEVADATTA: Siddhartha, this is my bird. What right have you to keep my bird? Give it to me!</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: No, this is my bird, Devadatta.</p>
<p>DEVADATTA: Your bird! I shot this bird. It belongs to me. This is my arrow. I aimed at the bird and it fell down here. It is mine, mine, my property, my possession.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Devadatta, if I had not removed the arrow from the bird, it would have died by this time.</p>
<p>DEVADATTA: The point is not whether the bird would have died or would not have died. The bird is alive, and it is my possession. It was my power, my skill, my capacity that brought the bird down to earth. You cannot have it. Everybody appreciates and admires you for your heart, for your kindness. But now let the world appreciate my capacity, my skill. You be satisfied with what you have: love. And I shall be satisfied with what I have: power. My power, my skill at archery deserves this bird, not your love.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: O Devadatta, you have the power to kill, and I have the power to love. But since I have this animal, this poor innocent bird, you shall not get it back.</p>
<p>DEVADATTA: Siddhartha, there is a time to listen to your philosophy, and there are people to listen to your philosophy. But this is not the time, and I am not the person. You can advocate your philosophy to others who want to be like you, who want to live in the moon-world and have no practical sense. Life has to be practical. Life needs strength, life needs vigour. But your life is a life of laziness and false kindness. You should be strong. You are the Prince, and soon you will have to rule your Kingdom. This kind of false attitude will not help you in any way. What I have done today, you will do millions of times more. I was about to kill a bird. You will one day kill men. At that time your philosophy will change.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: No, Devadatta, my philosophy will always remain the same. My philosophy is the philosophy of compassion, and not the philosophy of destruction.</p>
<p>DEVADATTA: You stay with your philosophy, and let me stay with mine. My philosophy is power. Your philosophy is compassion. Well and good. Now give me my bird.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Sorry, I will not give it to you.</p>
<p>DEVADATTA: Are you prepared to go to the court to fight for this bird?</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Yes, I am fully prepared.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1163478" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Act I, scene II</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(The court.)</em></p>
<p>JUDGE: Prince, why do you keep a bird which belongs to somebody else? True, you have compassion, you have love for the bird. You have love for everything. But justice says the bird belongs to Devadatta. It was he who brought the bird down to earth. It is his possession.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: O venerable Judge, I do not know anything about justice, but my heart tells me that he who saves life is the owner, not he who takes life. My heart was bleeding for the bird and I saved it. I am prepared to give my own life for this bird.</p>
<p>DEVADATTA: Siddhartha, you know how to talk. You know perfectly well that no one will kill you in place of this bird. Don't show your false compassion.</p>
<p>JUDGE: Devadatta, I am the Judge. Let me hear more from him.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: O sir, I feel that this bird belongs to me because I have saved its life. Devadatta practically killed the bird. Please tell me who is more important, the life-saver or the life-destroyer?</p>
<p>JUDGE: Prince, I agree with you. The life-saver is infinitely more important than the life-taker. You have saved the bird's life; therefore it is you who can claim this bird. The bird is yours. He who saves life or gives new life is the real owner, and not he who takes life or destroys life. Today you have offered your life for a bird. A day will come, I clearly foresee, when you will offer your life for all of humanity. Your heart will cry to save the bleeding heart of humanity. Your heart will cry to illumine the unlit mind of humanity. Your soul will cry to elevate the consciousness of humanity.</p>
<p>DEVADATTA: Siddhartha, today your love-power has won the victory, but a day will come when I shall conquer you with my destruction-power. You will see that power conquers love.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Devadatta, you are wrong. Love will always conquer, for Love is the Almighty Power.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(Channa, Siddhartha's charioteer, is driving the Prince through the streets.)</em></p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Channa, I am so happy today. For the first time I have come out of the palace. I smell now the real fragrance of life. Look at this panoramic view. My entire being is in deep ecstasy.</p>
<p>CHANNA: O Prince, in your happiness is my happiness. I am always at your disposal.</p>
<p><em>(All of a sudden Siddhartha sees an old man before him.)</em></p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Channa, who is this man? He can't even walk. How strange-his hair is white. My hair is black, and yours is, too. Everyone in the palace has black hair. What is wrong with this man's hair?</p>
<p>CHANNA: Prince, he is an old man; therefore he is very weak. That is why he cannot walk properly. Old people have white hair. One day you and I also will grow old.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Me? I shall become old? Impossible! I feel miserable for that old man. Channa, I don't think that I shall ever have to become old.</p>
<p>CHANNA: Prince, how I wish that you would never become old! But, unfortunately, nobody can escape old age.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Channa, I feel really miserable for that old man, who is so thin and weak. Let us go back to the palace. I hope that tomorrow I shall not have to see an old man.</p>
<p>CHANNA: Oh, no. Tomorrow I shall drive you along another road.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: The very idea of becoming old in the future is making me sad.</p>
<p>CHANNA: Me too, O Prince.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1163481" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Act I, scene II</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(The following day Channa is driving Siddhartha in the chariot along a different road.)</em></p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Life outside the palace is really beautiful, Channa. Here everything is fresh, charming and soulful.</p>
<p>CHANNA: I am glad that you are enjoying your ride.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Inside the palace it is all luxury. Outside the palace it is all beauty, nature's beauty, life's beauty. <em>(All of a sudden Siddhartha sees a man lying in the street.)</em> Channa, who is this man? He can't even sit properly. He is lying down in the street. He is pressing his head with one hand and pressing his stomach with the other. His eyes are deeply sunken. He is moaning and shedding bitter tears. What is wrong with him? It seems that he is finding it difficult to breathe.</p>
<p>CHANNA: Prince, that man is sick. He is suffering from severe pain in his head and stomach. Perhaps he has other ailments, too. Prince, everyone falls sick once in a while.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: No! I have never fallen sick. I feel such sorrow for that man. Can I be of any help to him?</p>
<p>CHANNA: No, you cannot be of any help to him, Prince. Only a doctor can help him. I am sure that soon some of his friends will take him to a doctor. Prince, we should move away from this place. As it was yesterday, today also your joy is ruined. The world is full of misery.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: I see. I was totally ignorant of this. Tomorrow we must take another road and drive around the Kingdom.</p>
<p>CHANNA: Certainly. Tomorrow we will drive through other streets.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1163482" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Act I, scene III</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(The next day. Siddhartha and Channa are in the chariot. Channa has taken a new road.)</em></p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Beauty, beauty! Today I see and feel real beauty on earth. We have covered a long distance. We are passing through a series of beautiful spots. <em>(All of a sudden Siddhartha sees some people carrying a man on their shoulders. Tears are running down their cheeks.)</em> Channa, what is wrong with that fellow? Why should others have to carry him? And why are they crying?</p>
<p>CHANNA: Ah, that man is dead.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: What do you mean?</p>
<p>CHANNA: There is no life in him, Prince. His play on earth is over. Everybody has to die one day. Everybody has to go away from this world. Everybody has to suffer from death.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Not me! I don't want to die. My beloved wife also has to die? My darling Rahul also has to die? No, that can't be. I shall not be able to bear such a loss.</p>
<p>CHANNA: Prince, whoever lives on earth has to die eventually. Nobody can live forever.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Channa, I can't believe it. I don't want to believe it. I must conquer death, not only for myself, but for everybody. Channa, please tell me if there is anything more powerful, more destructive than death.</p>
<p>CHANNA: No, Prince, there is nothing more powerful and destructive than death. Death conquers everybody. We are all slaves of death.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Not me!</p>
<p>CHANNA: We are all at the mercy of death.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Not me! Channa, now that I have seen an old man, a sick man and a dead man, I think that I have seen everything bad that the world can show me. But something within me tells me that there are still things that I have not seen as yet. I want to come out tomorrow again.</p>
<p>CHANNA: If you want to come out of the palace again, I shall be more than happy to drive you, O Prince.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1163483" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Act I, scene IV</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(The next day. Siddhartha and Channa are in the chariot driving along the streets.)</em></p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Channa, we have covered a very good distance. Today everything is fine. Today I don't have to see an old man, a sick man or a dead man. Today I shall see and enjoy only nature's beauty, nature's lustre, nature's love, nature's heart and nature's soul.</p>
<p><em>(All of a sudden he sees someone meditating beneath a tree.)</em> SIDDHARTHA: Who is that man, Channa? What is he doing at the foot of that tree? Why are his eyes closed? What is he doing with a garland of beads?</p>
<p>CHANNA: I am answering your questions one by one, O Prince. Who is that man? He is a spiritual man. What is he doing at the foot of the tree? He is praying and meditating. Why are his eyes closed? He thinks that his prayers will be more sincere and his meditation will be more intense if he keeps his eyes closed. What is he doing with a garland of beads? He is repeating the name of God, and counting the number of chants on the beads.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: I believe all that you say, but what will he get by leading this kind of life?</p>
<p>CHANNA: He will get infinite Peace and infinite Joy.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Infinite Peace? Infinite Joy? I must go and talk to him. Channa, come along. Let us go and speak to this peculiar man.</p>
<p>CHANNA: Indeed, that's a nice idea.</p>
<p><em>(They leave the chariot and approach the spiritual man.)</em></p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: May I know your name? What do you do for your living? <em>(No answer from the spiritual man.)</em> Do you know that I am Prince Siddhartha? My father owns this Kingdom; he is the Lord of this Kingdom. You are ignoring his son. I can do anything to you that I want. For God's sake, don't waste my precious time!</p>
<p><em>(No answer from the spiritual man.)</em></p>
<p>CHANNA: Prince, forgive me. I must tell you something. He is a spiritual man. He is praying to God; he is meditating on God. We should not disturb him. Who knows what is happening inside him? Perhaps God and he are talking inwardly. Perhaps God is telling him how he can have infinite Peace and Bliss.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: I need that. I need infinite Peace and infinite Bliss, Channa. Do you think I will ever have that kind of Peace and Bliss?</p>
<p>CHANNA: Why not? Why not? Without fail you will have infinite Peace and infinite Bliss if you pray and meditate like this spiritual man.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Channa, then tomorrow a new life for me begins. I shall pray and meditate all day and night. My present life of luxury is no longer for me. I shall welcome the life of poverty. I shall embrace the life of renunciation. I shall put an end to suffering in this world. I know ignorance is the root of all suffering. I shall uproot the huge ignorance-tree, Channa; I shall exterminate it. The first day I saw an old man; the second day I saw a sick man; the third day I saw a dead man; today, the fourth day, I see a spiritual man. Either tomorrow, or in the near future, or in the distant future, I shall see another man, who has infinite Light, infinite Peace and infinite Bliss. My life is meaningless and useless without eternity's Light, infinity's Peace and immortality's Bliss. The human in me ends its role today, Channa. No more for me this life of pleasure. The divine in me shall begin its role tomorrow. For me, from now on, only the life of universal Peace and transcendental Bliss.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(Siddhartha is sitting under a tree in high meditation. Enter five ascetics.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST ASCETIC: O Siddhartha! Siddhartha Look at Siddhartha!</p>
<p>SECOND ASCETIC: I am sure he will soon realise the highest Truth.</p>
<p>THIRD ASCETIC: Without fail.</p>
<p>FOURTH ASCETIC: We have also been crying for our realisation. We have been praying to God and working so hard in our inner life. But still the realisation of God is a far cry for us. I am happy that at least one person will realise God.</p>
<p>FIFTH ASCETIC: At least Siddhartha will reach the highest Truth. It does not matter who reaches the Truth first; I want people to be free from ignorance.</p>
<p>FIRST ASCETIC: Let us not disturb him. He is in deep meditation, in trance. Let us not disturb poor Siddhartha. May God bless him. He has not been eating at all. He drinks only water. He is so weak, so weak. Poor fellow! Such a hard, austere life! I am sure God will soon grant him illumination.</p>
<p>SECOND ASCETIC: He could have enjoyed all the pleasures of the world. He was the Prince, and in every way he could have lived a life of pleasure.</p>
<p>THIRD ASCETIC: He knows that the life of pleasure cannot give him abiding satisfaction.</p>
<p>FOURTH ASCETIC: But it is very difficult to overcome vital movements, vital pleasure.</p>
<p>FIFTH ASCETIC: God has something special to do with Siddhartha's life. I can clearly see it.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Sujata, who bows down to Siddhartha and places before him a bowl of sweetmeats. Siddhartha opens his eyes and accepts food from Sujata.)</em></p>
<p>SUJATA: O Sage, I am so grateful to you that you have accepted my food. For days you have not eaten anything. Your body has become so weak, so thin. Now I shall bring food for you regularly. You pray to God; I shall serve you. I am so glad, so grateful that you will accept my devoted service.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: I have come to understand that starvation is not right. The extreme path is not the right way. The middle path is by far the best. To reach the highest Truth one need not stop eating altogether. One has to eat a moderate amount of food. The food that is necessary for health, to keep the body fit, one must eat. But at the same time one must not be a voracious eater. When I realise the highest Truth, mine will be the middle path.</p>
<p>FIRST ASCETIC: Shame, shame! Look at Siddhartha! He is eating food!</p>
<p>SECOND ASCETIC: Look who is serving him! Such a beautiful girl!</p>
<p>THIRD ASCETIC: Well, what can you expect? How long can one control his vital life?</p>
<p>FOURTH ASCETIC: Alas, Siddhartha has fallen.</p>
<p>FIFTH ASCETIC: He does not deserve our appreciation and admiration. He has taken sweetmeats from such a beautiful girl. He is serving his senses and he is feeding his body. See, the life of pleasure has already started. A woman is enough to destroy a man's aspiration no matter how sincere, how devoted he is. One beautiful woman is enough to take even such a great aspirant from the path of Truth. Let us go.</p>
<p>FIRST ASCETIC: Whom to blame? The girl or Siddhartha?</p>
<p>SECOND ASCETIC: I blame the girl. She has ruined Siddhartha's aspiration.</p>
<p>THIRD ASCETIC: I blame Siddhartha. Who asked him to be so weak? If he had been strong in his mind he could have rejected her.</p>
<p>FOURTH ASCETIC: Well, we must remember that it is a difficult task to conquer the wrong movements of the vital,</p>
<p>FIFTH ASCETIC: It is difficult also to pray to God, to meditate on Truth.</p>
<p>FOURTH ASCETIC: But since he made an attempt to realise the Highest, he should have continued.</p>
<p>FIFTH ASCETIC: I feel sorry for him. At the same time I feel that he can be of no use to us now. I thought that he would illumine us as soon as he got his own illumination.</p>
<p>THIRD ASCETIC: I thought the same. But now it is impossible. Let us leave, let us leave. Siddhartha has failed, Siddhartha has fallen.</p>
<p><em>(Exeunt the five ascetics)</em></p>
<p><em>(All this time Sujata is feeding Siddhartha and showing her loving, soulful gratitude to him. Tears of gratitude are flowing from her eyes.)</em></p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Sujata, don't pay any attention to them. They are ignorant people. From ignorant people we can expect only ignorance. You have come to feed me, and I am grateful to you. My blessingful joy you will always feel.</p>
<p>SUJATA: O Sage, I don't pay any attention to those ascetics. They are fools. They do not see your utmost sincerity. They do not see your burning cry for Truth, for God. It will take them thousands of years to realise God, but I clearly see that very soon you will reach your goal. I see that the day of your realisation is fast approaching.</p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: They came, and now they have left. They saw something in me, and that is why they wanted to stay. But when they saw me take food from you, they left. They left just because their minds are still impure; just because their vitals need more purification; just because they could not identify their lives with my aspiring consciousness and your dedicated consciousness. Your dedication knew and felt the depth of my aspiration. And my aspiration feels the depth of your dedication. Sujata, I bless you with all my heart and soul. Here I shall sit, here at the foot of the Bodhi tree. Here I shall realise the Truth. I shall not move from this spot anymore. Even if I suffer from cold or hunger or thirst, or from anything else, I shall not move. Here at this very place my Illumination must take place. And I shall put an end to sorrow.</p>
<p><em>(Sujata bows to Siddhartha and leaves. Siddhartha sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Hihasane shushyatu me shariram</em><br /><em>Twagasthi mangsam pralayancha jatu</em><br /><em>Aprapya bodhing vahukalpa durlabham</em><br /><em>Naivasanat kayamatah chalishye</em></p>


<p>[Here on this seat may wither my body;<br /> Skin, bone and flesh may be destroyed.<br /> Without getting the supreme Wisdom<br /> Attainable only with difficulty<br /> In myriad aeons,<br /> Definitely I shall not move from this seat.]</p>

<p><em>(Siddhartha meditates. He is having visions of life. The life of pleasure, vital movements, sex forces â€” all are trying to enter into him.)</em></p>
<p>SIDDHARTHA: Ah, these lower vital movements are trying to enter into me. No, I shall not permit them. I have my inner strength, indomitable strength. I shall fight against them.</p>
<p><em>(Siddhartha meditates with tremendous determination. Suddenly his whole being is flooded with Light. He starts to sing.)</em></p>

<p>Â Â  Â Â No more my heart shall sob or grieve.<br /> My days and nights dissolve in God's own Light.<br />Â Â  Â Â Above the toil of life my soul<br /> Is a Bird of Fire winging the Infinite.Â Â  Â Â I have known the One and His secret Play;<br /> And passed beyond the sea of ignorance-Dream.<br />Â Â  Â Â In tune with Him, I sport and sing,<br /> I own the golden Eye of the Supreme.Â Â  Â Â Drunk deep of Immortality,<br /> I am the root and boughs of a teeming vast.<br />Â Â  Â Â My Form I have known, and realised,<br /> The Supreme and I are one-all we outlast.</p>

<p><em>(All of a sudden his body begins radiating a golden Light and Siddhartha becomes the Enlightened One, the Buddha.)</em></p>
<p>BUDDHA: I know, at last I know the Truth! I know the way. I know the way to end sorrow, to exterminate the tree of suffering. From today I shall serve humanity with my inner Light. I have seen the Truth, and this Truth every human being on earth will achieve. My Truth is for all. My Love is for all. My Realisation is for all. I am for all. This life of mine, this dedicated life of mine, is for humanity's use. Now that I have the Transcendental Light within me, I shall go out into the world to teach others.</p>
<p><em>(Exit the Buddha)</em></p>
<p><em>(The five ascetics are meditating. Enter the Buddha)</em></p>
<p>BUDDHA: Now I have come to Benares, a sacred place. <em>(He sees the five ascetics)</em> Ahhh! Here are the five ascetics who came to me and left me.</p>
<p>FIRST ASCETIC: Look, here is Siddhartha again.</p>
<p>SECOND ASCETIC: But this time he cannot fool us.</p>
<p>THIRD ASCETIC: Certainly not. He cannot fool us anymore.</p>
<p>FOURTH ASCETIC: But look at him. He looks different.</p>
<p>FIFTH ASCETIC: I see something in him, something strange.</p>
<p>FIRST ASCETIC: Well, I seem to see some Light in him.</p>
<p>THIRD ASCETIC: His whole face is glowing.</p>
<p>FOURTH ASCETIC: His face? His entire body is glowing!</p>
<p>FIFTH ASCETIC: He is illumined, totally illumined!</p>
<p><em>(The Buddha approaches them. One by one they touch the Buddha's feet. The Buddha, with his compassionate smile, blesses them.)</em></p>

If your heart is so big, how then do you deny women the Truth that you have realised? Father, that is unfair. You have to accept my mother. And the day you accept her, you must accept all women.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: My son, I am truly proud of you. You are still a child, you have not yet seen even eleven summers, but your inner knowledge is profound. My son, your knowledge of Truth has given me enormous Joy and pride. The world listens to me. I have hundreds of disciples and they listen to me with devotion. I listen to you with my heart's pride and my soul's joy. Go and tell your mother that I have accepted her also as my true disciple. Today I take both of you into the Sangha, my spiritual community.</p>  </div>

<p>BUDDHA: Gautami, you are right. No family on earth can say that death has not visited it. You are suffering, and like you many, many others are suffering. Many have suffered and many will suffer. Not just many, Gautami-all. Everyone has to suffer from death. We came from Light and we shall go back to Light.</p>

<p>GAUTAMI: Please console me, Father. You are the only one who can do it.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Gautami, as long as there is life there will also be death. Birth is bound to be followed by death, and death is bound to be followed by birth. Now, Gautami, I shall tell you the cause of sorrow. You have lost your only child. Your life is overwhelmed with sorrow. But the cause of your sorrow is not death. The cause of sorrow is desire. The day you conquer desire you conquer sorrow, too. Pray and meditate. You will conquer desire, and at that moment you will see that Light and Delight have become your constant friends.</p>
<p>GAUTAMI: O Sage, you are my Master. Today I know you. I have nobody on earth, nobody. I have no husband, I have no child-nobody but you. You are my All. You have consoled me. Now what I need from you is inner illumination. I shall dedicate my entire life to you unconditionally, wholeheartedly. It is through my dedicated service to you, Master, that I shall achieve my illumination.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Gautami, you are right, absolutely right. My child, your life is destined to enter into the realm of eternal Bliss. Meditate on God. Meditate on Truth. You will attain Peace, Joy and Bliss.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(King Prasenjit and Kshema.)</em></p>
<p>KING: Kshema, you are a great disciple of the Buddha. He is proud of your wisdom and I am fascinated by your spiritual insight. You have been at my palace for a few days, and you have given much wisdom to all the members of my royal family. I offer you my deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: O King, I am so happy that I have been able to serve my Lord Buddha in your royal family.</p>
<p>KING: Kshema, tell me in a few words about Buddha's philosophy. You have to forgive me, but I do not have much time. My work in the Kingdom is simply killing me. I am overburdened, but I am deeply interested in Buddha's philosophy. Tell me in a few words.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: Your Majesty, Buddha's teaching is very simple. He gives us the message of renunciation. He gives us the message of compassion. It is through renunciation and compassion that one can enter into Nirvana.</p>
<p>KING: One thing more, O Kshema.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: Tell me.</p>
<p>KING: Why has Buddha not spoken about the soul? We Hindus all believe in the existence of the soul. Nothing can be done without the soul.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: True, he has not spoken about the soul, but he has spoken about the inner Light. What is that inner Light if not the soul? He has not used the term soul, but what he speaks of as the inner Light is nothing but the soul.</p>
<p>KING: He has not used the term God. We Hindus believe in God.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: True, he has not used the term God. But he has used the term Truth. What is Truth? Truth is God. God is Truth. The moment you realise the Highest Truth, you will realise God the infinite.</p>
<p>KING: It seems to me that Buddha has not spoken about life after death or about life after Nirvana.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: True, Buddha has not spoken about life after death and life after Nirvana, but he has told us why death exists, and he has told us a little about Nirvana. He has given us the message of peace. Death exists when there is no peace. When you have peace, there is no death. As for the life after Nirvana, first we have to know what Nirvana is. Nirvana is infinite Delight. What can there be after infinite Delight?</p>
<p>KING: I don't understand your philosophy, Kshema.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: Let me try to make it clear to you. From your palace you can see the Ganges?</p>
<p>KING: Yes.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: You can see the sand on the bank of the Ganges. Now send whomever you want from your Kingdom to count the number of grains of sand. Or send somebody to measure the weight of the ocean. Can anybody from your Kingdom do it, your Majesty?</p>
<p>KING: I am sorry, I do not think anybody can count the number of grains of sand on the shore, or measure the weight of the ocean.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: True. Nobody can count the grains of sand on the bank of the Ganges or weigh the water in the ocean. Similarly, when you enter into Nirvana, there Bliss is infinite. It cannot be measured, weighed or counted. It is unfathomable. In that highest realm of Bliss we see the meeting place of existence and non-existence. There non-existence and existence are inseparable, indescribable.</p>  </div>

One day the world will come to know that the cause of suffering is desire. Now people are still quarrelling, fighting and killing each other. I have some sad news for you: just last week a member of the royal family was stabbed to death by Angulimal, the dacoit. I am sure you have heard about Angulimal.

<p>ANANDA: Lord, we should immediately move to some other place.</p>

<p>BUDDHA: O Ananda, most loving child, if we move from one place to another with the idea of finding a better place for manifesting the Truth, we shall never be successful. Truth has to be manifested here where we are, and not elsewhere. Once the Truth is established here, in the twinkling of an eye the Truth will be founded everywhere. Either here or nowhere the Truth must be established. Again and again I must tell you, Ananda, the Truth has to be seen, felt and realised within, and then manifested here on earth, wherever we are, and nowhere else.</p>  </div>

<p>AJATASHATRU: What kind of inner disease? What do you mean by inner disease, Dr. Jaivaka? How will you cure me?</p>
<p>DR. JAIVAKA: O King, I will not be able to cure you because your disease is not physical. Your disease is mental, psychological, spiritual. Only Buddha can cure you.</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: Buddha? Lord Buddha? Do you know that Devadatta and I are intimate friends, most intimate friends?</p>

<p>AJATASHATRU: Then why do you say that Buddha can cure me? That is impossible.</p>

Your heart is feeling miserable for what you have done to your father and for what you have been doing to Buddha, the innocent Buddha, the Light of the world. Once you rolled a big stone toward him while he was meditating on his disciples, but it veered away before hitting him. On another occasion, you set a mad elephant to destroy him. But Buddha just looked at the elephant and it bowed down to him. Instigated by Devadatta, in various ways you have tried to kill him, but each time you have failed, and you will always fail. Buddha has realised the highest Truth. Your heart is crying for the highest Truth. This is your disease, the disease of your spiritual heart. If you really want to be cured, go to Buddha. He is the Divine Doctor, the Doctor Supreme. Nobody on earth but Buddha can cure you. He can and he will.</p>

I told you that one day with my vital love of power I would conquer your heart's power of love. Since then I have tried in hundreds of ways to humiliate you, to ruin your mission and to kill you, but I have failed. You forgave me then, O Siddhartha.

<p><em>(The Buddha and his disciple Sariputra.)</em></p>
<p>SARIPUTRA: O Lord Buddha, I am sure that you are the greatest of all spiritual Masters. Nobody before you attained to your height, and nobody after you will be able to equal you. You are unparalleled. You will always remain unparalleled. Nobody has come near your realisation, and nobody will ever come near your realisation.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Sariputra, how do you know that nobody before me has ever attained to what I have attained? And how do you know that nobody will surpass me in the future? How can you make this kind of utterance? Do you know anything of the past? Do you know anything of the future?</p>
<p>SARIPUTRA: O Lord, I do not know anything about the past or the future, but I know everything about you.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Sariputra, you are a fool. You know very little about me. A spiritual Master of my calibre cannot be known totally by anybody on earth. You see my outer history, my outer life. But my inner life you do not see, you cannot see. In my outer life I do perhaps ten things a day. In my inner life I am doing millions of things daily. The inner life of a spiritual Master will always remain a mystery. The outer life of the Master may be observed, but it will not always be understood. Very often it will be misunderstood. So, Sariputra, about my outer life you know practically nothing, and about my inner life you know nothing at all.</p>
<p>SARIPUTRA: I know nothing, true. But I know who you are. You are my liberation and you are my All.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Sariputra, do not think of the past. Do not think of the future. Think only of the present. The past we have left behind. The future has not yet arrived. To think of things that we have left behind is useless, and to think of things that have not yet happened is equally useless. Forget about the past. Forget about the future. Think only of the present. It is today that you have to aspire. It is today that you have to realise. It is today that you have to manifest. It is today that you have to conquer all your desires. It is today that you have to bring to the fore all your aspiration. It is today that you have to become what you inwardly are, the Light. It is today that you have to give to the world at large what you are, the Light.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(The Buddha and Ananda.</em> )</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Ananda, I am now an old man. I am eighty years old. Ananda, for fifty years I have been teaching and preaching. The time has come for me to depart from this world. I am weak. I am an invalid. My whole body is shattered, Ananda. This body can be of no more use here on earth.</p>
<p>ANANDA <em>(shedding tears!:</em> No, Master, no. You have to stay with us for quite a long time more. Your very presence is a great blessing to humanity. This <em>Sangha</em> is not yet well established. This <em>Sangha</em> needs your physical presence.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Ananda, do you mean to say that the <em>Sangha</em> expects something new from me? Do you mean to say that I have not spoken in clear terms what I have to say about this <em>Dharma?</em> I have not kept anything hidden from you people. Never have I shown any sign of reticence, nor any indifference. Besides, I never thought that I would have to conduct and manage the <em>Sangha,</em> and that it would always depend on me. So why should I stay? Why should I be involved any longer in the activities of the <em>Sangha?</em> Ananda, from now on be self-sufficient. Have faith in yourself. Lead a spiritual life. You will realise the highest Truth. He who follows the <em>Dharma,</em> he who takes refuge in the <em>Dharma,</em> will alone enter into the world of Bliss, and nobody else.</p>
<p>ANANDA: O Lord Buddha, what you say is perfectly true, but our hearts cannot live without you. We need you. We shall eternally need you.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Ananda, you need me. I need you. Again, the Truth Eternal needs us both. The Truth Eternal needs me in the world of the Beyond, and the same Truth needs you here on earth. My life has come to an end. All the experiences of the world I offer to the world. Yesterday I ate at Chunda's house. Since then I have been feeling weaker, but I wish to assure you that this weakness is not due to his food. I am suffering, true, but it is not his fault at all. He gave me food with utmost love and devotion. Nobody should blame him when I die. I offer him my deepest blessings. Before I was illumined, before I became the Enlightened One, Sujata's food helped me to live on earth. Her food made it possible for me to meditate. And now Chunda's food is helping me to enter into the Highest Nirvana. I see no difference between Sujata's food and Chunda's food. Each has served a special purpose of its own.</p>
<p><em>(Enter a few intimate disciples.)</em></p>
<p>ANANDA: Look! Look! Today the Buddha's whole body is flooded with Light. This Light we have never seen around him. Such celestial Light!</p>
<p>THE DISCIPLES: Yes, Lord, today we see something totally new in you which we have never seen before. Your whole face is inundated with Light and Delight.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Ananda, today reminds me of my days at the foot of the Bodhi tree. Just before I entered into Nirvana this body had the same Light, the same Delight. Today once again this body is flooded with Light and Delight. You are seeing it for the first time. But I am seeing it for the second time. The day ends, and my earthly sojourn ends along with it. Therefore, all of you are seeing this Light in me and around me.</p>
<p><em>(Ananda bursts into tears and is about to leave.)</em></p>
<p>BUDDHA: Ananda, stay here. Don't go away. My life can now be measured in minutes. Ananda, do not cry for me. I tell all of you not to cry for me. Ananda, I have told you repeatedly that everything is transient on earth. There is nothing everlasting here. Anything that comes into life will have to give up life. You have served me, O Ananda, most devotedly, most soulfully, and for that I offer you my last blessings. Proceed on your inner strength, and you will receive liberation. You will have your liberation in due course. My spiritual journey began with renunciation and compassion, and today, at the end of my journey's close, I offer to the world the same message: renunciation and compassion. O Ananda, do not grieve.</p>
