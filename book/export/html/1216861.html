<p>When I was in an Indian restaurant in Australia, an Indian lady asked me where I came from. I said I came from Bengal. She said, "I am also from Bengal."</p>
<p>I said, "I am from Chittagong." Then immediately she said she was from Shakpura, which is where I grew up.</p>
<p>I asked her some questions in case she was fooling me. Although I am much older than she, she was really from Shakpura. Her name was Anita.</p>
<p>The restaurant we were in was only three and a half miles from her present home. She had come to Australia with her son.</p>
