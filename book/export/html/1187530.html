<p>When he saw his Master<br /> For the very first time,<br /> It took him only<br /> A few fleeting moments<br /> To bring his inner existence<br /> To the fore.<br /> He is indeed a chosen seeker,<br /> For there are many, many on earth<br /> Who simply will not be able<br /> To do what he has so easily<br /> And so spontaneously done.</p>
