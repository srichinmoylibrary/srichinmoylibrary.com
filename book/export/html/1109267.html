<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes a dog has better intuition than a human being. Dogs have developed intuition, which lets them know when something is stolen. But do you think that a dog will become God-realised before you?</p>
<p>You can use your intuitive talent to expedite your journey. If it is not properly used, then it can be a hindrance. But if you use intuition properly, then you will get more Grace, abundant Grace, infinite Grace. If you don't squander this Compassion-Grace, then naturally you will make the fastest progress. Grace helps you to make the fastest progress. Grace is not only capacity; it is something more. God's Grace embodies His infinite Reality. God's Compassion-Grace and His Reality are inseparable. But intuition is not the same as Grace, and it can be totally separated from God-Reality.</p>  </div>
