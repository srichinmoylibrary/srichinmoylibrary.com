<p>We also had Germanyâ€™s number one marathon runner, Christophe Herle. His timing is 2:09. Before I lifted him, I was talking to him. He is very, very nice. I said that my best timing is 3:55. He did not laugh. He was smiling.</p>
<p>Then he asked me how many times I had run a marathon. I told him that I have run 22 marathons.</p>
<p>He has run only four marathons.</p>
