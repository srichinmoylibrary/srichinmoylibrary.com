<p>In Bukittinggi, I was bargaining to buy a synthesizer. The man in the store was coming down only 2,500 rupiah, so I did not want to get it.</p>
<p>I told Savyasachi to take Vijali there to bargain with them some more. She has immediate luck.</p>
<p>The synthesizer has one setting that sounds like a violin and another that sounds like a harpsichord. With my Yamaha, I have to push several buttons in order to make these sounds.</p>
