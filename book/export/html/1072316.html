<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there are some Indian <em>asanas</em> that can offer a fresh supply of energy to the nerves, and to a certain extent the muscle-power can be increased by taking these exercises. If one is interested in this, he can go to some Hatha Yoga experts who can demonstrate and teach those particular exercises.</p>  </div>
