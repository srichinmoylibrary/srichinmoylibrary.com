<p>Then I went down the 150th Street hill. I saw a van that said something like, "C. S. Company." A young man with curly hair said, "Hello, Sri Chinmoy! Hello, Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>Then I started to walk another mile. When I had walked about 1500 metres, I saw a cyclist coming. I went another 100 metres to complete my mile. Then I saw him stop. I said to myself, "Something is wrong with his bicycle."</p>
<p>He started saying, "Sri, Sri, Sri Chinmoy!" He was so happy to see me.</p>
<p>I smiled. Then, very slowly, he rode with me to Main Street, beaming with joy.He made a right turn and I made a turn towards my mile mark.</p>
<p>Both these young men were so thrilled to see me.</p>
