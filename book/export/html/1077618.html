<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul knows that it has come from Infinity and that here on earth it is moving in Infinity and marching or running forward to its home, which is all Infinity and Eternity. The soul is playing a game and that game is called the game of manifestation. Each time the soul enters into the world it makes the solemn promise that it will manifest God here on earth. This time your soul has accepted a particular body and it is trying to manifest something divine on earth through this body. In its next incarnation it will take another body to manifest other divine qualities.</p>  </div>
