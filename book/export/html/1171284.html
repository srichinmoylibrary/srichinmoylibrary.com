<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How will we get peace without prayer and meditation? There is no other way. Politicians talk about peace. Next moment they go and fight. So my way has nothing to do with politics, although many politicians are very kind and affectionate to me. When I meet with politicians of the highest order, we meditate together and try to bring about inner peace.</p>  </div>
