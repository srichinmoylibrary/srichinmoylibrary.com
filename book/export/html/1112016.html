<p>This morning I ran four miles. The first mile I ran in 12:13. I said, "Great! Very near 13, my lucky number."</p>
<p>The second mile I ran in 10:21. I couldn't believe it! Instead of descending, I went faster. This was all because I got inspiration from Chidananda. After the first mile I saw Chidananda drive by in his car, and he was smiling like anything.</p>
<p>I said to myself, "Definitely he didn't meditate at six o'clock. Otherwise, he wouldn't be out at this hour." Sunirmalya was in the car with Chidananda. They were going to play tennis. Later Sunirmalya told me they had left the house at 6:16, right after meditation.</p>
<p>My third mile was 9:37. Then my fourth mile was 8:57.</p>
