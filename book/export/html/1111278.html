<p>When I had run another mile and a half, I stopped for a second or two. Immediately a tiny dog came and sat by my right foot, wanting me to caress it and give it a little kindness. I never do this kind of thing, but this time I bent a little to touch the dog's head. The owner, who was bald-headed, wearing a grey coat, came over to me and said, "My Dolly has fallen in love with you."</p>
<p>I kept caressing the dog. The owner said, "Dolly, do you want to become a great runner like this gentleman?"</p>
<p>I said, "How I wish I could become a great runner!"</p>
