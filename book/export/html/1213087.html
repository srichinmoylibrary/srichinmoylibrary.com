<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, like some illustrious philosophers, do you not think that human life is a vapid experience?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, I do not agree with those great philosophers. To those unfortunate human beings who are not aspiring, life may seem a dull, flat and flavourless routine. But to the fortunate souls who are consciously striving to reach the supreme Goal, human life is a challenging and fulfilling reality. If you look at the world with God’s Eyes and in God’s Way, then in no time you will come to realise that the ever-fulfilling world is the Reality of the ever-growing Divinity.</p>  </div>
