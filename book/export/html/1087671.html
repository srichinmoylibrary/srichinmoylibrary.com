<p>Once a merchant was passing through the mountains with his caravan to bring goods to another town. On the way, there was a terrible storm and lightning struck the caravan. The merchant and many other people were killed, and there was nobody to take responsibility for the goods being carried in the caravan.</p>
<p>When Babar heard of the tragedy, he asked his soldiers to collect all the goods and keep them in a safe place. Then he sent for the merchant's relatives to come to him immediately, and he gave everything to them. The members of the merchant's family were overwhelmed by Babar's concern and kindness. They wanted to give the Emperor an expensive present, but he would not accept it. They begged him at least to take some reimbursement for his trouble, but again Babar refused.</p>
<p>He said, "No, I can't do that. You have lost your dearest one. Now I can't take advantage of his death. It is your wealth and property; it is you who deserve it."</p>
<p>So Babar gave everything to the merchant's relatives without accepting any reward for his kindness and concern. The merchant's family was deeply moved.</p>  </div>
