<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we aspire, we find that we have the capacity to pray and the capacity to meditate. Prayer takes us up into the highest Beyond and shows us the face of the Ultimate Truth. Meditation brings down the reality of the Beyond into the vastness of our own inner silence and enables us to offer this reality to the world at large.</p>  </div>
