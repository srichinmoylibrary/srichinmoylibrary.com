  <h1 class="book-heading">Indian-style bargaining</h1>
  
 
<p>In another store in Korea, I saw something I liked and asked the elderly lady at the counter how much it cost.</p>
<p>The lady said, "$13." I had bought a few things already from her, so I said, "No, $10!" and gave her $10.</p>
<p>She said, "No, you have to give me three more." Since I was bargaining, I told the lady I had no more money.</p>
<p>I thought that all my money was in my left pocket and that only some papers were in my right pocket. To show the lady that I had no more money, I pulled all the papers out of my right pocket. O God, so much money came out!</p>
<p>The shopkeeper said, "You have money."</p>
<p>What was I going to do? I smiled at her very soulfully and offered her the other three dollars, but she didn't take it. She gave me the item for $10.</p>
<p>When I said I had no money, I was not telling a lie. I was just bargaining in my Indian manner. But after she saw all my money, I smiled at her and she became so nice!</p>
