<p>Today, the day of the U. N. Peace Run, I walked over 22 miles. From my house I walked to Flushing Meadow Park on a particular course which is five miles. Then I walked two miles on our Flushing Meadow "Runners Are Smilers" course. After that I took a little rest.</p>
<p>Then, for the first and last time, I walked along Queens Boulevard into Manhattan to the U.N. It is very bad to walk that way into Manhattan. There were so many undivine things, but the noise of the cars was the worst. It killed me. Why did I have to listen to so much noise? I took an oath that it would be the last time.</p>
