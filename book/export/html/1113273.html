<p>I took a copy of it from Robi-da and gave Nolini-da's translations of both Robi-da's poem and mine to Sethna. He deeply enjoyed both poems and subsequently published them in the Mother India. Sethna said to me: "Chinmoy, Amrita's comment on Robi's poem is wonderful and what he said about your poem is also very, very nice. I do not know what you and Robi have done with your Bengali originals, but I must say Nolini's translations are extremely beautiful."</p>  </div>
