<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Forces are always loitering around. Once they have conquered one person, they try to go to someone else. Every year after our main celebration in India, how many undivine calamities used to take place! Sometimes even on that very day many sad things took place.</p>
<p>If you know that someone in your spiritual family is doing something wrong, then tell me. The patient should be brought to the doctor as soon as possible. What is spirituality? It is oneness, oneness, oneness. You are afraid to tell me, but when the patient is dead, at that time you will say, "I knew it long ago." A doctor will get the proper opportunity to cure the patient only if he catches the disease right at the beginning. I am your spiritual doctor, but you do not give me the proper chance.</p>
<p>When close disciples leave, how many people actually sympathise and how many people get malicious joy? Most people only shed crocodile tears. If twenty persons really try to bring back the one who has left, then the hostile force that has taken away the disciple will have to surrender. But how many people will pray to the Supreme to bring back that disciple? Again, when I try with my love to bring back disciples who have left, they are afraid of me because they feel that I have some magnetic power.</p>  </div>
