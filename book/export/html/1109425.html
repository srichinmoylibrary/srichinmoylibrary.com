<p>The sole function of Art is to discover beauty within and without. And Art is in itself a self-expression of the different levels of Consciousness.</p>
<p>The mysterious slogan "Art for Art's sake" expressed by Victor Cousin is, however, only partially true. To quote Sri Aurobindo: "Art for Art's sake certainly â€” Art as a perfect form of and discovery of Beauty; but also Art for the soul's sake, the spirit's sake and the expression of all that the soul, the spirit, wants to seize through the medium of Beauty."</p>  </div>
