<p>Dear to my Lord<br /> Is my aspiration-heart.<br /> Dearer to my Lord<br /> Is my surrender-life.<br /> Dearest to my Lord<br /> Is my gratitude-breath.</p>

<p>If your mind climbs up the pride-ladder,<br /> Your life before long<br /> Will fade into obscurity<br /> And your heart will not be rediscovered<br /> By Heaven's Concern.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186649" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1003</h1>
  
 

<p>True, he cannot control his mind.<br /> But his life has surrendered to his heart.<br /> Therefore, his life is anchored<br /> In the Golden Boat of the Lord Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186650" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1004</h1>
  
 

<p>His heart's ever-blossoming hope<br /> Is holding both ends<br /> Of the Infinity-Rope<br /> Of God's Eternity.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1005</h1>
  
 

<p>He lives in ignorance-night<br /> With only the echoing memories<br /> Of his soul's long-lost promises.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186652" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1006</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord, destroy me!<br /> If You do not want to destroy me,<br /> At least destroy my mind's hopelessness.<br /> If you do not want to destroy<br /> My mind's hopelessness,<br /> Please, please destroy<br /> My heart's helplessness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186653" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1007</h1>
  
 

<p>Your soul is asking you<br /> To sleep in your life's illumination-bed.<br /> But what are you doing?<br /> You are forcing your life<br /> To lie beneath its annihilation-blanket.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186654" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1008</h1>
  
 

<p>Finally his heart's aspiration-life<br /> Became so powerful<br /> That it was able to totally paralyse<br /> His mind's desire-life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186655" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1009</h1>
  
 

<p>God will not be there to receive you<br /> If you hurriedly reach<br /> Your life's finish line.<br /> He will not only receive you<br /> But also garland you and embrace you<br /> If you slowly, steadily and soulfully reach<br /> Your life's finish line.</p>

<p>What is wrong with you, my mind!<br /> Why can't you accept any defeat?<br /> What is wrong with you, my heart!<br /> Why are you afraid of winning<br /> Continuous victories?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186657" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1011</h1>
  
 

<p>If your heart is ready<br /> To sparkle with eagerness,<br /> Then God will definitely come<br /> And stand right in front of you<br /> With His Infinity's Fulness.</p>
  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1013</h1>
  
 

<p>You may not realise it,<br /> But God is carrying you,<br /> And you are quite heavy.<br /> Perhaps it is beyond your imagination,<br /> But God has also developed<br /> Very serious back pain<br /> Because of your weight.<br /> Can you not lighten His Load and cure Him<br /> With your obedience-surrender-medicine?<br /> Try, you can!<br /> You have simply no idea<br /> How proud God will be of you<br /> If you do.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186660" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1014</h1>
  
 

<p>My heart has undertaken<br /> A very difficult task.<br /> It wants to guide<br /> My mind's irregular search for God.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1016</h1>
  
 

<p>Do you want to hear<br /> What you say during your sleep?<br /> You say that you love God alone<br /> And need God alone, nobody else.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186663" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1017</h1>
  
 

<p>Your heart feels that God<br /> Does not speak to it<br /> Because it is imperfect.</p>
<p>Your mind thinks that God<br /> Does not speak to it<br /> Because it has already reached<br /> Perfection-height.</p>

<p>Do you know God<br /> Or do you just know about Him?<br /> If you know God,<br /> Then I shall immediately become yours.<br /> But if you just know about God,<br /> Then even if the entire world claims you,<br /> I shall never become yours.</p>

<p>When a true God-lover<br /> Cannot decide what to do<br /> In his outer life,<br /> God, out of His infinite Bounty,<br /> Takes it as His bounden Duty<br /> To help that person choose<br /> The right thing to do.</p>

<div id="node-1186679" class="section-2">

<p>Something is wrong,<br /> But I do not know what.<br /> Perhaps my heart does not<br /> Love God intensely anymore.</p>
<p>Something is right,<br /> But I do not know what.<br /> Perhaps my mind has sincerely<br /> Started longing for God at last.</p>

<p>Your heart's climbing cry<br /> Is like a rope,<br /> Longer than the longest,<br /> Extending from earth to Heaven.<br /> Once you start climbing that rope<br /> Cheerfully and powerfully,<br /> Who can prevent you from reaching<br /> The highest perfection-satisfaction-height?</p>

<p>Pride and insecurity<br /> Come from only one source: impurity.<br /> He who is bloated with pride<br /> And he who is insecurity incarnate<br /> Are both absolutely useless.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186684" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1038</h1>
  
 

<p>Purity has the capacity<br /> To immediately destroy<br /> Insecurity and pride.<br /> Purity has the capacity<br /> To immediately create<br /> Oneness with God's<br /> Transcendental Will.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186685" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1039</h1>
  
 

<p>Whoever experiences<br /> His life's surrender-smiles<br /> As a permanent reality<br /> Is undoubtedly the choicest instrument<br /> Of his Beloved Supreme.</p>

<p>If you are loyal to God<br /> And take Him as your only Friend,<br /> How can you have any serious problems?<br /> Impossible!<br /> Even your mind-problems<br /> Will be taken care of<br /> By His Heart's Compassion-Concern-Sky.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186687" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1041</h1>
  
 

<p>If your consciousness<br /> Remains deep inside your heart<br /> And you are constantly<br /> Thinking of God,<br /> Then all your problems will be solved,<br /> Even if you simply ignore them.<br /> Needless to say,<br /> This applies only to you,<br /> Since you are a soulfully sincere seeker.</p>

<p>For years you have neglected<br /> Your teeming weaknesses.<br /> But now that you want<br /> To conquer them,<br /> What you need<br /> Is an ever-climbing heart-cry.</p>

<p>Aspiration-fire is immediate purification.<br /> It powerfully purifies<br /> The sleeping body,<br /> The strangling vital<br /> And the doubting mind.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1045</h1>
  
 

<p>In your life of service to humanity<br /> Confidence is supremely good,<br /> But do not develop<br /> Disproportionate self-confidence,<br /> Not to speak of pride and haughtiness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186692" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1046</h1>
  
 

<p>If you think that you are<br /> Most graciously helping others,<br /> You are badly mistaken.<br /> You should feel that you are offering<br /> Your service-smile<br /> To the Supreme in others.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186693" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1047</h1>
  
 

<p>If your service-life<br /> Is only increasing your ego-power,<br /> Then rest assured<br /> You are a stark failure<br /> In the inner world.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186694" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1048</h1>
  
 

<p>Someday you will realise<br /> That your Master is<br /> The direct representative<br /> Of the Supreme.<br /> Someday you will realise<br /> Your Master's Eternity's oneness<br /> With the Supreme.</p>

<p>He started with utmost sincerity<br /> Trying to please the Supreme<br /> In the Supreme's own divine Way.<br /> Alas, now he is shamelessly<br /> Begging the Supreme to please him<br /> In his own human way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186696" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1050</h1>
  
 

<p>Either please God<br /> In His own Way<br /> Or go back to your old life<br /> Where your desire-fires<br /> Reigned supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186697" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1051</h1>
  
 

<p>If you feel that God's Way<br /> Is not the only way,<br /> And you have a totally different way,<br /> Then why should anybody<br /> Care to prevent you<br /> From following your own way?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186698" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1052</h1>
  
 

<p>True, nobody is indispensable.<br /> But if you can please the Supreme<br /> In His own Way,<br /> Then He will definitely need you<br /> Infinitely more than He needs<br /> Anybody else.</p>
