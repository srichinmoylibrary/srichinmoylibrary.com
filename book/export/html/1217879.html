 <p>
AUM 239-242. Bayamon, Puerto Rico, August 1, 1967. These are the highlights of a radio interview held during Sri Chinmoy's recent summer visit to Puerto Rico. The program was broadcast from Radio Station WLUZ, Bayamon, Puerto Rico, on Aug. 1, 1967, from 5:00 to 5:20 p.m. The interviewer was the well-known Puerto Rican radio personality Senor Jose Miguel Agrelot. He later invited Sri Chinmoy to be a guest on his program whenever the Guru visits the Island.</p>
<h2>Senor Agrelot: What is actually meant by Yoga?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yoga means union. This union is between man and God. Yoga tells us that we have a divine quality called Aspiration within us and that God has a divine quality called Compassion. Yoga is the common link between our Aspiration and God’s Compassion.</p>  </div>
