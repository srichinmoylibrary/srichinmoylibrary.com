<p>One thin girl who had run in our twenty-four-hour race was running the marathon. She is very thin, like Kusumita. Her name is Kim. She had been behind me, but around the ten-mile point she passed me. As she went by she shouted, "Hello, Guru. I am happy to see you." While she was saying this, she was taking off her long-sleeved shirt. It was like our purple shirt. It had my picture on the back and said "Sri Chinmoy Marathon." Underneath she was wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt. I thought she would throw the long-sleeved shirt on the street, but she held it as she ran.</p>
<p>I saw two or three more non-disciples wearing different shirts of ours. But Kim was the only one who recognised me.</p>
