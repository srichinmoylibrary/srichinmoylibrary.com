<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is through prayer and meditation. Right now this body that we claim as our own is our only truth. This body, which will live for sixty or seventy years, is our life. But when we pray and meditate, we see that this body is not our entire existence. We also have a soul, which lives in eternal life. Here on earth for seventy years or so we play a specific role; then we leave the body and take rest. After some time, again we will come back to earth to love and manifest God.</p>
<p>How can we be eternally aware of what we have within us? We can be eternally aware of our inner existence, of our eternal life, only through constant prayer and meditation.</p>
