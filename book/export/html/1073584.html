<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Once God was extremely hungry. Then, lo and behold, somebody came out from God's Body to feed Him. God was highly pleased and gave him the name 'man'. Then God said, "There shall come a day when I shall come out of your body to feed you, and you will give Me the name 'God'."</p>  </div>
