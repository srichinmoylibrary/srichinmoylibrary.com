<p>My Dumaguete friends, my brothers and sisters, I am a man of prayer; I am a student of peace. I am praying to the Heavenly Father to bring to the fore all your divine qualities and to increase them in boundless measure. I am praying to the Heavenly Father to bestow upon each of you His Dream Message, which is peace. And I am also praying to the Heavenly Father to give you joy in infinite measure and to give you ceaseless and indomitable strength to love both Him and His Son, the Saviour Christ, and to please Them in Their own Way.</p>
<p>This is my prayer to the Heavenly Father for you, my dear friends, my sisters and brothers of Dumaguete.</p>
