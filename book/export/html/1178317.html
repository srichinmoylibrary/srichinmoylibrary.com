<p>The outer world<br /> Doubts his sincerity-mind.<br /> The inner world<br /> Doubts his purity-heart.<br /> But he is not lost at all.<br /> Do you know why?<br /> Because he does not doubt himself.<br /> As long as he has implicit faith in himself,<br /> He need not worry<br /> What the outer world thinks of him<br /> Or what the inner world thinks of him.</p>
