<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. Total, inseparable oneness with God is one thing and the manifestation of that inseparable oneness on earth is another thing. When someone realises God, he and God become consciously inseparable. But that is not the end of the game. He has to manifest God; he and God have to consciously play together. Before realisation he was an unconscious instrument of God. Now he has to become a constant, conscious instrument of God.</p>  </div>
