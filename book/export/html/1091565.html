<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, not just by thinking, but by exercising our inner will-power. If I want to become the richest man on earth, I cannot do it just by thinking about it. I have to concentrate and bring forward my soul's will-power. The more I can identify with my soul's will-power, the easier it will be for me to manifest whatever I want to manifest. First we have to discover our inner will-power, and then we have to exercise it. If we do this, we can become whatever we want to be.</p>  </div>
