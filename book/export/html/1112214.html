<p>Usually I see quite a few people in the street when I run. This morning I did not even see Sulochana on her famous block. Then I saw Nemi's car. Nemi was probably going to our Runners are Smilers race. Quite a few cars were having problems because of the snow. It was very dangerous. Some buses were stuck at the top of 150th Street. They did not dare to go down 150th Street hill!</p>
