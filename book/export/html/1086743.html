<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God stays alive because He takes two types of food. One food is man's inner cry. He likes it very much. He eats another food that is called His Compassion. In Heaven He eats His Compassion-food and on earth He eats cry-food. When man cries to Him, He eats cry-food on earth. By eating the foods of Compassion and cry, He will always remain alive.</p>  </div>
