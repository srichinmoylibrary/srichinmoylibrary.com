<p><em>Sister Patricia:</em> When you hold a meditation, do you pre-plan it? Do you have a form before you start?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. Sometimes I hold meditations for seven hours, and we also have had a thirteen-hour meditation. Once my students meditated with me for thirteen hours and two or three times they have meditated with me for seven hours. Just a few months ago I invited the general public to come and meditate with me for seven hours, in three sessions. But there is no preconceived idea.</p>
<p><em>Sister Patricia:</em> Is there any verbal communication?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, there are very few words. I may sing one or two songs and for five minutes I may give them some instructions on how to concentrate, how to meditate, how to contemplate. In seven hours, I may speak for fifteen minutes, or not even that. The last time for nineteen minutes I talked; the rest of the time I remained in silence.</p>
<p>Most of the time I will meditate. Sometimes they will just observe me, and sometimes they will dive deep within.</p>
<p><em>Sister Patricia:</em> Are you conscious of how attentive they are?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, because they are inside my heart. When I am in my highest consciousness, if you enter into me at that time, you will be able to feel whether I am able to house all these seekers. As you expand your heart, you welcome the aspiration of humanity. You expand, you become receptive and the rest of the world is inside your heart.</p>
<p><em>Bishop Kennedy:</em> So you will be instructing people in Adelaide by actually meditating?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, by meditating; that is the way. Not by verbal instruction, because then it becomes mental instruction. Each one has his own way of praying and meditating. I try to bring to the fore each seeker's inner consciousness. Then Consciousness itself will tell them how to meditate. I help them find the key to the treasure chest within each one of them.</p>  </div>
