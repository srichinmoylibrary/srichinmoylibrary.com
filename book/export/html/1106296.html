<p>In Paris recently one fellow saw a poster and he came to Haridas’ course. All of a sudden, he told the disciples that he had heard that an Indian living in America had lifted up a very heavy weight. He said, “This is what meditation can do.” He did not know that I was the Indian he had heard about. So the disciples showed him a picture of me lifting weights. This French man knew nothing about meditation, but he was inspired by my weightlifting feats to attend the course.</p>
<p>That means lifting up weights has made me known. Now music has to make me known. Weightlifting is one door, now we have to try another door. Spirituality can be approached through many, many doors.</p>
