    <title>Question: If you are consciously aware that you are actually being tortured by the vital or mind, does that mean you&#039;re still aspiring or does that mean you&#039;ve surrendered?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are attacked. But that doesn’t mean you have surrendered. The fly can come and sit on your head, but you have to remove it. You have to throw it away. As long as you are fighting, it doesn’t mean that you have surrendered. Just because they come again and again and again, it doesn’t mean you have surrendered. Only you have not conquered them altogether.</p>  </div>
