<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> True freedom is not an isolated or independent thing. True freedom is oneness with the Infinite. It cannot operate in isolation, as a separate thing. God is both universal and individual, both unity and multiplicity. Just because we do not feel oneness with others, we do not have true freedom.</p>  </div>
