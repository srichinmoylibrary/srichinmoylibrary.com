  <h1 class="book-heading">68. Purity</h1>
  
 
<p>A purity-heart is never empty.</p>
<p>A purity-heart does not worry. It does not hurry either. A purity-heart devotedly waits, soulfully watches and unmistakably acts.</p>
<p>Conviction's treasure-home: a purity-heart.</p>
<p>A purity-heart houses a very large amount of capacity. Therefore, it surmounts most of the difficulty-barriers in human life.</p>
<p>Purity is the life's achievement. Joy is the heart's commitment.</p>
<p>Purity's absence is the fast beginning of life's real bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Purity most rapidly increases in the seeker's inner obedience-life.</p>
<p>Rich in purity means rich in divinity. Rich in divinity means rich in perfection. Rich in perfection means rich in God-satisfaction.</p>
<p>A pure God-lover carries the crying earth up to Heaven in the morning and brings the smiling Heaven down to earth in the evening.</p>  </div>
