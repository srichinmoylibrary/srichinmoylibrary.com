<p>I am now a poet. My brother Chitta's own inspiration and aspiration have influenced my poetic life right from the beginning. His love for me was unparalleled. How many times he used to massage my feet! Again, he used to say that he had never seen such beautiful eyes as mine. When I was meditating, or studying, or writing poems, he would come and stand in front of me and look into my eyes. I am his youngest brother and his only wish was to look into my eyes. My eyes were beautiful in those days.</p>
<p>This brother of mine had the vision before others. When I was inside my mother, he had the vision that a great spiritual figure of the highest magnitude was coming into our family.</p>  </div>
