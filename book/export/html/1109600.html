<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, no, no. When a realisation comes to us through our inner aspiration, although we may express it verbally, it is not considered philosophy. It is only an expression or revelation of our inner experience. First we become aware that we are the embodiment of peace, light and bliss and all divine qualities. Then we reveal these qualities. It is like a seed which germinates and becomes a plant. Then it becomes a tree. Then it produces flowers and fruits.</p>
<p>In the same way, our inner realisations come slowly, steadily and unerringly from our aspiration or through our aspiration. Then, when we express them, it is not philosophy. We are only trying to offer the reality that we have felt or that we have grown into, not in terms of philosophy, but in terms of a particular language. No philosophy is involved there.</p>  </div>
