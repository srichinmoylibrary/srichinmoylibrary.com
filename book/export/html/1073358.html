<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I shall not attack anyone, but if somebody attacks me, I will try to protect myself. On my own I will not strike anybody, but if somebody wants to strike me, first I will try to avoid that person; but if that is impossible, then I will defend myself. He is doing the wrong thing by striking me. Why should I allow him to throw his ignorance at me by striking me? On the contrary, I will try my utmost to prevent him from increasing his own ignorance. If he wants to strike me, which is wrong, I will try to prevent him from doing this wrong thing. If I allow him to strike me out of my false love, I am only adding to his ignorance.</p>  </div>
