<p>During my thirteen-mile run today, only once did I walk a few metres while drinking water. Otherwise, the rest of the way I ran.</p>
<p>The first two years I ran in the New York City Marathon, I had cramps in spite of my practising. This year, I have not been able to practise. How will I be able to run the marathon?</p>
<p>When you run long distance, as opposed to short distance, you sometimes feel that you won't be able to complete the race. You are afraid that you will get cramps and won't be able to finish the distance.</p>
