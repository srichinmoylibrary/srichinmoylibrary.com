<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God got His first beginning from His Silence. He remained silent and inside His Silence He got a message. When He was in silence, He was One alone. He felt no loneliness as we do when we stay alone. But even when He was alone, He was complete because He Himself was Silence and He Himself was both the Observer and the Enjoyer of that Silence. God started His first beginning with Silence. Then He became many with His Sound-Light. With His Silence-Light He was one. With His Sound-Light He became many.</p>  </div>
