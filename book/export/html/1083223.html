<p>O medical science, O Homeopathy, O life-serving science, O life-saving science, I do not know you. But I do know well my most esteemed Homeopath friend, Bhumanandaji. His eagerness to serve God in mankind through you, Homeopathy, has always been a source of divine inspiration to me. Since your fond son, Bhumananda, is really good and kind to mankind, you must be most kind and most fulfilling. So, in you I see Reality's Smile and Divinity's Pride.</p>  </div>
