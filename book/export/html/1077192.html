<h2>O Human Rights</h2>


<p>O Human Rights Divine!<br /> In harmony-world you shine.<br /> You are the Voice of Light<br /> and blue Perfection-Height.<br /> Yours is the supreme role<br /> to change the cosmos-dole.<br /> You are the only strength<br /> of Heaven’s Vision-length.<br /> Division-bondage-doom<br /> no more —<br /> All oneness-bloom.</p>
<p><em> — Sri Chinmoy</em></p>

<p>Equality is of paramount importance. No equality, no peace of mind. No individual should become a victim to racial bias. There is no black or white. One soul, one goal, one Divinity and one Immortality shall always reign supreme over humanity’s devoted mind and surrendered heart. Einstein’s life knew it. Einstein’s heart felt it. Einstein’s soul was more than eager to share this sublime truth with humanity</p>
<p>In championing the cause of black people in America, Einstein was brave in action as well as in speech. Here the scientist became a fully devoted and dedicated God-server in man and man-lover in God. <em>“I believe that whoever tries to think things through honestly will soon recognise how unworthy and even fatal is the traditional bias against Negroes.... What can the man of good will do to combat this deeply rooted prejudice? He must have the courage to set an example by words and deeds, and must watch lest his children become influenced by racial bias.”</em></p>
<p>By serving humanity, one fulfils one’s true destiny. But he who expects a result from his actions is a veritable beggar. His is the heart that is wanting in magnanimity. His is the heart that is wanting in oneness with the Infinite. To quote Einstein: <em>“Why should one man receive a greater ‘reward’ for his work than another? And is it not a man’s duty to serve his fellow man without thinking in terms of reward?”</em></p>
<p>Science is indeed a great instrument, but if humanity or human realities are not given first and foremost importance, then no scientific data can ever elevate or illumine the earth-consciousness. Man’s fate man alone must change. Man’s face man alone must transform. There is no other way. Then, once it is done, man can invoke science to add more significance and more fruitfulness to humanity. Said Einstein, <em>“Of course, science is suffering from the terrible effects of the war, but it is humanity that should be given first consideration.”</em></p>  </div>
