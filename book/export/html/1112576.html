<p>A husband and wife were eating dinner one night when the wife said to the husband, "For the past few months, I have been seeing a few unusual things in you. What is the matter?"</p>
<p>The husband said, "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>The wife said, "You are becoming mean in every way. Any time I ask you for a favour, you won't do it. But there once was a time when you used to please me in every way. What have I done to you?</p>
<p>The husband said, "Be specific. What do you mean?"</p>
<p>The wife explained, "I mean you are not pleasing me."</p>
<p>"I am not pleasing you? But I try my best to please you," the husband said.</p>
<p>The wife said, "No, you don't try to please me anymore. When we first got married, you used to think of me more and give me more. If we had anything to share, always you used to give me the larger share."</p>
<p>The husband said, "Be specific. What do you mean?"</p>
<p>The wife continued, "I am talking about when you eat. When we were first married, whenever I made a delicious cake and asked you to cut it, you used to take the smaller piece and give me the bigger piece. When I used to ask you to cut the meat, you used to take the smaller piece. Now you are taking the bigger piece and giving me the smaller one. In those days you would not have done that."</p>
<p>The husband said, "In those days you didn't know how to cook at all. Your food was terrible. That is why I used to take the smaller piece. Now everything you make is most delicious. That is why I take the larger portion and give you the smaller one."</p>  </div>
