 <p>
RRGB 1-18. On 17 August 1991, as part of the activities marking his 60th birthday, Sri Chinmoy answered questions on spirituality that were asked by some of his students from the Soviet Union who were visiting New York. They joined over a thousand other students from around the world, who also had the opportunity to hear Sri Chinmoy answers to these thoughtful and soulful questions -- in a session which lasted exactly 60 minutes.</p>
<h2>Question: Does everyone have a special mission on earth?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em>: Yes, each individual has a special mission on earth. What that mission is depends on the development of the soul. If the soul is extremely developed, then the mission of that particular person will be very, very great.</p>  </div>
