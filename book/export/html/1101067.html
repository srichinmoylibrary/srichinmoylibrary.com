<p>My Lord Supreme, my Beloved Supreme, You wanted to awaken my sleeping heart with Your Satisfaction-Heart. But alas, I did not allow You to succeed. Therefore, You badly failed.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, my Beloved Supreme, You wanted to awaken my sleeping heart with Your Compassion-Eye. But alas, I did not allow You to succeed. Therefore, You badly failed.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, my Beloved Supreme, You even wanted to awaken my sleeping heart with Your Justice-Light. But alas, I did not allow You to succeed. Therefore, You badly failed.</p>
<p>Finally, my Lord Supreme, You awakened me with Your utter frustration, utter exasperation and utter disgust, plus Your Thunder-Blows and Thunder-Kicks. Now I am awakened, fully awakened. But alas, why did I prevent You from awakening me in Your own Way according to Your choice Vision?</p>
<p>My child, you and I do not belong to the past. We do not even belong to the future. We only belong to the Eternal Now."</p>
