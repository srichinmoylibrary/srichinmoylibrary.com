<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To some extent it is predetermined. Again we have God's Compassion, God's Love, to change our fate. As you sow, so you reap: this is one theory. Two young boys are playing. One has struck the other, so naturally he will be beaten by the one he has hurt. But if the first boy goes running to his father for protection, then the fellow he has hurt cannot strike him back. He is under the protection of somebody who has much more strength than the ordinary retributive justice. If you have made some mistake or done something wrong in your previous incarnation, the time will come for you to receive punishment. But before that, if you consciously feel that you have done something wrong, you can invoke the protection of the Supreme, the Almighty Father.</p>  </div>
