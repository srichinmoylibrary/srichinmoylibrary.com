<p>Transformation we need in three areas: transformation of the mind, transformation of nature, transformation of life. Let us start with the mind. There are many subjects that are difficult, but transformation of the mind is the most difficult subject.</p>
<p>In order to transform the mind, we have to bring light into the mind from the heart. We have to take the mind as a jungle, nothing else. We have to clear the mind, and to clear the mind we need light from the heart. Mind-transformation can never become a reality unless we bring light into the mind.</p>
<p>Then comes transformation of our nature. Nature does not mean trees and other living things; it means the way we formulate thoughts and ideas, the way we look at anything that is coming into our view. Every time we take one step, a wrong thought may come to the fore, a wrong feeling may come to the fore. Thinking, feeling, becoming: this is our nature. In our thinking, feeling and becoming, we have to establish purity. While any thought is coming to our mind, let us repeat the word ‘purity’. While any feeling is coming to our heart, let us repeat ‘purity’. While any incident is taking place in our life, if we repeat, “Purity, purity, purity,” the our nature will be transformed.</p>
<p>Then comes transformation of life. Life-transformation comes only from identification, from the feeling of oneness. Human life can never be transformed unless we can feel that the One has become many; and again, inside the many we have to feel the One.</p>
<p>Life-transformation is not like the transformation of the body. Today I may be physically strong, vitally strong or mentally strong, and tomorrow I may become stronger, but that is not transformation. Transformation means expansion, universal expansion. For the transformation of nature, purity is needed. But for the transformation of life, the individual life has to become not only collective, but universal.</p>
<p>Again, we have to feel both dependence and interdependence. When we are concentrating on God, we have to think that we are entirely depending on God. Then our transformation will come about. But when we are dealing with human beings, or with earth itself, then we have to think of interdependence: I depend on you, you depend on me. Again, God is so kind that He says He depends on us, which we cannot believe. Although God created me, God does not have to depend on me. He can kick me out at His sweet Will. But He gives me importance. He tells me, “You are indispensable, you are great,” and so on — only to give me joy. God Himself is always independent; He has the last word. But He gets joy by saying, “O My child, you are also great, equally great!”</p>
<p>If we have the humble feeling of dependence on God, if we can sincerely say, “I depend on God for everything — for my inner life and outer life,” then we get joy. But when we deal with other human beings, we need the feeling of interdependence. This is the way life’s transformation can take place. I depend on your good qualities, and you depend on my good qualities. While depending on others’ good qualities, I as an individual am becoming many. So, transformation of life is expansion of one’s heart and of one’s life-breath.</p>  </div>
