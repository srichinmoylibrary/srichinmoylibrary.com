<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now, I would like to be of dedicated service to you, my mothers. I have offered my dedicated service many times at public meetings by answering questions. Now, I wish to share my experiences with you. If you have any specific questions with regard to what we do, I will be extremely grateful for the opportunity to answer them.</p>  </div>
