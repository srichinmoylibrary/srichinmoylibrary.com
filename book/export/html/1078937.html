<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The sadness that you are feeling is quite natural, because you were in a higher world and then you had to come down to this practical world, to the earthly level. At that time, worries and problems of the world entered into you. But if you meditate for a few years, these worries will not stand in your way, because by that time they will be overcome. Then, when you come down from your meditation, you will have tremendous peace, poise, joy and love for humanity. When you have tremendous love for humanity, at that time you will not feel exhausted. Right now you have boundless love for your child. But there is no end to our love. After you have meditated for a few years, you will have much more love for your child because you will feel the presence of God inside him. Right now you do not feel the presence of God inside your child all the time. If he is naughty or if he breaks something, then you don’t think that the God inside him is operating. At that time you are exasperated. You simply say, “No, no, this is not God; this is the devil incarnate.” But there will come a time when you will see God inside your son all the time, no matter what he does or what he says. That will be your own progress. It is only a matter of time. Then, when you come down from your meditation, you will not feel drained. On the contrary, if you meditate well, there will be no pulling and no pushing. Right after your meditation, when you enter into the ordinary life, you will be able to maintain the same joy, delight, peace and poise.</p>  </div>
