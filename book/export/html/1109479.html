<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet."</p>
<p>â€” Kipling</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This famous statement was proved false when Vivekananda, with the flood of Sri Ramakrishna's inspiration, gloriously united the East and the West with his unique message on religion.</p>
<p>Tagore, too, utterly denied this statement. His fruitful life was a mission of interpreting the East to the West; he wanted nothing more, nothing less than a flood of peace between the two hemispheres.</p>  </div>
