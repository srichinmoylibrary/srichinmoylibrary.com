<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is a very good question. I speak to God not only in English and Bengali but in many languages. Our discussion can be in Bengali, in English, in any language, There are many languages I do not know at all, which my physical mind is not aware of. But it has happened that I have talked to God in those languages as well. To tell you the truth, God and I quite often speak without using earthly languages. Instead, we use Light, which is our divine medium to converse with each other.</p>  </div>
