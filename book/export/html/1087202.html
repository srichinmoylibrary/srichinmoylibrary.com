<p>Two days ago X and I went shopping. At one spot, they were unloading things from a truck, and there was a rail blocking the sidewalk. I was about to go out into the street to walk around the rail.</p>
<p>X was smiling at me. Then he just walked right under the rail.</p>
<p>I said, "See, there is an advantage to being short!"</p>
