<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can bring the confidence of the heart into the mind very swiftly, effectively and fruitfully only when we feel that the heart is the mother-the mother of love, affection, light, patience and forgiveness. Once we truly feel that the heart embodies all these divine qualities, if we can also think of the heart as a member of our being, then we will be able to bring the confidence of the heart into the mind. We must feel that the mind is a restless child, without wisdom and maturity, and that the heart is the mother who embodies all divine qualities. Naturally, whatever the mother has, the child can claim because the mother is ready to give whatever she has to the child. So when we think of the heart, we have to think of the Divine Mother, whose boundless qualities enter into the child while she instructs him. Then, automatically, like the flowing of a river, the heart's qualities will enter the mind.</p>  </div>
