<p>One day a young boy went swimming in a river and there he was caught by a crocodile. He started screaming and his mother came running. The crocodile said, "If you want to remain in ignorance, then I will eat you up, but if you do not want to remain in ignorance, then I will let you go."</p>
<p>Then the son said, "Mother, this is the time to grant me my boon. I want to accept sannyas, renunciation. If you do not allow me my wish, then the crocodile will kill me."</p>
<p>"I will give you my permission to accept <em>sannyas</em> if you feel that the crocodile will free you," the mother said.</p>
<p>Immediately the crocodile let him go. The boy fell at his mother's feet for the last time and took her blessings. Then he left home.</p>
<p>This boy was none other than India's Shankaracharya, the peerless philosopher who introduced our <em>Advaita</em> philosophy, "One without a second."</p>  </div>
