<p>Chitta Ranjan Das died in Darjeeling. When his body was brought by train to Calcutta, his admirers begged and begged Tagore to say something. Tagore wrote two most significant lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enechhile sathe kare mrittyuhin pran</em> <em>Marane tahare tumi kare gele dan</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you came into the world you brought with you an immortal life, and you left it here on your way back.</p>
<p>I have set Tagore’s sublime message to music.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
