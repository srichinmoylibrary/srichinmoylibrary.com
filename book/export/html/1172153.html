<p>At the nursing home, I went to visit a lady who is our family friend. It was at her place that I met our great Ashram sage, Anirvan, when I was very young. She is twenty years older than I am. Her younger son is extremely close to me.</p>
<p>As soon as I went there, she said, "Chinmoy, Chinmoy, Chinmoy, come and bless me. I need your blessingful presence."</p>
<p>I said, "Oh no, I cannot bless you. I am praying to the Mother and Sri Aurobindo to bless you."</p>
<p>Then she said, "Let me see how soft your hand is."</p>
<p>I knew she was playing a trick on me. Her son was there in the room, and he said, "You should allow my mother to touch your hand."</p>
<p>So I gave her my hand. She immediately grabbed it and put it on her head.</p>  </div>
