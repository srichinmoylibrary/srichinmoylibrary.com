<p><em>(Franklin D. Roosevelt is sitting at his desk.)</em></p>
<p><em>Franklin D. Roosevelt:</em> Lord, I am grateful to You for granting me the capacity to serve my country as its President. True, I am paralysed by polio, but You have blessed me with ceaseless activity. You have spoken through me these celestial words: "This great nation will revive... The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." And the most important of all the blessings that You have showered upon me is my dear wife, Eleanor. Without her I could have done nothing. Without her I could have become nothing. <em>(Eleanor Roosevelt enters.)</em></p>
<p><em>Eleanor Roosevelt:</em> Franklin, I overheard you. Now it is my turn to speak. Because of you, I am the wife of our President. Because of you, I am the First Lady of the country.</p>
<p><em>Franklin D. Roosevelt:</em> And because of you, one day when I am physically gone, I will be known as the husband of the First Lady of the world.</p>
<p><em>Eleanor Roosevelt:</em> Why? Why such extravagant absurdities?</p>
<p><em>Franklin D. Roosevelt:</em> No extravagant absurdities. Because of your devoted, selfless service to the nation and the world community, you deserve that greatest honour. I clearly see it. When the world claims you as its First Lady, an unprecedented honour, I shall swim in the sea of light and delight in Heaven.</p>
<p><em>Eleanor Roosevelt:</em> You have always been a great patriot. Now you are a matchless President. But since when have you become a prophet?</p>
<p><em>Franklin D. Roosevelt:</em> Right from today. My vision can never fail.</p>
<p><em>Eleanor Roosevelt:</em> I also have a vision. Your dream of the United Nations will, without fail, blossom. Wilson's dream-the League of Nations-will be blossoming powerfully and significantly with a wider, brighter and more fulfilling capacity in your dream of the United Nations. Wilson entered into a war to end war. You, too, did the same after America was attacked. Both you and Wilson are God's sons of all-loving and all-fulfilling peace. Your dream will one day be fulfilled, I assure you.</p>
<p><em>Franklin D. Roosevelt:</em> Let us thank God that He has blessed both of us with prophetic vision.</p>
<p><em>Eleanor Roosevelt:</em> Indeed, you are a great prophet, Franklin.</p>
<p><em>Frank</em>in D. Roosevelt:/ And you are a prophetess, Eleanor.</p>  </div>
