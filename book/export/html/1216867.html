<p>At the Delhi airport when I was returning to Japan, the man behind the counter told me, "Unfortunately, your luggage is sixteen pounds overweight," and he gave me a very amused smile.</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, you are smiling and I am crying."</p>
<p>Then he checked in my luggage and said, "You don't have to pay extra. I don't want you to cry."</p>
