<p>The Mayor and the Commissioner of the Park were at the opening ceremony of the London Peace Mile. There were also a Nobel laureate and a Minister on the stage. For the opening they asked me to release peace doves. I said that I would like the Mayor to release them.</p>
<p>The Mayor said he would do so only on one condition: I had to be on the stage beside him. So we stood together, and he released the doves.</p>
