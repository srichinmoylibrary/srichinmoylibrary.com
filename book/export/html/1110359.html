<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the heart and the vital. Sometimes the lower vital movements come forward and enter into the heart. Sometimes the heart's sweetest joy and light enter into the vital in order to transform it. Before it is transformed, the vital is all impurity. But once abundant purity enters into it, it is all divinely dynamic energy.</p>  </div>
