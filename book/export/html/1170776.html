<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Try to visualise a beautiful garden inside your heart. If you see a beautiful garden, then soulfulness automatically will come. Or feel that you are seated alone at the foot of a tree, facing a river. That also will help you. But the other way is better; it will bring forward soulfulness very quickly.</p>  </div>
