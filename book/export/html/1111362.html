<p>At one point during the Long Island Marathon, I was walking towards the runners for about half a mile. They were yelling, "Hey, Sri Chinmoy!" and "Sri" and "Master." It went on like this and didn't stop for the entire half a mile.</p>
<p>Then, three strong black men stopped running and captured me. One put his arm around my head. He was perspiring like anything. The other said, "How are you doing, Sri Chinmoy?" They said that they never saw me, so now they were getting a chance to see me.</p>
