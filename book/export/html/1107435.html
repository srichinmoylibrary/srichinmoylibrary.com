<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Nothing happened to you because outwardly you did not curse him. Because your own power is quite strong, your vital was able to assimilate the power that he used. He cursed you, but you did not reciprocate, even though you did have the kind of power needed to fight back. But since you didn't reciprocate, the power that you have was there to receive his power without being disturbed or devoured. On the vital plane, if someone who is attacked does not fight back, that does not mean the victim will be totally destroyed. No, he can absorb the power that has attacked him.</p>  </div>
