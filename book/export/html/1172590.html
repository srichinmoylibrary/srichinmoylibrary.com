<p><em>(Three minor gods in Heaven.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST GOD: That King Shibi, on earth, is disturbing my inner poise.</p>
<p>SECOND GOD: Mine too.</p>
<p>THIRD GOD: Dear friends, what is wrong with Shibi? What is wrong with you two?</p>
<p>FIRST GOD: That Shibi has become a very great aspirant. Soon he will become a most advanced soul.</p>
<p>SECOND GOD: Shibi’s heart is as vast as the ocean of love and compassion. His soul is illumination itself.</p>
<p>THIRD GOD: So what? If Shibi really becomes great or is already great, then we should be proud of him instead of jealous. He is, after all, God’s most devoted son.</p>
<p>FIRST GOD: Today Shibi is great. Tomorrow he will be greater. The day after tomorrow he will be the greatest. And then he will outshine us all.</p>
<p>SECOND GOD <em>(looking at the third god)</em>: When the matchless glory of his life badly eclipses your inner sun, perhaps you will know what a stupid god you are. Don’t be philosophical, for God’s sake. Be practical.</p>
<p>THIRD GOD: It is a real shame that even the gods are jealous of a human being. <em>(Looking up.)</em> O God, You are truly kind to me. You have made me a perfect stranger to jealousy. Whosoever is great, whosoever possesses God’s Divine Greatness, will be admired and adored by me, be he a human being or even an animal.</p>
<p>FIRST GOD: Since you have come to that kind of realisation, to me you are worse than an animal.</p>
<p>SECOND GOD: You are absolutely right, my good friend. He is undoubtedly inferior even to an animal. <em>(Looking at the third god.)</em> Go back to your most undeveloped stone life, to the mineral kingdom, for that is where you belong.</p>
<p>THIRD GOD: You two are corrupting the purity and beauty of Heaven with your impure and wild jealousy. I pronounce my most powerful curse on you. Heaven will soon get rid of you two. You two have cast a slur on Heaven. Poor Heaven, my Heaven, Indra’s Heaven, Brahma’s Heaven!</p>
<p>FIRST AND SECOND GODS: One more word and you will be found in the stone life. We shall extinguish your life in Heaven!</p>
<p><em>(Enter Brahma and Indra.)</em></p>
<p><em>(The three gods, as if nothing has happened, show their utmost reverence to Brahma and Indra.)</em></p>
<p>BRAHMA: Occultly we have observed your most deplorable dispute. Even Indra and I are not sure if Shibi is that great.</p>
<p>INDRA: So we have decided to go to Shibi’s palace on earth to test him.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: If he is really that great, then we should and we must admire him — his love, his concern, his compassion and his sacrifice.</p>
<p>INDRA: And if he is not all that we hear about him, then the jealous gods can be happy.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Hard is it to conquer jealousy.</p>
<p>INDRA: Alas, I suffered from that disease for a long time, but now jealousy and I do not live together. We live separately, we think separately and we fulfil our ideals separately. Now I am ready to touch the feet of anybody who is superior to me in spirituality.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Indra, I admire your sincerity. I adore your humility,</p>
<p>INDRA <em>(to the minor gods, smiling)</em>: You three wait here and see. We two are entering into the world. Brahma will assume the form of a huge hawk and I shall assume the form of a tiny dove.</p>  </div>
