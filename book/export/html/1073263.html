<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you can’t fall asleep and undivine thoughts are not bothering you, it means God has given you an opportunity to meditate more. And if you can’t meditate, then read some spiritual books. But don’t torture yourself; if sleep knocks at your door, allow it to come. Again, if sleep is not torturing you, then you should feel fortunate that you can use these hours for your own purpose.</p>  </div>
