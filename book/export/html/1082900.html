<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is neither economical nor extravagant. He is what His Compassion-Light or Wisdom-Light wants Him to be. He uses His Compassion-Light for those who are still sleeping spiritually and He uses His Wisdom-Light for those who are fully or partially awakened. But God's Compassion is not extravagant and His Wisdom is not economical. These are just two mighty weapons that He uses. By using these two formidable weapons, God inspires and energises both the non-seeker and the seeker to do the right thing. The non-seeker He inspires to come out of sleep, and once the person is awakened and has become a seeker, He inspires him to run the fastest toward his Goal.</p>  </div>
