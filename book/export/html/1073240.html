    <title>Question: Would you say that the &lt;em&gt;asanas&lt;/em&gt; are needed more in the West to help people relax, because people from India and the Orient already have more peace of mind than we do?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To some extent it is true that in the West there is great tension, and that Westerners need peace of mind. But in the East, especially in India, there is tremendous poverty, and this poverty also creates anxiety, worries, tension and turmoil.</p>
<p><em>Asanas</em> do help the body to relax. They are a very good way to keep the body limber and in good condition. But if you expect to get peace of mind by relaxing the body, you will be disappointed. The relaxation that you get from <em>asanas</em> is not real peace. If you want to get infinite Peace, eternal Peace, or a change in your inner consciousness, <em>asanas</em> cannot help you significantly.</p>  </div>
