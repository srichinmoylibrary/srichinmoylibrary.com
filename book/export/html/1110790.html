<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We know that it is really difficult for us to make a little progress by ourselves in the spiritual life, in our inner life and in our outer life. So we have to have infinite patience in order to see a little transformation in human nature, that is to say in mankind as a whole. We must not lose patience. Just because our neighbours and friends are not following the spiritual life, it does not mean that we should give up. We have to know that there was a time, either in this incarnation or in past incarnations, when we were also perhaps of their type and perhaps worse. We have to try to help people with the idea that once upon a time we were also unaspiring, unspiritual, but then by somebody's Grace or with the help of some people on earth, we became spiritual. Now perhaps we are not conscious of who actually helped us. But there was someone who helped us in our spiritual journey, in our inner awakening. So we shall also try to inspire people. If one person gets inspiration from us, that is enough.</p>
<p>Gradually, gradually, the number of seekers will increase. Now night is ruling the world. But a day will come when Light will rule the world, because it is from Light that the world came into existence. Some people are conscious of the fact that Light exists, while others are not. Those who are unconscious will naturally take a long time to reach the Goal. Those who believe in Light will advance much faster toward the Goal.</p>
<p>After one has practised spiritual disciplines for twenty years or perhaps even several incarnations, he realises God. Spiritual achievement is sacrificed after one realises God. A God-realised soul sacrifices his achievement by coming down into the world of suffering in a human body to work for mankind. This very act of coming down into the world is a tremendous sacrifice if one looks at it from a human point of view. But from the spiritual point of view there is no sacrifice. Who is sacrificing for whom? God is constantly sacrificing Himself for us, in us and through us.</p>  </div>
