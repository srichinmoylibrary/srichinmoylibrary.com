<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one Truth. In Sanskrit there is a saying that Truth is only one but it is expressed in various ways. I own a truth, you have a truth, another one has still another truth. In the field of expression, Truth expresses itself in different ways. But truth is only one and my truth can never be different from your truth nor can your truth be different from mine.</p>  </div>
