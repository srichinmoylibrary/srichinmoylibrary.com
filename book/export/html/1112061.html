  <h1 class="book-heading">An unfair race</h1>
  
 
<p>In one race I saw a 92-year-old man running; he came in third. Quite good! But he came to me after the race and said, "Is it fair? I have to run with 85-year-olds!" Poor man. How could they have another category for runners over 90? So he was only third. He was a nice man. He had been a revolutionary in his youth, and had been in jail for 16 years. They wrote a nice article about him in the San Juan paper.</p>
