<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Angels do sing, but they are more oriented towards instrumental performance. They like music more than words and melodies. On the one hand, angels are all majesty. On the other hand, they are so sweet and beautiful. Sometimes sweetness and power do not go together, but in the case of angels, they have both sweetness and power. Their power is not like atomic power. Their power is more like flute-power, while the fairies' power is more like drum-power. The angels' flute-power is subtle and delicate and, at the same time, it is all brightness.</p>  </div>
