<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can be divinely practical in our day to-day activities, not cleverly practical in a human way by deceiving others. In divine practicality you share your inner wealth. You feel the divine motivation behind each action and you share the result with others.</p>
<p>Divine practicality means that before an action starts you feel that this action does not belong to you. Then, while acting, you feel that you are not the doer; it is someone else who is acting in and through you. When the result comes, you share it with others. You feel that it is not you who has accomplished something: it is the Person who has inspired you, who was acting in and through you. Then you can have divine practicality in your life at every moment.</p>  </div>
