<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As a seeker, the supreme art of life is to realise the highest absolute Truth. As a realised soul, who is an eternal seeker, the supreme art of one’s aspiring life is to become part and parcel of the universal Consciousness and make it available to all those who need it.</p>  </div>
