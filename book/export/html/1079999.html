<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can be most receptive on the strength of your own simplicity, sincerity, purity and humility. When you bring to the fore your own divine qualities — simplicity, sincerity, purity and humility — then you can receive the utmost. And inside simplicity, inside sincerity, inside purity, inside humility, please try to feel a sense of gratitude to the Inner Pilot, to your own Inner Pilot. Your gratitude-heart will be able to receive the utmost; it will bring down from above peace, light and bliss in boundless measure. It is a gratitude-heart that receives these divine qualities and also manifests them here on earth.</p>  </div>
