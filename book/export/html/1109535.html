<blockquote>
<p>"Behold! I do not give lectures or a little charity, When I give I give myself."</p>
<p>â€” Walt Whitman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My heart of dedication echoes and re-echoes with Whitman's throbbing utterance. At the same time, I wish to add something more. I give lectures. I give lectures not because I have something special to offer to humanity, but because I wish to expand my mind's horizon, my heart's love and my body's service so that I can totally become one with God's Divinity in humanity. Once I have done it, once I have become one with God's Divinity in humanity, I shall have to make no effort to offer myself to God's children, for I become consciously one with them. We then sing the song of God's unity in His multiplicity.</p>  </div>
