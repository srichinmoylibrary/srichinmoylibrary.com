<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the Master meditates, there may be twenty seekers that are restless, but the Master is not affected. He maintains his inner peace and he offers his peace to those meditating with him. Then when you go home, you also will feel peaceful. The strength of my peace enters into those seekers who are sincere. Even now as I am talking, peace, light and bliss are emanating from me.</p>
<p>You people represent the world. The world is something very huge, but you create the world and I create the world. Let us say that this little room is a miniature world. From here you will get something from me, and then you will offer it to somebody else. So you see how peace can spread from one person to two persons and so on.</p>  </div>
