<p>Prayer and meditation must go together. When we pray we ask God to be responsible for us, and when we meditate we consciously accept responsibility for God. When we pray, we offer God our responsibilities; we give our helpless, hopeless, useless existence to God. When we meditate, we become like lions: we become divine, devoted instruments of God. At that time we take upon ourselves God's responsibilities. One moment we give our existence to God because we are helpless; the next moment we ask God if we can do something for Him. Prayer takes us up to God and God fulfils us. Meditation brings God down to us and then we fulfil God. The two should go together.</p>  </div>
