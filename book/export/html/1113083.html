<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The world to some extent is progressing spiritually; but at the same time, the world is still full of ignorance. I cannot categorically say that right now ninety percent are meditating and ten percent only are not meditating or nor spiritual. Only I can say that spirituality, as such, has awakened mankind to a greater extent than it had done, say, fifteen or twenty or forty years ago-especially in the West. People are meditating now in the West. Real spirituality has come.</p>  </div>
