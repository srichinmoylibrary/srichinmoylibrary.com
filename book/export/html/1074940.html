<p>The body is guilty<br />   For the things it has delayed,<br />   For the things it has forgotten.</p>
<p>The vital is guilty<br />   For the things it has accepted,<br />   For the things it has rejected.</p>
<p>The mind is guilty<br />   For the things it has suspected,<br />   For the things it has believed.</p>
<p>The heart is guilty<br />   For the things it has discovered,<br />   For the things it has avoided.</p>
<p>The soul is guilty<br />   For the things it has promised,<br />   For the things it has omitted.</p>
