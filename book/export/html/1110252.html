<p><em>Question:</em> What can we expect from the spiritual life?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Whenever we do something, we expect. But when we accept the spiritual life there should be very little expectation. The One that we are entrusting ourselves to, the Supreme, is infinitely kind, affectionate and compassionate. Naturally, He will give us whatever we need. We don't have to cry for appreciation or affection from Him. In the outer world if we give one dollar, we get the equivalent of that one dollar in return. But in the spiritual life we are all clever people. God is the only fool. He gives us infinitely more than we give Him.</p>  </div>
