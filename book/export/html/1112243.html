<p>I do not have speed, I do not have stamina, I do not have the determination to run, but I do have the eagerness to watch the marathon. I like it so much. Everybody is like a beautiful flower. While they are crying, we smile. While they are smiling, we cry. If somebody is crying, in order to cheer the person, we smile. If they are smiling, we say, “We know that you are crying inside.” We identify with their smiles and with their tears.</p>
