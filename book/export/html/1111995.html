  <h1 class="book-heading">Harassment</h1>
  
 
<p>This morning I went out to walk fast. First I saw Nilima, then I saw Bhikshuni and then I saw Agamani — three!</p>
<p>After four and a half miles, three other girls — not disciples — were a little ahead of me on the sidewalk and would not allow me to cross the street. With greatest difficulty I crossed. Then I thanked them.</p>
<p>They started running behind me, saying things which I couldn't understand. For 100 or 150 metres they were harassing me. I turned around and looked at them, and then they all turned around and started running away. Then I went ahead.</p>
<p>In spite of seeing the boys following me in the car, they were harassing me.</p>
