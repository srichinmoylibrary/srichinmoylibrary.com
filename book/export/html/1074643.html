<p>Sloth and vagary<br /> Found no place in him.<br /> Fear and doubt<br /> Found no place in him.<br /> Worry and despair<br /> Found no place in him.<br /> God's Love and Pride<br /> Found place in him.<br /> He found his place,<br /> His Eternal Place<br /> On the Lap of Singing God,<br /> In the Heart of Dancing God.</p>
