<p>"My Lord, may I cut a silly joke with You?"</p>
<p>"By all means, My child."</p>
<p>"My Lord, I have now consciously become one with You. You and I are inseparably and eternally one. Suppose today I leave You and tomorrow I surpass and go beyond You. What will happen?"</p>
<p>"O silliest child of My entire creation, you know that we two are inseparable. You can't leave without carrying Me. How can you surpass and go beyond Me alone, without Me, when we are eternally inseparable? My sweetest silly child, something more. I tell you, today if you leave Me, tomorrow if you surpass and go beyond Me, the day after tomorrow you will cry for your new Goal. To your utter surprise, you will see that that Goal, too, is I, your Beloved, your eternal Father and Friend. My child, I am the ever-transcending Beyond."</p>
<p>"My Lord, You are also something else. You are my ever-forgiving Father."</p>
