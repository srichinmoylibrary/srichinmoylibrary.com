<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know that this physical energy has a source. It has only one source, and that source is the spiritual energy. As long as we remain in the body-consciousness, we are not aware of this, but when we go deep within, we see that spiritual energy is the source of the physical, vital and mental energy. When the spiritual energy left its Source and entered into the physical, it was somewhat polluted. It was unable to maintain its pristine purity. What we need is purity on the inner plane and dedication on the outer plane. If we aspire, we will be able to purify the physical energy. Outer dedication comes through gradual inner purification and inner awareness. When we have both inner purity and outer dedication, then the spiritual energy enters into the physical energy, and the physical energy at that time becomes an added strength to the spiritual energy.</p>  </div>
