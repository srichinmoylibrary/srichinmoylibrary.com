<p>God's Heart means God's Love. God's Love means God's Oneness. God's Oneness means God's Delight. God's Delight means God's Perfection. And God's Perfection means our unconditional acceptance of God's Will and God's unconditional acceptance of our ignorance.</p>
<p>God's Heart is empty. When God's Heart is filled with man's gratitude, then God will be fulfilled both here on earth and there in Heaven. When we fill God's Heart with our constant gratitude, then God will play His role by manifesting Himself in and through us.</p>  </div>
