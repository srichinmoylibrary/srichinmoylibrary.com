<p>In my life of surrender,<br /> Each step of my inner running<br /> And each step of my outer running<br /> I am offering, offering, offering<br /> To my Lord Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191294" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5602</h1>
  
 

<p>When the physical consciousness<br /> Is radiating the soul's light,<br /> The vital and mind may become jealous.<br /> But ultimately they will surrender,<br /> And also turn to the soul.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191295" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5603</h1>
  
 

<p>Seeing the heart<br /> Flooded with the soul's light,<br /> The mind cursed itself:<br /> "Oh, why am I so stupid!<br /> Why do I not visit my soul<br /> Every day?"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191296" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5604</h1>
  
 

<p>In this world we kill ourselves<br /> All for outer success.<br /> But there is another world<br /> Where our happiness<br /> Does not depend on outer results.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191297" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5605</h1>
  
 

<p>Impossibility is a mere word.<br /> Such being the case,<br /> Impossibility must surrender,<br /> And it does surrender,<br /> To the seeker's completely devoted oneness<br /> With the Will of his Beloved Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191298" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5606</h1>
  
 

<p>Is your heart crying<br /> To inspire others?<br /> Then immediately start<br /> Making tremendous progress<br /> And creating stupendous improvement<br /> In your own life.<br /> Others are bound to see<br /> A new radiance on your face<br /> And obey you unconditionally.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191299" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5607</h1>
  
 

<p>The heart's intensity<br /> Immediately becomes one<br /> With God's Music.<br /> But the dictator-mind<br /> Wants to show off and prove<br /> That it can have the same intensity<br /> In a negative way<br /> By destroying the heart's<br /> Inner peace and delight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191300" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5608</h1>
  
 

<p>O seeker,<br /> How can you even think of leaving<br /> The Supreme's Golden Boat<br /> After staying so long<br /> In your heart's only home?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191301" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5609</h1>
  
 

<p>To be a God-dreamer<br /> What you need<br /> Is a God-lover's heart<br /> And a man-server's life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191302" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5610</h1>
  
 

<p>Take a close look at yourself.<br /> Your heart has travelled<br /> Miles and miles<br /> For a blessingful Smile from God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191303" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5611</h1>
  
 

<p>Before God grants you<br /> Your liberation,<br /> You will have to pass<br /> His purity-inspection.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191304" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5612</h1>
  
 

<p>God does not care for<br /> Your millions of thoughts<br /> And your millionaire-mind.<br /> He cares only for<br /> Your beauty's life<br /> And your purity-heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191305" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5613</h1>
  
 

<p>Where are the world's peace-leaders?<br /> They are all inside your hearts.<br /> They are begging your minds<br /> To open their doors<br /> And keep them wide open<br /> For God the man and man the God<br /> To sport together.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191306" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5614</h1>
  
 

<p>What can God's Compassion do?<br /> It can easily end<br /> Your doubt-decade<br /> And help you begin<br /> Your aspiration-era.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191307" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5615</h1>
  
 

<p>God's omniscient Eye<br /> Will guide you<br /> Provided your aspiration-heart<br /> Is not afraid<br /> Of His omnipotent Hand.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191308" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5616</h1>
  
 

<p>It is always<br /> Inside your ancient heart<br /> That you can have<br /> An ever-new harvest.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191309" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5617</h1>
  
 

<p>The outer day<br /> Belongs to his devotion.<br /> Therefore<br /> He is divinely good.</p>
<p>The inner day<br /> Belongs to his surrender.<br /> Therefore<br /> He is supremely perfect.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191310" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5618</h1>
  
 

<p>To aspire<br /> For God's infinite Compassion-Light<br /> Is to learn<br /> The practicality-lesson<br /> In God's inner School.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191311" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5619</h1>
  
 

<p>How can you ask God<br /> To measure His Height<br /> With an earthly measuring tape?<br /> How can you?<br /> And why should you?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191312" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5620</h1>
  
 

<p>God does not want to know<br /> His own Height.<br /> He just sings the Song<br /> Of Self-Transcendence.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191313" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5621</h1>
  
 

<p>Now that you are<br /> Spiritually awake,<br /> You, and nobody else,<br /> Will carry the Banner<br /> Of the Lord Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191314" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5622</h1>
  
 

<p>Along with sincerity<br /> Something else is needed<br /> To take you to your goal<br /> Faster than the fastest,<br /> And the name of that something<br /> Is intensity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191315" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5623</h1>
  
 

<p>Let at least one member<br /> Of your inner family<br /> Listen all the time to the soul.<br /> Its progress, happiness and satisfaction<br /> Will immediately inspire<br /> The other members to follow.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191316" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5624</h1>
  
 

<p>What an unfortunate seeker!<br /> Not even one member<br /> Of his inner family<br /> Is fully convinced<br /> That the soul is always right â€” <br /> No, not even his heart!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191317" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5625</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> I am aspiring to do something good.<br /> Will You approve it, please?</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> I am desiring to do something bad.<br /> Will You forgive me, please?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191318" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5626</h1>
  
 

<p>My Supreme Lord,<br /> You are the Origin of everything.<br /> Therefore<br /> Ultimately, nothing can take place<br /> Except through Your Will.</p>
<p>"True, My child, true.<br /> But some things I approve of,<br /> While others I only tolerate."</p>

<div id="node-1191319" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5627</h1>
  
 

<p>Before the race<br /> They are all surrender.<br /> They are praying for God's Victory.<br /> But during the race<br /> And after the race<br /> They are thinking of<br /> Nothing but their own victory!<br /> I do not want you<br /> To be in their company.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191320" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5628</h1>
  
 

<p>The cosmic gods and goddesses<br /> Do not have to learn songs<br /> By heart.<br /> They just allow their divine capacity<br /> Spontaneously to sing.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191321" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5629</h1>
  
 

<p>In my highest consciousness<br /> No disturbance can breathe.<br /> I can forgive the whole world.<br /> I can even forgive myself,<br /> For there I am<br /> In God's Eternity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191322" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5630</h1>
  
 

<p>The undivine may have won<br /> An immediate victory,<br /> But the ultimate Victory<br /> Will always belong to God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191323" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5631</h1>
  
 

<p>An inner defeat:<br /> A great seeker has fallen<br /> And lost his progress-chance<br /> For this entire lifetime.</p>
<p>An inner victory:<br /> The same seeker may return<br /> To earth<br /> With renewed aspiration<br /> And more powerfully proceed<br /> To a higher level than before.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191324" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5632</h1>

  <h1 class="book-heading">5635</h1>
  
 

<p>O purity,<br /> By the very sound of your name<br /> Anything that is attacking me<br /> Is weakened<br /> And my own good qualities<br /> Come to the fore.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191328" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5636</h1>
  
 

<p>Look around!<br /> You will see so many things<br /> To do for the world.</p>
<p>Dive deep within!<br /> You will not only see<br /> But also at once do<br /> Many things for God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191329" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5637</h1>
  
 

<p>In the world of aspiration<br /> There are many roads,<br /> But all the roads<br /> Lead to the same Goal:<br /> God, the Absolute Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191330" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5638</h1>
  
 

<p>The music of the heart,<br /> The beauty of the soul<br /> And the Divinity of God<br /> Are inseparable.<br /> This secret and sacred truth<br /> Reveals itself<br /> To the seeker-lovers of music.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191331" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5639</h1>
  
 

<p>Through each good action<br /> I am carrying myself<br /> Slowly but unmistakably<br /> Towards my eternal Destination:<br /> The Golden Shore of the Beyond.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191332" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5640</h1>
  
 

<p>Everything has to be done<br /> On the basis of surrender.<br /> Whatever we may do<br /> Without surrender<br /> Will remain utterly meaningless.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191333" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5641</h1>
  
 

<p>When I surrender my finite existence<br /> To the infinite Consciousness,<br /> Then my surrender is perfect,<br /> For my lowest is surrendering<br /> To my highest.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191334" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5642</h1>
  
 

<p>When I sing,<br /> I know that I am singing<br /> For the Supreme Singer.</p>
<p>When I play music,<br /> I know that I am becoming one<br /> With God the Supreme Musician.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191335" class="section-2">

<p>When the seeker surrenders,<br /> Then only<br /> He becomes one with the Reality<br /> He has been longing to reach.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191337" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5645</h1>
  
 

<p>Over the years<br /> He has totally lost<br /> His intense aspiration-flame.<br /> But his own inmost sincerity<br /> Still has the power<br /> Once more to bring to the fore<br /> The soulful inspiration and aspiration<br /> That once upon a time<br /> Started his spiritual journey.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191338" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5646</h1>
  
 

<p>He had an infallible vision:<br /> The cosmic goddesses<br /> Were so deeply moved<br /> By the seekers' soulful singing<br /> That they came and joined<br /> The singers<br /> And most powerfully sang<br /> In and through their human voices.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191339" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5647</h1>
  
 

<p>I assure you,<br /> Unlike the outer world,<br /> The inner world is not asleep.<br /> The inner world only watches and waits<br /> For a little receptivity<br /> From the outer world<br /> So that it can pour and pour into it<br /> Its unreserved blessings and love.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191340" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5648</h1>
  
 

<p>Once upon a time<br /> You used to defeat ignorance-prince.<br /> But now you are practising<br /> Your surrender to ignorance.<br /> Do you really think<br /> That this kind of surrender<br /> Is what your Beloved Supreme<br /> Wanted from you?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191341" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5649</h1>
  
 

<p>Alas,<br /> Where is my true<br /> Aspiration-life?<br /> Alas, alas,<br /> When will I again<br /> Pray and meditate<br /> With my heart's utmost intensity?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191342" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5650</h1>
  
 

<p>O God-musician!<br /> You are creating<br /> An absolutely new world.<br /> You are adding so much<br /> Divine beauty and supreme majesty<br /> To God's worlds of aspiration,<br /> Dedication and manifestation.<br /> Perhaps God only<br /> Appreciates you adequately.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191343" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5651</h1>
  
 

<p>What else<br /> Is my tremendous achievement,<br /> O my Lord Supreme,<br /> If not the manifestation<br /> Of Your own supremely unparalleled<br /> Compassion-Capacity?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191344" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5652</h1>
  
 

<p>Revive your old spiritual grandeur!<br /> Even if your stone-heart<br /> Does not feel it,<br /> Your eyes are bound to see<br /> That others are now lifting the burden<br /> That once upon a time<br /> You devotedly carried<br /> For your Lord Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191345" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5653</h1>
  
 

<p>To have intensity<br /> Without sincerity<br /> Is like trying to reach<br /> The Highest<br /> By hook or by crook.<br /> Success is just impossible.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191346" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5654</h1>
  
 

<p>You think that at the last moment<br /> You will win the race.<br /> But I am telling you,<br /> Without tremendous inner intensity<br /> How can you be sure<br /> That you will even finish the race?</p>

<div id="node-1191347" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5655</h1>
  
 

<p>When your Master gives you<br /> A private interview,<br /> Remember that you are<br /> Face to face<br /> With God's own personal representative.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191348" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5656</h1>
  
 

<p>In your deep meditation<br /> All is oneness.<br /> Never allow division<br /> Even to start,<br /> Or soon it will take you<br /> To the utter frustration<br /> Of separativity-consciousness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191349" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5657</h1>
  
 

<p>An undivine force came to attack.<br /> It stood right in front of him!<br /> But he challenged it<br /> And conquered it<br /> By invoking purity and light<br /> From his Master<br /> And from his own soul.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191350" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5658</h1>
  
 

<p>Before you go to sleep,<br /> Do not forget to ask<br /> For your Lord's Protection.<br /> If your consciousness is high,<br /> You will not have to worry<br /> About unwanted nightmare-friends.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191351" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5659</h1>
  
 

<p>You are trying to fight with God.<br /> But where is your capacity<br /> And where is God's Capacity?<br /> At the right moment<br /> He will simply change your mind.<br /> His Compassion-Light<br /> Will be your Satisfaction-Delight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191352" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5660</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You have entered into my heart<br /> And made me feel<br /> That we are all brothers and sisters<br /> Of one world-family.<br /> Now do enter into my mind<br /> So it will act like the heart,<br /> And I will not be able<br /> To hurt others.</p>

<div id="node-1191353" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5661</h1>
  
 

<p>I am grateful to you,<br /> My Master-Lord,<br /> For when I cannot hear<br /> My inner voice,<br /> Your outer messages<br /> Carry the voice of my own soul.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191354" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5662</h1>
  
 

<p>Easily you can hear<br /> The voice of your Master.<br /> Is his voice not inside<br /> His books?<br /> Is his voice not inside<br /> His meditation?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191355" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5663</h1>
  
 

<p>O my body,<br /> Do not suspect the soul,<br /> Which has glowing faith in you<br /> And infinite patience with you.<br /> O my body,<br /> Once you have full faith<br /> In the soul,<br /> You will no longer need the help<br /> Of the vital, the mind<br /> Or even the heart.<br /> You will have your own free access<br /> To the soul.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191356" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5664</h1>
  
 

<p>True, there was a time<br /> When the mind and the vital<br /> Were bitter rivals.<br /> But now that their past rivalries<br /> Are buried in oblivion,<br /> Can they not become fellow travellers<br /> In the search for God?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1191357" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5665</h1>
  
 

<p>When he bragged about his past,<br /> Some believed it and got inspiration<br /> To become truly good.<br /> If the result was nothing but truth,<br /> Then who can say it was wrong<br /> For him to tell lies?</p>
  </div>

<p>O lethargy-prone seeker,<br /> Spirituality you are separating<br /> From your body, vital and mind.<br /> But do not forget the Vedic times<br /> When spiritual strength<br /> And physical strength went together.<br /> Once again<br /> Spirituality has to be<br /> In the physical and for the physical.</p>

<p>Insincere seekers<br /> Will ask countless questions.<br /> But those who soulfully hunger<br /> For the Master's illumination<br /> In silence only receive and receive.</p>

<p>To those who work very, very hard<br /> In any field of life,<br /> God will eventually give inner experiences â€” <br /> Unimaginable and undeserved â€” <br /> To tell them:<br /> "Do not halt!<br /> Do not stop here!<br /> There is something infinitely higher,<br /> Far beyond your present life."</p>

<p>Right now we have to start,<br /> Although insincerity is mixed<br /> With our sincerity.<br /> Eventually we will have pure sincerity<br /> And ultimately we shall proceed<br /> From illumining light<br /> To more illumining light.<br /> Right now we have to start.</p>
