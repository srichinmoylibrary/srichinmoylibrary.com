<p>I went into another weightlifting store in Hawaii to buy a dumbbell, but the owner said they did not sell single dumbbells. He said that in Hawaii dumbbells have to be bought by the pair. But why did I need two?</p>
<p>I showed him the article about me in <em>Iron Man</em> magazine. When he read about my calf raise lifts, he felt my quadriceps and asked me, “What are they made of?”</p>
<p>He xeroxed the article in <em>Iron Man</em> and read every line very carefully. He didn’t just glance over it. He was so happy to meet me, and we talked for a long time. He told me that two days ago he had tried to lift 250 pounds. He weighs 251 pounds. When I said, “I am 160 pounds,” he just looked at me. He was such a nice boy.</p>
<p>Finally he said, “Now, whatever you want, you can have. You don’t have to buy dumbbells by pairs.” So I got three individual dumbbells: 35, 50 and 60 pounds.</p>
<p>He also wanted a picture of me, and when I went back, he chose the 503-pound lift and immediately put it up on the wall. So both stores have that picture. When I went to the Hawaiian Sports Shoppe, I was trying to buy a 75-pound dumbbell and also a 15-pound dumbbell. The man said, “We always sell by the pair, but I will have to sell you a single one. How can I sell you this if you don’t want two?”</p>
<p>I said, “I don’t need two. I am here only for one week.”</p>
<p>The previous time I was in Hawaii, everything was sold in pairs also.</p>
