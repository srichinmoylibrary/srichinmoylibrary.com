<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. We can avoid them if we can pay attention to their first warning in the mental plane. In the mental plane we get a warning, but we neglect it. We feel that it will not come to the physical plane. As soon as we notice that we are going to get an attack on the physical plane, we have to fight against it. Just to notice the warning on the mental plane is not enough. We have to fight against it immediately. Otherwise, from the mental plane it will come to the vital and then to the physical plane. While it is in the mental plane we do not pay attention to it; therefore, it starts descending. Once it comes to the vital plane it becomes very difficult to stop it. And when it reaches the physical it is most difficult.</p>
<p>No disease, not even a little cold, can immediately attack us on the physical plane. First it attacks on the mental plane. But we do not know what is happening on the mental plane because most of the time we remain in the physical consciousness. So until the ailment has attacked our physical body we are not aware of it.</p>
<p>You will not have to go to the doctor at all if you become more conscious of these things. Since you are all seekers, every day you pray and meditate. All these things come to you during your prayer and meditation. But sometimes you feel that you are so powerful that the illness will not attack you. Or you feel that even if it comes to the physical, still you can easily conquer it. Another problem is that the human body is so undivine that it cherishes disease. Why? So that people will sympathise with it. When somebody says, "I am so sorry you are sick," immediately we feel that we have achieved something.</p>  </div>
