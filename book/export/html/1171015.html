<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God lives everywhere. He lives not only in the sky, not only in the planets, not only in the sun and the moon, but everywhere. But if you ask which place He prefers most — the vastness of the sky or the selflessness of the heart — then I have to say that He prefers the selflessness of the heart to the vastness of the sky. Usually, when something is vast like the sky, we identify it with God. We think that He abides only in vastness. But God is omnipresent and omnipotent. He can be the Infinite itself, and again He can easily transform Himself into the finite. We can find God inside the atom as well as in the vast sky. God’s favourite place to live is inside our aspiration-heart. The aspiring heart prays and meditates for God’s Victory, while the vastness of the sky may not pray to God at all. There are many, many planets, but these planets do not pray for God’s Victory the way the aspiring heart does.</p>  </div>
