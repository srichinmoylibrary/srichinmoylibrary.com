<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite peaceful. There is only one thing that we need here on earth and that is peace. Everything else is meaningless and useless. We can get name, fame, prosperity and everything else, but if we do not find peace in the inmost recesses of our heart, then we will not be satisfied. Only peace can give us true satisfaction. Nothing from the outer world can give us abiding satisfaction save and except peace. And for this peace we have to dive deep within and pray and meditate.</p>
<p>So when people look at my drawings and find peace, this helps to bring forward their own soul's qualities and increase their own wisdom and joy. When they look at these birds and see them flying in the inner freedom-sky, this increases their own heart's joy.</p>  </div>
