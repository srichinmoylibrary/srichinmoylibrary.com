<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Your Rainbow-Smile is the source<br /> Of my heart's freedom-life<br /> And my soul's satisfaction-breath<br /> Here on earth,<br /> There in Heaven.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186850" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1202</h1>
  
 

<p>My prayer longs to reach<br /> God's Feet.<br /> My meditation longs to see<br /> God's Eye.<br /> I long to breathe<br /> God's Heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186851" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1203</h1>
  
 

<p>How can you have<br /> Translucent morning dreams<br /> When you carry the heavy weight<br /> Of ignorance-night<br /> Inside your unaspiring heart?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186852" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1204</h1>
  
 

<p>Yours is the happiness-heart<br /> That significantly helps God<br /> In steering His Eternity's<br /> Vision-Boat.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186853" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1205</h1>
  
 

<p>Each time he soulfully meditates,<br /> On the strength of<br /> His self-transcendence-mind<br /> He sees that his life-tree<br /> Is ascending and expanding.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186854" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1206</h1>
  
 

<p>If you are an excellent truth-seeker,<br /> Then your Master's compassion-splendour<br /> Will radiate<br /> In your aspiring dream-eye.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186855" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1207</h1>
  
 

<p>Look at this stupid seeker!<br /> His aspiration is reduced<br /> To skin and bones,<br /> Yet he thinks that God<br /> Is still pleased with his mind,<br /> Still fond of his heart<br /> And still proud of his life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186856" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1208</h1>
  
 

<p>Faith is what my heart has.<br /> Doubt is what my mind knows.<br /> Life is what my Lord places<br /> Inside my heart.<br /> Death is what I place<br /> At the feet of my Lord.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186857" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1209</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Sometimes I wonder<br /> If Your Heart-Dictionary<br /> Houses all the words.<br /> "My child,<br /> My Dictionary houses all the words<br /> That your dictionary houses<br /> Save and except "indifference"<br /> And "uselessness."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186858" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1210</h1>
  
 

<p>Finally imperfection<br /> Has left his mind.<br /> Finally frustration<br /> Has left his vital.<br /> Finally hesitation<br /> Has left his heart.<br /> And now gloriously begins<br /> His Heavenward life-journey.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186859" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1211</h1>
  
 

<p>I have three names.<br /> My first name is<br /> Aspiration-cry.<br /> My middle name is<br /> Dedication-smile.<br /> My last name is<br /> God-Satisfaction.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186860" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1212</h1>
  
 

<p>If you want to be inside<br /> God's Silence-Delight-Heart,<br /> Then you must completely forget<br /> Your power-hungry past.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186861" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1213</h1>
  
 

<p>If you feel you have nothing<br /> To discard in your life,<br /> Then you are sadly mistaken.<br /> You can at least discard<br /> Your useless complaints<br /> And deathless grievances.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186862" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1214</h1>
  
 

<p>My heart's pressing necessity<br /> Is to shun the spiritual Masters<br /> Who deliberately offer<br /> Counterfeit realisations<br /> To the world at large.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186863" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1215</h1>
  
 

<p>Previously he was his heart's<br /> Silence-trance.<br /> Now he is his life's<br /> Transcendence-joy.<br /> Soon he will be his God's<br /> Perfection-Satisfaction-Song.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186864" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1216</h1>
  
 

<p>When silence sails his mind-boat,<br /> God immediately sails<br /> His Golden Boat ahead of him<br /> And leads him to the Golden Shore.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186865" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1217</h1>
  
 

<p>Always treasure a powerful will<br /> In the depth of your heart<br /> So that you can avert<br /> All ignorance-adventures on earth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186866" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1218</h1>
  
 

<p>True, I have changed many things<br /> In my life,<br /> But I will not be completely satisfied<br /> Unless and until I have fully transformed<br /> The face of my heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186867" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1219</h1>
  
 

<p>To fathom the depths<br /> Of my Lord's Compassion-Roots,<br /> I must first become<br /> A childlike surrender-blossom.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186868" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1220</h1>
  
 

<p>Cancel two things in your life<br /> And you will be extremely happy.<br /> Cancel your success-delaying ideas<br /> And your progress-starving ideals.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186869" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1221</h1>
  
 

<p>His soul has made a solemn promise<br /> To him<br /> That it will not leave the body<br /> Until all his divine dreams are fulfilled<br /> Here on earth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186870" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1222</h1>
  
 

<p>What you are is nothing<br /> But an immense tide of desire.<br /> Therefore, even your heart's silver dreams<br /> Have become dull and tarnished.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186871" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1223</h1>
  
 

<p>Who will believe in time to come<br /> That you seized a mountain-high greatness<br /> Without earning it in the least?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186872" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1224</h1>
  
 

<p>God will grant you another chance<br /> To rewrite your dull life-story<br /> If you do not allow<br /> Your body, vital and mind<br /> To become immersed in attachment-wave.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186873" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1225</h1>
  
 

<p>I am now convinced<br /> That two things will never leave me:<br /> My heart's expectation-smile<br /> And my life's frustration-cry.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186874" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1226</h1>
  
 

<p>When I suffer badly<br /> From my mind's forgetfulness-disease,<br /> My Lord Supreme appears before me<br /> With His Compassion-flooded<br /> Love-Medicine.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186875" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1227</h1>
  
 

<p>Unexpected troubles are knocking<br /> At your door<br /> Because you are surrendering<br /> To your ceaseless desire-hunger-life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186876" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1228</h1>
  
 

<p>Wherever he goes,<br /> He creates a new Heaven.<br /> Wherever he stays,<br /> He destroys the dark despair of hell.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186877" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1229</h1>
  
 

<p>O superior human beings,<br /> If you wear the shoes of contempt,<br /> Do you know that your hours<br /> Of deplorable folly<br /> Will never meet with the Hour<br /> Of God's infinite Wisdom-Delight?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186878" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1230</h1>
  
 

<p>No time for sorrow!<br /> I shall become my heart's soul-bird.<br /> I shall soar high, very high,<br /> And drink deep the Fountain-Love<br /> Of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186879" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1231</h1>
  
 

<p>At last he has defeated his ego<br /> Mercilessly.<br /> Now he loves and knows<br /> Only one thing:<br /> Oneness-song.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186880" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1232</h1>
  
 

<p>You are such a fool!<br /> Why are you trying<br /> To remember the pain<br /> Of your lost illusion-mind?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186881" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1233</h1>
  
 

<p>If you do not have oneness-realisation,<br /> Who knows what will happen to you?<br /> You may be imprisoned<br /> By world-jealousy and world-insecurity,</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186882" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1234</h1>
  
 

<p>Definitely God has use for you.<br /> At His choice Hour<br /> He will reveal your inner capacities.<br /> Be not afraid of Him!<br /> He is not going to expose<br /> Your past naked ignorance-breath.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186883" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1235</h1>
  
 

<p>The oneness-cry of my soul-bird<br /> Is the only thing<br /> That I shall love infinitely more<br /> Than anything else.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186884" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1236</h1>
  
 

<p>"The perfection-satisfaction-smile<br /> Of Heaven<br /> Is just one step ahead."<br /> This is what my obedience-mind<br /> And my surrender-life<br /> Are cheerfully telling me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186885" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1237</h1>
  
 

<p>Yesterday I called it<br /> A moment of self-indulgence.<br /> But today I am calling that very thing<br /> A year of destruction-death.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186886" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1238</h1>
  
 

<p>If you are a truly sincere soul,<br /> Then God blessingfully does<br /> Two things for you:<br /> Secretly He buries<br /> Your old ignorance-life.<br /> Openly He hurries to you<br /> And extols your new wisdom-flooded life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186887" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1239</h1>
  
 

<p>Alas, he is extremely unhappy<br /> Because he has<br /> A mind that is too quick<br /> To think wisely<br /> And a heart that is too slow<br /> To choose wisely.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186888" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1240</h1>
  
 

<p>Every day you walk along<br /> The avenue of doubt.<br /> At each step you have<br /> Only one friend:<br /> Frustration-dust.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186889" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1241</h1>
  
 

<p>My mind thinks<br /> That it is really great.<br /> My heart feels<br /> That it can be really great<br /> If so is the Will of God.<br /> My soul knows<br /> Only one thing:<br /> My Inner Pilot is everything.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186890" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1242</h1>
  
 

<p>He bowed his head<br /> To the humility-dust<br /> Only to be pierced by the arrow<br /> Of God's ever-increasing<br /> And ever-transcending translucent Joy.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186891" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1243</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> You are telling me<br /> That I am another God,<br /> Like Yourself.<br /> Would You kindly cut another joke?</p>
<p>"My sweet child,<br /> Another joke:<br /> I wish to be a perfect student of yours,<br /> Since you feel you have been failing<br /> All along<br /> To become a perfect student of Mine."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186892" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1244</h1>
  
 

<p>What has God's Compassion-Eye<br /> Done for me?<br /> God's Compassion-Eye has given<br /> My body, vital, mind, heart and soul<br /> Countless chances to prepare themselves<br /> For a perfection-satisfaction-dance with Him.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186893" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1245</h1>
  
 

<p>My Supreme Lord,<br /> What shall I do?<br /> Do You want me to complain<br /> Against the world,<br /> Or should I explain to You<br /> Why I am in<br /> Such a deplorable situation?</p>
<p>"My sweet child,<br /> I need no complaints from you.<br /> I need no explanations from you.<br /> I want you only to maintain your soul's<br /> Adamantine will-power-fire<br /> To burn the ignorance-tree<br /> That you see before you<br /> And the ignorance-tree<br /> That is inside you."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186894" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1246</h1>
  
 

<p>Each day dawns<br /> With a Compassion-Smile<br /> From my Beloved Supreme.<br /> Yet my journey's goal<br /> Is still a far cry.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186895" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1247</h1>
  
 

<p>Are you trying to teach me something<br /> Or are you trying to learn something<br /> From me?<br /> If you are trying to teach me something,<br /> Then instead of teaching me,<br /> I would like you to teach<br /> My unruly, disobedient mind.<br /> If you are trying to learn something<br /> From me,<br /> Then instead of learning from me,<br /> I would like you to learn every day<br /> A purity-song from my heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186896" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1248</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme laughed at me<br /> For an hour<br /> When He heard that I felt I have<br /> Something exceptionally new to offer<br /> To the world at large.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme cried for me<br /> For an hour<br /> When He heard that I have declared<br /> My life to be a total failure.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186897" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1249</h1>
  
 

<p>Alas, you are not schooled enough<br /> To see purity<br /> Inside earth's heart-garden.</p>
<p>Alas, you are not schooled enough<br /> To see the Compassion-flooded Eye of God<br /> Inside your soul's God-Hour.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186898" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1250</h1>
  
 

<p>Every day enlarge<br /> Your aspiration-heart-room.<br /> To your wide surprise,<br /> You will see that one day<br /> God Himself will come and remove<br /> Your darkness-desire-corpse.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186899" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1251</h1>
  
 

<p>By no means does self-transcendence<br /> Mean an impossible task,<br /> And possibility can and must reach<br /> Self-transcendence-shore.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186900" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1252</h1>
  
 

<p>You want to receive from God<br /> His Satisfaction-Crown<br /> In spite of the fact<br /> That you have the appetite<br /> Of a tiny bird<br /> For your progress-life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186901" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1253</h1>
  
 

<p>God does not need<br /> Many things from me<br /> To satisfy Him.<br /> He needs only one thing —<br /> Surrender —<br /> And that, too, He does not need<br /> In large quantity.<br /> Even a morsel of my surrender-life<br /> Can satisfy Him.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186902" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1254</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> You have corrected my mind<br /> With Your Concern.<br /> You have perfected my heart<br /> With Your Compassion.<br /> You have fulfilled my life<br /> With Your Forgiveness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186903" class="section-2">

  </div>
<div id="node-1186904" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1256</h1>
  
 

<p>Every day his Inner Pilot<br /> Takes the pulse<br /> Of his aspiration-heart<br /> And grants him<br /> A powerful Satisfaction-Smile.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1257</h1>
  
 

<p>You can never be a loser,<br /> You can only be a winner<br /> Every time<br /> If you race<br /> On a sincerity-progress-track.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1258</h1>
  
 

<p>For a long time<br /> God the Justice has been giving me<br /> His own Telescope<br /> To see the Beyond.<br /> Now God the Compassion has given me<br /> His brand new Telescope<br /> To see the Beyond<br /> And has said to me<br /> That I don't have to return it<br /> But can keep it for my own use.</p>

<div id="node-1186908" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1260</h1>
  
 

<p>Long ago we said farewell<br /> To truth's inner instructions.<br /> But now we have become hunters<br /> Of that lost divinity-world.</p>

<div id="node-1186909" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1261</h1>
  
 

<p>Do not interrogate<br /> Divinity's poise within you,<br /> For inside it<br /> What always looms large<br /> Is God's Perfection-Choice.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186910" class="section-2">

  </div>
<div id="node-1186911" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1263</h1>
  
 

<p>A long chain of responsibility:<br /> This is what the human life is.<br /> A sleepless embrace of Immortality:<br /> This is what the divine life is.</p>

<p>Disobedience means death.<br /> How can you drink<br /> The sunbeams from the Beyond<br /> When disobedience reigns supreme<br /> In both your inner life and outer life?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186913" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1265</h1>
  
 

<p>A doubting mind is nothing other than<br /> An age-old corruption in man.<br /> A trembling heart is nothing other than<br /> An age-old frustration of God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186914" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1266</h1>

<p>God usually does not interfere<br /> In anybody's life.<br /> But in my case He did interfere<br /> When I felt absolutely sure<br /> That I would never be able to become<br /> A choice instrument of His.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186916" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1268</h1>

<p>His mind-clock tells him<br /> That he does not have to waste<br /> His precious time<br /> Waiting for God,<br /> Since God's existence is quite uncertain.</p>
<p>His heart-clock tells him<br /> To wait and watch,<br /> For God will definitely come.</p>
