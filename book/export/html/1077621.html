<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, everyone eventually has to realise God. In life there are two rooms. One is all light and knowledge and the other is all darkness and ignorance. The criminals have chosen to stay in the room that is all darkness. But one day they will see that the other room is much more fulfilling. Then naturally they wonâ€™t want to stay in darkness anymore. They will come out and enter into the other room that is full of light.</p>  </div>
