<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To me the path of the heart means divine love, divine devotion and divine surrender. Human love means to bind and be bound. Human devotion is nothing other than attachment. Human surrender is like the forced surrender of a slave to the master. But divine love means to love God in the way God wants to be loved. Divine devotion means to serve God in the way God wants us to serve. Divine surrender means to make our will completely one with His Will.</p>
<p>We want to love God unconditionally in order to please Him in His own Way. We want to devote ourselves to God unconditionally in order to please Him in His own Way. We want to surrender our earth-bound will to His Heaven-free Will unconditionally in order to please Him and fulfil Him in His own Way. Everything has to be unconditional. This is the path of the heart.</p>
<p>The supreme message of the Saviour we have to apply to our everyday life: “Let Thy Will be done.” When we love God, devote ourselves to God and surrender to Him unconditionally, our finite ‘self’ grows into the Infinite in exactly the same way that a drop enters the ocean and becomes the ocean itself. When we become one with the Infinite, and claim it as our very own, then we can truthfully say that we ourselves <em>are</em> infinite.</p>  </div>
