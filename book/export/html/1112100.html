<p>Yesterday, when I was running a race in Australia, two runners went ahead of me. As they were passing me, one of them told the other, "This guy is everything! Turn around!" Both of them turned and looked at me.</p>
<p>Then, right after the race, somebody else came up to me and started asking me about food. He said, "Why do you not allow people to eat meat and fish?" I simply smiled at him.</p>
<p>This second experience happened immediately after the race, when I was so tired and exhausted. That is why I was not in the mood to answer the question.</p>
