<p>One day in his childhood Rabindranath wanted to accompany his elders to school. The private tutor gave him a slap and remarked, “Now you are weeping for not being able to go to school, but a time will come when you will weep more bitterly for having to go to school.” In later years Rabindranath said that no other prophecy proved to be as accurate as this in his life.</p>  </div>
