<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have great admiration for the Catholic Church, in the same way that I appreciate our Hindu temples in India. To me, the Church embodies inspiration, aspiration and devotion in the purest sense of the terms. To me, each Catholic church, like a Hindu temple, is a heart-garden flooded with purity and divinity. It carries humanity's aspiration to the highest and brings down God's Compassion to humanity. You can say that the Church is the golden bridge between man's aspiration-cry and God's Satisfaction-Smile.</p>
<p>So I do not look upon the Catholic Church as merely an institution with various dogmas and moral laws. From my own spiritual point of view, I feel that the Church embodies God's sleepless and self-giving Breath for the illumination, salvation and perfection of mankind. In this sense, God has been working in and through the Holy Father and the Church to expedite humanity's inner and outer growth and progress, and to fulfil humanity's aspirations for inner and outer freedom and liberation.</p>  </div>
