<p>Tagore is the only poet to have two national songs to his credit. <em>Jana Gana Mana</em> is the national anthem of India and <em>Amar Sonar Bangla</em> is the national anthem of Bangladesh. That one song, <em>Amar Sonar Bangla</em>, has touched the highest heights of Immortality. The words are absolutely simpler than the simplest, but they carry such inner depth:</p>
<p><em>Amar sonar Bangla, ami tomai bhalobasi.</em><br />O my golden Bengal, I love you.</p>
<p>This is how the song starts. Inside these words there is such feeling. Tagore is giving a description of Bengal’s beauty.</p>
<p>I am a poet, a self-styled poet. If I am to be the judge, I will give <em>Amar Sonar Bangla</em> the highest award. It is so simple, so sweet, so soulful and so blissful — what more can I say? It is sweeter than the sweetest and most beautiful. Such a sweet, melodious song! The whole song is a description of Mother Bengal. Sweetness, softness, mellowness and so many other good qualities this song embodies.</p>
<p>Many people have written on Bangladesh and perhaps many more will write on Bangladesh, but this song will be always on the top of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>I am sure Tagore will remain the only poet to have two national songs to his credit.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
