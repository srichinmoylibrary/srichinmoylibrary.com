<p>Many of the people who organise races have given up running themselves. Only in the evening they walk. They have all developed nice stomachs.</p>
<p>I am the only spiritual Master who runs. Others just hold meditations and become fat. I will definitely defeat all the spiritual Masters in running.</p>
