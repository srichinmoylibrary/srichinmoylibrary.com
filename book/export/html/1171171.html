<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You know well what happens if you accept the spiritual life and give up. If we start a course and then do not complete it, how do we get the diploma? In life, everything we start that is good, we have to continue until we have reached the destination. After accepting the spiritual life, if you give up and then expect the same treatment from God after leaving the body, it is not possible. As in human life, if we study a course, we have to complete the course in order to get a degree. If we accept the spiritual life and then give up, then how can we get the same kind of peace, light, love and bliss from God?</p>
<p>If we aspire, if we cry for God, if we pray and meditate, naturally we shall please God much more than otherwise.</p>  </div>
