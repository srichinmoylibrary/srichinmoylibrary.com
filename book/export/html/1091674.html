<p>One day a yoga teacher came to a priest and said, "Father, Father, forgive me."</p>
<p>The priest said, "What have you done? What kind of sin have you committed?"</p>
<p>The lady said, "Father, I am a yoga teacher. I studied yoga in the Hindu way, and then I also started teaching people yoga, and joined a Hindu Master. This Master had students from all faiths â€” Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Can you imagine! We were always taught that there is only one God. For this Master, there are so many gods. I had to pray to the founders of all faiths."</p>
<p>The priest asked, "Did the Master tell you to pray to the founders of all faiths?"</p>
<p>"He did not say that directly but implied it, because he has students from all faiths. Yet Christ said, 'I am the Way. I am the Goal.' I have made such a serious blunder and committed such a terrible sin by leaving Christianity."</p>
<p>The priest said, "All right. I forgive you, but do not commit this kind of sin again."</p>
<p>How useless both the yoga teacher and the priest were! The priest was telling the teacher to stick to her Christianity and not to commit this sin again. Is it a sin to have a universal heart that sees truth and goodness at the core of all faiths?</p>  </div>
