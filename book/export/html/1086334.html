<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are pulling beyond your capacity. Everybody has an inner vessel. You are trying to pull light from above beyond your capacity. When peace, light and bliss are forced into you, your vessel begins to give way because its capacity is very limited. First you have to make your inner vessel larger, much larger than it is now. How will you do this? You will try to aspire quietly, sincerely, devotedly. Do not pay any attention to the time limit. When you are in a position to meditate most intensely and soulfully for five minutes that is the best length of time for you. If you try to meditate intensely for half an hour, that is beyond your capacity. At that time if you continue to pull light from above, there will be a struggle between your heart and your mind. The mind is pulling and pulling, but the heart knows its capacity. The mind is putting the heart into difficulties. It is like the husband who brings all his friends home unexpectedly and asks his wife to give them a meal, although she is not at all prepared. In this way the mind pulls light, although the mind knows perfectly well that the heart-vessel will not be able to hold all this light or retain it. But the mind is a greedy fellow, so it just grabs as much as it can and brings it into the heart although it is beyond the capacity of your inner vessel. So when you meditate, meditate for a short time at first and see the heart's capacity for receptivity. Then do not allow the mind to try to pull down anything by force.</p>  </div>
