<p>The physical in me surrenders to God, the vital in me surrenders to God, the mind in me surrenders to God. But the psychic in me, the heart in me, does not have to surrender to God, for it has already surrendered to God. The soul in me does not have to surrender to God because it has already surrendered not only to God, but also to its own Reality. And what is its own Reality? Its Reality is the constant, fulfilling choice of God's eternal Voice.</p>  </div>
