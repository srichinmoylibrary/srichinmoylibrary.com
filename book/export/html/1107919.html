  <h1 class="book-heading">We run, we become</h1>
  
 
<p>We run. We become. We run in the outer world. We become in the inner world. We run to succeed. We become to proceed.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, speed is of paramount importance. In the outer world, speed is founded mostly upon inspiration. In the inner world, speed is founded mostly upon aspiration.</p>
<p>Inspiration helps us run — far, farther, farthest. It helps us run the length and breadth of the world. Aspiration helps us become — fast, faster, fastest — the chosen instrument of our Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Inspiration tells us to look around and thus feel and see boundless light, energy and power. Aspiration tells us to dive deep within and enjoy boundless inner nectar and delight.</p>
<p>Inspiration tells us to claim and proclaim our own divinity, which is our birthright. Aspiration tells us to feel and realise once and for all that we are exact prototypes of our Beloved Supreme and thus we can be as great, as good, as divine and as perfect as He is.</p>
<p>Inspiration tells us to become our true selves. Aspiration tells us to become God Himself.</p>
<p>Inspiration tells us to feel what we soulfully have: God's Love, God's Compassion, God's Beauty and God's Peace in infinite measure. Aspiration tells us to feel at every moment that we are of the Source and for the Source. We are of our Beloved Supreme the One and we are for our Beloved Supreme the many. Him to fulfil, Him to manifest, Him to satisfy unconditionally in His own Way is the reason we have taken human birth.</p>
<p>We run. We become. At every moment we are running to become something great, sublime, divine and supreme. While we are becoming, we feel that we are in the process of reaching our ultimate Goal. But today's Goal is only the starting point for tomorrow's new dawn. At every moment we are transcending our previous achievements; we are transcending what we have and what we are. By virtue of our self-giving, we are becoming the Beauty, the Light and the Delight of our Beloved Supreme.</p>  </div>
