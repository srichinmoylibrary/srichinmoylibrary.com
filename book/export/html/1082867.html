<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme has given you as a human being the capacity and potentiality to realise God, the real God. If He is not kind, why does He give you this human life? He has given you this life, He has given you the aspiration, He has given you the opportunity and He has given you the capacity to realise His highest Height. Would He have given you all this if He did not love you? The Supreme loves you, He <em>does</em> love you, that is why He has given you the aspiration to seek His Love.</p>
<p>Sometimes we speak to our own mind, to our own dissatisfied vital, but very rarely do we try to speak to our inner being. If we discover the secret of speaking to our inner being, we will solve all our problems and discover the true meaning of our human existence. This human existence is a golden opportunity that the Supreme has granted us. We say that we don't have an opportunity but it is a sheer lie. The Supreme has given us the opportunity, but we do not avail ourselves of that opportunity.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
