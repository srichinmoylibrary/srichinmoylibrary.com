<p>Akbar and Birbal were walking together along the street. It was a very hot day, and after a while the Emperor took off his new coat and handed it to the Minister to carry. The Minister received the coat gladly, and they continued walking.</p>
<p>All on a sudden the Emperor said, "I am sorry that you are carrying my coat. It is so heavy. You are carrying the load that a donkey should carry."</p>
<p>Birbal replied, "I am happy that I am carrying only the coat of a donkey, and that the donkey itself is not on my back."</p>  </div>
