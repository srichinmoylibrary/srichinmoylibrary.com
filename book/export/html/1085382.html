  <h1 class="book-heading">The farmer and the zamindar</h1>
  
 
<p>Once four farmers, idle talkers, were chatting. A young village man happened to pass by. One farmer said, "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>The young man replied, "Don't bother me. I am going to the home of the zamindar, the rich man in the village. I have some important business with him."</p>
<p>"You don't have to be proud," one of the idle talkers said. "I can go to visit the zamindar and eat with him anytime I want."</p>
<p>The young man became furious. He said, "Why do you cut jokes with me? Will it ever be possible for you to go to the zamindar's place? You are such an insignificant person."</p>
<p>The farmer in question said, "Don't brag; I can go whenever I want."</p>
<p>The young man said, "If you can eat with the zamindar, I will give you two absolutely new bullocks. And if you cannot eat with him, then for six months you have to plough my field with your own bullocks." The farmer agreed.</p>
<p>"Then let us see who wins," said the young man, continuing on to his destination.</p>
<p>The farmer took a short cut and reached the zamindar's house before the young man. He knew the way quite well because he lived in the same area as the zamindar, whereas the young man was from another village. The farmer entered and offered his pranam to the zamindar. "What are you here for?" the zamindar asked.</p>
<p>"I have something very special to ask you," replied the farmer. "I know you will forgive me."</p>
<p>"What is it?" the rich man said.</p>
<p>The farmer said, "I have found a piece of gold which is as big as an egg. You are very sincere and honest. Please tell me what its value is. I can't trust anybody but you, because you are the zamindar."</p>
<p>The rich man said, "Oh, I am so happy for you. First sit down and let me order food. You have brought such good news. I am so pleased and happy that you have found this piece of gold. Now you will be rich like me. You don't have to worry anymore; you won't have to beg or work at all. But first of all, eat. Later, I will tell you the exact price of the gold."</p>
<p>Immediately the servants brought food and both of them started eating. At that moment the young man came in. When the meal was over, the zamindar said to the farmer, "Now show me your gold."</p>
<p>The farmer answered, "I didn't tell you that I was going to show it to you; I wanted only to know the price. You told me to eat with you, so I did. But you didn't ask me to show it to you. I only came to know the price."</p>
<p>The zamindar got mad. He shouted, "Get out of here! Get out of here!"</p>
<p>The farmer left, but he was waiting outside the door when the young man came out later. The young man had lost.</p>
<p>So the farmer ate at the zamindar's house, plus he got two bullocks.</p>  </div>
