<p><em>On 4 February 1977 Sri Chinmoy inaugurated a new Centre in the New York area. Following is a transcription of what he said to the group of about 25 seekers who wished to become members of the new Green Centre.</em></p>
<p><em>The following questions were asked by disciples of Sri Chinmoy's Blue Centre on 11 February 1977.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please meditate for one minute and then tell me what is the most difficult thing for you to accomplish or conquer in your life, except God-realisation. God-realisation you are aiming at, but right now it is out of the question. But if you have jealousy, doubt or whatever, please tell me. The answer I give will be applicable especially to you.</p>
<p>General questions and answers</p>
<p><em>The following questions were answered on 2 March 1977 at Rockland County Community College in Suffern, New York.</em></p>  </div>
