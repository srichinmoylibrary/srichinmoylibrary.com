<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some of the birds are group birds while others are not. The individual birds will play individual roles while the collective ones will collectively play their collective roles. But at the end of their journey's close, both the individual birds and the collective birds will arrive at the same destination: the destination that is flooded with earth's self-giving beauty and Heaven's God-revealing Fragrance.</p>  </div>
