<p>Dipti Nivas will always remain a temple. Every time I am here, I feel the presence of the cosmic gods and goddesses most powerfully. People who are working here and serving this restaurant are serving the Supreme directly: this is true. But something else is infinitely more true: you people are really fortunate here. You may work nine or ten hours a day, but you are working in a place where the Supreme has most special Blessings. His presence and His children’s presence — that is to say the presence of the cosmic gods and goddesses — is very powerful here.</p>
<p>To each of you I offer my blessingful gratitude for serving the Supreme here. Please maintain the same height, the same standard, which I have been noticing again and again. There is no end to our progress. I really want you people to transcend and transcend. I transcended my transcendental Consciousness in 1970. My transcendental Consciousness, where I am one with the highest Absolute, would have always been more than enough for me, but there is no end to our progress. You people can also transcend, in the same way that I have transcended. The divinity that I see here can be increased by your own aspiration.</p>  </div>
