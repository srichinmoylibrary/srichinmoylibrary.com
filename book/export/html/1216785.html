<p>For my flight to San Francisco, Sandhani the great got me a discount. I almost never fly first class, but economy class is real torture for me, because there is no room to stretch out and after three hours my legs give way. I get such pain! And San Francisco takes practically six hours' flying.</p>
<p>Garima is always kind to me. When I said that I always have knee trouble because of the lack of room in economy, she wanted to change my ticket from economy to ambassador class for the return trip. She was asking me to let her change my ticket because she said the ambassador-class seats are very wide. She was begging me to let her pay the difference.</p>
<p>So I agreed, and Garima had to pay the difference, first between super-saver and economy, and then between economy and ambassador.</p>
