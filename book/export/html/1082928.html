  <h1 class="book-heading">37. Question: Can a crying heart ever displease God?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it can. Unless it is perfect, it can displease God even while it is crying. It can cry for Peace, Light and Bliss for half an hour and then it may not cry any more, or it may cry for earthly gifts, for earthly name and fame. While it is crying for Peace, Light and Bliss, definitely it is pleasing God. But how long does a heart cry for Light, Truth and Bliss? For half an hour or so. Then the same heart will mix with the impure mind, or the aggressive devouring vital will enter into the heart. Then the heart becomes a victim to the undivine members of the family. At that time, naturally the heart will displease God. But while the heart is crying for Peace, Light and Bliss, definitely it will not displease God. It will always please God at that time.</p>  </div>
