<p><em>(The Buddha with hundreds of disciples. Enter King Ajatashatru. All the disciples are excited. Ajatashatru prostrates himself before the Buddha.)</em></p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: O Lord of the world, out of our stupendous ignorance my friend Devadatta and I tried to kill you several times, but we failed, badly failed. Today I am at your august feet, to be killed immediately by your wisdom-sun.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: O King...</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: Master, I am not your King. You are the King of my heart and soul. You are the Lord of my heart and soul. I am your undeserving slave.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: You are not my slave, you are my son, my chosen son. My compassion-sun forgives your ignorance-night. My wisdom-sun illumines, liberates and immortalises your heart's cry.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Devadatta. Falls at the feet of the Buddha.)</em></p>
<p>DEVADATTA: Siddhartha, while we two were quite young I fought with you over the possession of a bird. The strength of my unruly, undivine vital had to surrender to the strength of your all-loving heart. You won the bird. I told you that one day with my vital love of power I would conquer your heart's power of love. Since then I have tried in hundreds of ways to humiliate you, to ruin your mission and to kill you, but I have failed. You forgave me then, O Siddhartha. Now, O Buddha, my shameless life desperately begs your forgiveness.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Devadatta, forgiveness is granted.</p>
<p>DEVADATTA: O Buddha, if you have really forgiven this inhuman creature, then do me another favour out of your infinite bounty. Your heart of compassion took care of that innocent bird. Now I pray to you to take care of the crying, bleeding bird inside my heart. And also I pray to you to take care of its cage, this body.</p>
<p><em>(Devadatta sings three times.)</em></p>

<p><em>Buddham saranam gacchami.</em><br /><em>Dhammam saranam gacchami.</em><br /><em>Sangham saranam gacchami.</em></p>


<p>[I go to the Buddha for refuge.<br /> I go to the <em>Dharma</em> for refuge.<br /> I go to the Order for refuge.]</p>
