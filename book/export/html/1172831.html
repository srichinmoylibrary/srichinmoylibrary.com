<p>I went to our San Diego Centre. And what did I do there? As soon as I saw some of the paintings which I did in 1976, I cried and cried with joy. I took pictures of four or five framed originals. I could not believe I was the artist! They were so beautiful, so beautiful!</p>
<p>There were six or seven paintings that made me cry and cry. My soul, my heart and my entire existence were absolutely overwhelmed. You cannot imagine what I felt when I was looking at those paintings.</p>
<p>Our San Francisco Centre also has quite a few originals. My boss at the Indian Consulate, Mr. Mehrotra, was transferred to San Francisco. He came to our Jharna-Kala gallery there, and he was so deeply moved. Then I invited him and his wife to eat at our restaurant. They sat with me, and I started painting in front of them. I gave them the painting that I had done right in front of them. It was a really beautiful painting! Mr. Mehrotra was very happy, and I was also very happy.</p>
