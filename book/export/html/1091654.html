<p>The teacher in a classroom once asked a question: "Where is God?"</p>
<p>The children were giving their answers. Many said, "God is in Heaven."</p>
<p>Some of the children added, "God is not only in Heaven, but also on earth. God is everywhere."</p>
<p>One boy said, "God cannot be everywhere. My father has told me, 'God is just like us. He is a man, and He is full of love.' If God is like us, then He can only be in Heaven. He cannot be in both places at the same time."</p>
<p>The argument went on and on. Some said, "God is in Heaven." Others firmly replied, "God is also on earth."</p>
<p>To end the discussion, the teacher said, "Tonight ask your parents, and let your parents say where God is. Please ask them if God can be both in Heaven and on earth."</p>
<p>One student, whose father was a scientist, came back to class the following day and said, "I asked my father. My father said, 'God is in Heaven, and He also has an office inside the church. God needs a representative on earth, so that is why He has an office here. For years and years, God has been searching for a good priest who is capable of taking care of His office and representing Him. But poor God is not yet successful.' That is why my father says that God lives in Heaven, but His office on earth is unattended."</p>  </div>
