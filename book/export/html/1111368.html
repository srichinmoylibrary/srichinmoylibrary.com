  <h1 class="book-heading">Suspicious characters</h1>
  
 
<p>Yesterday, around one o'clock in the morning, I took six or seven boys with me while I went out for a run. They were standing along 150th Street, helping me. They were so calm and quiet, but somebody called up the police and made complaints against us. They said some suspicious characters were outside.</p>
<p>A policeman came to see what we were doing. He was so sympathetic. He knew us well. He asked me whether I had run the Long Island Marathon. He said that if the rest of the people in the neighbourhood would be my disciples, then he would have no problems.</p>
