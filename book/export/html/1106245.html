<p>This morning I saw the jacket Vidagdha gave me that says, “Training for 1 Ton.” When I saw the jacket, I got confidence that I would do 2,000 pounds. I said, “Let me do it today.”</p>
<p>First I did 400, 600, 800 and then 1,000 pounds, and all the time I was wearing her jacket. She will be so happy!</p>
<p>Then I went from 1,000 to 2,000. When I was lifting 2,000, I didn’t dare use the jacket because I knew I had to kill myself and the jacket might be slippery. I was afraid the weight might slip off my shoulders. So I took the jacket off and held it in front of the video camera.</p>
