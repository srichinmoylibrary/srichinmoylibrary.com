<p><em>(Alipore Court. Beachcroft, Additional Sessions Judge and the jury. Norton, C.R. Das and other lawyers. The day of Aurobindo's release. C.R. Das after summing up his whole case concludes his historic address.)</em></p>
<p>C.R. DAS: "... My appeal to you is this that long after this turmoil, this agitation will have ceased, long after he is dead and gone, he will be looked upon as the poet of patriotism, as the prophet of nationalism and the lover of humanity. Long after he is dead and gone, his words will be echoed and re-echoed not only in India but across distant seas and lands‚..."</p>
<p><em>(Beachcroft looks on, eyes indrawn. The prosecution counsel, Mr. Norton, who was listening spell-bound to the peroration, now looks at C.R. Das, relaxed and relieved of his yearlong tension.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Beachcroft starts addressing the jury. After his address to the jury the foreman takes leave of the court to retire for consultation with his colleagues.)</em></p>
<p><em>(The jurors retire. The Court rises for lunch.)</em></p>  </div>
