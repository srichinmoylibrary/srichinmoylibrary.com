<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can increase your capacity to accept love by giving love to others. The more you give, the more you receive. So if you are able to give more love to mankind, then you will be able to receive from mankind. Self-expansion is God-expansion. You are expanding your own reality inside God’s Universal Reality. So the more love you give, the more you get from mankind and also from God.</p>
<p>So when you miss God, that is a very good sign, an extremely good sign. The first step is to miss Him. But then you have to go one step ahead and ask yourself whether the person you miss is universal. If you feel that He is universal, then you know that He is bound to be here, where you are. Therefore, you do not cry for Him. You try to see Him all around you, since He is universal. And if you want to see Him around you, then your aspiration has to be the strongest.</p>
<p>Our progress depends entirely on our sincerity. At home I spend hours and hours in my chair. But my chair will never realise God before you. Impossible! I may go to a disciple’s house only once a year: I may not go to a disciple’s house at all. But the disciple will realise God long, long before my chair and the other things that I use and have around me. Progress entirely depends on what you consciously want, and from whom. My chair does not consciously want God-realisation from me. Again, you may live thousands of miles from my house, but if you are consciously knocking at my heart’s door, naturally your progress will be infinitely faster than the progress of some individual who may stand in front of me and talk with me, but has no aspiration. So progress entirely depends on the inner necessity, inner cry and how badly one needs the Master.</p>  </div>
