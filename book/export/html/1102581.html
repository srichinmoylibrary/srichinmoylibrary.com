<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can transcend our self-centredness and our ego-motivated life if we can feel that we are of the One who embodies the many. Only our dedicated joint effort will bring about success. No matter what we do, what we say, what we achieve and what we grow into, it is all valueless unless we feel that we are of the One who embodies the many and that we are of the many who have to fulfil the One. We belong to a large family, and if we do not carry the members of our world-family to the Destination, then we shall never be fulfilled. If we see the Face of God without our friends and dear ones, then we will not be satisfied. Only if we carry them with us consciously and devotedly will we ever find true satisfaction and fulfilment.</p>
