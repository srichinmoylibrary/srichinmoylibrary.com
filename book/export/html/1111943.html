<p>In today's half-marathon, Chandika defeated Lavanya, Chetana and Nilima on my behalf. Deliberately I was staying seven metres behind Chandika, saying to myself, "I will defeat all of them." After two miles I surrendered, but Chandika went ahead and defeated them.</p>
<p>At one point, Sarama was going ahead of me with such devotion and surrender. Great, Sarama!</p>
<p>When I saw Tarak, he gave me such a wonderful smile. Then I found out that it was because he had gone ahead of Pahar. To get a smile from Tarak is no joke! Mahiyan and Tarak were running together. Then, at the last moment, Tarak had to defeat Mahiyan.</p>
<p>As you know, I didn't have the courage or strength or stamina to finish. From the first mile I wanted to surrender.</p>
<p>At the finish line I was sitting in the car. Sundar came up and told me of his deplorable performance with such sincerity and soulfulness. There was no false modesty — only sincerity and soulfulness. I was so proud of him. How I wish all the disciples, when they don't do well, would maintain this kind of cheerful and soulful consciousness!</p>
