<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now injustice is creating suffering in your life. Some people in your office are striking you inwardly, and because of your fear or incapacity you cannot protect yourself. But if you become very strong inwardly, you can use this strength either to take yourself to some other plane where their attacks will not reach you or to give them some illumination so they will stop bothering you.</p>
<p>Injustice is a kind of negative or undivine power, whereas light is a divine power. If you seriously enter into the spiritual life and learn how to invoke God's Light and Compassion, these divine forces will definitely save you from the situation that is now causing you suffering. But this may take a little time.</p>
<p>A quicker way of saving yourself is to acquire peace of mind. At our meditations here at the United Nations, we bring down peace. This peace is not something imaginary; it is very real. When you meditate with us, you can not only feel this peace but you can actually swim in the sea of peace. This peace is a solid power, which is infinitely more powerful than injustice. When you are swimming in the sea of peace, no human power can upset you.</p>
<p>Right now when these people attack you, you become angry and upset because you feel they are of the same standard as you. But when your whole being is flooded with peace, then no matter what other people do, you will feel that they are like children playing in front of you. You will say, "These are all children. What can I expect from them?"</p>
<p>When you have to defend yourself or protect yourself, always try to use a higher weapon. If people say something and you retaliate on their level, there will be no end to it. Again, if you simply swallow your anger, they will continue to take advantage of you. But if you are inundated with inner peace, they will see something in you that can never be conquered. They will see a change in you, and this change will not only puzzle them but also threaten and frighten them. It will make them realise that their weapons are useless.</p>
<p>Peace is the most effective weapon with which to conquer injustice. If you pray and meditate regularly, you will soon feel that your peace is infinitely stronger, more fulfilling and more energising than the unfortunate situations that others create.</p>
