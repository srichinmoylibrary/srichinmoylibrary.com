<p>Today I went to a bakery to buy heart-shaped cookies for prasad. I have been to that store so many times, and usually they are very nice, but this time they didn't pay any attention to me.</p>
<p>While I was there, a young boy of 14 or 15 years took an ice cream cone from the display case and started eating it without paying. The lady went inside to inform the manager. Then a stout man came out.</p>
<p>The boy did not run away. He just walked out with no fear. He was so daring.There were two or three other customers, but they just watched.</p>
<p>For another five minutes they did not serve me. Finally I said, "I need about 200 of these cookies."</p>
<p>They said they had no time to count them. Then I asked for a quarter pound.</p>
<p>They asked, "Why do you want a quarter pound?"</p>
<p>I replied, "I will be able to count how many are in a quarter pound, and then I will know how many pounds I have to buy in order to get 200."</p>
<p>They said, "We don't understand."</p>
<p>Finally I got my 200 heart cookies.</p>
