<p>Indeed, the power of helplessness in human beings is remarkable. Do we dare to believe this?</p>
<p>Indeed, the power of hopelessness in human beings is staggering. Do we dare to believe this?</p>
<p>Indeed, the power of uselessness in human beings is frightening. Do we dare to believe this?</p>
<p>What is this power? This power is self-oblivion. Self-oblivion has blighted man's aspiration and blinded man's vision.</p>
<p>Here at the United Nations, each person is a representative soul of his nation. It is in and through him that his nation gives and receives. It is in and through him that his nation thirsts for world-acceptance, world-recognition, world-appreciation and worldadmiration.</p>
<p>A person's willingness to hoist the banner of truth in order to bring about national and international victory determines his life's success-march and his heart's progress-flight. Indeed, his life's successmarch and his heart's progress-flight are the successmarch and the progress-flight of his nation as well. This success-march and progress-flight can be founded only on his and his nation's self-giving to the United Nations, which is the world's peaceenvisioning home, the world's oneness-home and a fulness-vision-manifestation.</p>
