<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In Yoga we pray, we concentrate and we meditate. When we pray, we get an inner feeling of going upwards, that is to say, with our hearts we feel that we are crying for something from Above. When we concentrate, we focus all our intense attention on something, it may be an object or it may be a person, in order to identify ourselves with it. And when we meditate, we enter into the deeper regions, deeper planes of consciousness.</p>
<p>By prayer, we enter into the Kingdom of God, by concentration we can also enter into the Kingdom of God and also, of course, by meditation. These three ways, prayer, concentration and meditation, are the most effective ways to commune with God.</p>  </div>
