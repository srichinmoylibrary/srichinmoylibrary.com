<p>"My Lord, people tell me that I am very beautiful, humble and pure. Do You agree with them?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do. Now, can you do Me a big favour, My child?"</p>
<p>"Definitely, my Lord."</p>
<p>"Then, My child, go and tell your admirers that since I fully agree with them in their genuine opinion of you, I will be very grateful to them if they agree with Me only on one thing."</p>
<p>"What is that, my Lord?"</p>
<p>"My child, I want them to agree with Me, happily and unconditionally, that you are My only perfect child on earth."</p>  </div>
