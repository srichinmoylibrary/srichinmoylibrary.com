<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please excuse me. You have misunderstood me. By outer silence I do not mean not speaking. I mean the outer expression of one's inner silence. One silence is dynamic; another silence is static. Static silence is found in deep meditation, which is preparation. Dynamic silence is found in action, which is manifestation. The inner silence guides and illumines us. The outer silence reveals and manifests us.</p>  </div>
