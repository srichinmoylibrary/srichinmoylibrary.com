<p>Databir brought me to a mall and left me there, and I was nicely shopping. When I went inside one store, the shopkeeper asked me, "Are you from India?"</p>
<p>I answered, "Yes."</p>
<p>He said, "That's why you have such a tan."</p>
<p>Perhaps he thought I was tanned because I had just come from India. He was very white.</p>
<p>I said, "Yesterday spring started."</p>
<p>He said, "You are wrong. Today spring started."</p>
<p>I said, "All right, yesterday or today spring started, but it is still very cold."</p>
<p>He said something like "Bad luck!" Then he said, "Why are you not taking this item? If you don't like it, you will be able to return it."</p>
<p>I said, "I am not coming back here to return it."</p>
<p>When I go shopping, how much talking I do with these people!</p>
