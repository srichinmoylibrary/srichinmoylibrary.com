<p>"Father, are You not proud of me when I speak to so many people all about You?"</p>
<p>"Son, I am proud of you because so many gods and goddesses listen to you."</p>
<p>"But Father, sometimes unlike the divine gods and goddesses, the human gods and goddesses look ugly and dirty."</p>
<p>"But son, you have the capacity to make them clean, tidy, beautiful and soulful."</p>
<p>"Father, You have told me all about my capacities. Now tell me something about Your own capacities."</p>
<p>"Son, I have only one capacity. Everyday I empty your Ignorance-Sea and fill it with My Knowledge-Light."</p>
<p>"Father, I am glad and sorry to tell You that Your one capacity surpasses all my proud capacities."</p>  </div>
