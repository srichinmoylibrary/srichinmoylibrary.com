<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is like human beings on earth. Each one has good qualities, but these qualities are not all coming together at any one point. When you come out with all your best qualities, at that time I may bring out all my undivine qualities. Usually, the best qualities of all the planets are not put together. Each one will keep its best qualities to itself.</p>  </div>
