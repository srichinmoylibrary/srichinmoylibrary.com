<p>My Lord,<br /> Whenever I tell You lies,<br /> You immediately catch me.<br /> But how is it when You tell me lies,<br /> I cannot catch You?<br /> "My child,<br /> Here is the proof<br /> That I am infinitely smarter<br /> Than you are."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101814" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> When I fall sick, You cure me,<br /> And this happens quite often.<br /> But when You fall sick,<br /> I can never cure You.<br /> "My child,<br /> There are many things<br /> That you can do,<br /> But I cannot do."<br /> My Lord,<br /> Please name only one.<br /> "My child,<br /> You have established friendship,<br /> Permanent friendship,<br /> With ignorance-night,<br /> A thing impossible for Me<br /> To accomplish."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101815" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I am planning to write<br /> My autobiography.<br /> Do You have any objection?<br /> "My child,<br /> I do have an objection."<br /> Why, my Lord, why?<br /> "I shall be terribly jealous<br /> Of you.<br /> I want you to write<br /> My Biography first."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101816" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Do You think<br /> You will ever care<br /> To write my biography?<br /> "My child,<br /> I shall write<br /> An excellent biography<br /> Of your life<br /> The day you completely stop<br /> Criticising Me."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101817" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You tell me to be careful<br /> Of my ego.<br /> It will destroy me.<br /> My Lord,<br /> When I extol You to the skies,<br /> Will You not have the same fate?<br /> "No, My child,<br /> Long, long before you were born,<br /> I completely destroyed My ego."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101818" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Be frank at least once<br /> In Your lifetime!<br /> It seems to me<br /> That You are jealous<br /> Of my mixing with ignorance.<br /> "My child,<br /> Why should I not be?<br /> After all, you are My child.<br /> I do have every claim<br /> To have you only for Myself."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101819" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> The more I satisfy You,<br /> The more You demand.<br /> Before You wanted from me<br /> Only love, devotion and surrender.<br /> Now You have added obedience.<br /> If I start obeying You,<br /> Then You will invent<br /> Something more!<br /> "My child,<br /> You failed miserably<br /> In your love-devotion-surrender-<br /> Examination.<br /> I want you to study<br /> The obedience-course,<br /> Which is abundantly easier."<br /> And, my Lord,<br /> If I fail in Your obedience-course,<br /> Will You have something<br /> Even easier?<br /> "My child,<br /> Yes, I will have something<br /> For you<br /> Easier than the easiest-<br /> My last resort-<br /> A sesquipedalian cane<br /> And<br /> An iron rod!"<br /> My Lord,<br /> Before You go that far,<br /> I am immediately starting<br /> My obedience-love-devotion-<br /> Surrender-life.<br /> I shall obey You<br /> Most sincerely.<br /> I shall start loving You<br /> Most sincerely.<br /> I shall devote myself<br /> To Your service<br /> Most sincerely.<br /> I shall give You<br /> My unconditional surrender<br /> Most sincerely.<br /> "Then, My child,<br /> Come, come, come<br /> And sit beside Me<br /> On My Golden Throne."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101820" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> When I do anything wrong,<br /> You immediately scold me<br /> Ruthlessly.<br /> But when I do many things right-<br /> I mean, most satisfactorily-<br /> You do not say even one word<br /> Of appreciation.<br /> Is it fair?<br /> "My child,<br /> When you do things<br /> To My great Satisfaction,<br /> I am all admiration for you.<br /> But, alas, your giant pride<br /> Does not understand My language.<br /> What is worse, it deafens<br /> Your two long and beautiful ears.<br /> "My child,<br /> At that time you should sympathise<br /> With Me,<br /> Instead of finding fault with Me.<br /> "My child,<br /> I do hope<br /> I have defended My case<br /> Most honourably<br /> And most satisfactorily."<br /> My Lord,<br /> In that case,<br /> I am terribly sorry for You.<br /> Or, should I say,<br /> I surrender completely<br /> And unconditionally<br /> To Your inscrutable Cleverness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101821" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I try so hard to please You,<br /> But I can never please You.<br /> Therefore, what is the use<br /> Of trying again and again,<br /> Only to fail again and again?<br /> "My child, do not give up!<br /> Let us not give up.<br /> It is a joint effort.<br /> The moment you succeed,<br /> I shall succeed as well.<br /> Your success has to precede Mine."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101822" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> No matter how hard I try,<br /> No matter how many ways<br /> I kill myself to please You,<br /> I can never please You.<br /> Now it has come to a point<br /> That I am arguing with myself<br /> Whether I should continue trying<br /> To please You.<br /> Is it really worthwhile?<br /> "My child,<br /> I am sharing a top secret with you.<br /> I have been also doing<br /> The same thing.<br /> You have no idea how hard<br /> I have been working<br /> To make you happy.<br /> Alas, it is of no avail.<br /> But something within Me<br /> Is telling Me to continue,<br /> So I shall continue.<br /> And I am requesting you<br /> To do the same.<br /> I am sure there will come a time<br /> When both of us will succeed.<br /> As you know, our philosophy<br /> Is never to give up.<br /> So before long,<br /> We are bound to succeed."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101823" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> What do You think of astrology?<br /> "My child,<br /> In My case<br /> I really do not want<br /> To go backward<br /> In order to go forward.<br /> I want only to go forward-<br /> Faster than the fastest<br /> And farther than the farthest."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101824" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> What do You think of palmistry?<br /> "My child,<br /> My Heart<br /> Is infinitely more beautiful<br /> Than My Palm.<br /> Therefore, I want to spend<br /> All My Life<br /> Appreciating, admiring, adoring<br /> And loving My Heart."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101825" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Am I correct when I tell You<br /> That finally I am making progress<br /> In my spiritual life?<br /> "My child,<br /> You are absolutely right.<br /> But do not forget<br /> To give Me a little credit."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101826" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Five days a week we work;<br /> Two days we get rest.<br /> Similarly, in the spiritual life,<br /> Can we not pray and meditate<br /> Five days a week<br /> And two days enjoy rest?<br /> "My child,<br /> I have no idea<br /> Whether you get a salary<br /> On the days you do not work.<br /> But in My case I cannot afford<br /> To give you your salary<br /> The days you do not work for Me."<br /> My Lord,<br /> What is Your salary, after all?<br /> "My child,<br /> My salary is<br /> My Affection, My Love,<br /> My Gratitude and My Pride."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101827" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Do You know everything<br /> That I do for You<br /> And say about You?<br /> "My child,<br /> I know only one thing:<br /> I love you, I love you,<br /> I love you unconditionally."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101828" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Do You not think<br /> It is high time<br /> For You to create<br /> A better world?<br /> "My child,<br /> I thought you are supposed<br /> To do that.<br /> "Please, My child,<br /> Do not thrust upon<br /> My two weak Shoulders<br /> Your heavy responsibility.<br /> You may not believe Me,<br /> My child,<br /> But I am already overburdened."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101829" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I cry for You every day,<br /> Every hour, every minute,<br /> Every second.<br /> Do You, my Lord, ever cry<br /> For me?<br /> "My child,<br /> If I also do the same,<br /> Then who will be able<br /> To console whom?<br /> Now, I am serious, My child-<br /> I do cry for you sleeplessly."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101830" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I do not know why<br /> You become so sad<br /> When You see me.<br /> Is it because You are not satisfied With me,<br /> Or is it because of something else?<br /> "My child,<br /> I become sad when I see you,<br /> Not because you are not good,<br /> But because your visits<br /> Are quite infrequent<br /> And unreliable."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101831" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You tell me that<br /> You always care for me.<br /> Where were You<br /> When I was wandering<br /> In my mind-forest?<br /> "My child,<br /> Unnoticed,<br /> I was following you,<br /> Lovingly and faithfully."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101832" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> When I take one step,<br /> You immediately tell me<br /> That I am great,<br /> Very great.<br /> My Lord,<br /> When I take two steps,<br /> You tell me<br /> That I am good,<br /> Very good.<br /> My Lord,<br /> What will You say<br /> When I take all the steps?<br /> "Then, My child,<br /> In no time,<br /> I will tell you<br /> That you are<br /> Absolutely perfect."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101833" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">21.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> When I leave You,<br /> Do You still care for me?<br /> "My child,<br /> My Mind may not,<br /> But My Heart definitely does."<br /> My Lord,<br /> Why does Your Mind<br /> Not care for me?<br /> "My child,<br /> You will not believe<br /> How much time I spend caring<br /> For all your brothers and sisters!"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101834" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">22.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Will it ever be possible<br /> For me to love You<br /> Unconditionally?<br /> "My child,<br /> This much only<br /> I can tell you:<br /> Many are your predecessors<br /> And<br /> Many will be your successors."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101835" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> If You really love me,<br /> How is it I cannot prove it<br /> To the world at large?<br /> "My child,<br /> My Love for you<br /> Is not for your demonstration,<br /> But for your life's illumination<br /> And nature's transformation."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101836" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Is there anybody on earth<br /> Who is pure in heart?<br /> "My child,<br /> You use your mind-eye.<br /> Therefore, you see everybody<br /> As impure.<br /> But I use My Heart-Eye.<br /> Therefore, I see that<br /> All My children,<br /> With no exception,<br /> Are pure."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101837" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I have made millions of mistakes<br /> In this life.<br /> Have You ever made any mistake,<br /> My Lord?<br /> Be sincere, once and for all.<br /> "My child,<br /> So far I have not made any mistake,<br /> But I have decided to make one:<br /> I want to withdraw My Concern<br /> From the disobedient human beings.<br /> Needless to say, you top the list!"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101838" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">26.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> It is so easy for me to feel<br /> That You love me,<br /> But why is it so difficult<br /> For me to feel<br /> That I love You?<br /> "My child,<br /> Do not worry.<br /> As long as you feel<br /> My Love for you,<br /> Your road will remain<br /> Amazingly clear."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101839" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">27.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I promise to You<br /> That I shall give You my heart,<br /> If You promise<br /> To break my mind first.<br /> "My child,<br /> Amen! A million times, Amen!"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101840" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">28.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I have called You<br /> At least a thousand times.<br /> But alas, no reply.<br /> "My child,<br /> You and I are playing<br /> The same game.<br /> I have called you<br /> At least a million times.<br /> But alas, no reply."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101841" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">29.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> When You get angry with me,<br /> What shall I do?<br /> "My child,<br /> Just give Me a cute smile."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101842" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">30.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> When am I supposed to arrive<br /> At the Golden Shore?<br /> "My child,<br /> Now,<br /> At this very moment."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101843" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">31.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I need from You<br /> The capacity to cultivate<br /> More love, more devotion<br /> And more surrender.<br /> Do You need anything from me,<br /> My Lord?<br /> "Yes, My child:<br /> More prayerful tears<br /> And<br /> More soulful smiles."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101844" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">32.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Alas, I am not ready<br /> To rise above daily trifles.<br /> "But, My child,<br /> I am all ready<br /> To give you My Divinity's All.<br /> Take it.<br /> Just take it."</p>
