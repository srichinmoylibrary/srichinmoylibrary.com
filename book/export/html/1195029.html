<p>God's Compassion<br /> Is taking care of<br /> My heart's aspiration-plant.</p>
<p>God's Satisfaction<br /> Will take care of<br /> My life's reality-tree.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195031" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9302</h1>
  
 

<p>Do not relax in your spiritual life.<br /> Do not act like a fool!<br /> Be wise at every moment<br /> To get the utmost benefit<br /> From your heart's aspiration-cry<br /> And from your life's dedication-smile.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195032" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9303</h1>
  
 

<p>Spiritual Masters -<br /> Whether of the past, present or future -<br /> All have the same opinion:<br /> No sincere effort fails;<br /> No sincere prayer remains unheard.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195033" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9304</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> How can I avoid<br /> Disobeying You unconsciously?<br /> "My child,<br /> If you have constant eagerness<br /> To please Me in My own Way,<br /> Then automatically<br /> Unconscious disobedience<br /> Will disappear."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195034" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9305</h1>
  
 

<p>Do not forget<br /> To ask your mind and heart<br /> Every day, without fail,<br /> How you can please God<br /> In His own Way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195035" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9306</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You have given me a zero<br /> On my progress report.<br /> Have I not pleased You at all?<br /> And do You think<br /> I shall never make any progress?<br /> Alas, alas!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195036" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9307</h1>
  
 

<p>This morning my Lord Supreme<br /> Told me an open secret:<br /> When I do not please Him<br /> In His own Way<br /> He may still give me<br /> His outer Smile,<br /> But inwardly He sees a big black stain<br /> On my aspiration-heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195037" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9308</h1>
  
 

<p>With aspiration-flames<br /> And determination-fire<br /> You can increase your heart's purity<br /> And your life's divinity<br /> To please God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195038" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9309</h1>
  
 

<p>"My dear child,<br /> Unfortunately you feel<br /> That since you have pleased Me<br /> In nine ways out of ten,<br /> I will forgive you<br /> If you do not please Me<br /> In the tenth way.<br /> But I know that you can please Me<br /> In each and every way."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195039" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9310</h1>
  
 

<p>God appreciates that you have<br /> Many good qualities.<br /> But be careful!<br /> Even one bad quality<br /> Can take away all His Joy.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195040" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9311</h1>
  
 

<p>If you can repeat from morn to eve,<br /> "My Lord Supreme,<br /> I want to please You<br /> In Your own Way,"<br /> Then you cannot<br /> Unconsciously disobey God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195041" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9312</h1>
  
 

<p>Look deep within.<br /> Are you expecting God<br /> To please you in your own way?<br /> If that is what you want,<br /> You and your life<br /> Will be total failures.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195042" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9313</h1>
  
 

<p>In the inner life<br /> And in the outer life<br /> There is nothing as useless<br /> And as destructive<br /> As disobedience to God's Will.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195043" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9314</h1>
  
 

<p>God knows what is best for you:<br /> Make this a psychic realisation<br /> And not just a mental conviction.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195044" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9315</h1>
  
 

<p>O my Lord Supreme,<br /> Are You aware of my disobedience?<br /> If so, what do You do<br /> With my disobedience-life?<br /> "My child,<br /> It is easier for Me<br /> To fulfil My Promise to your soul<br /> To transform your nature<br /> If I pretend<br /> That I have not seen and felt<br /> Your disobedience."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195045" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9316</h1>
  
 

<p>Alas, in his life<br /> All good qualities<br /> Are forced to surrender<br /> To one bad quality -<br /> Disobedience to God-Light.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195046" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9317</h1>
  
 

<p>My sweet Lord,<br /> I need many, many things from You.<br /> "My child,<br /> You do not need many things<br /> From Me.<br /> You only need one thing,<br /> And that is My Satisfaction<br /> In you, with you and for you."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195047" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9318</h1>
  
 

<p>A God-lover's best attitude:<br /> God cared for me,<br /> God cares for me<br /> And God will always care for me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195048" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9319</h1>
  
 

<p>God is cultivating<br /> A garden of good qualities<br /> In His seeker-children:<br /> Security-trees, purity-flowers<br /> And surrender-fruits.<br /> And He will not allow<br /> Any disobedience-seed<br /> To take root.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195049" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9320</h1>
  
 

<p>Yesterday<br /> God cared for me<br /> By giving me a powerful Smile.</p>
<p>Today<br /> God cares for me<br /> By not giving me an unwise Smile.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195050" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9321</h1>
  
 

<p>If you really love God<br /> And need only God,<br /> Then give God the opportunity<br /> To care for you<br /> Always in His own Way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195051" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9322</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> True, I have lost all hope,<br /> But Your Eye of indifference<br /> Ruthlessly tortures me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195052" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9323</h1>
  
 

<p>Do not feel<br /> That yours is a failure-life.<br /> Do you not know<br /> That God has infinitely more hope<br /> For your life<br /> Than you do?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195053" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9324</h1>
  
 

<p>If you do not have new hope,<br /> New aspiration and new dedication<br /> Every day,<br /> Then where is your true awakening?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195054" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9325</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Which of my difficulties<br /> Looms the largest?<br /> Is it impurity, doubt<br /> Or insecurity?<br /> "My child,<br /> There is only one obstacle<br /> In your life,<br /> And that is disobedience."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195055" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9326</h1>
  
 

<p>When you accepted the spiritual life<br /> Did God say to you,<br /> "My child,<br /> Now I shall please you<br /> In your own way"?<br /> Or did your heart and soul<br /> Say to God,<br /> "My Beloved Supreme,<br /> I am accepting the spiritual life<br /> Only to please You<br /> In Your own Way"?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195056" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9327</h1>
  
 

<p>Do you not realise<br /> That God is too compassionate<br /> To please you in your own way?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195057" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9328</h1>
  
 

<p>I am sure that your purity-heart<br /> Wants to give you confidence-light<br /> To replace your mind's arrogance-night.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195058" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9329</h1>
  
 

<p>God does not want to prove<br /> That He is right<br /> And you are wrong.<br /> He just wants you to be illumined<br /> By His Perfection-Smile.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195059" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9330</h1>
  
 

<p>Do not forget,<br /> You have two hurdles to cross:<br /> God-realisation first,<br /> And then God-manifestation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195060" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9331</h1>
  
 

<p>You know inwardly perfectly well<br /> That you are a beginner-seeker.<br /> Is it not useless<br /> To try to convince others<br /> That you are very advanced?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195061" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9332</h1>
  
 

<p>He aspired deeply and intensely.<br /> Therefore, God's infinite Bounty<br /> Made him win the inner aspiration-race.<br /> Do not envy him.<br /> Try to surpass him<br /> If you want to.<br /> Or at least you can follow him.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195062" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9333</h1>
  
 

<p>According to your heart's receptivity-smile<br /> God is trying and trying<br /> To manifest Himself in and through you<br /> In a very special way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195063" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9334</h1>
  
 

<p>God is not looking to see<br /> Who stands first or last.<br /> God is only looking to see<br /> If your consciousness-light<br /> Is bright.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195064" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9335</h1>
  
 

<p>Read spiritual books<br /> With your heart's aspiration;<br /> You will understand everything.<br /> Read them with your mind's suspicion;<br /> You will understand nothing.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195065" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9336</h1>
  
 

<p>God is not expecting you<br /> To reach His inner Height.<br /> But if you can reach<br /> Your own height,<br /> He will be more than happy.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195066" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9337</h1>
  
 

<p>If you cannot reach your highest<br /> When you stand before<br /> Your Lord Supreme,<br /> Then when are you going to<br /> Reach your highest?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195067" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9338</h1>
  
 

<p>Meditation is<br /> The expansion of consciousness.<br /> When you are meditating,<br /> If you feel and know<br /> That along with you<br /> Someone else will benefit<br /> From your meditation,<br /> Then this is absolutely perfect meditation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195068" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9339</h1>
  
 

<p>The day you lose enthusiasm and joy<br /> In your spiritual life<br /> Is the beginning<br /> Of your journey's end.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195069" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9340</h1>
  
 

<p>O sadness-night,<br /> I shall never allow you<br /> To enter into my aspiration-heart,<br /> For You are ruthlessly destroying<br /> My inner and outer capacity-smiles.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195070" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9341</h1>
  
 

<p>O my vital,<br /> You are worse than a mad elephant,<br /> For a mad elephant has peace<br /> At least some of the time,<br /> Whereas you enjoy<br /> Constant rebellion and destruction.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195071" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9342</h1>
  
 

<p>Knock at your own heart-door<br /> To see God and feel God.<br /> Knock at God's Heart-Door<br /> To enter into His Heart-Room<br /> And to sit there<br /> With utmost joy, love and gratitude.</p>

<div id="node-1195072" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9343</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Would You kindly make<br /> All important decisions in my life?<br /> I shall always ask You<br /> Inwardly and outwardly what I should do.<br /> My Lord,<br /> Do make all decisions<br /> In my life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195073" class="section-2">

<div id="node-1195074" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9345</h1>
  
 

<p>God sees in you<br /> Tremendous enthusiasm,<br /> Eagerness and oneness.<br /> That is why<br /> He is lovingly and affectionately<br /> Calling you His divine soldier<br /> Who threatens the ignorance-tiger<br /> All the time.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195075" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9346</h1>
  
 

<p>God has given you<br /> The capacity to please Him.<br /> But if you do not exercise the capacity,<br /> Then you are a failure,<br /> And You make poor God feel<br /> That He is also a total failure.</p>
  </div>

<p>The law of karma is one thing<br /> And the divine Grace is another.<br /> Remember,<br /> Grace can nullify,<br /> Grace can illumine,<br /> Grace can expedite,<br /> Grace can multiply -<br /> Of course,<br /> If you believe in Grace!</p>

  </div>
<div id="node-1195078" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9349</h1>
  
 

<p>When outer difficulties<br /> Stand in front of you,<br /> Just tell yourself,<br /> "If I can meditate<br /> In spite of this opposition,<br /> I will become<br /> A better and stronger God-seeker<br /> And God-lover."</p>
  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">9350</h1>
  
 

<p>The mind may surrender<br /> To opposition-wall,<br /> But the heart can and will<br /> Bring to the fore<br /> The joy of overcoming all opposition.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195080" class="section-2">

<p>My Beloved Lord<br /> Offered me a simple cure-all:<br /> "Remain always happy and soulful.<br /> Then easily you will be able to aspire<br /> And dedicate your life to Me,<br /> And your imperfection-life<br /> Will come to an end."</p>
  </div>

  </div>
<div id="node-1195082" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9353</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1195083" class="section-2">

<p>You fool!<br /> By blaming God<br /> For what He has not done<br /> Or what He has done,<br /> You will never be able<br /> To become another God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195084" class="section-2">

<p>You are not your mind.<br /> Why do you have to care<br /> Whether your mind is tired<br /> Of loving God or not?<br /> Indeed, you are your soul.<br /> Your soul can never be tired<br /> Of loving God.</p>
