<p>There was a time when my Lord Supreme<br /> Came to me with His Forgiveness<br /> In infinite measure.<br /> Alas, soon He came to realise<br /> That I did not deserve His Forgiveness.<br /> Therefore, He was compelled to withdraw<br /> His Forgiveness.</p>
<p>There was a time when my Lord Supreme<br /> Came to me with His Compassion<br /> In infinite measure.<br /> Alas, soon He came to realise<br /> That I did not deserve His Compassion.<br /> Therefore, He was compelled to withdraw<br /> His Compassion.</p>
<p>There was a time when my Lord Supreme<br /> Came to me with His Tolerance<br /> In infinite measure.<br /> Alas, soon He came to realise<br /> That I did not deserve His Tolerance.<br /> Therefore, He was compelled to withdraw<br /> His Tolerance.</p>
<p>Now my Lord Supreme says to me,<br /> "O useless seeker,<br /> From now on I shall come to you<br /> With My Justice-Light,<br /> Which is, indeed, another way<br /> Of expressing My Concern for you.</p>
<p>"But if you fail even this time,<br /> Then I am going to use<br /> My most powerful weapon:<br /> My Indifference.<br /> Of all My weapons,<br /> My Indifference is by far<br /> The most destructive.<br /> Be careful, be careful, be careful,<br /> O useless seeker!"</p>
