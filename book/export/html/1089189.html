<h2>Meeting with Mitsuo Sato: head priest of the home of the Great Buddha</h2>

<p>I am offering you my soul's blessingful love and gratitude. The Lord Buddha is giving his highest blessings to your heart, and illumining your entire being. Many, many people come here to receive the blessings of the Lord Buddha, and you are the instrument of our Lord Buddha. Therefore I am extremely grateful to you.</p>
