<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If a person has four children and they are playing together, he gets tremendous joy. But if he has only one child, he may not get the same amount of joy. Similarly, if you have a beautiful body, beautiful vital, beautiful mind and beautiful heart, when you see them operating together harmoniously and divinely, you get the greatest joy. How can you make yourself beautiful in all parts? How can you make them all what you want to be? It is through self-giving. You have to give time and attention to the physical in you; that is to say, you have to keep your body clean and neat. You have to offer time and attention to your vital; that is to say, you have to act, you have to be dynamic, you have to move around; you will not stay at home and rest all the time. You have to give time and attention to your mind by reading spiritual books and by concentrating. You have to give time and attention to your heart by praying and meditating. If you don't pray and meditate, you will remain insecure, but when you meditate you become aware of your oneness with God. By paying attention to the physical, to the vital, to the mind and to the heart, you are giving them the nourishment they need. If you want them to please you, you have to feed them first you have to pay attention to them. Once you give them proper nourishment they will all dance in front of you like divine children.</p>  </div>
