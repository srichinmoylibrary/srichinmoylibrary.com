<p>My Lord, my Lord, my Lord, do You think of me even when I do not think of You?</p>
<p>"My child, I do, I do, I do! I do think of you even when you do not think of Me, and I think of you infinitely more than you think of yourself. Otherwise, by this time you would have jumped out of My Golden Boat into the ignorance-sea, and once more you would be drowning.</p>
<p>"My child, you may not be able to think of Me as many times as I think of you, or for as long, but you can think of Me a little more often from today on. But do it devotedly and soulfully to give your heart utmost joy and to give My Heart perfect Satisfaction."</p>
