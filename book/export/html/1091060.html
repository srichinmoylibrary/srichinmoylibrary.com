<p>I begged. I got nothing.</p>
<p>I desired. I got something, next to nothing.</p>
<p>I aspired. I got everything, even more.</p>
<p>When I begged, God said: "I have nothing to do with a beggar."</p>
<p>When I desired, God said: "I have little to do with you. You don't want my Omnipresence, Omniscience and Omnipotence. You want to be satisfied only with an infinitesimal portion of my Reality."</p>
<p>When I aspired, God said: "You are my chosen child. You are my pride. You want me fully. You want my Existence, my Revelation and my Manifestation.</p>  </div>
