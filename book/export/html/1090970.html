    <title>Question: Sometimes in my meditations, I come to think about Eternity. This feeling, instead of giving me joy, on the contrary causes me great anguish. I feel that I am all alone, I feel that by the power of my mind I have destroyed the world and am all alone by myself. Please tell me if I am taking the wrong track.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In your meditation, when you feel that you are alone, it is not actually the loneliness of a human being that you feel. At that time you have gotten a glimpse of the Soul, which pervades all. What you feel is a sense of your unconscious oneness with the Absolute Oneness. You see the Reality; you are the One pervading everything.</p>
<p>But when the physical, the vital and the mind are not transformed to a considerable degree, they are afraid of this loneliness. What is actually happening in your meditation is that your aspiration ceases before it reaches its Goal or finds its abode in the Goal. Your heart's mounting flame rises upward, but there are a few stops and breaks. If there were an uninterrupted and continuous flight, then you would not feel the loneliness at the lower levels of your consciousness. Please try to keep your aspiration uninterrupted at all times. The inner runner must complete his race divine.</p>  </div>
