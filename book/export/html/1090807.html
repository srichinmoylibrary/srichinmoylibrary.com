<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What you are seeing and feeling is a base. This is not the end of your journey; there is a farther goal. Don't be discouraged. It is a beginning; you have started. Now that you are walking along the path, you will see God and you will listen to the dictates of God as a child listens to his father. We are still walking, marching along the path of Infinity. Everything is bound to come, but we have to continue our journey.</p>  </div>
