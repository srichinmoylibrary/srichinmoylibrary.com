<p>X said to Nolini-da in the morning: "Nolini-da, when I was in Calcutta, I heard a rumour that the Mother is extremely sick and has decided to stop giving interviews. They say She won't even give her <em>darshan</em> four times a year. Is it true?"</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "This is the discovery of some of the Ashramites. Since they don't meditate, how will they get realisation? God had to bless them with a fertile imagination; otherwise, He would have had nothing to give them. I personally wrote to Pathamandir (Calcutta) that they must not pay any attention to such destructive rumours."</p>  </div>
