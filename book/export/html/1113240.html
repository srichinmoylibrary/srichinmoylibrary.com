<p>Ranju-da offered two large slices of mango to Nolini-da. Nolini-da gave me a piece. At this moment Rajen-da came in. Ranju-da said to him: "Would you care for some mango?"</p>
<p>Rajen-da said: "Let me see."</p>
<p>"High quality, excellent taste," Ranju-da replied. "But only five mangoes are in good condition. The rest were ruined in the train."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "Who sent them?"</p>
<p>Ranju-da said: "Satya Bose."</p>  </div>
