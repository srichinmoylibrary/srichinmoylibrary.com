<h2>Question: I would like to ask you how to develop these processes of meditation? For someone who has never done anything like this before, how do you begin?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are an absolute beginner, then you have to start by reading spiritual books, written by spiritual Masters and not by so-called professors and scholars, because the spiritual Masters are offering their own realisation in the form of writing. The scholars and professors, on the other hand, borrow the light from the Masters' writings and, with their mental capacities, they elaborate. So if you study their books, it is like the blind leading the blind, for they have not realised the Truth and they cannot offer the Truth. Whereas the Masters have realised the Truth, and they have the capacity to offer the Truth provided the seeker is willing to receive it the way the Master wants to offer it.</p>
<p>If you study their books, then you will get inspiration. But inspiration is not enough. You will feel the necessity for someone who can guide you in the path of spirituality, because if there is no guidance, you are apt to make mistakes. One is inspired to do something, but that doesn't mean that he will be able to do the thing correctly. I am inspired to run, but if someone has not taught me how to run properly, how to take big strides and how to move my hands and all that, then naturally I will not be able to run fast.</p>
<p>And then, while running, there will come a time when one feels that he has to run in a particular lane. If the runner is constantly changing lanes, then he will be disqualified even though he is running fast. For he is disturbing others, and others are entering into his lane, and there will be calamity. So there is the necessity of a particular lane, a particular path. In the spiritual life, one must choose a path. Otherwise, if one is constantly changing his path — today this path, tomorrow that path, the day after something else — then he is only confusing matters, and he won't be able to run fast.</p>
<p>When you start your journey as an absolute beginner, then you have to read books written by spiritual Masters. Then you have to have guidance from a Master in whom you have faith, and follow his path. If you study with him, then you have to follow his path. If you feel the necessity of individual concentration, individual attention, then you have to get a personal meditation from the Master. The Master will give general meditation instruction in his books; or during his talks he will say, "Make the mind calm and quiet," or he will give secrets of meditation in general. But if you want to become closer to the Master, or if you feel that getting a specific meditation from the Master will help you make fastest progress, you should follow his path.</p>  </div>
