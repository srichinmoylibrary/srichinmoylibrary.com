<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, but we have to know for what purpose â€” for meditation, or for gossip? For my disciples I advise six or seven hours of sleep. Six or seven hours is necessary, but not eight, nine or ten hours.</p>
<p>If you become like me, then after one hour of sleep you can make yourself feel that you have slept for five hours. The clock will say one hour, but your mind and body will say five hours. However, until you have that yogic capacity, six or seven hours is absolutely necessary for you and others. Four or five hours I do not advise. If you cannot get six or seven hours at night, then sleep sometime during the day. During your lunch break eat for ten minutes and then, instead of talking with your colleagues, go into your office and sleep for half an hour or forty-five minutes. That will help.</p>  </div>
