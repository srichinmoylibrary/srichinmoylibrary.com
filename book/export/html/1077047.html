<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> An ocean signifies vastness, immensity. Water signifies consciousness. When we dream of water in the ocean, it means consciousness in its immensity, in its vastness. In the ocean, consciousness is static, whereas in a river, consciousness is dynamic. A river is movement, movement toward the destination. When we dream of a river, we have to feel that consciousness is flowing toward its destination, the sea or the ocean.</p>  </div>
