<p>During our race in Fukuyama, I was running along the one-mile course. I saw Padmasini running about forty metres ahead of me. She was alone.</p>
<p>There was a big stone marking the turn-around point, but she did not go up to the stone. Before reaching it, she just turned around and went back. I thought, "How clever Padmasini is! There is such a big mark at the turn-around point, but she pretends not to see it."</p>
<p>I thought that since nobody was there, she was taking a shortcut. But I did not have the heart to say anything. Afterwards, I found out that she had already finished the race and was just doing some more walking and running.</p>
