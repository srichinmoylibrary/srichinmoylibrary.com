<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yudhisthira represents adherence to truth and piety. Bhima stands for justice. Arjuna shows surrender to God's Will. Nakula expresses faithfulness and beauty manifested in the physical. Sahadeva is known for wisdom-light in his inner and outer actions. Although he was the youngest, he was also the wisest.</p>  </div>
