<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When an accident or something serious is about to take place, your utterance is an expression of your inner cry. At that time you need not repeat the name of the Supreme in a slow, prolonged manner. When danger is approaching, if you repeat 'Supreme' quickly and intensely, there is nothing wrong in it. It is an expression of the soul's cry for immediate intervention of the divine protection.</p>
<p>When one is pronouncing the Supreme's Name, one has to know what the purpose is. At the time of meditation or as part of one's inner spiritual discipline, one has to say it slowly and soulfully. Even then, this does not mean that you have to prolong the word as long as possible. You can say the Name very soulfully with love, reverence and devotion at a normal speed. But in an emergency, when danger is threatening, if 'Supreme' comes from the depths of the heart like an intense cry, then it is also most soulful, although it is fast.</p>  </div>
