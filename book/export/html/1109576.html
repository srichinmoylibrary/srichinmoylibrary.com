<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Familiar in the sense that I have read about them and heard a little about them from some seekers. But I am not in direct contact with other Masters, either inwardly or outwardly. Only I have a close connection with Pir Vilayat Khan, the head of the Sufi order. We are good friends.</p>
<p><em>Examiner:</em> He was here recently.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I think he was. But I have regard for all the sincere spiritual Masters.</p>  </div>
