<p>When we were leaving Narita Airport, in Japan, there was a long delay. We spent three hours in the plane outside the gate. At first they said it was a mechanical problem. After some time, the pilot happened to pass near me. I was absolutely in the first row of executive class. The pilot was very upset. He said, “Nothing is wrong mechanically. Why can’t they tell the truth?”</p>
<p>The truth was that there had been a bomb threat. The airline officials suspected one fellow from Thailand, who was holding a Thai passport. Before we boarded, they had been announcing, “All people who are holding Thai passports must come to the counter immediately.” So something must have happened, and they suspected a passenger holding a Thai passport.</p>
<p>The result was that we had to deplane. They took us back to the Narita View Hotel, where we spent the night.</p>  </div>
