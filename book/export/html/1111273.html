<p>In the afternoon at three o'clock I was running along the street near the turn-off to Guru Stationery. Many children were coming home from school at that time.</p>
<p>A little girl, eight or nine years old, said to a little boy, "Look, look, Shry is running!"</p>
<p>The boy said, "His name is Sri."</p>
<p>The girl said, "He runs like an old man."</p>
<p>The boy said, "He is not old."</p>
<p>The girl said, "But he runs like an old man."</p>
