  <h1 class="book-heading">Pleasing the Master</h1>
  
 
<p>We are living in the world of undivine personality and individuality. An aspirant’s divine personality is his oneness with his Inner Pilot. An aspirant’s divine individuality is the fulfilment of this Inner Pilot through his own life, when his life’s actions become nothing other than the manifestation of the Will of the Inner Pilot.</p>
<p>When the Master tells you to do something, if you do that very thing, then it is as good as real meditation. If he tells you, “Please bring me a glass of water,” at that time do not feel that you will get your realisation by meditating on him and remaining in trance. No! Feel that your realisation at that time depends on your immediately bringing him a glass of water. If you have accepted a Master as your true Guru, then it is by satisfying him, fulfilling him and pleasing him that you fulfil yourself. Right now if he is thirsty and you try to please him by bringing him a flower, then you are making a mistake. Right now he is in need of water. If you say, “A flower will naturally make him happy, because it represents purity and my pure feeling of aspiration,” you are wrong. If you go deep within and look at the Master’s face or just enter into the Master, at that time you will see that the Master is really thirsty. So bringing him water represents your dedication and your feeling of oneness with him. If you do not have faith in your Guru and obedience to him, then you are wasting your precious time and the precious time of your Master by remaining with him.</p>
<p>On the one hand, no disciple has ever truly pleased me. On the other hand, everybody has pleased me. To you it may sound contradictory; to me it is absolutely true. When I see what my disciples are, I am terribly disappointed, terribly disheartened. But when I know what they are eventually going to be — God’s most perfect instruments on earth — I offer them my Eternity’s love, Infinity’s gratitude and Immortality’s pride.</p>
<p>I was in a spiritual Centre and I know much about other spiritual Masters and their disciples. Real Masters are very, very strict with their disciples for five, ten or twenty years. Then there comes a time when they get disgusted they say to their disciples, “Do as you please.” As long as they were serious and took personal interest in their disciples’ progress, they suffered a lot; but at the same time they saw some progress in the disciples. But when they gave up and said, “After all, they are God’s children. Now God can take care of them,” then the disciples’ progress was very slow, almost nothing.</p>
<p>In my case, in every way I try, try, try. Most of the time I try through love. Even when I scold you outwardly, inwardly I show tremendous love. I may scold you and insult you with my human tongue, but with my divine heart I am inundating your whole being with love. No matter how mean I am when I bark at you, you have to stay in the heart. Immediately you will feel the message your heart is receiving from me, although my face or tongue may be offering you a totally different message.</p>
<p>The Master needs something from each of his disciples. He needs not only their feeling of oneness with him as their means of fulfillment, but also the establishment of their oneness with each other, as a family. The Master is the head of the family and he really wants all of his spiritual children to feel that each member is his brother or sister. He wants his disciples to feel the joy and necessity of acting as a unit in God’s manifestation on earth.</p>
<p>Your faith means your devotion. Your devotion means your love for your Master, for the Supreme in him. Your own aspiration plus the Master’s grace and compassion will take you to God. But if you try to exploit his compassion, you are lost. He is doing things the way the Supreme wants him to do them. A disciple should never misunderstand the Master’s compassion. This is like allowing poison to enter into the aspiring heart.</p>  </div>
