<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fear is very bad. This palpitation is very good when it is the result of your inner joy or thrill. If the heart starts palpitating, sometimes it means oneness. But if you become afraid of this experience, then the vital or the mind makes you feel that an unknown guest is entering into your heart. So there should be no fear. If there is fear, then this fear you have to destroy.</p>  </div>
