<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Whether Heaven wants me or not, I am sincerely eager to visit Heaven. I won't remain on earth for a hundred years. In my case, it is out of the question. And, as I have said many, many times, this will be absolutely my last incarnation. God has promised me that I will not have to take any more human incarnations. So this will be my last and last and last incarnation.</p>
<p>But wherever I am, whether in Heaven or elsewhere, I will definitely bless my spiritual children who think of me, who pray to me and who meditate on the Supreme in me. No matter where I am, I will be of devoted, loving service to you all provided you think of me and meditate on the Supreme in me. The physical is not the only reality. But a oneness-life, oneness-heart, oneness-existence, oneness-life breath is of supreme importance.</p>
<p>Wherever I am, my good will, my love and my blessings will always be there for this planet. I shall remain eternally, eternally, eternally grateful to this planet earth, for here my Beloved Supreme, out of His infinite Bounty, has given me the supreme opportunity to serve Him. And I have been trying to serve Him as much as I can in His own Way.</p>  </div>
