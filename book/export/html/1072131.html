<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes! All art, without fail, is an expression of the Supreme’s Beauty. Art is beauty and beauty is art. Art, beauty and joy are like three brothers. When Keats said, “A thing of beauty is a joy for ever,” he was so right because joy is beauty itself. Keats said something else which is also extremely important, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty.” Truth represents the Highest. When Beauty becomes one with Truth, naturally Beauty also becomes the Highest, which is none other than God. Art is God’s creation, God’s expression. When you think of art and God’s Beauty, you will see that they are like the obverse and reverse of the same coin: they are inseparable.</p>  </div>
