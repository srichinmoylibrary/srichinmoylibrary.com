    <title>&lt;em&gt;Donna Halper:&lt;/em&gt; There are so many people seeking, trying to find out about religion. They don&#039;t feel satisfied with organised religion, let us say, so they come to you. How would they know whether or not you are the right spiritual Master for them?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They will be able to discover this in a few minutes' time. As soon as they see me if I am meant for them they will get a kind of vibration a kind of familiar feeling. They don't have to talk to me. They will feel an inner communication. They will see and feel in me a friend a true and eternal friend.</p>  </div>
