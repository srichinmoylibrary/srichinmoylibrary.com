<p><em>(While the song was performed, Sri Chinmoy offered a gift to Mr. Matsumoto and, in return, Mr. Matsumoto presented a plaque to Sri Chinmoy.)</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Matsumoto:</em> Thank you very much. I am very grateful. Before I left for Shikoku, a friend of mine told me about a man who lives in the heart as I do, and my friend invited me to go to a concert to see this man. While Sri Chinmoy performed on 10 different instruments at Bunka Geijutsu Kaikan Hall, I was deeply moved. It was a most mystical experience for me.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I feel that the lives of the Japanese people are maybe a little too hectic and a little too busy. It is necessary for us to meditate inwardly once in a while to transform ourselves.</p>
<p>I am truly delighted to have Sri Chinmoy here with us as our special guest today. Transcending all nationalities, we are one in heart and soul.</p>  </div>
