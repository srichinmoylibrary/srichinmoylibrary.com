<p>Soul, my sweet soul,<br /> Why are you in tears?<br /> Is it because, of late,<br /> I have been welcoming death?<br /> Is it because, of late,<br /> Ceaseless suffering has conquered me,<br /> My all?</p>
<p>The following thirty-seven poems were written on 1 November 1979 while en route from London to New York</p>
