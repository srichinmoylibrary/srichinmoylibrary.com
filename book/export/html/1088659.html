<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can best please me by not doing the things that stand in the way of your pleasing me. If you are angry with your sister, feel that naturally this anger will enter into your Guru's heart. Think that this anger will immediately have a painful effect on my heart. Then immediately you will conquer your anger. Always do the thing that will not hurt me or harm me. You will please me most by not doing the wrong thing.</p>  </div>
