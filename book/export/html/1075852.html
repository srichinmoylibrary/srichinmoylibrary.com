<h2>Three dramatic scenes from <em>The Descent of the Blue</em></h2>

<p><em>When Sri Chinmoy was between twenty-six and twenty-eight years old, he wrote a full-length drama about the life of Sri Aurobindo entitled</em> The Descent of the Blue. <em>Three scenes in this play focus on C. R. Das and his historic defence of Sri Aurobindo, as well as his later urge to follow the spiritual life. This play was published serially between 1958 and 1962 in the</em> Mother India.</p>  </div>
