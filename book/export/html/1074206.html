<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First you. You are the first, and the absolute second is B. Third is C. These are all, all, all, all angels. When a mother tells you about her children, she makes you feel that they are all angels. It is because of her love. We are all angels, if we really lead a better life.</p>  </div>
