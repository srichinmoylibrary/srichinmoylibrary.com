<p>The T-shirt that I gave Pulak this morning says, “I may not be smart, but I can lift heavy things.” In Hawaii, one of the saleswomen in a weightlifting store was wearing it. I asked her if I could buy one like that, and she said, “Yes, but we only have extra large.”</p>
<p>I said, “I need a large. Extra large will be too big for me.”</p>
<p>She said, “No, no, you take the extra large. You are on your way.”</p>
<p>Another store had only small and medium T-shirts. When I asked for a large, the lady said, “We only have small and medium, but a medium will fit you.”</p>
<p>So each store had its own story to tell. One said I am on my way to extra large,and the other said I am definitely a medium.</p>
