<p>In June 1991 I went to International Falls for a special ceremony. The mayors of Fort Francis and International Falls, two towns on the border between America and Canada, declared that the train that runs between them would be a Sri Chinmoy Peace Train. The General Manager of the Railway was also there. It was the fulfilment of my childhood dream to follow in the footsteps of my father, who was the main inspector of the Assam-Bengal railway line.</p>
<p>At 5:30 in the morning on the day of the ceremony, my father, my mother, my brother, two sisters and two of my friends all came to me in the hotel room where I was staying. All of them are now in the soul’s world. My father was so happy, so proud. Together we were enjoying our hearts’ fulness-delight. We were having a long conversation, but my mother remained silent. When my father comes, she does not speak. She is full of devotion, so she does not open her mouth. But when my mother comes alone, she talks and talks.</p>
<p>How happy we were on that day, for trains are in the life-blood of our family.</p>  </div>
