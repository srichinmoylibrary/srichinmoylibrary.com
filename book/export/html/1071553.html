<p>Two disciples were meditating in front of their Master. The Master's eyes were wide open and he was looking soulfully at one of the disciples. He was not looking at the other disciple at all. But this other disciple was still gazing at the Master most devotedly with folded hands.</p>
<p>The disciple on whom the Master was meditating assumed that the Master was ignoring the other disciple because that person was very bad. He became angry that such an undivine fellow was even being allowed to meditate in front of the Master. This is what was going on in the mind of the disciple on whom the Master was intensely meditating.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other disciple was thinking, "Master, I am so grateful to you for looking at him and not at me. You are teaching me how to conquer my jealousy. In your presence, I have no jealousy. So I am sending you my gratitude for looking at him."</p>
<p>When the meditation was over, the Master stood up from his chair and went over to the second disciple and blessed him. "You have shown me what gratitude is," the Master said. "Even though I did not look at you, you remained in a soulful and devoted consciousness." Then the Master scolded the first disciple mercilessly because he had become so proud and haughty.</p>  </div>
