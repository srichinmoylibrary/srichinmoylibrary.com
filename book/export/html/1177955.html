<p>My mind does not want to remember<br /> How much God has done for it<br /> Although God blesses its breath<br /> Time and again, unconditionally.</p>
<p>My heart does not want to remember<br /> How much it has done for God<br /> Although it serves God every day<br /> Devotedly, soulfully and unreservedly.</p>
