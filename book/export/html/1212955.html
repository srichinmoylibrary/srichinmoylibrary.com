<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, I have been thinking of asking you a most significant, yet silly question. Please tell me, what is God’s <em>cognomen</em>?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, God’s <em>surname</em> is Compassion and His middle name is Justice. When His Justice fails, His Compassion works. When His Compassion fails, His Justice works. To deal with a non-aspirant He uses His Justice first, and then, if necessity demands, He uses His Compassion. To deal with an aspirant He uses His Compassion first, and then, if necessity demands, He uses His Justice.</p>  </div>
