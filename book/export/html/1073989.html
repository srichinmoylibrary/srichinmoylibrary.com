<p>It is a very happy day for me today, for today I have decided that I shall not continue to live with my false confidence — my false confidence that I can destroy the world, the entire world. From today on I shall live only with real confidence. My real confidence is this: I shall serve my Beloved Supreme to transform this world into perfect Perfection — a world that will not see the faces of insecurity and impurity, two unforgivable forces that are not allowing this beautiful world of ours to be absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>When insecurity captures my heart, I shall immediately declare: “Larger than the largest am I. Larger than the universe am I.” When impurity captures my life, I shall immediately declare: “I am oneness, universal oneness, within and without.”</p>  </div>
