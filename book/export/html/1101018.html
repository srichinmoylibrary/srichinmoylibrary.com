MHDI 74-83. These questions were answered by Sri Chinmoy on 1 April 2006 at P.S. 117 in Jamaica, New York.</p>
<h2>Question: When I meditate, sometimes I can almost get my mind to stop, but then there will be some song going through my mind. It could be one of your songs or some other song that I knew a long time ago. I wish I knew a way of making that stop.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why? If you have had a good meditation, the song will only help you. In your case, they are spiritual songs, soulful songs, so you should be very, very happy. You are lucky. They are not vital, emotional songs â€” no! If you are hearing soulful, inspiring songs, then you should cherish them. Instead of getting rid of them, you should cherish them. That is a very good experience. The thing that is going to help you, you should value. It is very good to cherish the songs.</p>  </div>
