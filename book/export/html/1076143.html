<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, the only thing is that the forces have to see your total disgust for them. They have to feel that you sincerely mean it. They have to see that you really don’t want them, that they have played their role. But so long as they have a little hope that you will invite them in, they will keep coming back. Unconsciously you get a kind of pleasure, an unconscious pleasure, when they come, and that unconscious pleasure the forces notice. Then they go on attacking, attacking. But when you are moving them out of your system, they have to feel that you really don’t want them anymore. And if they aren’t there, that is the proof that you people have succeeded. People <em>have</em> realised God. People have realised the Light just by removing these bad forces.</p>  </div>
