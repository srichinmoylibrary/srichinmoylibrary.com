<p>A sleepless self-giver<br /> Is another name<br /> For God's Victory-Banner.</p>
<p>A sleepless self-giver<br /> Is God's Victory-Banner-carrier.<br /> A sleepless self-giver<br /> Is God's Dream-fulfiller.<br /> A sleepless self-giver<br /> Is God's creation-transformer.<br /> A sleepless self-giver<br /> Is God's Heart-biographer.<br /> A sleepless self-giver<br /> Is God's Life-publisher.<br /> A sleepless self-giver<br /> Is God's Breath-giver.</p>
<p>Although there have been few,<br /> Very few in number,<br /> Mother-Earth is extremely happy<br /> To have such sleepless self-givers.<br /> Give; you become.<br /> Give; you are.<br /> Do not give; you are lost.<br /> Do not give; you are dead.<br /> Give and give and give<br /> Only to the Supreme in humanity.</p>
