<p>This is a story about your Guru, about what kind of opportunist he is. In Mazatlan every day my mantra was that nobody should follow me when I went to the market. Everybody listened, but sometimes unconsciously people made mistakes.</p>
<p>One day, after I said that nobody should follow me, whom did I see in the market? Nayana! So I gave her an undivine look and she disappeared.</p>
<p>Then I bought something for Kanan's singing group. Just then I saw Hashi, and I gave her a very divine look. Do you know why? So that I could give her the things that I had bought. After I handed her the packages, I said, "Now, go away!" Then again I didn't let anybody come near me.</p>  </div>
