<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, that is what I do. Emanations do this many, many times. At night when I am doing other things my emanations may do this. But if they want to show themselves, they can. Sometimes out of compassion I may want to show my emanations to the disciples. These emanations may take a long face or a round face. One time five years ago I went to someone and intentionally changed my figure into a very tall being. That disciple said I looked solid and she was 100 per cent certain it was me. She saw me not in this form but in another and she was right.</p>  </div>
