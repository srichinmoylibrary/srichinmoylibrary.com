<p><em>On 20 August 1988, Sudhahota came to Victory Field in Queens, where Sri Chinmoy and his students were holding their annual Sports Day Competition. Sri Chinmoy and Sudhahota competed against each another in the 100 metres, with the Olympic athlete race-walking while the spiritual teacher ran. (Sudhahota won.) Sri Chinmoy also lifted Sudhahota with one arm as part of his “Lifting up the World with a Oneness-Heart” programme. The champion athlete stood on a specially built platform, which was several feet off the ground, and the Master then lifted the platform above his head. The “Lifting up the World with a Oneness-Heart” programme honours men and women of inspiration and dedication around the world.</em></p>
<p><em>During the day, several of Sri Chinmoy’s students asked Sudhahota questions.</em></p>  </div>
