<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I sincerely pray to God for the fulfilment of God's Will, then my prayer is bound to teach me how to see good realities in every human being. If each tradition hungers for God's Love and Light, then everything that is good will come to the fore for the betterment of the world.</p>
<p>Today we see good qualities in others. If we appreciate them unreservedly, then those good qualities try to blossom inside our own life like a lotus—slowly, steadily and unerringly.</p>
<p>Without prayer and without meditation, it is almost impossible to appreciate good qualities in others and not be ruthlessly attacked by jealousy-snake.</p>
<p>Each tradition is right in its own way. We need a cosmopolitan heart to appreciate, admire and value all the traditions and to become a world citizen — inspiring, encouraging, illumining and fulfilling each tradition.</p>  </div>
