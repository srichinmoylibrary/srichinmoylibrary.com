<p>My morning Lord, since I have teeming doubts, anxieties, worries and fears in my mind-forest, how can I see Your morning Beauty's Heart-Garden?</p>

<p>"My morning child, do not think of your inadequacy; do not think of your incapacity. Just pray to Me to bless you with morning humility. It is in and through your morning humility that I shall be able not only to show you My morning Beauty's Heart-Garden but also to help you grow into My morning Beauty's Heart-Garden."</p>
