  <h1 class="book-heading">The knish temptation</h1>
  
 
<p>Then I walked about 200 metres. Just past the courthouse, I saw another vendor. I was still drinking from the first can. I had not finished even half. But I threw it into the garbage bin and went up to the second vendor. I said to myself, "Today I am in the world of amusement, so let me have another experience!"</p>
<p>This vendor was short, about forty years old and he had a moustache. He was very polite and from his accent I knew that he was Puerto Rican. I asked him the same question: "Do you have Diet Snapple?"</p>
<p>Very politely, he said, "Yes, we have." He charged me $1.30 — fifteen cents less than the previous one. He was so kind and polite. Then I noticed that he was also selling knishes. Knishes have become my most favourite snack. An argument was going on inside my mind whether to buy one.</p>
<p>Temptation and greed were on one side and my stupid diet was on the other. I was saying to myself, "In the morning I took a knish, now again I have to do it? Tomorrow I will feel miserable when I get on the scale. Yesterday I took a knish after eight o'clock at night and I gained weight, so today I promised that after four o'clock I would not eat anything. Now it is already after four o'clock." Then my greed and temptation would say, "Who cares if tomorrow I gain one pound?"</p>
<p>The argument was going this side and that side. I felt miserable. Finally my diet won. I had to be content with my Snapple. This time I drank the whole can.</p>
