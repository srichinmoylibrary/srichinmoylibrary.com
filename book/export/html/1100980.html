<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Daily, at least five times for three or four minutes, each time you breathe in, consciously try to have intensity. Try to feel you are breathing in intensity, intensity, intensity when you pray to the Supreme. Breathe in and breathe out as slowly as possible, and then feel that that intensity is coming into you. It has entered into your heart and into all your nerves and muscles.</p>  </div>
