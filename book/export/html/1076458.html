<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has form and again God is formless. God is both with attributes and without attributes. God is masculine and again, God is feminine. According to Indian philosophy, God is neither masculine nor feminine but neuter. This neuter God we call “Brahma.” God has countless forms and faces.</p>
<p>But we are like children. A child likes to call his father “daddy.” He has no need to call his father any other name. Yet the father’s friends call him by another name, and his relatives also call him by a different name. Those at the office may call him by yet another name. Nonetheless he is the same man.</p>
<p>Similarly, each aspirant has his own name by which he calls God. It is a matter of personal preference and in my case, it is not that by referring to God as “He” I am denying that God is also the Divine Mother. Far from it. God is the Mother. God is the Father. God is Light. God is Peace. God is Infinite Energy. When I refer to God as “He”, I am not taking anything away from God. Like the child calling the father, God will come with all that He is, no matter if I call Him Father, Mother or Brahma. God will not mind. He simply comes to answer His child’s call and that is all.</p>  </div>
