<p>In one store I saw a beautiful stuffed animal, but I could not figure out if it was a cow or a dog. It had a bell around the neck. I was going to buy it for Samarpana.</p>
<p>Before I bought it, I said to one of the salesladies, "I like it very much; it is white and very nice. But is it a cow?"</p>
<p>She laughed at me and said, "No, a dog!"</p>
<p>It was very beautiful, and it looked like a cow.</p>
