<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now, many people do not yet believe in the inner power, or the inner world. They feel that the outer power or the outer world is everything. No. Only because of the inner life, the soul, does the outer life exist.</p>
<p>Through prayer and meditation, one has to bring the inner power or capacity to the fore. Ignorance stands in front of us, but if determination and aspiration join together, these two friends can definitely help us in the battlefield of life.</p>
<p>Among the professional weightlifters, there are now people who feel the existence of inner power, or something that can be called the soul, and they believe that this inner power, or soul, is helping their bodybuilding or their weightlifting.</p>  </div>
