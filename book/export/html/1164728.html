<p><em>(Utanka is very thirsty, and there is no pure water in the house. He invokes Krishna.)</em></p>
<p>UTANKA: O Krishna, fulfil your promise. I need water, pure water. Let me see if you come, or how the water will come.</p>
<p><em>(Immediately, a Chandala (undertaker) comes forward with a glass of water and offers it to Utanka.)</em></p>
<p>UTANKA: You untouchable! How dare you come to me with water! True, I am thirsty, but I will never take water from an untouchable. Get away from here! I don't need you. I will die of thirst before I drink anything that you have touched.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Chandala)</em></p>
<p>UTANKA: O Krishna! You rogue! True, I wanted water. I am practically dying of thirst, but did you have to send an undertaker, an untouchable, with my water? This is how you insult me. I don't need that kind of water. Either bring me the water yourself, or I don't need any water from you. I shall manage my life as I did before you gave me that boon, you rogue. <em>(Enter Krishna.)</em> Krishna, you didn't keep your promise. You didn't give me water, at least not pure water that I could drink.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Water! I sent Indra himself to you, not with water, but with divine nectar.</p>
<p>UTANKA: Indra?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Yes, in the garb of a Chandala. He wanted to test you, to see whether you have conquered the feeling of superiority and inferiority, purity and impurity, whether you have gone beyond that after having seen my Universal Form.</p>
<p>UTANKA: You know, Krishna, that I am a Brahmin. I thought that he was a Chandala. He came in that garb. How can I drink water from a Chandala? Why did he deceive me?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: He did not deceive you, Utanka. He came to see whether you had really gone beyond caste. Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra and Chandala all go together. They are all in the Heart of God, in the Heart of the Supreme.</p>
<p>UTANKA: O Krishna, forgive me. Now it is too late. What am I going to do? What can I do?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Utanka, I have forgiven you. From now on whenever you are in need of water, you will be supplied with water in another way. You invoke me and with my occult power, I shall form clouds in the sky and cause rain. Then you will have no dearth of water. This plot of land will always have enough water. And the clouds that form in the sky will be called <em>Utanka megh</em> from now on. In the future, those who stay in this land, when they see these rain clouds, will call them <em>Utanka.</em></p>
<p>UTANKA: Krishna, you are all forgiveness. You are a constant miracle. You are constant joy. You are constant fulfilment. This ungrateful heart of mine is at your compassionate feet.</p>  </div>
