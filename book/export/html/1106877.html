    <title>&lt;em&gt;Mrs. Marcantonio:&lt;/em&gt; Yes. My husband and I talk about you all the time because we have so much to be grateful for. Marc is not a young boy; he is a man and few mothers have grown sons who come to them with smiling faces. You brought him back to God. When he was a youngster he was religious, but then he drifted away. But you brought that all back. I have so much to be thankful for and I am also speaking for my husband. Thank you. Thank you.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I shall eternally remain grateful to you. What you are saying is coming from the inmost recesses of your heart, your true reality-existence. I have not taken anyone away from you. In the inner world, you are helping your son beyond your imagination. When you identify with his happiness, it is most helpful, for your happiness is your encouragement to your son. And in your encouragement you are helping your son do the right thing. Not only human beings, but also God Himself becomes happy in His children's happiness. If He sees that the members of His family are happy, then there is nothing else needed.</p>
<p>I am extremely grateful to all the mothers who are present. As a token of my appreciation and smiling oneness with your aspiring hearts, and with my blessingful heart's soulful appreciation of your sons, who are our true manifested joy here on earth, I wish to offer some gifts for the mothers.</p>  </div>
