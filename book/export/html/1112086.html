<p>When I had walked only two or three hundred metres, one of the scorers said I was not straightening my legs properly. There were two judges — the supreme judge, who would throw people out of the race, and another man. A girl who was the assistant to one of the judges was telling him about me, saying, "He is not walking properly."</p>
<p>The big shot said, "Don't bother him!" He knew I was last. If you are last, why do you have to get a warning?</p>
<p>Later, the judge introduced himself to me. His name was Howard Jacobson. He was the one who organised the race.</p>
