<p>Today I was watching Pulak when I was walking. When I walk, people are running so fast. The other day how fast Nilima was running in the street. She was getting ready for the marathon. From time to time I see Natabara. He also runs quite fast. Chandika I never see running. I am killing myself, but she is always in the car. I have also seen Nemi and Jyotsna in the car. Bruce is the best! When I see Bruce, he says "Guru" quite a few times very loudly and then for forty or fifty metres he goes on honking.</p>
