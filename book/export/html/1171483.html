<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The inner beauty of Hawaii has not surrendered to the outer opulence and outer grandeur of America. Outwardly Hawaii is a state. Therefore all the good qualities and bad qualities of the other states have entered into Hawaii. At the same time, Hawaii's own good qualities are drawing tourists from all over the world. But there is a very subtle, delicate, inspiring and aspiring beauty which Hawaii has. This divine beauty Hawaii has not surrendered to America or any other state. As soon as you enter into the soul of Hawaii, you see that this pristine beauty, serenity and many other divine qualities are untouched. They have not been destroyed by the rest of America or by any other part of the world.</p>  </div>
