<p>If you want to make the fastest progress, then the first thing that is required is a normal, balanced life. There are many things that a mad person does, but you must not do anything that is abnormal. You are an aspirant, a seeker. You cannot do the kind of things that mad or insane people do.</p>
<p>There is a great difference between a seeker and an unaspiring person. The ultimate aim of a seeker is to realise God. If your aim is to realise God, and if you want to make the fastest progress, then the first thing which you must have in your life is simplicity. If you feel that you don't have enough simplicity, then you have to cultivate it.</p>
<p>After simplicity, you have to have sincerity. If you feel that you are not sincere to yourself or to God, then immediately you have to become more sincere. Gradually you have to be absolutely simple, absolutely sincere in your life. After simplicity and after sincerity comes love. You will come to realise that the love that you have for God now is not enough. I am not saying that you don't have any love for God at all. But you have to have more of everything. You have to have more simplicity, more sincerity, more love, more devotion and more surrender. Then, a day will come when this kind of measurement will stop. There will be no more comparison: much, more, most. You will simply be complete. Your simplicity will be complete; your sincerity will be complete; your love will be complete; your devotion will be complete; and your surrender will be complete. When you are complete, you will make the fastest progress.</p>  </div>
