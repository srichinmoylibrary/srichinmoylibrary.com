<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, I must admit that you are a spiritual lion. Tell me one thing: what is the thing that you are doing wrong which <em>enervates</em> you after you have had a long meditation?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, nothing actually takes away my strength before, during or after a long meditation. To me, meditation is all energy and all life. It is the wild resistance from the unlit vital of some of my disciples and the opposition of the unaspiring earth-consciousness that <em>weakens</em> my human body when I bring down light into my disciplesâ€™ obscure, unaspiring and resisting natures.</p>  </div>
