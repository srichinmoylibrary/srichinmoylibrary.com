<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Universal Consciousness gets them. But the only thing is, disciples have an endless reservoir. This morning we empty the dustbin and then in five minutes again it is the same mess. Every day it is being emptied by my loving concern, and every day it is being filled by the same undivine forces â€” the same, same, same. If I can empty the dark forces from your life and they do not return, then you are on the verge of transformation.</p>  </div>
