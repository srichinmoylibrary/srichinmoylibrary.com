<h2>Question: Do high souls who were liberated in a previous incarnation also have to struggle with doubt?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Doubt is an almost incurable disease. Unless and until one has realised the highest Truth, there is every possibility that doubt may enter. Many spiritual seekers, even while they are making very fast spiritual progress or after having covered a long way in the spiritual life, fall victim to doubt. But once realisation has taken place, doubt is banished from our life for good.</p>  </div>
