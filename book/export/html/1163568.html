<p>Death, please illumine me.<br /> Some people are killed<br /> While defending their own country<br /> When they come to you,<br /> What do you do with them?</p>
<p>"When they come to me,<br /> I bless them and bless them.<br /> I embrace them and embrace them<br /> Until they are tired of my embrace."</p>
<p>And what about those<br /> Who are killed<br /> While attacking another country<br /> And killing its people?<br /> My question is,<br /> What do you do with those aggressors?</p>
<p>"Aggressors? I hate them,<br /> I literally hate them!<br /> I hate them to the same extent<br /> That I hate Satan.<br /> And when they come to me,<br /> I turn them all<br /> Into a huge football<br /> And kick them and kick them<br /> With all the strength of my Thunder-Feet,<br /> Until I am completely exhausted!"</p>
