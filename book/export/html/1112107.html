  <h1 class="book-heading">Senani running in Japan</h1>
  
 
<p>Four or five times in Japan I saw Senani running. When I see somebody who is older than I am jogging and running, it gives me such joy and inspiration. I can only walk and limp; but he is so tall and his strides are so long. I was admiring him from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>When elderly people run or do physical exercise, it inspires the younger generation. In the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Nolini started running again after turning 65. Some of you people are 28 or 29, but you are acting as if you were ancient.</p>
<p>Those who do physical activity give me immense joy, and those who do not take exercise have to develop a new heart to feel my sadness.</p>
