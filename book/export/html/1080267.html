<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Neither you nor I will be alive in three hundred years. So, why worry about three hundred years from now? We see how little progress we have made in three thousand or four thousand years, so how can we expect to be perfect in three hundred years? It is not possible for that kind of progress to be made in three hundred years; it is simply absurd. In order to make progress, we must have tremendous devoted love. God knows how many years it will take: perhaps three million years. Thinking about these things does not help you; it only feeds your curiosity. What is happening in your present life is what is important. As a seeker, you must think only of your immediate progress: today's progress and tomorrow's progress.</p>  </div>
