<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It may take you four or more visits to my Centre to decide whether I am your spiritual Master or not. But for me, it is a matter of a few seconds to determine if I will accept you or not. I donâ€™t find it difficult to accept seekers, but for the seekers to accept me is often quite difficult. They will first judge me and test me. But if I allow too long for them to decide, then I will be in difficulty.</p>  </div>
