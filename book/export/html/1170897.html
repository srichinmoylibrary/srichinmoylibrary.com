  <h1 class="book-heading">Interviewer: Do you play basketball?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In India I used to play basketball. Now I practise taking free throws from the penalty line. Usually I throw a hundred times, and then I take a little rest before throwing another hundred times. I practise on a regular basis when the weather permits it. My highest score is 79.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> No kidding â€” 79 out of 100!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In India I also played soccer. For many years I was captain of the soccer team in our spiritual community. I was also a volleyball captain and instructor. Here in New York I have played tennis. Some great tennis players have been very kind to me. They have come and played with me here at our court in Queens. Monica Seles, Steffi Graf, Ilie Nastase and Ramesh Krishnan came at different times to encourage me. After playing a few sets, I lifted each of them with one arm using a special apparatus. I have lifted people from many walks of life, and they all got joy. We call the programme <em>Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart.</em> These world-citizens are great in their own fields, so I have honoured them in my own way. In India, whenever people do something great, they are lifted up on the shoulders of their colleagues.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> So this has a symbolic meaning?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is symbolic.</p>  </div>
