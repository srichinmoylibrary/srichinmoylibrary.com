<p>Death, how often do you speak to Satan?<br /> "I never speak to Satan.<br /> I hate him!<br /> I hate his brutality;<br /> I hate his ignorance-existence-reality.<br /> He is just impossible!"<br /> Why, Death, why?</p>
<p>"You know why.<br /> I love both Heaven and earth.<br /> I love Heaven's flower of beauty.<br /> I love earth's fruit of duty.</p>
<p>"Rascal Satan is always eager<br /> To destroy the flower of God's own Heaven<br /> And the fruit of God's own earth.<br /> One day I shall conquer Satan.<br /> I shall devour Satan.<br /> And then I and my Dream-boat shall enjoy <br /> God the Beauty,<br /> And I and my Reality-shore<br /> Shall enjoy God the Duty,<br /> Unreservedly and eternally."</p>
