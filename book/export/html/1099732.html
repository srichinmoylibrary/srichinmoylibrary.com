<p>On December 25th, 1974, Sri Chinmoy’s disciples honoured his achievement of writing two hundred books in the ten years since he had come to the West. Standing before a complete display of his literary works, Sri Chinmoy gave a long talk about his writings in which he mentioned for the first time his father’s soulful request that he eventually write one thousand books.</p>  </div>
