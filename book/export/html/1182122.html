<p>You want to advise God<br /> About how to change the world.<br /> Do you think you can give Him<br /> A few more years<br /> And see if He is making<br /> This world of His better?<br /> In the meantime,<br /> Can you not change your own life<br /> For the better,<br /> So that God can start<br /> His World-Perfection-Life<br /> In and through you?</p>
