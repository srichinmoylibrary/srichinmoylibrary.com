<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A curse has power if someone has accumulated power in it. If a spiritual Master who has power curses you, it can really be dangerous. The Vedic Seers used to curse right and left. They developed power by practising austerities. This power they could use to build something; again, they could use it through their eyes to destroy someone or liberate someone. If someone curses you outwardly, only the mouth is the instrument; but they could have used their eyes, which are quite powerful.</p>  </div>
