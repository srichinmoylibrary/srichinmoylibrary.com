<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> After you have chosen the path, once you are sure of your path, it is the Master's responsibility to tell you what you should do and what you should not do. But the choice lies with you in the beginning. You have to decide whether that path or that Master is meant for you. Once you have chosen a path, then it is the responsibility of the Master to give you a specific meditation, or to inspire you inwardly. He may not speak to you, he may not be physically in front of you, but he will have an inner communion with you. He will have a free access to your soul and your soul will have a free access to his soul. He will be able to tell your soul how to guide you and mould you in both your outer and your inner life. The Master is fully responsible for you only when a mutual commitment has been made by your soul and by the Master. But the Master is not fully responsible for someone who has joined his path on a trial basis. If the Master makes a commitment at that time, he will be misunderstood. Immediately the seeker will find some motive behind the Master's acceptance. He will say, "Oh, I am a great singer," or "I come from a very rich family; that is why the Master needs me." This kind of wrong idea will enter into the mind of the seeker.</p>  </div>
