<p>I was typing in the flower-room when Nolini-da came up to me and said: "Chinmoy, fifty years ago one of my toes was badly injured while I was playing football, but I recovered. Once I recovered, there was no pain at all, but now it seems that the pain has come back and I can't do athletics anymore."</p>
<p>I said to him: "Nolini-da, it seems your body does not want you to participate anymore in athletic competition."</p>
<p>"I see, I see. Chinmoy, I know that you are not going to participate in athletics this year; you have had enough of it. But you must practise every day without fail to keep your body fit."</p>
<p>"I do that. Prahllad is my witness."</p>
<p>"I don't need your best friend to support your case. I believe you. You know, Chinmoy, I don't like to participate in athletics anymore either, but there are various reasons why I still have to."</p>
<p>I said: "I fully understand that."</p>
<p>He said: "I am glad that you understand it."</p>  </div>
