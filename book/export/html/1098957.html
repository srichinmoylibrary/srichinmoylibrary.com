<p>Four or five years ago, Sanatan was in that part of Brooklyn looking for something and he happened to go into that printing shop. A young man was working there. He was Mr. Custer’s son. When Sanatan told him my name, he said, “I remember him.”</p>
<p>Sanatan came back and told me that he had found my first printer. I could not believe it. After so many years! Sanatan took me there to see the place. It was exactly the same, and across the street the flower shop was still there.</p>
<p>I went inside the printing shop and immediately the son recognised me. His father had by that time passed away. I said to the son, “Now that I have seen you, I want to print one of my books here.”</p>
<p>He said, “Yes, of course. I know how much my father loved you. I will do the job at a very cheap price.”</p>
<p>I said, “Ask any price. I remember your father so well. He had such affection for me.”</p>
<p>So he printed one book.</p>  </div>
