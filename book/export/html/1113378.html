<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can constantly feel that you are a warrior fighting on my side against ignorance provided you remember the inner assurance that I have repeatedly made to you. I have repeatedly offered you the inner assurance that your victory and my victory is not our victory, but the Victory of our Beloved Supreme. Him to please in His own way, we who are in this boat have come into the world. At every moment, if you can think that He is not only your journey's Goal, but also your journey's Start and Course, then you will easily feel that you are a warrior fighting on my side against ignorance-night.</p>  </div>
