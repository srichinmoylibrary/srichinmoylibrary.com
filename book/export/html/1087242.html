<p>I had such a fight while trying to buy yo-yos. The yo-yos had a light in them and were so nice. I wanted to buy them for the young singing girls. I said one price, but the man wouldn't come down. Then I said another price, but still he wouldn't come down. I tried a third time, but then I had to surrender. After failing three times, I had to buy at his price.</p>
