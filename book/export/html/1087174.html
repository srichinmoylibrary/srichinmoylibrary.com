<p>In Bombay I went to buy more handkerchiefs. While in the store, I told the shopkeeper about the man who tempted me with extra handkerchiefs in Calcutta.The Bombay shopkeeper used undivine words about the fellow in that story. Then he asked me where I came from. I said, "I am from Bengal, but I live in America."</p>
<p>He said, "My son lives in Manhattan."</p>
<p>I said, "Tell me your son's name. In Manhattan many people know me."</p>
<p>He said, "My son is not leading a good life, so I do not want to give you his name."</p>
<p>I said, "You can tell him about me."</p>
<p>He said, "You seem to be a very nice man. I don't want to tell you his name, and I don't want to tell him your name."</p>
<p>Then I bought the handkerchiefs from him. The price was cheaper than what I had paid the man in Calcutta who gave me only one extra.</p>
