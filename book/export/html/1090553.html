<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You will please sit in your room quietly for five or ten minutes every morning. When any thought comes into your mind, just kill it. Just reject all the thoughts that are coming to you. They will come and touch you, but you will not allow them to stay. For just five minutes, just be a blank mind ... no thought.</p>
<p>Now, normally we do not hear the beating of the heart because we are not conscious of it. But try to hear it for one minute. Do not be afraid of the sound of the heart's palpitation. Listen to it. Immediately it will come in to offer a word or message. This message is coming from God Himself to you through your heart.</p>  </div>
