<p>“My friend has been through married life. He knows who can please him. His first wife did not please him because she was anything but divine, but in me he has found his true partner. That means he and I will really be happy. But the Master won’t allow us to become one. The Master feels that there can be no happiness based on human love. Why did God give us the human body if human love is meaningless and useless?</p>
<p>“And I curse the Master because he has brainwashed my future husband and made him feel that only God satisfies mankind and not any human being. I don’t need his path. I wanted to please him in his own way always. I am glad that I did not please him in his own way. If I had done that, today I would really have become crazy. I want to retain the little sanity that I have.”</p>
<p>This is what this young woman thought, and she left the Master.</p>  </div>
