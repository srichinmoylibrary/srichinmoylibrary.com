<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good! This dream meant that it was necessary for you to accept life powerfully and courageously. You had entered into a new life, and there was a subtle fear in you. So it was tremendous energy that I was pouring into you in this dream. This energy was entering into you and, at the same time, like a magnet it was pulling you. Through my concentration I made a conscious entrance into your soul so that you would not have fear. It was necessary for you to be powerful and dynamic so that you could get a bumper crop of Truth, Light and Bliss in your new life.</p>  </div>
