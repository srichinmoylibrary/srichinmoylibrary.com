<p>Squirrel, my squirrel,<br /> You served the Lord Rama<br /> With your devoted service.<br /> You carried grains of sand<br /> While he was building<br /> His famous bridge<br /> To fight against Ravana,<br /> The force undivine.<br /> He has made you immortal.<br /> You carry his name<br /> On your heart.<br /> Your service-glory<br /> Is far beyond the death-dart.</p>
