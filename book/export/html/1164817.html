<p><em>Sri Chinmoy's Dedication of his Poland Peace Concert to President Gorbachev</em></p>
<p><em>21 March 1992</em></p>
<p><em>Palac Kultury, Warsaw, Poland</em></p>
<p>Today's Peace Concert I am most lovingly and most devotedly dedicating to President Gorbachev. He is the Himalayan Freedom-Peace-Seeker, Freedom-Peace-Lover and Freedom-Peace-Giver.</p>
<p>On July 11, 1988 he gave a most significant speech before the Polish Parliament. I wish to quote from his most encouraging, most illumining and most fulfilling utterance:</p>
<p>"To conclude, please allow me from this high platform to convey my best wishes to the workers of Poland and the whole Polish people. We wish you, dear friends, tremendous success in all your activities and initiatives which are aimed at the welfare of the people of Poland and the socialist renewal of your homeland."</p>  </div>
