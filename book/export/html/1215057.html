<p>Sons of God have come at different times to perform God’s work, but they are all God’s children. We don’t have to differentiate between them. In this incarnation you have a name and in your previous incarnation you had another name. Even in this incarnation your mother calls you by one name, your husband or wife by some other name, your children by another and your friends by still another. You are the same person but people approach you in different ways. Similarly, although you play different roles in your various incarnations, your soul or spirit is always the same. Likewise the Christ’s spirit, Lord Buddha’s spirit, Sri Ramakrishna’s spirit, your spirit, my spirit, everybody’s spirit is the same, but the forms are different. God is the universal Spirit, but He is assuming different forms for the sake of manifestation.</p>
<p>Now you have to know that the one Spirit is all pervading but when it takes an individual form, when a soul enters into the world-play, it has to manifest its own inner divinity. The Christ manifested his inner divinity, Sri Ramakrishna manifested it, the other spiritual Masters manifested it. But still we have not manifested it. That is, we all embody God; but when spiritual Masters take the human form, they embody God in a special way. Sri Krishna was a great spiritual Master and in his case he not only embodied but also revealed and manifested God. In our case we have three things to do: realise God, reveal God and then manifest God. Sri Krishna, however had realised God before coming into the world, so he was already in a position to reveal and manifest God.</p>
<p>God and the spiritual Masters are one, and God and we are one. But the difference is that we don’t claim God as our very own because we know that we have done many things wrong. We feel that still we are in ignorance, wallowing in the pleasure of ignorance. The Christ said, “I and my Father are One.” But we don’t dare to say that God and we are one. Sri Krishna, Lord Buddha and the Christ, on the strength of their conscious realisation of God could say that they and God were one. All the Sons of God are divine manifestations of God the Absolute.</p>  </div>
