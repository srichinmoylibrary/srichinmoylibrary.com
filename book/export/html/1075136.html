<p>A WILL AND A WAY</p>
<p>There is a will,<br /> And that will is in the soul.</p>
<p>There is a way,<br /> And that way is in the heart.</p>
<p>There is a will,<br /> And that will is of God.</p>
<p>There is a way,<br /> And that way is for God.</p>
<p>There is a will,<br /> And that will is leading me to the Supreme.</p>
<p>There is a way,<br /> And that way has made me love the Supreme.</p>
