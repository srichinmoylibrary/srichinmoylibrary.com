<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have many scriptures in India. Among these are the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Gita. Just as your Bible is a collection of writings and not one particular piece of writing, so are our scriptures a collection of religious and spiritual books. The most loved and revered scripture of India is a book that I have mentioned, the Bhagavad Gita. This book, by the way, is often called the Bible of India.</p>
<p><em>Mr. George Riddell:</em> The Gita is also used in Islam?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They have their Koran. The Koran is the sacred book of the Moslems as we have the Gita and you have the Bible.</p>  </div>
