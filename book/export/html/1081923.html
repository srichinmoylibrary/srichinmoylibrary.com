  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: What has God learned from His Self-transcendence?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has learned from Self-transcendence that His own Light and Delight are constantly increasing. He does not want to be bound either by His Vision or by Himself. He feels that if His Creation binds Him, then it is useless. And if He binds Himself, then He is useless. He does not want to be bound by anything that He has done or by anything that He has become. He wants freedom, constant freedom from what He is and from what He has done. So God has learned from Self-transcendence the message of His own Freedom. Each time He transcends Him self, God increases His Freedom-Power. When He uses His Freedom-Power in Heaven, it is His Vision-Power. It is all His Vision that He is spreading. And when He uses His Freedom-Power here on earth, it is His Compassion-Power. Out of His infinite Bounty, unconditionally He is making us good. So that is His Compassion aspect that He is using. Freedom He has transformed into Compassion. But in Heaven He is using His Freedom in the form of Light, so that He can see what He has done and what He is going to do.</p>  </div>
