<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul does not have to come to the Centre; the soul will get light no matter where it is. I feed the soul in the inner world. Your soul will get light directly from me. But your soul also has tremendous compassion for its little brothers and sisters, the vital and the mind. The soul says, “I have got so much. Now let them get something.” That is why the soul pleads with the brothers and sisters: “Accept light, accept light.” But the vital and the mind are always delaying. The soul is like a beggar: It is all the time pleading with your vital, with your mind, to listen.</p>  </div>
