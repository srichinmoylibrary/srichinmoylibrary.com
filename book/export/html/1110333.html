<p>Sri Chinmoy was invited to give a series of six spiritual talks in the spring of 1973 by Columbia University's centre for religious activities, Earl Hall. The lectures were held in St.Paul's Chapel on the University campus.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy offers his deepest blessingful gratitude to P., who made the arrangements for these talks. The Master also offers his blessingful gratitude to B. who was in charge of coordination.</p>
<p>At the end of each lecture in this series, Sri Chinmoy invited spiritual questions from the audience. Selected questions and answers follow the talks.</p>  </div>
