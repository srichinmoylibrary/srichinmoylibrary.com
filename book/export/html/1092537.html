<p>Poor Tagore enjoyed the earth only for eighty fleeting years. But the blessed earth has obtained him for all time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Death," says Tagore, "lays its hand upon the ego in all its forms. The world is not deprived of anything. All losses are incurred by the ego alone." <em> — Shantiniketan 7</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tagore has died only to become deathless fully and integrally in the Indian, nay, universal consciousness.</p>  </div>
