<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people are born in a particular country who do not have any connection with that country. They come out of curiosity, as a complete stranger. It is like travelling to some other country out of curiosity to see what it looks like. But some people come to a particular country to elevate the consciousness of that country or to do something really great and good for the country. They come because of their previous connection with the country. Again, the Supreme may send them directly to do something great for the development of that country.</p>  </div>
