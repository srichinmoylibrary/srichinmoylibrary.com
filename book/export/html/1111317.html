<p>The more I practise the slower I become. So I decided to cut down on my distance and only practise speed work.</p>
<p>Today I started my speed work. This morning I was running a very short distance, and in front of C.'s house I saw someone who looked exactly like T.</p>
<p>I said, "T., T., T." three times. Then I said to myself, "It can't be T. If I call him three times, how is it that he won't answer? The strange thing is that he didn't even nod. I came near him and, O God, it was a different person.</p>
