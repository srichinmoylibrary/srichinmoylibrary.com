<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Constantly thinking that your mind is bothering you and that it is full of undivine thoughts is not good. By doing this, you will have no clear idea of truth. If the mind is constantly involved in our so-called aspiration, then we will not succeed.</p>
<p>The mind is like a sick person. Let us say you have two brothers. One brother is sick all the time, and the other brother is strong and healthy. If you constantly think of the brother who is sick, then you will also feel sick. If you go to the hospital four or five times a day, then you are bound to feel that you are sick, although the doctors will find nothing wrong with you.</p>
<p>If you spend most of your time with your sick brother, which is the mind, then you will be affected. But if you spend most of your time with your strong, healthy brother, the heart, then you will get strength and energy. When you have become strong, then the two strong brothers can go to help the poor sick brother, the mind. Always try to think of the heart. It is not that you are rejecting or avoiding the mind, but right now you are not strong enough to cure the mind. You are not powerful enough. Only with the added strength of your heart will you be able to go to the mind to make it spiritually stronger.</p>  </div>
