<p>Early this morning I lifted 270 pounds for the first time since I started again. I did it four times with my right arm and four times with my left arm and these lifts are higher than my 250 pounds! I am fully satisfied. From tomorrow I shall practise 300 pounds. In 1986 I failed 213 times before I lifted it. Now I think I will be able to do it in fifty. In a week I think I shall be able to do it. I have one month and ten days before we leave for the Christmas trip. I am ready for 300!</p>
