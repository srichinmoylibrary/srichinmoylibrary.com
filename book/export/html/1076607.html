<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are absolutely right. Meditation is the easiest thing on earth because our inner divinity has not only the capacity or the quality of meditation, but practises it at every moment. Now whatever I do constantly will naturally be the easiest for me to do. Otherwise how can I do it at every moment? So when you are identified with your inner divinity, you will see that meditation is being constantly done for you. It is being done within you and for you, and if you are identified with the inner divine entity which is doing it, then meditation is very, very easy. Otherwise it is most difficult, for the mind will tell you during your meditation, “I am allowing a stranger to enter into me.” The vital will say, “I am entering into an alien world.” The physical will say, “You are trying to make me think that I am a fool. I still want to enjoy the world. I don’t need your heaven.”</p>
<p>All this happens when you are not identified with your inmost divinity. But if you are identified, you can truthfully and spontaneously say that meditation is the easiest thing in the world because in meditation reality grows and the life of creation flows.</p>  </div>
