<p>What Nolini has written on relaxation in athletics is not only the result of scientific research but also a deep spiritual truth regarding the body, mind and life based on the realisation of the Yogins. We use the word "relaxation" in athletics as one counts the beads of a rosary. But most of us do not know the real signification of it. Indeed, we can derive much benefit from Nolini's personal experience. This calls to mind the famous novelist Saratchandra's words to Dilip Kumar Roy: "Do you know our difficulty? Our readers are so lazy that they would refuse to go to Heaven if it meant toiling up the stairs and if a little somersault would land them in Hell."</p>  </div>
