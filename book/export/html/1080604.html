<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Would it offend you if I smoke?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it would not offend me at all. If that is your nature, then why should it offend me?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> You do not smoke, I am sure.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the strength of my oneness with you, how am I going to say that it is something wrong if it pleases you?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> The doctors told me yesterday that I have to stop or I will die. I do not want to die. I would disappoint you if I died...</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly!</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em>...before I did my work.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No question!</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> But this is very bad for me.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Oh, I have a present for you.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Another present?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let me present this to you. <em>(Sri Chinmoy gives Leonard Bernstein a framed copy of his "Leonard Bernstein" poem, written in calligraphy.)</em></p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I love those things.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Oh, excellent.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> They are so beautiful. How I wish to get a painting of yours! I have seen so many prints, but I have not seen an original painting.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I shall definitely give you a painting of mine.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Wonderful!</p>  </div>
