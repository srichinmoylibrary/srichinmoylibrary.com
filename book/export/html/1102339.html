<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The role of the United Nations will not come to an end after the establishment of peace on earth. To have world peace is just the beginning; it is not and cannot be the end of human achievement. When an individual seeker acquires peace, for example, there are many other things that he must also acquire in order to make himself a perfect instrument of God. He must begin to grow into a new light and achieve a new harmony and a new fulfilment. Similarly, this earth of ours also has many things that it has yet to offer to the Absolute Supreme. The first is peace â€” peace in the individual and peace in the collective human consciousness. But, as is the case with the individual seeker, this is only the beginning. The earth also has to grow into a new light and achieve a new harmony and a new fulfilment.</p>
