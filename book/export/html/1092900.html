<p>It was Dilip's dream that his dearest friend Subhas would one day accept Yoga and go to the Source, the Goal Ultimate. Then from the Absolute Supreme he wanted Subhas to learn how to execute earth-bound ideas and Heaven-free ideals.</p>
<p>Subhas felt that Mother India's liberation should be his first and foremost goal. He did subscribe to Dilip's view that the highest Goal is God-realisation. But he was neither ready nor willing to have that loftiest Goal as his own, very own, for the time being. He believed that when the Hour of God strikes, the Hour itself will do the needful. Subhas wanted to climb up the life-tree progressively, step-by-step, giving due attention to each successive height.</p>
<p>Dilip was adamant. He did not want his dearest friend's burning God-hunger in the inmost recesses of his heart to remain totally, if not shockingly, dormant. Therefore, time and again, he made soulful attempts to bring to the fore his friend's genuine God-hunger-cries. No, never cleverly, but self-givingly.</p>
<p>In return, Subhas offered his gratitude-heart to Dilip. Something is at once interesting and illumining: whenever he received blessings, concern and goodwill-even indirectly-from Sri Aurobindo, Subhas the heart blossomed into sincerity-appreciation.</p>
<p>Dilip writes <em>Å• propos:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...I had only sent him [Subhas] a flower from Sri Aurobindo as a token of his blessing. Subhas wrote from prison: 'I think that even those who rule out a supra-mental order have to admit the existence and efficacy of what is popularly styled will power. And this power-call it by what name you will-is bound to act, even if the receiver is not open or adequately and consciously receptive. I am grateful to Sri Aurobindo....I have appreciated (I cannot find the proper word!) Sri Aurobindo's action. I shall not say more lest my language become conventional.'"</p>
