<p>One day Troilanga Swami said to the young seeker Bijoykrishna Goswami, "Look here, I shall have to initiate you."</p>
<p>Bijoykrishna said, "I don't want to be initiated by you. You are so undivine. What you did in the Kali temple was so shocking to me."</p>
<p>Troilanga Swami said, "No, I have received an inner command from above. You have to be initiated by me. It is absolutely necessary for everyone to be initiated. If there is no initiation, then there can be no purification. You need purification in your life, and if you do not have this purification, there will be no God-realisation for you. I have got the command from within. Otherwise, I would be the last person to ask to initiate anybody."</p>
<p>When Bijoykrishna heard these words, he fell at the Swami's feet and got initiation. It helped him considerably in his purification and expedited his spiritual journey. Eventually, Bijoykrishna Goswami also became a very great spiritual Master.</p>
<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>Initiation is of paramount importance. The Master can initiate the seeker either outwardly or inwardly. But the traditional outer way, as part of a religious rite, is far less effective than the silence-initiation. In the silence-initiation, the Master offers a portion of his life-breath to the seeker for his ignorance-illumination and his delight-realisation. Initiation is purification. No purification, no perfection. No perfection, no satisfaction either on earth or in Heaven.</p>  </div>
