<p>A German adage runs:<br /> "In America, an hour is 40 minutes."<br /> A Russian adage runs:<br /> "The slower you go,<br /> The farther you will be...."<br /> When I identify President Gorbachev<br /> With the German proverb,<br /> I clearly see that his hour is 33 minutes.<br /> The inimitable way he gave freedom<br /> To Poland, Hungary, East Germany,<br /> Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania,<br /> He himself is the perfect synthesis<br /> Of his saying and doing:<br /> "History cannot wait; people cannot afford to waste time. It may also be too late tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow may never come."<br /> When I identify him<br /> With the Russian proverb,<br /> Slowness is founded upon patience —<br /> Patience, patience, patience.<br /> He has not given up.<br /> He continues with his life-pilgrimage<br /> Slowly, steadily and unerringly<br /> To the farthest destination —<br /> Mankind's nature-transformation.</p>
