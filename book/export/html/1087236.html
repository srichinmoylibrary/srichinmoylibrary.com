<p>Today I went shopping in a Chinese store where the lady likes me. As I was paying, her husband came up to me and grabbed my shoulder. He was smiling.</p>
<p>He said, "7,000!" and raised his arm. On his wall was the picture of my 7,000-pound lift.</p>
<p>He has a 16-year-old son named Nick. He said, "Nicholas looks at your picture every day. He is your best admirer!"</p>
