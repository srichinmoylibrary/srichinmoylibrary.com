<p>When I was about to enter the plane — I was only ten or twelve metres from the door — a young girl looked at me, smiling, and said, "Guru!"</p>
<p>I couldn't imagine who she was. She said, "I am a new disciple."</p>
<p>I said, "You are a new disciple?"</p>
<p>She said, "I have been your disciple for only three weeks. I am a Zurich disciple. My name is Emily." She grabbed my instrument case and wanted to take my bag also. She spoke English fluently. She works for Air France, and she was taking the same flight to Scotland. She carried my bags right to my seat. She was going on standby. But she told me that she would have no trouble getting on the plane.</p>
