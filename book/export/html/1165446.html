<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am very clever. For years I have been doing stretching exercises, starting with sit-ups. I do not like sit-ups as much as I should, but I always do this exercise with the hope that it will help me to flatten my stomach. So my hope is stronger than my liking or disliking. Therefore, I do sit-ups, although they may not appeal to me.</p>  </div>
