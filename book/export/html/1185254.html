<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What is actually happening is that you are not properly concentrating and meditating on the heart. If you concentrate on the top of the head, it will cause confusion and numbness. But if you concentrate on the heart, no matter how much power descends you will be able to hold it. At that time you will feel the loving presence of the Supreme in your heart, and no matter how much Light and Power you get from above, you will be perfectly able to hold it.</p>  </div>
