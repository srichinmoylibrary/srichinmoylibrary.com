<p>In our ten-mile race today two ladies over fifty were so happy and excited to get prizes! They never expected in this lifetime to win anything. They never imagined that they would come in first and second in their age category and they were so thrilled. They were in tears because they had won. One of the ladies was very spiritual.</p>
