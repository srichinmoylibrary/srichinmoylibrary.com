<p><em>(The verandah of Aurobindo's room. Time: evening. Date: March 30, 1914. Aurobindo seated in a chair on the verandah. A and B, his associates, seated opposite to his table.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Anything you want to ask?</p>
<p>A: A little about the French lady who visited you yesterday, if you please.</p>
<p>B: The striking thing about her is that she seems to be home here among us, strangers, in a strange land in strange surroundings.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Long before her arrival here I had been aware of her. You will know her more and more from day to day. Even then she will be far above what you can know. As regards her being at home here, or in any other place, nothing would make any difference for her. She is in all the world and all the world is in her. In a large sense, she is an Indian soul born in a European body.</p>
<p>A and B: <em>(Almost in one voice)</em> A similar thought struck us yesterday â€” as if she would link up East and West in a golden chain.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: <em>(Smiling)</em> Yes, and much more.</p>  </div>
