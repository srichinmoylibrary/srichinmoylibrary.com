<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can learn the language of my inner silence by doing two things: by becoming more sincere in what you are doing and by becoming more dynamically peaceful in what you are doing. Peacefulness can be lethargic and it can be dynamic. If you become dynamic in your peaceful life, then you will know my inner consciousness, my inner silence. Peaceful life is inner silence. So increase your sincerity and increase your dynamic qualities inside your peaceful life. Then you are bound to learn, bound to know the language of my inner silence.</p>  </div>
