<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to forgive me. This time it is impossible. I will be coming back in January and at that time, I shall stay for about a month. If you care to stay with the Centre, until I come back, certainly I will give you an interview. So if you can stay for another month, I will be coming back again in January and remaining here another month. At that time, I will give you a very satisfactory interview, if you stay. This time, unfortunately, I will not be able to give any interviews because tomorrow I have much work.</p>
<p>If you want to come the day after tomorrow, on Thursday morning at 10:00 a.m. you are most welcome, all of you. And if you want to feel the highest Peace, Light and Bliss, you are most welcome at ten o'clock. Please come a few minutes early. On New Year's Day, we have to forget the past.</p>
<p>According to our philosophy, the past is dust precisely because the past has not given us what we wanted. Yesterday did not give us realisation. That is why today we are crying for realisation. If yesterday did not give us what we want, tomorrow has to give it to us. So we have to come out of the past, although what was good in the past, we will take. But what happens, very often, is that we enter into the world of depression. "Yesterday I did not get realisation. Am I a fool? How is it that I may get it today? Since yesterday, I did not get realisation, today also I will not get it. This is our human understanding. So I wish to tell all of you that if yesterday, you did not realise God, that does not mean that today you are not going to realise Him. Today, with your aspiration, you are bound to feel se Him. And if you cannot do it today, then tomorrow. You cannot say that God is not going to give it to you today.</p>  </div>
