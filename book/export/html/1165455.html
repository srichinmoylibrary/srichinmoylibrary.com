<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I used to run long distances, I used to become very tired. After a long run I needed to relax at least for four or five hours. But when I do intense bodybuilding, in two hours I gain back my energy. The tiredness is not of the same type. When I used to run, my entire body — from the soles of my feet to the crown of my head — used to feel tired. But after weightlifting I mostly feel tiredness inside my arms, especially my right arm, for it lifts much heavier weights than the left arm.</p>  </div>
