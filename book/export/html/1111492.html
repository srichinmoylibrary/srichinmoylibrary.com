<p>Today I was watching the Seven-Mile Reversible Race in Central Park. Two middle-aged men were running. I was standing at the side watching when they passed by me. I think their timing was better than my best timing for seven miles. Suddenly, both of them turned around and said, "Sri Chinmoy!" They did not ask me, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?" No! They were saying, "Sri Chinmoy!" They were so surprised to see me. When they first passed by me, they did not recognise me. Then, after three or four steps, they turned around and greeted me.</p>
<p>Then a black woman came up to me and said, "Sri Chinmoy, do you have the time?" I could not tell her the time. I was wearing my yellow stopwatch which does not have the regular time. So she smiled at me.</p>
