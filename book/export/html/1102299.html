    <title>&lt;em&gt;Mr. David Rowe:&lt;/em&gt; When a Member State assumes an &amp;quot;anti-United Nations attitude,&amp;quot; it is probably due to frustration or fear that the United Nations has taken or may take some action against it.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When a Member State assumes an "anti-United Nations attitude," it undoubtedly weakens the United Nations system on the outer plane. But on the inner plane the strength of the United Nations system is extremely solid and sound. As long as the inner aspiration of the United Nations is sincere and strong, we do not have to worry if some Member States, or even all the Member States, go against the United Nations system. For it is not the Member States alone that will bring about world harmony. It is the united force of all the nations, big and small, that can and will bring about a oneness-world-family.</p>
<p>There may be many reasons why a Member State wants to stand against United Nations policy. But just by standing against United Nations policy, a State will not be able to solve even an iota of the world's problems. If one sees that the United Nations is doing something wrong, that is no reason to stand violently and shamelessly against the United Nations. One has to love the United Nations more in order to bring to the fore its sincere aspirations, for this alone is what can and will change the face of the entire world.</p>
<p>"To err is human, to forgive divine." To forget the past blunders of others, as well as one's own, is to make friends with satisfaction-peace and perfection-bliss. Furthermore, this is the only way to accelerate humanity's oneness-vision and oneness-goal. If you see the imperfections of the United Nations, you should not consider the United Nations a filthy object; you should not discard it or speak ill of it in season and out of season. No! The wise thing is to accept and embrace the United Nations as a humble and well-meaning instrument of an all-embracing and all-fulfilling supreme Reality.</p>  </div>
