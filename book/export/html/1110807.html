<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My philosophy is the absolute acceptance of life. Life has to be accepted. In this life there is the living Breath of God. God is not only in Heaven, He is within us as well. God and His creation can never be separated.</p>
<p>My message is this: If we really think of God, if we feel the existence of God, then we have to accept the world as real, just as God is real.</p>
<p>First we have to accept the world as it is. If we do not accept the world, then what are we going to change? What are we going to transform? If a potter does not accept his clay, then how is he going to shape and mould a pot? We have to aspire to bring down Peace, Light and Bliss for the world. We have to enter into the very breath of life in humanity in order to transform and change the face of earth.</p>  </div>
