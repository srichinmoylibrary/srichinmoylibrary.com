<p><em>[The King's palace. The King is on his throne. Enter minister.]</em></p>
<p>MINISTER: Your Majesty, the man who stabbed the jeweller was put in jail yesterday, but today he has escaped.</p>
<p>KING: How?</p>
<p>MINISTER: He was a strong man. It seems he was able to break some of the bars of the prison window, and somehow he escaped.</p>
<p>KING: What is to be done?</p>
<p>MINISTER: That is up to you. Please tell me, I am at your command.</p>
<p>KING: Well, if you can't find him, look for any strong young man of his size, and bring him to me.</p>
<p>MINISTER: Only one person?</p>
<p>KING: No, bring everyone. Bring all the men of his size, and I will make a selection. I will have the strongest person hanged. It is an insult to me that a prisoner can break out of my prison and escape. So the strongest man will be put to death.</p>  </div>
