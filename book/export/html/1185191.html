  <h1 class="book-heading">Swami Vivekananda&#039;s presence at the Parliament</h1>
  
 
<p>Swami Vivekananda's soul-stirring addresses at the Parliament of Religions inspired the audience to have faith in all the religions of the world and to hug the best in each religion. There was a magic spell of throbbing delight woven around his very name at the Parliament. He was the figure that dominated the world's gaze there.</p>
<p>A report appeared in <em>The Boston Evening Transcript</em> of September 30th, 1893 about the great triumph of this Indian spiritual giant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If he merely crosses the platform, he is applauded, and this marked approval of thousands he accepts in a childlike spirit of gratification, without a trace of conceit.</p>
