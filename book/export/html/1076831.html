<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They have nothing to do with the mind. This is something that anybody can practise. The thing is to go beyond the mind. What you call the mind is an ordinary human mind. With this mind we cannot meditate or contemplate. We have to go beyond that mind. The mind thinks something now and the next moment thinks something totally different. It is always full of ideas and thoughts like a monkey standing in front of you pinching and biting you continuously. You have to enter into meditation and make the mind stay quiet and calm, like a lake without waves, perfectly tranquil. One has to go beyond the mind to be able to perceive Peace, Light and Bliss.</p>  </div>
