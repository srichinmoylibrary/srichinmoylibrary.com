<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a legend and there is also one very special picture of Sri Ramakrishna that is connected with Russia. We have thousands and thousands of pictures because we live in the West. But in poor Bengal, at that time, Sri Ramakrishna did not have many pictures. Once he was asked, "Where are you going to take birth in your next incarnation?" He simply pointed to a particular spot on the map, and that spot was Russia. A photograph was taken and it became one of his most famous spiritual pictures. He entered into his highest consciousness and pointed out a particular part of the world, and definitely it was Russia.</p>  </div>
