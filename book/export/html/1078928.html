<h2>Question: Sometimes I'll get a real high sound in my ear, even though I am not meditating. I'll just be sitting and all of a sudden I'll get this sound. Could you explain it to me?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are not meditating consciously, but your soul is meditating. This is called spontaneous meditation. Your soul is meditating, although your physical mind does not know that the soul is meditating. This sound you hear is like unconditional Grace from above. When you pray, when you do something good, at that time you feel that in return you will get something. But God gives many things unconditionally. He is like a mother. A mother does many things for her children unconditionally. You may say that the mother feels that one day the children will grow up and then help her. No. The mother knows very well that when the children are twelve or thirteen, they will leave the family. Very often the physical mother, does things unconditionally for her children. God, being our eternal Father and Mother, does everything unconditionally for us.</p>  </div>
