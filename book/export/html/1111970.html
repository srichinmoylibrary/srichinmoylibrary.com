<p>One fellow was running the marathon in sandals. Vidura gave him his running shoes and they fit him.</p>
<p>In the last two miles Virendra ran so fast that he passed four or five runners.</p>
<p>He came in second.</p>
<p>The two brothers, Aviram and Pravaha, are such jokers. At thirteen miles I saw them stop and go into the hotel. The tall one said, "Guru, after thirteen miles we realised we were not wearing your T-shirt, so we went into the hotel."</p>
<p>Then the little one said, "Guru, we got a little tired, so we stopped!"</p>
