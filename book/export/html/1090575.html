<p><em>[Exactly the same as Scene I]</em></p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: My child you are destined to get realisation very soon in this incarnation; therefore, I am offering you these beads. My children, let me look at you to see whether you have again become jealous. No, you are not jealous at all. I see you have the firm conviction that it is the result of your aspiration that has been manifested in the arrival of your new spiritual brother.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, Master, here I am seeing five faces just like my own! Five bodies, five hearts, five souls just like my own! Am I right, Master, or is this just a hallucination?</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: You are absolutely right, my son. These are not your mere spiritual brothers and sisters, but they are part and parcel of your very existence. In you they have found their divine pride, and in them you have found your divine duty. It is you who will help them to realise the Highest, and it is they who have brought you here with their most sincere aspiration.</p>  </div>
