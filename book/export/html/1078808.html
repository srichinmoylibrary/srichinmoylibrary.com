<p>If you want to be great, then keep yourself busy learning everything â€” everything in everything and everything of everything.</p>
<p>If you want to be good, then keep yourself busy unlearning the things you have learned in the desire-world, and keep yourself busy learning everything in the aspiration-world.</p>
<p>If you want to be only in the realisation-world, and not in the desire-world or in the aspiration-world, then you do not have to learn anything and you do not have to unlearn anything. You have only to become what you want to become. How can you become what you want to become? You can easily become what you want to become only when you feel that you can never make yourself what you want to become. No human power can do it. Only by the Grace that comes from above can you do what you want to do and become what you want to become.</p>
<p>How do you get this Grace? You get this Grace if at every moment you shed loving tears of gratitude to the Supreme for what He has done for you out of His infinite Bounty and, again, for what, out of His infinite Bounty, He has not done for you. Many things God has given you out of His infinite Bounty, so that you can be happy, the divine in you can be happy. Again, many things He has not given you for your good. So, because of what He has given you and what He has not given you, you must create a sense of continuous gratitude. Inside that gratitude you are bound to see Him, feel Him and become one with Him in His Divinity's integral Life.</p>
