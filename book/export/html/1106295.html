<p>This week I have begun playing the piano after I finish weightlifting. You can see on the video that I am still wearing my weightlifting shorts. Yesterday, after I had finished playing the piano, I immediately became my monkey-consciousness and showed my muscle power in my arms. I was at the end of my most powerful and soulful self-giving at the piano and then I adopted a weightlifting pose!</p>
<p>Yesterday was Mahasamrat’s wife’s birthday, so I want to send them the video. I have given his wife the spiritual name Bhavatarini.</p>
