<p>Although your desire-friend<br /> Is staying all alone,<br /> Don't go to him.<br />   He will spoil you;<br />   He will ruin you.<br />   He will spoil your character;<br />   He will ruin your life.</p>
<p>Although your aspiration-friend<br /> Is weak and not helping you,<br /> Go to him and stay with him.<br />   One day he will become strong;<br />   One day he will become rich;<br />   One day he will become immortal.<br />        When he becomes strong<br />        All his power will be yours.<br />        When he becomes rich<br />        All his wealth will be yours.<br />        When he becomes immortal<br />        All his Immortality will be yours.</p>
