<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one wants God's guidance, then right from the very beginning one has to offer his mind to God. There cannot be two teachers. So either accept God as your teacher or accept the mind. When you ask God for His guidance, do a favour for your mind. Carry your mind to God as you are carrying yourself to God. Then, both you and your previous teacher, mind, should be placed under His guidance.</p>  </div>
