  <h1 class="book-heading">My Peace-Education-Life</h1>
  
 
<p>Peace I find when I am lost inside God's Compassion-Eye.</p>
<p>Peace I become when I am lost inside God's Forgiveness-Feet.</p>
<p>Mine is a mind-jungle totally empty of peace.</p>
<p>Mine is a heart-garden flooded with peace.</p>
<p>The divine in us embraces peace.</p>
<p>The human in us longs for peace.</p>
<p>The animal in us destroys peace.</p>
<p>President Gorbachev, the peace-dreamer, peace-bringer and peace-server of this century, has urged again and again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What we need is Star Peace and not Star Wars."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I heave a sigh when my mind becomes a victim to searing conflicts.</p>
<p>I become a singing bird when my life becomes the breath of peace.</p>
<p>My heart's God-love-beauty has peace.</p>
<p>My life's God-surrender-fragrance is peace.</p>
<p>The dream-flooded and soul-stirring words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ring forth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I still believe that one day mankind will bow before the altars of God and be crowned triumphant over war and bloodshed."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Devotedly I chant the Name of my Beloved Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>Bountifully my Beloved Lord Supreme enchants my life.</p>
<p>My soul's peace-smiles and my heart's peace-tears together cover endless miles unobstructed.</p>
<p>Infinity is the Source of my soul's peace-smiles.</p>
<p>Eternity is the Source of my heart's peace-tears.</p>
<p>Peace is infinitely more than the birthless and deathless promises of my mind.</p>
<p>Peace is in the ever-blossoming hopes of my heart.</p>
<p>I wish to cite the momentous utterance of U Thant, the third Secretary-General of the United Nations, who was widely revered for his innate spirituality and deep wisdom. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is no peace in the world today because there is no peace in the minds of men."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God comes to me, compassionately and unconditionally, and gives me Peace.</p>
<p>Man comes to me, immediately and ruthlessly, and takes away all my peace.</p>
<p>God comes and man comes.</p>
<p>When God comes, I swim in the ocean of infinite Delight.</p>
<p>When man comes, my very earth-existence is devoured by the unquenchable thirst and insatiable hunger of sorrows.</p>
<p>But love mankind I must, for mankind is unmistakably an extension of my own reality-existence. The lofty realisation of Mother Teresa, the twentieth century's unparalleled server of bleeding humanity, echoes and re-echoes in the inmost recesses of my heart: "Works of love are works of peace."</p>

<p>I ask God,<br /> "My Lord, is there any way I can embody<br /> and treasure Your Peace forever and forever?"<br /> God says,<br /> "My child, there is a way.<br /> Just illumine your mind more, infinitely more.<br /> Feed your heart more, infinitely more.<br /> Energise your life more, infinitely more.<br /> Lo, in you My Infinity's Peace has found its Eternity's Abode."</p>

<p>Peace is today's soul-seed-world.</p>
<p>Peace is tomorrow's life-tree-world.</p>
<p>But the peace of tomorrow must be built upon the solid foundations of today. What are those foundations? President Woodrow Wilson, the champion of the League of Nations, has a most significant message for the world-community in this connection. He advises us that lasting peace can never be the fruit of a war where one side defeats the other. "It must be a peace without victory," he proclaims.</p>
<p>O world, you will not be happy and satisfied if you come and visit God's omnipotent Power-Head, but you will be completely happy and supremely satisfied if you come and visit God's omnipresent Peace-Feet. Man thinks his mind's love for world power and his heart's love for world peace can live together. Indeed, this is the height of man's stupidity.</p>
<p>Up until now, God has been pleading with the human mind to study the world peace course. But now God is forcing the human mind to study the world peace course.</p>
<p>The moment the division-mind desires to live in the heart of oneness-peace-world, God will immediately declare His supreme Victory on earth.</p>
<p>One minute of world peace is ten hours with God.</p>  </div>
