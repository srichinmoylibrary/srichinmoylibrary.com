<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What happened is that for a few seconds your soul left your body. You identified with the soul, while your physical consciousness remained below your soul-reality. Right now you do not see your soul-reality. The Divinity which your soul embodies you do not see. But when you become consciously one with the soul-reality, you will see it. What you experienced is very good. For a few seconds you identified with the soul-reality and not with the body-reality When you go one step further and bring the soul-reality into the body-reality, that is illumination.</p>  </div>
