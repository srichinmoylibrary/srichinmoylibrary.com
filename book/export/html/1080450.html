<p>Truth and God are eternally one. Although Truth and God are eternally one, we feel the necessity of the supreme Truth only when our heart is awakened. But we feel the necessity of God no matter what kind of life we lead - animal life or human life or divine life. Even in the animal life, we need God for destruction. In the human life, we need God to show the power of our dominion. In the divine life, we need God to offer the light of our universal oneness. Although Truth and God are eternally one, we try to utilise God constantly no matter which plane of consciousness we are in. But Truth we invoke only when our heart is awakened to Light.</p>  </div>
