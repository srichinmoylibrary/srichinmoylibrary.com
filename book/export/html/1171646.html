<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. God created this world out of joy. We use the spiritual word 'delight'. In the Vedas it says, "From delight we came. In delight we grow and, at the end of our journey, we enter into delight." This means that we go back to our Source.</p>
<p>If you have joy, then you create, like a child. A child has joy all the time. That is why he is able to do things here and there. If I am an octogenarian with no interest in life, am I going to create something? When we are happy, we want to do something for the rest of the world. When we are miserable, we do not do anything, either for ourselves or for anybody else.</p>  </div>
