<p>In Victoria we went to another restaurant and I asked for a grilled cheese sandwich. I paid for it with an American ten dollar bill, and the lady at the cash register gave me the change. As soon as I got it, I put it in my pocket and left.</p>
<p>After I had gone half a block, the cashier came running up to me and said, "I'm sorry, I didn't give you the correct amount of change. You gave me ten American dollars, but I gave you change for ten Canadian dollars."</p>
<p>So this is the good side of Canada; the bad side is that when you ask for egg salad you get mayonnaise.</p>
