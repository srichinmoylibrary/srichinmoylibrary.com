<h2>Is the soul always with the person during his lifetime, or can it leave him temporarily, even making its home elsewhere?</h2>

<p>As a rule, the soul always remains with the person during his lifetime, but it can leave the body for a few minutes, or a few hours at most, while the person is asleep. It can also leave the body for a short period while the aspirant is in a deep state of meditation. Then one can see one's own body. One may see it as a dead body or a dynamic body or as a shaft of light facing his soul, or in many other ways. Of course, at that time, one sees the body with the eye of his own soul.</p>  </div>
