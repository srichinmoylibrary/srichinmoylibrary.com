<p>Before I left for California, Vinaya ordered a case for my new big harmonium. I gave him the money and he bought it, only to discover it was too big — three times larger than the instrument itself. And he had measured the harmonium first!</p>
<p>I said, "Vinaya, you have bought my coffin!"</p>
<p>That particular harmonium is by far the best, so I wanted to take it to San Francisco. Two weeks earlier I had received it from India. The last time I was in Calcutta I played it in the store and I liked it so much. The people in the store were kind enough to send me the same one.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Japan I went via San Francisco. In San Francisco I liked a particular harmonium and I bought it. They said, "Oh, we will ship it to New York," and I believed them. When I got back to New York there was a- harmonium, but not the one I had bought.</p>
