<p>The world loves me. I love the world. My Lord loves me and the world. I ask my sweet Lord if it is all correct.</p>
<p>My Lord says: "The world does not love you, my child. The world loves only your appreciation. You do not love the world, my child. You love only the world's admiration. But I love you and the world. You have the capacity to appreciate. The world has the capacity to admire. I have the capacity to perfect. I shall perfect your appreciation by directing it towards Me. I shall perfect the world's admiration by directing it towards Me. Your feeble appreciation divinised by Me will be the bloom of your true love for the world. The world's fruitless admiration transformed by Me will be the bloom of the world's true love for you. In the near future you and the world will love each other the way I love you two â€” unreservedly and unconditionally."</p>  </div>
