SCA 1046-1056. In May 1994, Victory-Banner Productions, under the leadership of K, presented Sri Chinmoy's play entitled <em>My Rama Is My All</em> for several weeks in New York. On 12 May, Sri Chinmoy invited members of the cast to ask him questions about various aspects of the play. Stage <em>personae</em> of the questioners are given.</p>
<h2>Performance of the play <em>My Rama Is My All</em></h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Most sincerely, I am extolling you all to the skies. This is absolutely by far the best performance that you have done over the years. Now, if the performers want to say anything by way of self-criticism, then I can either agree or disagree.</p>  </div>
