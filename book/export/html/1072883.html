<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sri Ramakrishna did not stay on earth for a long time. He was given limited time. Had he stayed on earth for eight more years, he could have developed somebody else into Vivekananda’s calibre, if he wanted to. But he knew his time limit. Even those who came to him, came only toward the end of his life. They got hardly six or seven years to meditate with him before he left. Even his closest disciples, those who were among that small group, were with him for a very short time.</p>  </div>
