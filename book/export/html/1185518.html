<p>A man came to a lawyer and said: “O lawyer, tell me what fee you want for helping me to get a divorce.”</p>
<p>The lawyer said: “One thousand dollars.”</p>
<p>“One thousand? I didn’t pay even one tenth of that amount to get married.”</p>
<p>The lawyer said: “Look, before you got married you didn’t even have one thorn inside your foot. Now I see that there are at least twenty thorns inside each foot. It takes me a long time to take out one thorn. To take twenty thorns out of each of your feet will be a tremendous task. So my fee is naturally higher than your marriage fee.”</p>  </div>
