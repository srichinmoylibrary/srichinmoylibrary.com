<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The main idea of my philosophy is that we have to accept the world and then try to transform it. We must not shun the world in spite of its limitations and imperfections. I will not exclude myself from the world because I feel the imperfections of the world are my imperfections and vice versa. So the world as such and each individual on earth must work together for the transformation of nature and the perfection of life. We have to work together.</p>  </div>
