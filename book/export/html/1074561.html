<p>When I aspire<br /> God honours me.<br /> He tells the world<br /> That I am His fond child,<br /> I am His choice instrument.</p>
<p>When I do not aspire<br /> He also honours me.<br /> He tells the world<br /> That I am His future Choice,<br /> I am His future Voice,<br /> I shall embody His future Race,<br /> I shall reveal His future Face.</p>
