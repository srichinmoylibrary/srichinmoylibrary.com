<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are one. We are sailing in the same boat. Our Beloved Father Supreme is manifesting Himself in and through us. You have offered to the world at large something unique, and the outer world knows who you are because of the magnificence of your unique contribution. The inner world, which is your heart's cry and your implicit faith in your Beloved Supreme, offers you constant oneness with the will of the Supreme. For that the outer world does not yet know you. But the golden day will dawn when the Supreme Message which you embody in the inner world will come to the fore. At that time the world will see you as the supreme seeker who is also the supreme composer and conductor. God the Lover aspect, which you embody in boundless measure, has yet to come to the fore. In your writings and in your compositions the world gets an iota of what you truly are inwardly. But I know how much the message of the inner world, which you embody, will come to the fore. Along with your music, it will inundate the world of aspiration and dedication.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I don't know how many years more I have to do that. That worries me, because I do have a lot to do. You are right. I have only begun, but I am sixty years old.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the Heart of our Beloved Supreme, sixty years is nothing. It is a fleeting second. Again, in a fleeting second you can inundate your entire being with infinite peace, light and bliss. The promise that your soul has made to the Supreme you are bound to fulfil. Your soul will not be satisfied unless and until you have offered to the world at large everything that you are supposed to offer and everything that you are.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> That is what I try to do. But there is so little time. Maybe I love people too much. I have so many friends and people I love.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are loving them because you see in them the living embodiment of your Beloved Supreme. Sri Ramakrishna was a great spiritual Master. His dearest disciple, Swami Vivekananda, once asked his Master, "Why do you always think of me? Why do you speak to me so much and why do you always show me so much affection?" Sri Ramakrishna replied, "I see God Himself in you. If I see an ordinary, unaspiring person, then I will not look at him." In the same way, you have so many friends, admirers and adorers. But you do not see them as ordinary human beings who are full of ignorance. You see them as God's representatives, as God's own creation. When you look at them and talk to them, you see in them the living Presence of your Beloved Supreme. So what you have been doing is most important. The Supreme has chosen you to be His supreme instrument in the music-world and in the spiritual world.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> How do you know that?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A God-seeker knows everything; a God-lover knows everything.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> There are many wonderful musicians in the world who are much greater than I.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not at all! That is again your humility speaking. The Supreme, out of His infinite Bounty, has given you some capacity. On the strength of my oneness with my Inner Pilot, I know who you are. To be very frank with you, you do not know who you are. I know more than you do, infinitely more than you do, about you in the inner world. About your outer life, you know. But you do not know your real inner self.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I feel it, though.</p>  </div>
