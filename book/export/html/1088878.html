<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not give but I become an instrument. I meditate on God and pray to Him to grant them the things that they want, provided they are good things, divine things, spiritual things, worthwhile things. If the student is longing for something earth-bound, for something that is going to bind him, then I will be the last person to help him get it.</p>  </div>
