<p>While I was practising before the start of the Long Island Marathon, someone came up to me and asked, "Are you Master Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He said, "Can I shake hands with you?"</p>
<p>So I shook hands with him. He was saying to his wife, "He is such a kind man."</p>
<p>At the start of the marathon, one lady ran with me for three or four miles. She was wearing all yellow. Then she asked Lavanya if I was Sri Chinmoy.</p>
