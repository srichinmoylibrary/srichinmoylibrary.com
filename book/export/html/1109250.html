    <title>Question: Guru, would you please say something about this meditation of yours from Food for the Soul: &amp;quot;I tell the truth. The world is hurt. I tell a lie, God is hurt. What am I to do? Silence. I must live in silence and become the smiling breath of silence. Lo, the world loves me and God blesses me.&amp;quot;</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In our day-to-day life when we tell the truth the world is not ready to hear it. The world immediately is hurt. If we flatter people, they like it. They don't deserve our flattery, but they like to hear it. Whenever they don't deserve something and we give it, they are pleased with us.</p>
<p>Truth is so painful. We have to know whether by telling the truth we are awakening the divine consciousness in others or creating more hostility in them. Sometimes we tell the truth just in order to say, "I know the truth and you should also know the truth." But by telling others the truth with that attitude, we are not doing them any good because they may not utilise the truth properly, face-to-face, which is the way we want them to see the truth. They will not see the truth. They will simply be hurt. Then they will become more hostile toward us and, at the same time, more hostile toward themselves. Out of arrogance and fear they will try to destroy even the little possibility of truth that they have. So let us be very careful and remember that when we tell the truth, the world is hurt. The world is not yet ready to listen to the truth and accept the truth. The world is ready only to hear from us appreciation or flattery. Truth is very painful.</p>
<p>When I tell a lie, naturally God will be hurt. So I must live in silence and become the smiling breath of silence. Lo, the world loves me and God blesses me. If we really live in silence, in purest silence, then automatically love, purity and inner joy grow within us. Silence does not remain alone. In silence there is joy; there is a kind of inner delight and inner assurance. So when we are in highest silence, the people around us will automatically get the divine qualities that are enveloped by silence. At that time the world will deeply appreciate us.</p>
<p>We may think that by remaining silent we are simply not antagonising anybody. But our very silence, if it is divine silence, emanates inner divinity. And this inner divinity enters into those who are around us. Then they will really love us, for unconsciously they will feel something beneficial coming from us. They may not actually know what we are offering them, but they will feel that we are giving them something solid, something soulful, something significant which they need. At that time they will deeply appreciate our offering.</p>
<p>God will immediately bless us if He can turn our existence into a sea of silence. And if we can free ourselves from this world of turmoil, worries and hesitation, then God will again bless us. In the sea of silence grows our true divine life. The divine life can grow in each individual only if he can have silence within and silence without. This silence is not the silence of a dead person. It will act most dynamically, most powerfully, but not in an aggressive way. It will act with the soul's power. While we are acting, inwardly we remain calm and poised. Again, while we are silent, we are running very, very fast, even though there may be no outer movement or outer gesture. Everything is done in the inner world, the soul's world, where silence is most dynamic and most fulfilling. When we have that kind of silence, naturally God will bless us, because we have discovered the Truth and we are living the Truth.</p>  </div>
