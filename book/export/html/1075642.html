<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the soul leaves the body, it takes with it the quintessence of the experiences that the body, mind, vital and heart had in this present life. But when it goes to the soul’s region, it does not take the heart or vital or mind with it. Now when it reincarnates in a new body, the soul — or you can say, the psychic being or Purusha — is the same. It still carries the realisations and experiences from its past lives. But it accepts a new heart, new mind, new vital and new body.</p>  </div>
