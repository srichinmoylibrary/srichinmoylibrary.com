<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Seven or eight students of mine have faithfully and devotedly counted them all, twice. It came to 1,001,919.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> I imagine they were all doves. Is that correct?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, they are birds of my imagination â€” in all different shapes and sizes. I have drawn them with ballpoint pens, felt tip markers, crayons, paint brushes and many other things.</p>  </div>
