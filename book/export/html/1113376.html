<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's Compassion always and always overrules the law of Karma. Had it been otherwise, no human being on earth could have lasted even for a single day. Again, from the highest spiritual point of view, you have to know that the law of Karma does not mean severe punishment. It is a necessary experience for the seeker; it is the only way to accelerate his progress. Therefore, the law of Karma itself is another form of God's Compassion. You may call it blessingful love in disguise.</p>  </div>
