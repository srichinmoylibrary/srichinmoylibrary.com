<p>Every day I would walk two miles early in the morning. Then in the evening at ten o'clock or ten-thirty I would go out again and walk two miles. On my fourth day, I went walking at three-thirty in the morning. After 400 metres, all of a sudden my right foot was aching like anything. The pain was so bad. I said, "How could it be?" Then I said, "All right, God does not want me to walk today."</p>
<p>I sat down. It was still quite dark; the sun had not risen. I was meditating very powerfully facing the sea. I meditated for about forty-five minutes. I was so happy. Now that I had meditated for forty-five minutes, I could go home.</p>
<p>I stood up. The sun was still not visible. I said, "The best thing is to imagine the sun. Let me take a few stretching exercises." I was taking stretching exercises, moving my arms and so on. At one point I turned around. Just thirty metres away, the Florida lady was doing the same exercise. I had not seen her before. I was so embarrassed. I said to myself, "Where could she come from?" O God, O God, she was there. I had not seen her when I went there to meditate. Can you imagine?</p>
<p>Then she followed me home. I was walking slowly because I was being cautious. My foot was still aching. I said to her, "I am begging you. Please do not bother me. This time my sister is dying. I am all the time thinking of her. Please, please, please."</p>
<p>But she would not listen.</p>  </div>
