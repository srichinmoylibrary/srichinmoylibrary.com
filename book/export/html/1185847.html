<p>The day he became a God-seeker<br /> Was the beginning of his conscious<br /> Feeling of Immortality.<br /> On that day he came to know<br /> That he is part and parcel<br /> Of Immortality.<br /> On that day he realised<br /> That he represents Immortality<br /> On earth.<br /> On that day he became<br /> A pathfinder and harbinger<br /> Of Immortality<br /> For those on earth who will accept<br /> The spiritual life after him.</p>
