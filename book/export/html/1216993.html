<p>When I was in Athens I saw Yiannis Kouros and his family. His wife Teresa is so sweet and polite. Their daughter Veronica acted as if she had known me all her life. They have put so many pictures of me in her room!</p>
<p>At the concert in Athens, Yiannis introduced me and gave a long talk about our philosophy. Then he and his family came with us to eat after the concert.</p>
<p>I brought little toys for Veronica. Luckily, I had bought two frogs — one for somebody whom I know was a frog in her last animal incarnation, and the other for Veronica. When the frog was turned on, it started jumping. She was so delighted. She was sitting on her chair, but then she jumped up to get her jumping frog!</p>
