<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I tell my disciples that I am not their leader. The real leader is God. God is your leader, my leader, the supreme Leader. God has told me to inspire my students for the time that I am on earth. I am a source of their inspiration. But I don’t tell them that I am God. I don’t say that I am their realisation. I am just their inspiration. God is their realisation.</p>  </div>
