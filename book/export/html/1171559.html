SCA 1072-1076. Sri Chinmoy answered questions about flowers on a bus trip from Baltimore to New York on 13 May 1989.</p>
<h2>Question: How can we use flowers to help us in our meditation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you are placing a flower on the shrine, try to feel that this flower is reminding you of your heart, which you want to be as beautiful as the flower. You cannot see your heart, but you can look at a flower and say, "How I wish my heart were as beautiful as this flower!"</p>
<p>Then try to feel that this flower that you have placed on the shrine is breathing, the same way that your heart is taking in your life-breath. Connect your heart-flower and the outer flower. While you are looking at the flower on the shrine, feel that your breath is entering into it. Then again, feel that the flower has entered into your heart and there it is breathing. Your heart-flower and the flower that you have placed on the shrine are going to and fro, they are constantly interchanging. The flower that is on the shrine is entering into your heart, and again it is coming out to be on the shrine.</p>
<p>If you can do this during your meditation, then your heart will become purer than the purest, and you will be able to absorb God's Compassion, Love, Blessings — anything that He wants to give you — in absolutely abundant measure because your heart is all ready to receive.</p>
<p>By seeing something with our outer eyes, we can become it. By becoming something also, we can see it. But it is far easier to see something with our outer eyes and then imagine that we are becoming that same thing on the inner plane.</p>  </div>
