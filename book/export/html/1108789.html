<p>[Dr. Doris Ching, Vice-President of Student Affairs, offers Sri Chinmoy the Dreamer of a Peace-filled World Award. The plaque is mounted on a traditional gourd or ‘Ipu’. The text of the plaque is as follows:]</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em><br /><em>Dreamer of a Peace-Filled World</em><br /><em>ka mea moemoe i ao lkahi</em><br /><em>Presented December 7, 1998</em><br /><em>University of Hawai’i</em></p>
<p>[Sri Chinmoy offers a musical performance.]</p>
<p>{{{fleuron}}}</p>
<p><em>Dr. Majid Tehranian</em>: December 7th, as we all know, was the day that the war in the Pacific was started here in Pearl Harbor. It is extraordinarily fitting that on such an anniversary we should be presenting this plaque, this symbol of peace, everlasting peace, for the New Millennium to a man who is a dreamer of a peace-filled world: Sri Chinmoy.</p>
<p>Let me add at the conclusion of this beautiful ceremony, that we all need to be thankful for the Heavenly music that we have just heard and the beautiful faces that we have seen. Let me also remind you that this need not be a one-day affair. The celebration of the spirit of peace must fill every moment of our lives.</p>  </div>
