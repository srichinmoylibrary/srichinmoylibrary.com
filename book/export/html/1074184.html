<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I see you right now, is it my imagination? It is so vivid. The fairy world, like other worlds, is also a reality. You can either enter into these worlds or these worlds can enter into you. Only then will these worlds be a reality for you. I say that I was born in India and that such a place exists. Your mind will believe this to some extent, because you have studied about India in school. But when it is a matter of India’s becoming a real reality for you, then you have to see the place. Here also, the fairy world one can really see. But unfortunately my disciples are not blessed with that capacity. It is not at all necessary to use the third eye. If one can have a childlike consciousness, the consciousness of a three-year-old, then one can easily see the fairy world. For that world is a children’s world; it is not the world of grownups and mature individuals. So you can use either your third eye or you can use your innocence and simplicity to see the fairy world. Again, if you can remain in my consciousness for even two minutes, you will definitely see it. So this is not a mental hallucination. The fairy world is a reality.</p>  </div>
