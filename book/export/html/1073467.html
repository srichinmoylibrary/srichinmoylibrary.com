<p>At the Los Angeles Olympics a good many observers — including even his so-called admirers — criticised Carl Lewis ruthlessly for not making the six attempts that he was officially allowed in the long jump. But his first jump was more than enough to prove his supreme supremacy. If the observers, and especially his admirers, had been wise and kind enough, they would have been happy with his decision. For he still had to run 200 metres the following days, as well as the relay. He made us happy by becoming first in the long jump. Let us admire heartily and unreservedly the confidence-emperor in him and not the critics and the curiosity-mongers who just wanted to see how he would fare with his other jumps.</p>
