<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A seeker is not forced to love anybody, not even God. A seeker's love is always spontaneous; it comes from the inmost recesses of his heart. In the heart, everything is spontaneous. In the mind, love is something we force, and in the vital, also, sometimes we force it. But in the aspiring heart, the love that we see and feel for God and for aspiring humanity is spontaneous. We cannot separate the heart's consciousness or the psychic consciousness from spontaneity. We cannot say that a seeker <em>must</em> love God, but we can easily say that a sincere, genuine seeker <em>will</em> love God, for God Himself is all Love.</p>
