<p>I need more. I need more peace. I need more joy. Peace I need in my mind. Joy I need in my heart.</p>
<p>I need more. I need more soulfulness. I need more selflessness. Soulfulness I need in my vital. Selflessness I need in my body.</p>
<p>I need more. I need more determination. I need more perfection. Determination I need in my aspiration. Perfection I need in my dedication.</p>
<p>I need more. I need more Compassion. I need more cooperation. Compassion I need from my Beloved Supreme in my very existence-reality. Cooperation I need from humanity in all that I do, all that I say and all that I grow into.</p>
<p>When I have more peace in my mind, more joy in my heart, more soulfulness in my vital, more selflessness in my body, more determination in my aspiration, more perfection in my dedication, more Compassion from God and more cooperation from humanity, at that time I shall become a most perfect instrument of God in the inner world and a most perfect representative of mankind in the outer world. I need more, I need more.</p>
