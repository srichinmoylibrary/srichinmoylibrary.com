<p>Successful was I<br />   When I did business<br /> With God and God alone.</p>
<p>I gave Him my centuries' possession:<br />   Ignorance.<br /> He gave me His Eternity's possession:<br />   Love.</p>
<p>Happy was I<br />   When the all-forgiving Compassion<br /> Of the Lord Supreme<br />   Married the extremities of my ceaseless pride.</p>
