<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, do I have any liberated souls among my disciples? I want my disciples to meditate here and then to go and work divinely. Aspire and manifest. They both go together. While you are manifesting, you are aspiring; manifestation itself is a form of aspiration. You cannot separate manifestation from aspiration. While you are manifesting anything, you are aspiring for further knowledge, for further light, for further wisdom.</p>  </div>
