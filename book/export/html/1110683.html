<p>If God-realisation is the object of our curiosity, it is useless. If it is a whim, it is useless. If it is a hope, then we shall accept it in our inner life. But if it is a promise to God and to ourselves, then we must take it as our living breath. Without breathing we cannot live. Similarly, if we take God-realisation as a most solemn promise to God and to ourselves, then God-realisation is an inevitable reality both for the seeker and for the Master.</p>
<p>So, we have to see if God-realisation is a matter of curiosity, a whim, a hope or a promise. If it is a promise, then it is absolutely inevitable, and it is the real fulfilment of life.</p>  </div>
