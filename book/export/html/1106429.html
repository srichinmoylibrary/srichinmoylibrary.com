<p>You will notice when you watch the video of my 200-pound double-arm lift from this morning that my screaming is not as loud as before. This is definitely not my 100 per cent effort. It is only 85 or 90 per cent. If I give more effort, I will scream more loudly, but this height is more than enough for my regular practice.</p>
