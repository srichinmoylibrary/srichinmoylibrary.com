<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Western philosophy says, “Truth there is. You can see the Truth.” Eastern philosophy says, “No doubt, Truth there is. One can not only see the Truth, but also feel the Truth and become the Truth.” Western philosophy does not go that far. Western philosophy says, “Truth is there, somewhere high, very high. It is accessible, but not always.” Eastern philosophy says, “Truth is always accessible. Truth can be achieved, and then one can grow into Truth.” Here Eastern philosophy has made bold to say that one can become Truth. Western philosophy has not come so far.</p>
<p>Again, just to say that the Truth exists — either on this earth planet or in some other world — is one of the great contributions of Western philosophy to the evolution of mankind.</p>  </div>
