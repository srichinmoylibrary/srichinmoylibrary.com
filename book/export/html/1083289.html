<p>I have a devoted and sincere policeman disciple at my Jamaica, West Indies, Centre. When he came and sat in front of me during our first interview, I said to him, "So, Joseph, when I steal something, you will be the first person to arrest me." He immediately said, "Yes, sir. But I have come here to beg of you to steal my heart first. To you I offer my entire life. I wish to be yours, devotedly yours."</p>  </div>
