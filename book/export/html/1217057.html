<p>When we left, the Archbishop came out to the street, right up to our car, to say goodbye. He was very, very nice.</p>
<p>In the beginning, he was very friendly, but he wanted to maintain his dignity and height. But, after a minute or two, he came down to our level and talked and talked.</p>
<p>The pictures will show everything. You can see how happy he was, specially when he was holding our Peace Torch. At the end, he took out his appointment book and wrote in my concert on the 26th.</p>
