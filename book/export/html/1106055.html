<p>My dear Supreme, my sweet Supreme,<br /> My Lord Supreme, my Beloved Supreme,<br /> My Absolute Master Supreme,<br /> May my mind thank You most sincerely<br /> For all the things that it has received from You.<br /> May my heart thank You most soulfully<br /> For all the things that You have not given<br /> To my heart.</p>
<p>My Supremely Beloved Supreme,<br /> My Absolute Master Supreme,<br /> Am I correct in saying and in feeling<br /> That my mind's world-possession-hunger<br /> Has made me enormously happy?</p>
<p>My Absolute Master Supreme,<br /> My Supremely Beloved Supreme,<br /> Am I perfect in saying and in feeling<br /> That my heart's bondage-renunciation-flight<br /> Has made You proudly happy?</p>
<p>"My child, My Eternity's Dream-child,<br /> My Infinity's Reality-being,<br /> In the world of your mind<br /> You are definitely correct,<br /> And in the world of your heart<br /> You are absolutely perfect.<br /> With your mind's possession-world,<br /> You may make yourself powerful.<br /> With your heart's renunciation-life,<br /> You can and will<br /> Make My transcendental Dream beautiful<br /> And My universal Reality fruitful."</p>
