<p>I pray to God and meditate on God.</p>
<p>I pray to God because God is my Lord, my Sovereign Lord, my Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>I meditate on God because God is my Friend, my eternal Friend, my only Friend.</p>
<p>I pray to God because He is powerful and thoughtful.</p>
<p>I meditate on God because He is beautiful and fruitful.</p>
<p>I pray to God to see His Face of Height.</p>
<p>I meditate on God to feel His Heart of Delight.</p>
<p>I pray to God to grant me what He is.</p>
<p>I meditate on God to regain what I have lost.</p>
<p>I pray to God to show me the way.</p>
<p>I meditate on God to transform my life of ignorance-night into a life of wisdom-light.</p>
<p>I pray to God to become the sound-sky in my human life.</p>
<p>I meditate on God to become the silence-sun in my divine life.</p>
<p>In my desire-life I pray to God because I am my necessity's slave.</p>
<p>In my aspiration-life I meditate on God because God and I have become our necessity's mutual satisfaction.</p>
<p>My prayer breathlessly loves God's Compassion-Power.</p>
<p>My meditation unconditionally loves God's Justice-Light.</p>
<p>Salvation-gift I have received from my prayer.</p>
<p>Perfection-gift I have received from my meditation.</p>
<p>I pray to God and meditate on God.</p>
