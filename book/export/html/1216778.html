<p>A woman who came to our concert in Davies Hall was so moved by my singing and playing. Afterwards she wrote a long letter to our music store saying how happy she was to have been able to come because it was so worthwhile. Then, in the last line she said, "I have never heard God play on the flute before."</p>
<p>This time San Francisco gave me two "God" experiences. The other one occurred on the plane on the way home.</p>
