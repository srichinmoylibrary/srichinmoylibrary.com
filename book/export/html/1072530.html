<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The fastest way to increase aspiration is through self-dedication and self-giving. Self-giving contains the supreme secret of oneness with Godâ€™s Will. Before we do something, we have to feel that a divine force is acting in and through us. And when we do the thing and get the result either in the form of failure or success, we have to feel that this is the experience that the Unseen Hand wants us to have and we have to become one with that experience. If it is failure, we take it as an experience. If it is success, we also take it as an experience. Always we have to be one with the result and offer it at the Feet of the Supreme. In this way we make the fastest progress.</p>  </div>
