<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no basic link between spirituality and intelligence. We cannot tie spirituality and intelligence together. If you take spirituality as the living Breath of God, then it is also in human intelligence. But intelligence and mental discipline cannot serve the purpose of spiritual self-discipline for Self-realisation.</p>
<p>Intelligence is a quality of the human mind, not something in the soul. The mind cannot and will not give us our true wealth; whereas the soul will. Although a man may be vastly learned and intelligent, he need not be spiritual at all. There are people who are extremely intelligent, but they are wanting in the inner cry. If they do not have the inner cry, they will never reach the Goal. Mind will take them as far as it can, but that can never be to the ultimate Goal. That Goal can only be achieved through psychic aspiration.</p>  </div>
