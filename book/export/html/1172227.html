<p>"My Lord, I am always hungry for Your Love, Affection and Fondness. Are You hungry for anything?"</p>
<p>"Yes, My child, I am always hungry for your attachment."</p>
<p>"My Lord, You have all along told me that attachment is a very bad thing. How can You ask me to be attached to You?"</p>
<p>"My child, you know perfectly well that I am jealous of your attachment to your sisters and brothers. Since I love you so much and have so much Affection and Fondness for you, do I not have the right to ask you to be attached only to Me?"</p>
<p>"My Lord, as usual, Your Philosophy is so complicated!"</p>
<p>"My child, I love and admire your sincerity."</p>  </div>
