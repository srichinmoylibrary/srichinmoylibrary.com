<p>"O man, let Me have a heart-to-heart talk with you. Man, I love you and I serve you. But you do not believe in My Love, you do not believe in My Service. To My sorrow you suspect Me. To My sorrow you feel that My Love is binding you, binding you to the earth-bound reality. You feel that My Love has enchained you, entangled you, encaged you. You want to be a free bird, a free reality-existence, but you feel that My Love for you is binding you in every possible way. This is the realisation you have come to, man.</p>
<p>" I am having a heart-to-heart talk with you, so I wish to tell you that in no way am I binding you. I am only helping you, with My Love and with My Service, to become one with vastness, one with immensity, one with God’s Eternity, Infinity and Immortality, one with Oneness-Delight itself. This heart-to-heart talk of Mine, man, one day you will believe. One day you will have faith in My soulful Message, My Life’s breathless Message, that I have just offered to you."</p>
<p>“O Lord, let me have a heart-to-heart talk with you. O Lord Supreme, I do not love You, I do not serve You, in spite of the fact that at times I am fully determined to love You and serve You conditionally, even if it is not within my capacity to love You unconditionally. But alas, I fail to love You even conditionally; I fail to serve You even conditionally. My Lord Supreme, is it because I love mankind more than I love You? Is that why real love does not come from me towards You? Is it because You are not to be loved the way I want to love You, with all my earthly needs and heavenly needs, with all that I think of as my needs? Is it because I am self-sufficient without You? To be without man is not an impossibility; but to be without You is impossibility itself. But is it because to some extent I can live without You? When I live in my ignorance-night, I do not live in You or for You. Or is it because my pride, my disproportionate pride, finds it beneath its dignity to live with You inside mankind? Is it because of all this that I am separated from You and find it impossible to offer true love to You? My Lord, will I ever be able to love You devotedly, will I ever be able to serve You soulfully, will I ever be able to claim You as my own, very own, founded on the inner conviction that You are mine and I am Yours? Will I ever be able to serve You and love You to my heart’s content?”</p>
<p>“My child, what do you want? Do you want to love Me or do you want to prove to Me that you love Me? There is a great difference between your love for Me and your demonstration of love. Your love of Me and your wish to demonstrate your love for Me are two different things. You do not have to demonstrate your love to Me as long as you have the inner cry to love Me. This inner cry is not theoretical, but practicality itself. It is the height of practicality. I am the eternal Lover and you are My mirror, so you have to know that when I look at you I see My own reflection. Remain My mirror and My Love of you will be your love for Me, for I see Myself alone here on earth and there in Heaven. I do not see anything as something other than Myself. I do not see anybody as someone else. I see only Myself, My larger Self, My universal Self, through you, My mirror. Through you I see Myself, My own reflection. Therefore, you do not have to prove your love for Me. Just maintain your inner cry to love Me devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally. This inner cry is not only My divine Will in you, but it is also My supreme execution of My divine Will in and through you.</p>
<p>"I love My creation. Therefore, I live in My creation. If it just cries to love Me, that is more than enough. I need no other proof. That is proof itself: the cry, the cry, the soulful cry, only for Me, only for Me.”</p>
