<p>Quite often when I run, many songs appear inside my brain. This afternoon when I was running, two or three new songs came to my mind. Then, after I finished running, I had to sit down and notate the songs.</p>
<p>I will die, but I know my songs will live on. Indians, especially Bengalis, in every nook and cranny will sing my songs.</p>
