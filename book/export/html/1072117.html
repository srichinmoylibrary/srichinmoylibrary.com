  <h1 class="book-heading">Beauty II</h1>
  
 
<p>Beauty without light is a flower without fragrance. Beauty with light is a human being without ignorance.</p>
<p>The beauty of life is our purity's spontaneity. The beauty of truth is our sincerity's necessity. The beauty of God-realisation is our aspiration's divinity.</p>
<p>We look beautiful within when our passions die. We look more beautiful within when our inner flame mounts. We look most beautiful within when our sun of realisation bursts.</p>
<p>The power of beauty is an aspirant's manifested motherhood. The peace of beauty is an aspirant's fulfilled fatherhood. The bliss of beauty is an aspirant's transformed and divinised manhood.</p>
<p>When I am physically beautiful, God smiles. God smiles at me because I am using His own dress. When I am spiritually beautiful, God plays. God plays with me because He has got me as His own playmate.</p>
<p>He who does not become, spiritually, the pages of cosmic beauty, will one day ruthlessly be compelled to read the book of fate, by Ignorance. Not even God the Compassionate will hide the book of fate from him</p>
<p>If we start with the soul's beauty, we can end in the Supreme's transcendental Reality. Let us start.</p>  </div>
