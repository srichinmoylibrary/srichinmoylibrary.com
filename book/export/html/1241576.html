<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That joking is infinitely better than brooding and sulking and speaking ill of others â€” infinitely better! You are lightening yourself when you joke, when you enjoy the humour aspect. Is there anybody among the spiritual Masters who did not like jokes? Sri Aurobindo enjoyed humour very much. So did Sri Ramakrishna. All the spiritual Masters enjoyed humour.</p>
<p>Humour takes away the mental fever, not only the physical fever. To take away the fever that we have inside the mind, humour is the best medicine.</p>  </div>
