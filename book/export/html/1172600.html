<p>NARRATOR: All the cosmic gods are present. Surya and Sanjnaâ€™s wedding takes place. Now Surya has become the happiest god. Once again he draws his chariot across the heavens with enormous delight. Earth is extremely happy with their marriage, since earth is once more getting sunshine. Heaven is happy, since Heaven is getting illumination as before. Sanjna is appreciated, admired and adored by everyone.</p>  </div>
