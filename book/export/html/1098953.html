<p>One day my friend Mr. Gruber took me to show me his ice skating skills. We went to a large, round outdoor place in Manhattan. I believe it was Rockefeller Center. He was 80 years old and I was only 33, but I did not know how to skate on the ice. He was so full of energy and he was going round and round so fast.</p>
<p>Poor me! I was only watching and watching from the side.</p>  </div>
