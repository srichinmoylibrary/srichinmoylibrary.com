Also, he felt that he had more love for the Master and more faith in the Master than the President. He said to the President, “Do you really have all faith in the Master, or is it just a pretence?”</p>
<p>The President said, “I do have faith, all faith, in my Master.”</p>
<p>“If you have faith, then it is all fanatic faith. If the Master asks you to jump off the fifth floor, will you immediately jump?”</p>
<p>The President said, “Of course, of course. ”</p>
<p>When sincerity came forward, the man felt from within that he did not have that kind of faith in the Master. Then he said to himself, “Since I am not as good as this man, who is to blame? The Master. How is it that he didn’t give me this kind of faith? Since I lost that case, for me the best thing is to leave.”</p>  </div>
