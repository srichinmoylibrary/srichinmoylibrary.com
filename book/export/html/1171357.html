<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Angels live indefinitely, not eternally. There is a great difference between indefinitely and eternally. Indefinite means that after twenty years, two hundred years or four hundred years, either they will take human incarnation or they will be dissolved. Some angels do not want to come down in a manifested form, with a gross human body. After a few centuries they want to be freed from their form.</p>
<p>Some angels want to go to another place. It is not like humans who, after eighty or ninety years, become old and die. No, only they are tired of playing their roles. They do not want to play the same role eternally. Either they will take human incarnation or they will go to some other planet to live. They have worked hard, so they want to enjoy vacation or, you can say, retirement.</p>  </div>
