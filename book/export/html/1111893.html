<p>The morning after the marathon, I ran seven miles. That shows what kind of marathon I ran! I hardly had to walk forty metres. There was no humidity, and I didn't even have to drink. During the marathon sometimes I drank every eight hundred metres!</p>
<p>After five and a half miles I started walking. At that time a man ran by me and said to me, "No walking, no walking!"</p>
<p>Then I started running again, and after half a mile, I saw the same gentleman, walking. I said to him, "It is not good to walk."</p>
<p>He said to me, "But while I was running, I was running faster than you are running!"</p>
<p>So we were two jokers.</p>
