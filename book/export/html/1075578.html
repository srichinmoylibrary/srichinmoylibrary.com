<p>Lord, please do not mind.<br /> Today I have<br /> The most difficult question<br /> For You.<br /> If You do not know the answer,<br /> Just tell me so.<br /> I shall understand.<br /> But if You know the answer,<br /> Then You have to answer me<br /> Most sincerely<br /> And<br /> With no reservations whatsoever.<br /> Lord, here is my question:<br /> Is the world really progressing<br /> Or<br /> Is the world really regressing?</p>
<p>"Daughter, you are most proud<br /> Of your question<br /> And<br /> I am most proud<br /> Of My answer.<br /> Here is My answer:<br /> The world is definitely progressing<br /> For those who know that<br /> I am the Creator<br /> And<br /> I am the Owner<br /> Of this world,<br /> And<br /> The world is unthinkably regressing<br /> For those who think that<br /> They are the owners<br /> And<br /> They are the rulers<br /> Of this world."</p>
