<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one follows the spiritual path, then one has to meditate at least once a day. This is obligatory; otherwise, it is useless to follow the spiritual path. It is better to meditate at least three times a day, but if it is not possible to feed your soul three times, then please feed it at least once. I am telling this to all of you. At least once a day you have to feed the soul. Feel that the soul is a little child, a divine child. If you don't feed the soul, then it will starve and your divine manifestation will be delayed.</p>
<p>So, if possible, you should meditate at least three times a day: early in the morning, at noon or during your lunch hour, and in the evening. Your morning and evening meditation should be for a longer time, that is to say, half an hour, and your meditation at noon should be for five or ten minutes. If possible, on some days try to meditate seven times for ten minutes or fifteen minutes each time. Seven is an occult number. It carries great significance. But this does not mean that you will only count the number of times and not how soulfully you meditate. You may meditate seven times a day, but it has to be done most soulfully. If you feel that you can meditate soulfully only once, early in the morning, then that is enough. You have to see your real capacity, sincerity, willingness and joy.</p>  </div>
