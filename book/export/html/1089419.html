<p>Shyama Charan Lahiri was born on September 30th, 1828, in the village of Ghurni, on the banks of the Jalangi River, near Krishnanagar, in Bengal. After his mother passed away in 1833, his father, Gaur Mohan Lahiri, took Shyama Charan with him to live in Benaras [Varanasi].</p>
<p>In 1846, Shyama Charan was married to Srimati Kashimani. Two sons, Tinkori and Dukori, and three daughters, Harimoti, Harikamini and Harimohini, blessed the union.</p>
<p>In 1851 Shyama Charan took the post of clerk in the Military Engineering Department of the British Government. He received many promotions during his time of service and was transferred at different times to its offices in Gazipur, Mirzapur, Naini Tal, Danapur and Benaras.</p>
<p>It was in his thirty-third year that Shyama Charan met his Guru, Babaji, near Ranikhet in the Himalayas and was initiated by him into <em>Kriya Yoga</em>.</p>
<p>Dronagiri Mountain of Dronagiri Valley in the Himalayas — the place where Lahiri Mahashoy was reunited with Babaji — has an elevation of 8,000 feet. It was in this valley and its surrounding mountains that the great Dronacharya often meditated, hence it was named after him. It is also called Dunagiri Hill.</p>
<p>In the beginning of his married life, Lahiri Mahashoy worked hard to support his family. After he retired in 1886, he remained at his house in Benaras. There he interpreted 26 of the sacred scriptures. Day and night he used to received a stream of visits from his disciples and those who wanted to be initiated into <em>Kriya Yoga</em>.</p>
<p>Lahiri Mahashoy left the body on September 26th, 1895.</p>  </div>
