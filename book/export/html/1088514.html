<p>How tremendously "the Lion of the Punjab" fought, how terribly he suffered after he had thrown himself headlong into the battle of freedom! Lala Lajpat Rai was definite in his assertion that independence could be achieved only by our own efforts, and that to depend on British generosity would be to cry in the wilderness. He had little sympathy with Gandhi-ji's non-cooperation. He knew what fighting means. To our country's cause he consecrated his whole life, his all.</p>
<p>The Trinity of India's national independence movement, started in the first decade of this century, was Lal-Bal-Pal. The harmonious blend of these three great names, as of their minds and hearts, still gives a thrill of joy and gratitude to the memory of the nation.</p>  </div>
