<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Seekers of the infinite Truth, who walk along the path of spirituality, will be able to know what is right and what is wrong because at every moment they try to listen to their inner voice or, you can say, their conscience. The further we go along the path of reality, the deeper within we go, the clearer it becomes to us what is right and what is wrong. When we live on the surface, it is next to impossible for us to distinguish what is right from what is wrong. But when we follow the inner life and have the capacity to bring forward the messages we get from within, then at every moment we are safe.</p>
<p>The very purpose of spirituality is to have conscious oneness with the ultimate Truth. If somebody has this conscious oneness, naturally he will be able to distinguish right from wrong. Whoever practises the spiritual life has a special advantage as well. When he gets an inner message, he also gets the inner urge to obey the message. He gets additional inspiration or, let us say, aspiration, to do the right thing. But an ordinary person very often does the wrong thing in spite of knowing that he is doing something wrong. Why does he do it? Because his inner urge is not strong enough to compel him to do the right thing. In the case of a spiritual seeker, it is otherwise. When a seeker feels from within what is the right thing to do, he also gets abundant capacity from within to do it.</p>
