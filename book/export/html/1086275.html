<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, do not jump from half an hour to one hour. Continue for one month, two months or three months meditating for the same length of time. Otherwise one day you will meditate for half an hour more and the next day you may not meditate even for one second. So it is like eating or taking exercise. One day you will eat too much and the next day you will have stomach problems. Or if you have the capacity to do five push-ups and then one day you get inspired and do twenty, the following day you won't even be able to go to the gym because your arms will feel broken; they will be full of pain. So always increase your capacity slowly; then you will have no difficulty.</p>  </div>
