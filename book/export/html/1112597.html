  <h1 class="book-heading">Zatopek and the Russians</h1>
  
 
<p>In the running world, the Russians were Zatopek's worst enemies. Sometimes he used to break a world record and hold it only for a few days before the Russians would break it. The Russians tried in so many ways to defeat him. They used to give him bad advice. Outwardly they pretended to be very good friends, but often they told him everything wrong so that he would practice wrong and then lose. That kind of trick he didn't play on the Russians.</p>  </div>
