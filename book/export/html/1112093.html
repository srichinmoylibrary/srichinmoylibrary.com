<p>After the race a man came up to me and asked, "Sri Chinmoy, how is your leg injury?" He was not a disciple, so how did he know about my leg?</p>
<p>I said, "I am getting better."</p>
<p>Then he said, "I understand that by your birthday you want to complete a thousand miles. How many miles have you completed?"</p>
<p>I said, "Not even 600."</p>
<p>He said, "You must finish it before your birthday!"</p>
<p>He was not a disciple, but he knew all about my secret promise!</p>
<p>â€” 13 July 1985</p>  </div>
