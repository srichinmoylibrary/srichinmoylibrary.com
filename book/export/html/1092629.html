<p>February 21, 1878</p>
<p>O Asia, O Ind, O tree<br /> And the high and proud enormous bough.<br /> Devour your blind and naked pride.<br /> The time is ripe for you to bow</p>
<p>With all your great past blotted out.<br /> Ours alone is the Mother of gleam.<br /> The One has fertilised your large land<br /> To reap in mirth the Light supreme;</p>
<p>Therefore your haughtiness knew no bound.<br /> A galaxy of flames and seers,<br /> Avatars were born in you to found<br /> The Life divine in a world of tears,</p>
<p>And for the fusion of East and West.<br /> But all their efforts ended in smoke.<br /> Behold, the Mother's advent a Grace<br /> Protecting all with a sun-wide cloak.</p>
<p>She is the Bridge unique, divine<br /> Between the two extremities.<br /> Her Birth declares, "All souls will live<br /> With the One in a fire-pure release."</p>
