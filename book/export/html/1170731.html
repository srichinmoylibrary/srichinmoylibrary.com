<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, but it is the soul's continuity. It is all the experience of the soul, which is the divine in us. The soul is one hundred percent divine, whereas the heart, mind and vital are not fully divine. In each incarnation the soul tries to illumine the heart, mind and vital. The soul has taken up the challenge to perfect all the members of the family. Sometimes it is so painful: the soul is begging the mind to be more divine, but the mind will not listen.</p>  </div>
