 <p>
UT 44-50. U Thant’s death left the whole world deeply bereaved. These are some reminiscences about the late Secretary-General.</p>
<h2>Kurt Waldheim</h2>

<p>Why does the world remember U Thant? We are extremely fortunate to have the most apposite answer by none other than his great successor Kurt Waldheim: “His integrity and his courage were rooted in his firm Buddhist faith and in an unshakable belief in humanity and in the necessity of improving the quality of lives of all mankind. We remember him for his achievements and for the difficulties he faced in presiding over our Organization for ten tumultuous years.”</p>  </div>
