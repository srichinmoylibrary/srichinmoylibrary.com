<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We don't believe in hell according to the way the Christian belief goes. We believe that hell is right inside us and heaven is also right inside us. It is all in the mind. This moment, I am thinking of something good, something divine. I pray, I meditate and I try to offer the inner light that I have gained from my meditation and prayers. This is when I am living in heaven. But this moment, if I think evil of you, criticise you and cherish wrong thoughts about you, then I am in perfect hell. Hell we create. Heaven we create. With our divine thoughts we are creating heaven. Again, with our wrong thoughts, silly thoughts, undivine thoughts, we are creating hell within us.</p>  </div>
