<p><em>Question:</em> Is there a spiritual way to break bad habits?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly there is. Before you do anything always meditate for a minute or at least for a few seconds. The power of that meditation will enter into the bad habit like an arrow. Meditation, the soldier, will use his divine arrows against bad habits. This is absolutely the best way.</p>  </div>
