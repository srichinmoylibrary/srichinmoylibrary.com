<p>Mine is a vision, a God-Vision.<br /> Mine is a mission, a God-Mission.<br /> Mine is a satisfaction, a God-Satisfaction.<br /> Mine is a perfection, a God-Perfection.</p>
<p>He who has a simple heart<br />   Can be with me in my vision.</p>
<p>He who has a sincere life<br />   Can be with me in my mission.</p>
<p>He who has a dauntless soul<br />   Can be with me in my God-Satisfaction.</p>
<p>He who has perfect beauty, inner and outer<br />   Can be with me in my God-Perfection.</p>
