<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am sure that you always think of your ego. When you concentrate on the limited consciousness, you will be more bound in your outer life. If you really want to get rid of your ego, then think of your soul always. Take the positive side. Try to have an inseparable oneness with the Vast. With your eyes wide open try to feel your own identity with the vast sky, the infinite sky. It is on the strength of your identification that you will be bound or freed. Vastness will free you, whereas the puny ego will bind you ruthlessly.</p>  </div>
