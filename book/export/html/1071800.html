<p>How to conquer deception? When you deceive someone, think that you possess the capacity only to please yourself and nobody else. Hence your capacity to achieve joy is very limited. Your life is so meaningless that you cannot please even one person more than your tiny self in this vast world. But if you allow the fragrance of sincerity to enter into you, it will not only please you, but please all human beings.</p>
