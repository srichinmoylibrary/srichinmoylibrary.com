<p>In the evening of his life, my father taught everything to my brother Chitta. Then, during the last ten or twelve years of my father's life, if there was any problem involving the family, my father would say, "Go to Chitta. He knows better than I do." My father had such confidence in Chitta! When you see that somebody else in your family can do your job well, it is such a relief. You get tremendous joy because you are the one who taught him.</p>  </div>
