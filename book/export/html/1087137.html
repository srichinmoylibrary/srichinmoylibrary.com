<p>After I finished shopping on Jamaica Avenue, one of the boys was supposed to come and collect me. I waited and waited for the car, but it did not come. Finally, I started walking home, carrying a huge bag.</p>
<p>The manager of Marine Midland Bank noticed me walking by and knocked on the window, waving for me to come in. So I went into the bank and we talked. He told me his daughter is studying yoga in Sarama's class.</p>
