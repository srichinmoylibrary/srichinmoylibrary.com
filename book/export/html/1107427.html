<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, when you breathe through the left nostril, please try to invoke the moon, the moon aspect, which is peace. You will see that you get peace and serenity and all the other mild qualities. When you breathe through the right nostril, please try to invoke the sun, and then you will get the dynamic aspect of the Divine. If you fail to invoke this pure, dynamic aspect, you won't get peace; rather, you will become lethargic and idle. But if you consciously invoke the moon by breathing from the left side, then you get actual peace and tranquility.</p>
<p>Suppose you feel that you have much to do, but have a limited time. For example, if one hour is all that you can spend on a difficult task, or if you are taking heavy exercise, then you will see that both your nostrils are functioning.</p>
<p>There are three channels of energy in the subtle body. The left channel corresponds with the left nostril and is called <em>Ida.</em> The right channel corresponds with the right nostril and is called <em>Pingala</em>. The middle channel is called <em>Sushumna</em>. If your conscious energy comes from the base of the spine through the <em>Sushumna</em> channel right up through your forehead, and if it pierces through the thousand-petalled lotus at the crown of your head, then you are carried to the highest <em>nirvana</em>. If you wish, you can practise breathing through the left nostril, then through the right nostril, and then through both. You can practise this daily.</p>
<p>Some people do not know how to breathe properly. Another problem some people have is that they sleep right on their chest, which is an absurd way of sleeping. At that time the <em>Ida</em>, <em>Pingala</em> and <em>Sushumna</em> cannot function at all. You always should face the Light when you are sleeping. If you sleep on your back or your side, you are receiving some Light. But if you sleep on your chest, immediately you have obstructed the Light.</p>  </div>
