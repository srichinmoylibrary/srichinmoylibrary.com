<p>Discipline! Perhaps I was born with discipline. In India I lived a disciplined life. Here in America also, if I did not believe in discipline and regularity, I could not accomplish so many things every day. Punctuality I miss sometimes, but regularity really saves me.</p>
<p>Regularity is of paramount importance for all my spiritual children. Again, punctuality is infinitely better; but if you fail in punctuality, at least stick to regularity. We need regularity, regularity, regularity. There is no other way to accomplish something great and good.</p>
