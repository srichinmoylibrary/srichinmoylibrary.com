<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can get rid of your expectation by knowing that most of your expectations end not only in frustration, but also in self-destruction. Anything that attempts to destroy you is not healthy. So do not expect anything; just do the needful. Then you will get infinitely more than you expected. If you play the role of expectation, then at each moment you will want something more. If you do not expect anything, but only do what you feel is best, then your expectation will be fulfilled beyond your imagination.</p>  </div>
