    <title>&lt;em&gt;Mr. Utsunomiya:&lt;/em&gt; One effect of nuclear war we experienced in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is that far more children and women and civilians were killed than soldiers. Most of the military leaders survived. This is not a war in the classical tradition. Classically, war was fought by uniformed people, military experts, professionals. But in a nuclear war, such as we experienced in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, far more innocent people were killed. This fact should be remembered by all.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! In bygone days hero-warriors used to fight with one another. Civilians and innocent people did not come into the picture. If you wanted to fight, you issued a challenge and fought. But those who didn't believe in fighting, those who wanted to remain peaceful, were not bothered. Now war is like a mad elephant. A mad elephant doesn't know who is an innocent bystander and who is the enemy. It just destroys.</p>
<p>Previously, warfare was like a contest between two boxers. A boxer is not going to come out into the street to hurt people. A wrestler is not going to go out into the street to throw people into the air. A wrestler will fight with other wrestlers. A boxer will fight with other boxers. But now, innocent people who have nothing to do with boxing or wrestling are being destroyed. It is so ridiculous, so painful!</p>  </div>
