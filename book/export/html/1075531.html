  <h1 class="book-heading">996. Three clever world-souls</h1>
  
 

<p>Krishna, Krishna,<br /> Hurry up, hurry up!<br /> Come down, come down!<br /> The world needs your immediate presence.<br /> "Chinmoy, I am in deep meditation.<br /> For God's sake, don't disturb me."<br /> Thank you, Krishna,<br /> You have always been clever.</p>
<p>Thakur, Thakur,<br /> Look, look! Earth needs<br /> Your presence desperately.<br /> "Chinmoy, I am sorry.<br /> My Mother has given me<br /> Much work to do here, upstairs.<br /> Therefore<br /> I simply can't think<br /> Of going downstairs.<br /> I am sorry."<br /> Thank you, Thakur.<br /> You too have become clever.</p>
<p>Naren, Naren,<br /> Once more Mother-Earth<br /> Needs your warrior-heart<br /> To fight against ignorance-night.<br /> "Chinmoy, tell Mother-Earth<br /> That I have been fighting<br /> More powerfully, more devotedly,<br /> For her from here,<br /> Against her Ignorance-Night.<br /> Therefore<br /> She does not need my<br /> Physical presence."<br /> Thank you, Naren.<br /> I shall be also as clever<br /> As you are,<br /> When my turn comes.</p>

<p>Lord, please do not mind.<br /> Today I have<br /> The most difficult question<br /> For You.<br /> If You do not know the answer,<br /> Just tell me so.<br /> I shall understand.<br /> But if You know the answer,<br /> Then You have to answer me<br /> Most sincerely<br /> And<br /> With no reservations whatsoever.<br /> Lord, here is my question:<br /> Is the world really progressing<br /> Or<br /> Is the world really regressing?</p>
<p>"Daughter, you are most proud<br /> Of your question<br /> And<br /> I am most proud<br /> Of My answer.<br /> Here is My answer:<br /> The world is definitely progressing<br /> For those who know that<br /> I am the Creator<br /> And<br /> I am the Owner<br /> Of this world,<br /> And<br /> The world is unthinkably regressing<br /> For those who think that<br /> They are the owners<br /> And<br /> They are the rulers<br /> Of this world."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">999. Never commit suicide</h1>
  
 

<p>Lord, sweet Lord,<br /> I do many things to please You.<br /> Have I done anything in this life<br /> To displease You?<br /> "Daughter, you have."</p>
<p>Father, I have displeased You!<br /> Tell me, how?<br /> "Daughter, time and again<br /> You have desired<br /> To commit suicide."<br /> Oh that, that's nothing.<br /> Look, I am still with You<br /> And for You on earth.</p>
<p>Father, is there any punishment involved<br /> When one commits suicide?<br /> "Daughter, punishment is a gross understatement.<br /> My Eye of Justice<br /> Does not forgive the coward<br /> Who takes her life away.<br /> My Heart of Compassion<br /> Ignores her.<br /> I welcome Satan<br /> To devour her."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1000. Two creators</h1>
  
 

<p>Father Supreme,<br /> I wanted to offer You<br /> One thousand Love-Devotion-Surrender blossoms<br /> From my heart-garden.<br /> I am so happy that my Dream<br /> Has seen the face of Reality.<br /> Today.<br /> Father Supreme,<br /> Are You not proud of me?</p>
<p>"Son, My praising Capacity<br /> Is very limited.<br /> Therefore<br /> Either I have to praise<br /> My creation —<br /> You, My son —<br /> Or<br /> I have to praise<br /> Your creation —<br /> Your poetry, your child.<br /> Son, I hope you do not mind,<br /> I am and I want to remain proud<br /> Only of My own creation."</p>
