<p>When I play tennis at the Ambarrukmo Palace Hotel, about fifteen or twenty children always stand outside the fence behind me and watch. And they always take my side.</p>
<p>When Mahiyan makes a good shot, they don't say anything. But when I do well, they are so happy.</p>
<p>Those children are more attentive than some of my disciples. Some of the disciples lie down or chat while I am playing, but the children watch attentively.</p>
