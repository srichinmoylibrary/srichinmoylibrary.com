<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The relationship between sound and soul is the relationship between the cage and the bird. The bird is the soul and the sound is the cage. Now when the soul-bird is inside the sound, inside the body, inside the cage, it will reach for its own manifestation. For its own manifestation the soul uses the cage, and for its own realisation the sound uses the bird.</p>  </div>
