<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no such thing as evil and good. There is only lesser light and greater light. An illumined being will know where there is light in boundless measure and where there is only a small amount of light. What has very little light, others will call evil, or darkness, or destruction; but he will simply call it lesser light. Just because he is in touch with the infinite Light, he will be able to bring down the infinite Light where the infinite Light is wanting. If there is an iota of light, he will bring down more light; if there is abundant light, he will bring down boundless Light. This is what he will do.</p>  </div>
