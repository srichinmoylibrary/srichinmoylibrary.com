<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not have to worry about what will happen in the future, even if I do not leave behind one perfect or first-class disciple, not to speak of an unconditionally surrendered disciple. Why? Because my creations will stand for me. True, some of my writings, my paintings, my birds, my songs and so forth may be third class, fourth class, even no class! But some of them have touched the very heights of divinity. The quintessence of many of the most sacred books of the past you will find in my writings, and I have composed many prayerful and soulful songs. Again, the soul-birds that I have drawn have abundant inner light. So my writings, my paintings and my music, which are my children, will continue to manifest my light.</p>  </div>
