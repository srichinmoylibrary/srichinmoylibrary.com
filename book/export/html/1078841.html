<p>Many, many years ago I started praying. One day God, my Beloved Supreme, came up to me and said, “I am satisfied with you, My son. I am granting you Peace.”</p>
<p>I kept praying. A few years later He came to me and said, “I am pleased with you, My son. I am granting you Light.”</p>
<p>I kept praying. A few years later my Lord Supreme came again. He said, “I am pleased with you, My son. I am giving you Delight, Nectar-Delight.”</p>
<p>I kept praying and a few years later He came and said, “Son, I have given you Peace, I have given you Light, I have given you Delight. What more do you want? Is there anything else that you want? Is there anything else that you need? If one has Peace, Light and Delight, one has everything. Inside Peace, Light and Delight is world-power, world-satisfaction, world-oneness, world-fulfilment.” I remained silent, and I kept on praying. My Lord left in silence, granting me a sweet little smile.</p>
<p>A few years later He came and said to me, “I see what you want. You want to become like Me, another God. Look, in the twinkling of an eye I am making you into another God. Are you satisfied?” I kept silent; I kept praying, praying.</p>
<p>He said, “I have made you like Me, another God. Even then you have to pray? What else do you need? Peace, Light, Delight, oneness, equality — everything I have given you. What more do you need? What more?” I remained silent. I kept praying.</p>
<p>My Lord said, “I know what you want. You want to play hide-and-seek with Me. You want to play the game of divine Lover and supreme Beloved with Me. This is what you want. I grant you this boon.” I gave my Lord a soulful smile and He granted me His all-loving, all-energising and all-fulfilling Embrace.</p>
