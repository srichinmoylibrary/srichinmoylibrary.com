<p>Subhas did not find it difficult to believe<br /> That the necessity of a spiritual Master<br /> Is of paramount importance<br /> For a free access to the inner realms<br /> Of Light, Power and Bliss.<br /> And he also had the inner conviction<br /> That the Master always knows infinitely more<br /> Than the disciple himself<br /> About his own life.</p>
