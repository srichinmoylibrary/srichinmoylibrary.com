<p>I said to Nolini-da: "I would be extremely happy if you would write something on Vivekananda."</p>
<p>"Chinmoy, I have already told you many times that I do not write either under compulsion or by impulse. Even though the whole world will be dancing during the coming year to commemorate the Vivekananda centennial, I don't like the idea of joining them unless I get the inner inspiration. We always have to keep in front of us our divine ideal and supreme goal.</p>
<p>"Now, do me a favour. Go and bring gargling salt from the dispensary.</p>
<p>I went to the dispensary and brought him gargling salt. He was happy to receive it.</p>  </div>
