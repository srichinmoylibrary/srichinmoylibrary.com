<p>"God, every day I succeed in fooling You. Do You ever succeed in fooling me?"</p>
<p>"I don't try to fool you. I am quite considerate."</p>
<p>"In what way, God?"</p>
<p>"You know very well that I am better than you in every respect. In one way at least, I want you to be better than Me."</p>  </div>
