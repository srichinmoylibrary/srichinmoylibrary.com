<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, we don't take the help of the mind at all. We focus the attention of our entire being on the heart, but this attention is not coming from the mind. The body is a being with an existence which we claim as our very own. Let this existence focus its attention on the heart. Our concentration is coming from our inner awareness of the light inside our heart, not from our mind.</p>  </div>
