  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Is the Supreme going to create a new world?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He could definitely create a different world if He wanted to, but it seems that He is not going to create a totally new world. He is like a great-great-grandfather who enjoys watching His children, His children's children, and so forth. He enjoys the game. For Him it is a daily affair that his great-great-grandchildren fight and quarrel. Of course He wants the members of His family to lead a harmonious life, but He does not plan to destroy His entire creation for a new creation. He believes in evolution.</p>
<p>The Supreme has been feeding and nurturing His present creation for so many years. True, satisfaction is still a far cry. But if He decides to start all over from the beginning, He has an apprehension that His next world may be worse. So He continues with the hope that light will descend on this present family, and it will eventually be illumined. In the process of evolution there is no such thing as perfection descending from Above all of a sudden. Gradually, light has to be received, and then the difference between light and darkness has to be recognised. Otherwise we shall not value light.</p>  </div>
