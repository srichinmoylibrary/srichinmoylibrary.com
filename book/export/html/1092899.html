<p>One of Dilip's most poignant entreaties is recalled by him in his classic book Netaji the Man-Reminiscences.</p>
<p>[Dilip to Subhas:] "I want you to fulfil your life following your <em>swadharma,</em> to wit, the deepest call of your nature. Why waste it? Come along with me to Pondicherry."</p>
<p>"I know, Dilip," he retorted. "But I can't turn to Yoga, branded 'defeated' by life." His lips quivered and sparks flew from his eyes.</p>
<p>"But you are not defeated-yet. On the contrary, you are the idol of young Bengal...."</p>
<p>"...If I go with you into even a temporary seclusion, I am afraid I may not be able to come out again into the open with the fire of the fighter in me."</p>  </div>
