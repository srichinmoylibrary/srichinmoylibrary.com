<p>The other day my road crew was following me in a car as I was running. After I had run only six miles, a fisherman started screaming at me, "Keep on running, run faster." Then he asked, "How many miles have you run?"</p>
<p>The boys are such jokers. I had run only six miles, but they told him twelve miles.</p>
