<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The answer is very simple. What God has, or what God is, is not enough for you. If you can make yourself feel that God is enough for you, God is complete and God can make you complete, then thoughts about other people will go away. If you feel that by thinking of God, you will be able to get only ninety-nine dollars, and that if you think of your ex-wife you will be able to make it one hundred dollars, then naturally she will come into your mind. But if you feel that God is one hundred dollars, then you will not need to think of others. If God is enough for you, then your previous attachments will not come to plague you.</p>
<p>In one place, two persons cannot stay. An Indian Master once said, “If I have only one small room, then only God can stay there.” Your mind is a tiny room, let us say. The capacity of that room is very limited. Either God can stay there or man can stay there. There is not sufficient room for both. I am sure you have read my story, <em>Go Alone.</em><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> On that flimsy bridge only one person could go at a time, not two. If two had gone, then the bridge would have broken. The mind is also weak like that. If you try to keep God and your ex-wife there together, then the mind will collapse. The best thing is to keep only God. Always try to feel that God is more than enough for you. Then nobody else can come into your mind. What God has and what God is are more than enough for you or anybody. If you do not feel this, then immediately everybody will come into your mind.</p>
