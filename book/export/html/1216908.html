<p>In Japan they bow even when they open the elevator door for you. Yesterday after the Peace Concert, I bowed at least 200 times during the walk-past for seekers.</p>
<p>As each person passed in front of me, he would bow. So I also bowed. Then I would have to bow a second time to show that the meditation for that particular individual was over.</p>
<p>For me to bow so many times and then look up is very difficult for my neck. So yesterday I had very good neck exercises!</p>
<p>I thought that they would keep their hands at their sides, according to the Japanese tradition, but most of them walked by with folded hands.</p>
