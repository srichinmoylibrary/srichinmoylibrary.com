<p>The <em>Japan Times</em> had a very nice article about me, but it had a few mistakes. They showed a picture of me playing the cello, but they said I was playing the viola. They also said that I came to the West at the age of 13. When the facts are wrong but the writer means well, their loving concern touches my heart.</p>
