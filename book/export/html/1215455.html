  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Do you see unity in everything?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I see unity in everything. Unity is in everything, true. But at the same time, we can say that unity is the highest, the deepest plane of consciousness, whereas multiplicity is the plane of manifestation.</p>
<p>When we go deep within, at that time we see unity, we feel unity, we become unity. But again, when we come out, we see the play of multiplicity. It is from unity that multiplicity has come into existence. Let us imagine a tree right in front of us. A tree has branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. These are multiplicity. But when we look at the tree as a whole, immediately we see that there is unity. The leaves, branches, everything is functioning in a different way, but there is a basic unity. Deep within everything there is unity, but when we come into the field of manifestation, it is multiplicity.</p>  </div>
