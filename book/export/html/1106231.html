<p>I always give a very nice prayer before I lift, either silently or out loud. Today in my mind I was praying that either in the near or distant future I would lift the 2,000 pounds. But the phrase “in the near or distant future” was not coming out. I could not add that phrase to my prayer because God knew that it wouldn’t be in the near or distant future but in the immediate future.</p>
