<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to feel that the body is also a divine instrument. It is not only the heart or the soul that will work for God. The physical also has to work. If you bake a cake, or if you work at the press, or if you do any other service on the physical plane, feel that it comes directly from God. Feel that the inspiration is coming from God and you are just executing it. As the soul is necessary for the realisation of God, so also is the body necessary for the manifestation of God. You have to keep in mind that this body is not only a lump of flesh; the body is the instrument of manifestation. If you keep the instrument perfect, then only can the player play well. But if the instrument is bad, then what can you do? If you keep the instrument in good condition, then only can the player play. If you neglect the body, then how can the divine Player, God, use the body in His cosmic Game?</p>  </div>
