  <h1 class="book-heading">My Lord Supreme does not want</h1>
  
 
<p>My Lord Supreme does not want to know what I have done for Him. He just wants to know how I am. If He hears from me that I am happy, then He Himself becomes exceedingly happy. In unmistakable terms He tells me that my happiness is His real and only satisfaction.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme does not want to hear from me what I see in Him. He just wants to hear if I feel something sweet, pure and divine in the inmost recesses of my heart. He tells me that my life-elevating feelings are, without fail, as good as seeing something divinely illumining and supremely fulfilling in Him.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme does not want me to show Him how much I know. He just asks me to agree to become His oneness-companion. He tells me that in my oneness-life with Him I shall learn everything from Him. The past, the present and the future will be three open books.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme does not want me to prove to Him how much I love Him. He just wishes me to cry inwardly and soulfully and to smile outwardly and wholeheartedly. He tells me that my inner cry and my outer smile are more than enough to inundate Him with my love.</p>
