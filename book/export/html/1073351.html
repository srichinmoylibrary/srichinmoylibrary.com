<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You may call God by one name and I may call God by another name, but your God and my God are not really different. You may say that this is God and I may say that that is God, but when we attain the highest realisation we will both see God as the ultimate Truth. Therefore, let us call God the ultimate Truth,</p>  </div>
