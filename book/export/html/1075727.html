<p><em>(The residence of Rishi Rajnarayan Bose. He adores the formless Aspect of the Brahman.)</em></p>
<p>RISHI: Swarna, Swarna! Take your seat right beside me. Swarna, I had a dream last night. To me that dream seems more vivid than reality itself.</p>
<p>SWARNA: Father, may I have a share?</p>
<p>RISHI: Certainly, my dream concerns you much. You all know that I have been a votary of the Nirakara Brahman for a couple of decades. But now no more. I saw Him ... It is beyond my power of expression. My eyes swam in light and delight.</p>
<p>SWARNA: Who was it, Father?</p>
<p>RISHI: The Light of the world, Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>SWARNA: Where?</p>
<p>RISHI: My daughter, in you, in you and nowhere else. Since the small hours of the morning I have been a torrent of ecstasy. I have also seen the Gods bow down on their knees before Him, your coming son. Swarna, you are my matchless jewel.</p>
<p>SWARNA: Father, you are my greatest pride. You stand very high in the estimation of all. You are the polestar of the Nation. Your voice has rung out the inmost voice of India. Now it is my hope that God will make me worthy of your prophetic vision.</p>  </div>
