<p>After quite a few days of walking, Shivaji and his son reached a fort that belonged to Shivaji. It was Shivaji's order that the fort remain closed from sunset to dawn. No matter who came to the fort, the guard was not allowed to open the gate.</p>
<p>When King Shivaji and his son reached the fort, night had already fallen. The guard knew perfectly well that it was his King and the King's son who had come back after so many months. He also knew what kind of ordeal they had gone through. Still he would not open the gate.</p>
<p>The guard went to the roof of the fort and tied one end of a rope to a pillar. Then he climbed down the rope to the ground. As soon as he touched the ground, he fell at Shivaji's feet, crying and embracing him.</p>
<p>Shivaji was also crying because he was so proud that the guard was faithfully carrying out his order not to open the gate. The King and his son waited outside the fort until daybreak, even though the guard had the key.</p>  </div>
