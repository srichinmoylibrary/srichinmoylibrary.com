<p>The man with no experience is stone-blind.<br /> The man with experience possesses one eye.<br /> The man who has had realisation has two eyes.<br /> The man who cherishes union with the Supreme has three eyes.<br /> The man who will be able to possess a divinized body will have four eyes; and all the four eyes will guide the four directions.</p>
