<p>Ability is the soul's flow and the body's glow.</p>
<p>Ability is accomplishment. The outer accomplishments we see with our outer eyes. The inner accomplishments we see with our inner eye.</p>
<p>Our present ability-friends tell us that our future ability-friends are on their way. At any moment they may arrive. We shall cheerfully and unreservedly welcome them.</p>
<p>Ability is our inner life's strength and our outer life's length.</p>
<p>Ability is confidence. Confidence smiles. Who enjoys the smile most? God the aspiring and transcending man.</p>
<p>Ability tells us what we can do for ourselves. Ability's cheerful and soulful surrender to God's Will tells us what God's infinite Satisfaction-Power can and will do for us.</p>
<p>Ability unused, man is man the sad failure. Ability used, man is man the eternal runner. Ability divinely used, man is man the quick-blossoming God.</p>  </div>
