<p>This morning, after I had done my 7,000-pound lift, the disciples came to view the weight. It was on display in my house. Chayanika gets second prize. When she saw how huge it was, she cried and cried. Chayanika is a showcase! But Pragatiâ€™s mother gets first prize. When she came, I could not believe how she was crying and crying. Some disciples came and laughed and laughed. The best was Dhananjaya.</p>
