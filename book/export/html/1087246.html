<p>I was buying a gift in Bangkok. The price was 250 bahts. I offered the lady 150.</p>
<p>She said, "200."</p>
<p>I said, "No, 160." She didn't say anything, so I went up to 170. But there was still no sign that she would give it to me. After I said 180, I was about to go away.</p>
<p>Then she said, "Yes, you can have it."</p>
<p>I gave her 200 bahts, and she returned 30 to me. I said, "Why are you giving me 30? The price was 180."</p>
<p>She said, "No, I decided in my mind to sell when you said 170."</p>
<p>I said, "No, I agreed to pay 180," and I returned 10. She started jumping with joy and giggling. She was so happy that I gave her back 10 bahts.</p>
