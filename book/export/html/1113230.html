<p>"Chinmoy, can you go to Sisir (Director of the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education) and bring me a copy of the book of biographies of eminent scientists? I think he will have this book in the university library."</p>
<p>I immediately went to Sisir-da and told him that Nolini-da wanted to have a copy of that book.</p>
<p>He said to me: "Suniti is not here. When she comes back she will search for it, and if we have it she will take it to Nolini-da."</p>
<p>So I went back to Nolini-da's room and started working. Fifteen minutes later he came in and said: "Where is the book?"</p>
<p>"Sisir-da said he would send it with Suniti if they have a copy of it."</p>
<p>"What? Go immediately and see if he has that book. If he does not have it, then don't waste any more time. Go to Medhananda (the librarian of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram Library). I need that book urgently."</p>
<p>I went to Sisir-da. He said to me: "We don't have the book Nolini-da wants. Suniti says there is a book containing a few articles on the scientists, but it is a children's book. I am sure it will not serve Nolini-da's purpose.</p>
<p>I said to him: "You could have sent Suniti to Nolini-da. He has been waiting for the book and you promised to send it."</p>
<p>He said: "Well, I am sorry."</p>
<p>Then I went to Medhananda and got four different books entitled <em>The Biographies of Eminent Scientists.</em> Nolini-da was exceedingly glad to have these books and said to me: "Chinmoy, there was a special purpose in my asking you to go to Sisir."</p>  </div>
