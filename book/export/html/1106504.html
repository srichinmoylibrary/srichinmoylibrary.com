<p>This is the fifth day that I have done the seated calf raise since we came back from the Christmas trip. The first time I went up to 800 pounds. Then, for four days, I did 1,000 pounds â€” which is my maximum. Now Bishwas has added more weights to my machine. Today I wanted to try 1,100 pounds. I went up to 1,000 pounds. You can see it on the video. Just focus your eyes below the white numbers and you will see it move. Then I went to 1,100 pounds. I did it three times. The first two times, it did not move but the third time I felt the vibration. I definitely felt a movement, but it did not go up.</p>
