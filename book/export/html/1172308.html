<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This movement you see indicates that my soul is moving from one region to another. Like a bird moving from one branch of a tree to the next, my consciousness is moving from one level to another. Each branch gives a special satisfaction to the bird: Light, Peace, Bliss, Power and so on. Similarly, each plane of consciousness I enter offers me its wealth, which I then bring down to my disciples and those meditating with me.</p>  </div>
