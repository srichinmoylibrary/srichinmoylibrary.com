<p>I came to him doubtful.<br />   He smiled and said:<br />      "Stay with me for three minutes."</p>
<p>I came to him uncertain.<br />   He caressed the sleeping Eye between my eyebrows and said:<br />      "Stay with me for three years."</p>
<p>I came to him with a student's eagerness.<br />   He blessed my devoted head and said:<br />      "Stay with me for thirty years."</p>
<p>I came to him with the heart of a child.<br />   He embraced my surrendered life and said:<br />      "Stay with me for eternity."</p>
