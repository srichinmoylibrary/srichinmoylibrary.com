<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We must pray and pray and pray so that there will not he a third, nuclear war. It will destroy all our hopes and humanity's happiness. Our prayers should be infinitely stronger than the atom bomb or the hydrogen bomb. We must pray-all sincere peace-lovers must pray-as intensely and as soulfully as possible so that we can avert a third world war.</p>
<p><em>Governor Takada:</em> I hope you will continue to work for world peace.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I thank you from the very depths of my heart. You are a lover of peace, and I am a lover of peace. Let us both, therefore, sail in the same boat toward the shore of world peace.</p>  </div>
