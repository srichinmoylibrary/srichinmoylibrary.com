<p>When we were going to meet the Mayor of Madrid, I took with me only the singers. Then we found out that they were expecting 200 people!</p>
<p>When the Mayor was escorting me to the reception after the meeting, he was saying that although the building was old, he has new, modern thoughts there. The building was built in the 16th century.</p>
