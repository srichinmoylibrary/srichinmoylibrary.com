<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Somebody gave me the key to open up the door of Heaven and I am successful always in opening up the Door of Heaven. But then I made another key for myself to open up the door of earth. Just because I made it, alas, that key does not work. Either give me a gift key or loan me one to open up the earth-door. Earth needs my key, for earth has to be opened up immediately to receive Your Light. Otherwise, it will always remain in ignorance-night.</p>
