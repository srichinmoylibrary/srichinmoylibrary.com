<p>Today in one of my weightlifting prayers I spoke about triumphing over self-doubts and world-criticism. I was about to do the clean and press and I was planning to try 50 pounds in each arm. So self-doubt was coming, “Will it go up?”</p>
<p>Then there was a plane passing very low over my house and making so much noise. That noise was disturbing my concentration. So this was the world-criticism. Instead of criticising the plane, I triumphed over it, and I was able to lift 50 pounds with both arms and do 63 presses once the dumbbells were in the air.</p>
<p>If I can lift up 70 pounds from the ground with each arm simultaneously then I will feel really strong.</p>
