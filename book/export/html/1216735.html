    <title>Question: You have said that from a very young age you knew that your mission would develop in the West. Was it an inner message you received during your first thirteen years, or was it a suggestion of your Guru? How did your knowledge of coming to the West develop?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It was a message from the inmost recesses of my heart that I used to get quite frequently during my adolescent years. So inwardly I was prepared to come to the West. On the outer plane, I came to the West when some American seekers saw me in India and invited me to come here to be of service to the seekers in the West.</p>  </div>
