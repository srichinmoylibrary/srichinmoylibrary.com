<p>He thinks that he is too poor,<br /> And his poverty is not allowing him<br /> To think of God.</p>
<p>You think that you are too rich,<br /> And therefore your riches<br /> Are not allowing you<br /> To think of God.</p>
<p>I think that I am neither poor nor rich.<br /> Therefore God the Compassion<br /> Has given me the capacity<br /> To become man the aspiration.</p>
