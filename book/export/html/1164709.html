<p><em>(Krishna's parents, relatives and neighbours are performing ceremonies in honour of the Lord Indra.)</em></p>
<p>KRISHNA: Why are you worshipping Indra? Who is he?</p>
<p>RELATIVE: Oh Krishna, you are just a child. You are eleven years old. That is why you do not know who Indra is.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: I do not know, but I wish to know from you who he is.</p>
<p>RELATIVE: Indra is the rain god. And he is King of the Gods.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: That is why you are worshipping him? You should worship this hill. <em>(Points out the hill Girt Govardhan.)</em> Our cattle are being fed by this hill; everyone is being helped in one way or another by this hill. Indra does not help us in any way. If you want to know the Truth, if you care for the Truth, then I tell you that you should worship this hill, and not Indra.</p>
<p>RELATIVE: Krishna, if we do it and something happens, your parents will feel miserable. And I am your relative, so I shall also feel miserable.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Nothing will happen. My parents will not feel miserable. You will not feel miserable. At least let's try this time, please. We shall not worship Indra anymore.</p>
<p><em>(Indra is watching from Heaven. He is furious.)</em></p>
<p>INDRA: How do they dare to listen to that little child, that rascal, Krishna! I shall show them! I shall teach them a lesson! I shall inundate the whole place with water!</p>
<p><em>(Rain begins to fall.)</em></p>
<p>RELATIVE: I knew this was going to happen! Now see this rain! God alone knows when this downpour will stop. Krishna, what do you have to say now?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: I never accept defeat. Never. Look! With one of my fingers I shall lift the whole hill, and it will serve as an umbrella. <em>(Lifts the hill.)</em> You can all be under the protection of the hill. Even if it rains for seven days, I will protect you. Giri Govardhan will protect us this way for seven days. And then Indra will have to accept defeat. Do not worry. You are all safe, protected under the hill.</p>
<p>RELATIVE: O Krishna, now we know who you are. From now on you will save us and illumine us.</p>  </div>
