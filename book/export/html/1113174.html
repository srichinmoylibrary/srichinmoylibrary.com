<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Beyond your experience is divine love. Love itself, divine love, is beyond your experience and beyond the experience of everyone here. Divine love is unconditional. So far in your life, nobody has loved you unconditionally, so right now it is beyond your expectation that some body can love you unconditionally. But when you go deep within, you see that God, the Supreme, loves you unconditionally. Since I represent Him for those who claim to be my disciples, since you have just become a disciple, you can expect unconditional love from me. No matter what you do or what you say, I will love you.</p>  </div>
