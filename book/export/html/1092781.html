<p>Once, when Deshabandhu heard of Subhas Chandra's imprisonment, he immediately exclaimed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Why have they not arrested me? I should like to know why. If love of one's country is a crime, I am a criminal. If Bose is a criminal, I am a criminal."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here C. R. Das is proving that the connection between the Guru and the close disciple is like the connection between father and son; the heart of the father always comes forward when the son is in trouble. The father's affection always tries to save the son. Deshabandhu had such love for Subhas that he wanted to embrace jail to save Subhas.</p>  </div>
