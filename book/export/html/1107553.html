<p>How do I use my aspiration?</p>
<p>I use my aspiration to unite my earth’s ascending cry and my Heaven’s descending Smile.</p>
<p>I use my aspiration to transform my world’s desire-night into my world’s illumination-height. I use my aspiration to feed my hungry Beloved Supreme; Him I feed with my aspiration’s gratitude-flames.</p>
<p>I use my aspiration to unlearn everything that my earth-bound mind has taught me and, right from the beginning, to learn everything from my Heaven-free soul.</p>
<p>I use my aspiration to be the most intimate friend of my sweet, kind and beautiful oneness-heart.</p>
<p>I use my aspiration for success in the outer world and for progress in the inner world. When I succeed, the outer world smiles at me, appreciates me, adores me and extols me to the skies. When I progress soulfully, devotedly and unconditionally, my Beloved Supreme smiles at me, blesses me and embraces me.</p>
<p>What is aspiration? Aspiration is my self-giving.</p>
<p>What is self-giving? Self-giving is a supreme art. From this art I come to realise that I have to fathom my unknown realities and I have to know my higher self which abides deep in the inmost recesses of my heart. I have to become consciously and inseparably one with my higher self, which is in perfect tune with my Beloved Supreme constantly, and I have to manifest my yet-unmanifested realities.</p>
<p>My aspiration embodies concentration, meditation and contemplation.</p>
<p>Concentration is my speed. With this speed I run fast, faster and fastest towards my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Meditation is my depth, my silence-depth. With this silence-depth I invoke my sweet Lord Supreme and place Him deep inside my gratitude-heart.</p>
<p>Contemplation is my ecstasy. With this ecstasy I sing my oneness-song with my Eternity’s Father Supreme. With my contemplation-ecstasy I dance my satisfaction-dance with my Lord, who is my Eternity’s Friend and Companion. With my Lord the Father I sing. With my Lord the Friend I dance. </p>
