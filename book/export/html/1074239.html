<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The souls of human beings may pass through the planets when they are coming down from the soulâ€™s world and entering into this world. While coming down, they may create some special connection or friendship with a particular planet. Spiritual Masters do it while they are here. Spiritual Masters, while living on the physical plane, can bring down qualities and capacities and realities from these planets. If they care for the beauty aspect, they will get it from one planet; power they will get from another planet. They can bring down Light, Peace and Bliss from these higher worlds on the strength of their concentration and meditation power.</p>  </div>
