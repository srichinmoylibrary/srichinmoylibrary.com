<p>Once I was running in Flushing Meadow Park in such a relaxed way. I thought that my strides were no more than forty inches, but they were actually fifty. Savyasachi was watching. Then, in order to prove it to the others on the road crew, again I started running in a relaxed way. They all saw that my strides were actually fifty inches.</p>
