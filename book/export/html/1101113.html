<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Human authority exists only for the sake of pleasure. Here it is the blind leading the blind. Divine authority comes on the strength of oneness with the Highest. The boss is superior to the ordinary worker; therefore, he has the authority to scold him. He knows perfectly well that the people working under him are different from him: that's why he is the boss. This is human authority. But in divine authority, there is no superiority or inferiority. Here it is the Highest in us leading the rest of the family. In divine authority, we do not feel that the higher authority is some stranger; we feel it is our own highest Self.</p>  </div>
