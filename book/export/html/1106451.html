<p>This morning I did all my lifts and then I went out to walk one mile. It took me 33 minutes. Do you know the meaning of the word ‘pathetic’? When I walked today, it was pathetic. Four or five times I had to stop. I was suffering from agonising pain in my knee. My back was very stiff, but my knee was impossible.</p>
