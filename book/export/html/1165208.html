<p>I sought God's guidance. He caught my fear.</p>
<p>I sought God's Wisdom-light. He caught my Ignorance-night.</p>
<p>I sought God's all-illumining Truth. He caught my all-spreading Falsehood.</p>
<p>I sought God to own Him. He caught me to give Himself.</p>
<p>I sought God because without Him I can do nothing. He caught me because without me He wants to do nothing.</p>
<p>I sought God, I am now fulfilled.</p>
<p>God caught me. He is now revealed.</p>
