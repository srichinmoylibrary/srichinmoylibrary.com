<p>What is chimera's mist or miracle today<br /> Was the immaculate truth divine of yore.<br /> Immeasurable by our human thought<br /> Was regal Vasishtha's presence and bright power.<br /> But from Above yet greater souls unmatched<br /> Over our Ind imperishably shall lean.<br /> The might of seers antique shall fade away<br /> Before the souls to come with Light new-born;<br /> And she shall sit on splendour's throne in the world.</p>
