<p><em>(The Buddha with his disciples. One disciple stands up.)</em></p>
<p>DISCIPLE: O Lord, I wish to preach your teachings.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Certainly you may, but I would like to ask you a few questions first. I am sure you will be able to answer them.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: It is by your grace that I will be able to answer them.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Tell me, if somebody speaks ill of you, what will you do?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: My Lord, I shall keep silent.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Tell me, if he strikes you, what will you do?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: I shall not raise my hands. I shall remain silent.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: If he wants to kill you, what will you do?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: I shall keep silent. I know that death is inevitable. Everybody has to die. I shall also have to die one day. I shall not invoke death, and at the same time I shall not avoid death.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: I am most pleased with your answers. You can preach my philosophy. You have my blessings. <em>(To all the disciples.)</em> Today I would like to walk in the forest. Those who want to follow me can come along.</p>
<p><em>(All the disciples eagerly follow the Buddha.)</em></p>  </div>
