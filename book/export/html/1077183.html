<p>Einsteinâ€™s life was a song of simplicity from beginning to end. When the scientist died, very few people came to his funeral, even less than the number present at his birth. He had asked that he be cremated and that there be nothing to mark his passing. This last wish, too, was granted.</p>  </div>
