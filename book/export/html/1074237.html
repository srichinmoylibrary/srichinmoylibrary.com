<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here on earth, not only physical manifestation but all kinds of manifestation can take place. Heaven is perfect from one point of view. You can take rest there after you have played your game on earth. But in Heaven there is no realisation, no manifestation; for this we have to come to earth.</p>
<p>Life is everywhere, and the existence of the soul is everywhere in all the galaxies. But some souls enter into the earth for the transformation of the physical consciousness. On this planet, the souls that enter into the physical plane care for physical transformation.</p>  </div>
