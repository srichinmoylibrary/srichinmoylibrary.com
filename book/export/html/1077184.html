<h2>1.</h2>

<p>Each human being is a unique reality in himself and has a standard of his own. Although he is a part of an integral reality, it is wise to let him develop his own standard according to his inner receptivity and outer capacity. Standardisation will be a deplorable mistake. The unique individualist in Einstein illumines our minds: <em>“Standardisation robs life of its spice.”</em></p>
<p>The thinker in Einstein tells us something most significant: who is qualified and who is not qualified for life. The thinker-scientist, who is a staunch supporter of truth, awakens the human in us and fulfils the divine in us when he says: <em>“The man who regards life [...] as meaningless is not merely unfortunate but almost disqualified for life.”</em></p>  </div>
