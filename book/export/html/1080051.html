<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two major obstacles. When one does not have enough feeling for one's own religion, one cannot go very far. So first one has to develop a sincere feeling. Then he has to make his religion a living reality, just as the body, the vital and the mind are living realities. Unless one knows and feels that religion is a living reality, he will not be able to make progress through his religion.</p>  </div>
