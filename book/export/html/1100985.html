<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only think of all the good qualities that your country has. All the good qualities that you can think of that your country has, you will try to keep right in front of your eyes. Then, just feed these qualities with your goodwill, with your love, with your concern. Think of a very young or beautiful child. You are feeding that child. Take the whole country as an individual, one individual, and feel that you are feeding that individual with your concern. That is the best way to serve: to think of the country not as countless millions of people, but as only one person, one person. For you, that one person will embody the whole of Russia. In that way, you will be able to do the best for your country.</p>  </div>
