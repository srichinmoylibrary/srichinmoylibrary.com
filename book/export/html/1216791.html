<p>In two hours' time at least ten or twelve people from economy class came to lie down in the ambassador-class seats. These people didn't pay anything for ambassador class; they just came and were sleeping there. The stewardesses didn't ask them to move. If it had really been ambassador class, they wouldn't have allowed people from the economy section to occupy the seats.</p>
