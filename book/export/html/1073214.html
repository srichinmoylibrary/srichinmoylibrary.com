<p>The award reads: "Sri Chinmoy: A Student of Peace â€” The beauty, nobility and harmony of Sri Chinmoy's vast outpouring of artistic, literary and musical creations have inspired millions of people worldwide. His creative works embody an age-old wisdom and the everlasting ideals of self-giving, compassion and oneness. The University of Victoria is proud and honoured to recognise Sri Chinmoy, who was born and raised in the East and has been serving tirelessly in the West, as a man of letters, fine arts and the elevated human spirit."</p>
<p>To all of my brothers and sisters at the University of Victoria, I thank you from the very depths of my heart. Here you have two most significant mottoes: "Let there be Light," and "A Multitude of the Wise is the Health of the World." When this world shall be inundated with the infinite Wisdom-Light of our Father Lord, then boundless peace and happiness shall dawn upon our devoted hearts and lives.</p>  </div>
