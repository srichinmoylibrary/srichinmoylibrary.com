<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme felt extremely proud of John Adams at that time, for John Adams triumphantly transcended the barriers of nationalism and entered into the free world of internationalism. In this world, the individual has to be given a full chance to defend himself and fulfil himself according to the light that he embodies.</p>  </div>
