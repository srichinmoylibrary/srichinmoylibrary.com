<p>Try to please God. God will not only be pleased with you for what you have done for Him, but also will forgive you for what you have not done.</p>
<p>Try to please a man. There is no certainty that you will get any credit for what you have done for him. But be fully prepared to receive a volley of criticism for what you have not done for him.</p>  </div>
