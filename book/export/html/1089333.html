<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People usually break the law because they don't want to be under any law. This is the outer reason. The inner reason is that, after all, it is not they who have made the laws. If they had made the laws, they would have defended these laws like anything. Again, there are spiritual people who break man-made laws because they have received a higher message. From the spiritual point of view, by listening to a higher law, they are doing what they are supposed to do in the world of aspiration.</p>  </div>
