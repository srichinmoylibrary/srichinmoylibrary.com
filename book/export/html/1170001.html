<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Training the physical mind does not destroy the intuition of a child. Only it puts aside the intuitive faculty. The intuitive capacity does not and cannot function when the physical mind is too active. But when the physical mind is alert or active, you can't say that intuition will totally be destroyed. No, only the intuition power cannot function properly. When the seeker begins to aspire and consciously prays and meditates, the physical mind is transformed into the illumined mind. At that time, the dormant intuitive faculty bears fruit.</p>  </div>
