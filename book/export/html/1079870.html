<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We do not have peace of mind because we feel that we are the most important people on earth. We feel that if we do not do this, if we do not say that, then the world will collapse or everything will go wrong immediately. We can get peace of mind if we can consciously feel that we are not important, we are not indispensable. The moment we can sincerely feel that we are not indispensable, we will not have to go anywhere to get peace, for peace will immediately come to us. If we feel that it is our duty to serve the world, that is good. But if we feel that it is our duty to illumine the world, and that if we do not illumine the world the world will remain full of darkness, that is wrong. I am not indispensable. You are not indispensable. Only God is indispensable.</p>
<p>Another easy way to have peace of mind is to feel that nothing is unduly important. If we have lost something, we must feel that that thing is unimportant in our life, that our life will not be ruined just because we have lost it. Everything on earth can desert us as long as we do not desert God and God does not desert us. God will never desert us because He is all Compassion, and even if we try our hardest, we will not be able to desert God because He is omnipresent. So we need not worry about anything on earth. We need not become upset or agitated about anything on earth.</p>
<p>We have to know and feel that, except for God and our inner cry for Truth, nothing on earth is indispensable. If we have the inner cry, then we get God. And once we consciously get God as our very own, we have everything. Ordinary people do not pray, do not meditate. God is only a vague idea to them. They know that God exists, but where is He, who is He, what is He doing? They cannot answer these questions. Only spiritual people know that God is inside the heart, that He is all Love, and that He is playing His divine Game in and through us. For spiritual people, God is a Reality, a constant Reality.</p>

<p>THE HOME OF UNIVERSAL LOVE</p>
<p>His mind<br /> Is the secret home of sound.</p>
<p>His heart<br /> Is the sacred home of silence.</p>
<p>His soul <br /> Is the blue-vast home of God.</p>
<p>His God<br /> Is the home of universal Love.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Truth is not behind me, but before me.</p>
<p>Realisation is within, and not without.</p>
<p>Death is behind me, and not before me.</p>
<p>Transformation stands before me, and not behind me.</p>
