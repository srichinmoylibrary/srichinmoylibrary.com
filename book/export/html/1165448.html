    <title>Question: When you lift extremely heavy weights, are you using the cosmic strength that comes from Heaven, or is it actually human physical strength? When I saw you lift the 106 1/4 pounds, I felt I saw the spark of energy that created the universe!</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In my case, it is a combination of divine Grace and human effort. The divine Grace is 99 per cent and the human effort is one per cent. This is what the aspiring man in me knows and feels. But from the realisation of my Inner Pilot, I know perfectly well that it is 100 per cent God's Grace in every possible way â€” from the very day I embarked on this journey.</p>  </div>
