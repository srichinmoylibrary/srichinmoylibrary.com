  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: What is your opinion about reading newspapers?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some spiritual Masters went to the length of saying that newspapers were nothing short of falsehood. I do not wish to go to that extreme. But if you are carried away by the news, then it becomes like a novel; there are so many things in the news that create sensation in you. After sensation will come irritation and many, many bad things will happen.</p>
<p>But again, you have to remain in the world. If you do not know that the President has died or if something very important takes place and you do not know about it, then you are not conscious of the world. You are not conscious of what is happening around you, and that is not good. But if you read the newspapers from the first page to the last page only for the sake of information, then you will remain in the world of information and illumination will not take place. So you have to be very careful.</p>  </div>
