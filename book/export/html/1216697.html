<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are right that my Hindu religion has been mercilessly tested throughout the centuries. Because of Hinduism’s vastness-heart and tolerance-life, it has survived and will continue to survive all inner and outer challenges. Hinduism encompasses many philosophies and beliefs. It is all-embracing in its love, and it gives importance to all the spiritual figures of the world. Hinduism embodies certain eternal ideals, and it sees a true harmony in the teachings of all religions. To some extent, it is more like a self-disciplined spiritual culture than a religion.</p>
<p>I am not well acquainted with the new religions that deal with social-life activities, so I am the wrong person to say anything about them. But I do hope they all are doing the right thing and aiming at the same goal — the goal of universal oneness.</p>  </div>
