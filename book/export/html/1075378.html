<p>Also,<br /> It does not care to understand<br /> Vaguely<br /> Anything whatsoever.<br /> It only believes and obeys,<br /> And<br /> Obeys and believes.</p>
<p>Surrender is by far the greatest<br /> Because it alone is the glowing ascent<br /> Of the aspiring heart<br /> And<br /> The proud descent<br /> Of the Absolute.</p>

<p>Duty sings<br /> In the arms of the man<br /> Who works.</p>
<p>Divinity dances<br /> In the soul of the man<br /> Who loves.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">846. Do you spend?</h1>
  
 

<p>Do you spend more than you earn?<br /> "Yes."<br /> Why do you do that?<br /> Who taught you to do that?<br /> "My ignorance-friend."</p>
<p>Do you spend less than you earn?<br /> "Yes."<br /> Why do you do that?<br /> Who taught you to do that?<br /> "My wisdom-friend."</p>
<p>Do you spend all that you earn?<br /> "Yes."<br /> Why do you do that?<br /> Who taught you to do that?<br /> "My God-friend.<br /> He said to me:<br /> 'You fool.<br /> Why do you have to think of the future?<br /> Let the future take care of itself.<br /> What I want from you<br /> Is to take care of today,<br /> Only today.'

  <h1 class="book-heading">84.7 Her life</h1>
  
 

<p>When she does not get<br /> Her Father's usual smile,<br /> Her life comes to a comma.</p>
<p>When she sees<br /> Her Father's angry face,<br /> Her life comes to a semi-colon.</p>
<p>When she sees<br /> Her Father's indifference,<br /> Her life comes to a full stop.</p>

<p>Father, Father,<br /> Why do You<br /> Ignore me so much<br /> Nowadays?<br /> "Daughter, not true!"</p>
<p>Father, Father,<br /> Why are You<br /> Not taking my services<br /> Nowadays?<br /> "Daughter, not true!"</p>
<p>Father, Father,<br /> Why don't You<br /> Care for me at all<br /> Nowadays?<br /> "Not true, not true, not true,<br /> My daughter sweet!"</p>

<p>Father, Father,<br /> Every day I see You<br /> Deliberately kicking me<br /> Farther and farther<br /> Away from You.<br /> I think this is enough,<br /> More than enough.<br /> Please, please,<br /> Give me another chance.<br /> This time I shall please You.</p>
<p>Father, Father,<br /> Still I think<br /> I am Yours,<br /> Only Yours.</p>
