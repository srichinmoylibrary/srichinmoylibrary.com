<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God teases you for two reasons. The first reason is that God wants you to feel that He is your eternal Friend, your only Friend. Just because He is your eternal Friend, He does something which only a real friend would dare to do. Only a real friend can tease you.</p>
<p>God also teases you for another, very specific reason. Sometimes when God sees that you are consciously or unconsciously in an unpleasant, superior, haughty consciousness, He tries to bring you down to the normal human consciousness, so that you will act like a normal, natural, loving human being. He brings you down to the level of your brothers and sisters so that even unconsciously you do not have a superior or self-imposed feeling of isolation.</p>  </div>
