<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two gifts the United Nations may give to the United States on its Bicentennial. One gift is gratitude, for the United Nations is housed in the United States. The other gift is its promise to help and fulfil America the way Americaâ€™s soul wants to be helped and fulfilled.</p>  </div>
