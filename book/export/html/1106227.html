<p>The other day Saral was eating in a vegetarian restaurant in Manhattan. A man and a woman sitting next to him were talking about the proper diet for athletes. The man was a weightlifter. He was saying that weightlifters don’t need much protein. Then he said, “Well, the strongest man in the world, Sri Chinmoy, doesn’t eat any meat.” Later Saral talked to the man and gave him some of my books and pictures.</p>
