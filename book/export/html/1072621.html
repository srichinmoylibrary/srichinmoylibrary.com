<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Any force, positive or negative, immediately creates a world of its own. Each time we release an idea, we are creating a world of our own. But if we say that just by using negative thoughts we are practising occultism, it would be absolutely wrong. Similarly, by using positive thoughts, we are not creating a higher spiritual life.</p>
<p>Negation and destruction are almost always in the unsatisfied vital world where we very often practise occultism. Positive assertion and one-pointed will to reveal and manifest oneâ€™s Divinity is always done in the inner world or the psychic world. So we have to know how we are using these powers and why we are using them.</p>  </div>
