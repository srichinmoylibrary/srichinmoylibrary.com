<p>I wish to offer to each member of the Meditation Group a blessing. From today on we, as members of the Meditation Group and as members of the United Nations staff, shall serve the world body and soul with our heart's soulful gratitude. At times people who are serving the United Nations are assailed with fear, insecurity, worry, doubt and other undivine qualities. But from today on we shall use our best quality; we shall use our soulful gratitude. We shall offer our soulful gratitude to the soul and body of the United Nations every day, every hour, every minute, every second. To serve the United Nations is to serve God's Oneness-Vision, God's ever-transcending, ever-fulfilling Vision of the ever-transcending Reality.</p>
