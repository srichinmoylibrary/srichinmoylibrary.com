<p>The great player of the universal peace-game in the Secretary-General lovingly teaches us that peace is a game to be played by all-a game that needs the conscious and self-giving participation of all human beings and nations, large and small, powerful and week, illumined and unillumined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In awarding their Peace Prize to the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations, the Nobel Committee recognises that the quest for peace is a universal undertaking involving all the nations and peoples of the world."</p>
