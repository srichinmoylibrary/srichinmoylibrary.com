<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately I will not be able to answer this question adequately because in my animal incarnation I was never an elephant. I was a lion in my last animal incarnation. If I had become an elephant, I would know why they are afraid of mice.</p>
<p>However, let me try to answer this question from a spiritual point of view. The elephant is not actually afraid. It is surprised that the same God who created such a huge elephant cares to create such a tiny creature. The same Power that is behind the elephant is also behind the mouse, so the elephant gets a tremendous surprise and shock. How can the mouse have the same Power behind it? How is it that God created such tiny little creatures in the same creation? So you can say that the elephant is jealous and insecure because God is not satisfied only with His elephant-product.</p>  </div>
