<p>Lord Mahavira was not the founder of the Jaina religion. Jainism has a long and illustrious line of teachers who are called <em>Tirthankaras.</em> Tirthankara means "one who finds a place to cross the ocean of suffering." Another translation is "ford-finder."</p>
<p>The very first Tirthankara was Rishabha who lived at the dawn of human civilisation. Lord Mahavira was the 24th Tirthankara and the last one in this particular cycle of time.</p>  </div>
