<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are various reasons why one feels pressure on the top of one's head. Sometimes a person will pull down Light beyond his capacity. It is as if a child is trying to pull down something very heavy from above, and it breaks his head.</p>
<p>Sometimes it also happens that this particular centre, the thousand-petalled lotus, is being opened through the Divine Grace and through one's aspiration. At that time also one gets tremendous pressure. But the individual has to know whether he has pulled something down from above beyond his capacity or if it is the awakening of the centre. If it happens consciously and spontaneously, it means that the crown centre is being opened up.</p>  </div>
