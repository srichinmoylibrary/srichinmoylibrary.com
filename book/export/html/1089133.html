<p>They say that Jainism and its <em>ahimsa</em> -code have caught the imagination of the Indian nation.</p>
<p>I say that Jainism and its <em>ahimsa</em> -essence have elevated the consciousness of the entire world.</p>
<p>They say that the Jaina religion is practised only by the few.</p>
<p>I say that the Jaina code of life is destined to be practised by the many.</p>
<p>They say that Jainism is confined to the shores of our Mother India.</p>
<p>I say that the heart and soul of Jainism will eventually be embraced by humanity as a whole. Indeed, that blessed day is fast approaching.</p>
<p>They say that Lord Mahavira and Lord Buddha were contemporaries, but by no means equals.</p>
<p>I say that Lord Mahavira and Lord Buddha were perfect embodiments of the selfsame Light of the ever-transcending Beyond. Who are we to judge them? We have to be fully enlightened like them before we can open our big mouths.</p>
<p>They say that Jainism is stark austerity-life.</p>
<p>I say that Jainism expects austerity from those who have the capacity to renounce the world for the world-illumination, and self-control from those who are still enjoying the pleasure-life.</p>
<p>They say that Jainism is too difficult.</p>
<p>I say that Jainism is easier than the easiest if you have but one feeling deep inside your heart: love and sacrifice for each and every living thing in the universe.</p>  </div>
