<p>The other day I went to buy some saris for two disciples. They were thirty-six dollars each. I told the shopkeeper, "No, thirty." The man agreed. Right after that a lady came in and wanted the same sari. He quoted her the same price - thirty-six dollars.</p>
<p>She came in after me, but she wanted to be served before me, so she bought it for thirty-six dollars, and left while I was still standing there.</p>
<p>Then the shopkeeper said that he gave me a better price because I always buy more than one. And he added, "Also, she is an ugly woman. I don't see any beauty in her." That is why he sold the sari to her for thirty-six dollars.</p>
