<p>"What are you doing?"<br /> I am looking for a new path.<br /> "I have one."<br /> May I walk along your path?<br /> "Certainly you may,<br /> But first you must offer me<br /> Your soulful cry."<br /> Ah, you can have it immediately.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"<br /> I am looking for a new Master.<br /> "I am the one."<br /> May I have you as my Master?<br /> "Certainly you may,<br /> But first you must offer me<br /> Your soulful smile."<br /> Alas, it may take a little time,<br /> But I shall definitely give it to you.</p>
