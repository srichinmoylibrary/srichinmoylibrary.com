<p>Ashrita had put a big box of ERG with my luggage for Bansidhar to use in our marathon. When my luggage passed through the machine, the inspector said something to me half in English and half in Spanish.</p>
<p>I said, "Please tell me in English."</p>
<p>She said, "What is in this box?"</p>
<p>I said, "ERG."</p>
<p>She said, "ERG? What's that?"</p>
<p>I said, "You don't know what ERG is?"</p>
<p>She said, "No!"</p>
<p>I said, "Runners use ERG."</p>
<p>Then she said, "Wait." Four or five minutes I waited. Then I asked the inspector, "Have you sent for someone?"</p>
<p>She said, "No, I am waiting for someone to come."</p>
<p>A very fat old lady was passing through the line. She had overheard our conversation, and she got the point. She turned around and said to the inspector either "Honey!" or "Dummy!" Then she said, "My grandson lives on ERG. In the New York Marathon he did so well."</p>
<p>Then the inspector allowed me to go through the line. She told me to go in Spanish.</p>  </div>
