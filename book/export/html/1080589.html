<p><em>Sri Chinmoy: (presenting one of his records to Don Pablo):</em> You are the Mt. Everest in your musical ability and I am the anthill in music. The anthill is offering its musical ability to the Mt. Everest.</p>
<p><em>Mrs. Casals:</em> This is played on what instrument?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The harmonium. It is like a miniature piano.</p>
<p><em>Mrs. Casals (to Don Pablo in Catalan):</em> These are his compositions. He has dedicated one of them to the Divine Mother.</p>
<p><em>Don Pablo:</em> You had a wonderful mother, I am sure. I, too, had a wonderful, wonderful mother.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy (noticing a portrait of a young woman):</em> That is a picture of your mother?</p>
<p><em>Don Pablo:</em> Yes, my Ma is everything to me, everything. We were poor, but from my childhood she had such a wonderful power to give me everything. My mother knew everything.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How old was she when they took this picture?</p>
<p><em>Don Pablo:</em> Oh, she was young. She was thirty or thirty-two.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> And in this other picture?</p>
<p><em>Don Pablo:</em> She was nearly seventy. She lived to be seventy-four. I feel my mother always with me, on every occasion. I feel her with me all the time.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am so happy. The mother helps the child to manifest his inner divinity, his inner realisation. She receives for Mother-Earth and she manifests what her child has within. You are representing Heaven, Heaven-consciousness, through your music. Mother-Earth's consciousness holds the Light of Heaven and then it helps the Light to manifest here on earth.</p>  </div>
