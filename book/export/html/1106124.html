<p>When I do weightlifting, I have to absolutely concentrate; no thought is allowed. If you are not serious, O God, even if the weight doesn’t fall, you may get hurt. If people don’t concentrate plus meditate, they may injure their muscles, and then they will suffer.</p>
<p>The weights are like a sleeping dog — very calm. But if you disturb the dog, it may open its eyes and bite you. In the same way, the inconscient weights say, “We are sleeping and now you are bothering us.” When you touch the weights, they feel a kind of sensation and get furious. Sometimes, because of my divine inner qualities, they get joy. Otherwise, it is like disturbing sleeping dogs; they just start barking.</p>
