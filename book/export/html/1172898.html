<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This entirely depends on the seeker. The seeker must listen to the inner voice. If the inner voice says two seekers should have children so that the manifestation of God can take place in and through more members of the family, that can be the only spiritual purpose.</p>  </div>
