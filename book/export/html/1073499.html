<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> That’s the attitude I have. I like to do everything and be involved. Of course, by throwing yourself into things it’s possible to become injured. I have competed while injured. But you have to get into the frame of mind where you want to do something and where you feel that nothing can really stand in your way.</p>  </div>
