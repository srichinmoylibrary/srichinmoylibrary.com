<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you pray and meditate, try to feel that you have gained something real: light, bliss, peace, power. When you earn money, you can keep it in your pocket and use it whenever you want to. Similarly, when you meditate in the morning, you have to feel that you have gained some inner wealth, and this wealth you have to keep inside your heart. Then while you are mixing with your friends, working in the office or studying in the school, when you are thrown into multifarious activities, you can use this inner wealth whenever you need it. Just meditate for a minute and enter into the heart where you have kept your inner wealth safe. Then you can distribute it wherever you feel the need. In the morning you save your money, because you know you will need it later on during the day.</p>  </div>
