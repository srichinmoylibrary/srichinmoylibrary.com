<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I started consciously meditating at the age of eleven. When I was four or five, I used to say a daily prayer, as children do. It would last one, two or three minutes. But when I was eleven I became fully conscious of divinity, and I started to take my prayer and meditation very seriously. And by the age of thirteen, I was meditating for eight hours daily.</p>
