<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, God likes to go on trips, but in God's case, He is constantly enjoying trips. God is silence and God is movement. Therefore, even while He is seated here on earth, He can move around the world and around Heaven. God is at once static and dynamic. While He is sleeping, He is running across the world. God has the capacity to do two contradictory things at one time.</p>  </div>
