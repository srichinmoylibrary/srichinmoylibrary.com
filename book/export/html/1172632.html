<p>PRAJAPATI, THE CREATOR</p>
<p>THE EYE</p>
<p>THE EAR</p>
<p>THE ORGAN OF SPEECH</p>
<p>THE MIND</p>
<p>THE LIFE-ENERGY</p>
<p>THE BODY</p>
<p>A terrible dispute arose among the Eye, the Ear, the Organ of Speech, the Mind and the Life-Energy. Each one was sure that he was by far the greatest. They quarrelled and quarrelled, but they could not come to any satisfactory conclusion; so they decided to go to Prajapati and settle the problem once and for all.</p>  </div>
