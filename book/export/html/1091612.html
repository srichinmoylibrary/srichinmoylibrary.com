<p>This book is the second of a two-volume series of Sri Chinmoy's answers to questions about the mind and the heart. The first volume dealt primarily with the mind. This volume focuses mainly on the spiritual heart and its relationship with the mind.</p>
<p>The spiritual heart is the heart which becomes one with all that it touches and,like a great vessel, holds within itself the universal Consciousness. The real secret of meditation and the highest kind of knowledge are contained in the spiritual heart. The spiritual heart is like a door, always open. This book is an invitation to enter.</p>  </div>
