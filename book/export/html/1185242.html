<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here on earth you have to know that ignorance is playing its role. If you fight with someone, you do not feel that you are fighting with yourself. You feel that you are fighting with someone else. Why? Because you have lost your feeling of oneness. The moment you feel that he and you are one, only in two different bodies, or that he is part and parcel of your life, you will stop fighting.</p>
<p>The basic problem is our ignorance. Now, what can put an end to our ignorance? It is our conscious aspiration. The more we go up with our aspiration and become one with a higher light, the more we become conscious of our unity. Aspiration will make us feel that we and the rest of the world are one. Then we see that the field of manifestation is like one sea with millions of waves.</p>  </div>
