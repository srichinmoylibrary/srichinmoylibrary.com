<p>I was running on Kissena Boulevard. It was very far, and I was running on the grass. I had just finished my marathon running and I was going along rather slowly.</p>
<p>A young man ran nearby very fast and screamed, "Sri Chinmoy, Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>I did not recognise him and my road crew did not recognise him. But since the man recognised me, that means I am greater than he is.</p>
