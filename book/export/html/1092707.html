<p>Netaji's sleepless and breathless self-giving for his country inspired countless stories of unparalleled sacrifice on the part of his brothers and sisters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Once, during a mammoth meeting in Rangoon, a garland which Netaji had been wearing during the earlier part of the meeting was auctioned. The first bid which was given in the name of Indian independence was for one lac of rupees. A youth cried out: 'Two lacs.' Then the bidding increased: three, four, five, six, seven lacs. The youth could put up with it no longer. He ran towards the pulpit and said: 'Netaji, I give everything that belongs to me. I lay all my property at your feet.' Netaji hugged him to his bosom and said: 'Yes, this garland is yours. This garland will adorn the neck of our Bharat Mata when she becomes free.'"</p>
