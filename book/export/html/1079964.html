<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People have become very sophisticated; they now have a machine-like consciousness. Anything that does not give them satisfaction on the physical plane, vital plane or mental plane, or anything that does not exist right in front of their nose, that thing they feel is unreal, embarrassing. And anything that they do not or cannot know immediately, or anything that they do not have an immediate need for in their life, they do not value. Also, many people who claim to follow a religion at times do not lead even an ordinary, simple human life. In the name of religious life, in the name of spiritual life, they do quite a few unthinkable, unbelievable, unimaginable things. So people who feel and think that they are normal, feel that this kind of life is all abnormality. But I wish to say that the strange behaviour of some so called spiritual people is in no way an indication of their inner progress or illumination. Some people are fanatic: some people are not sincere in their approach or they approach religion in a very aggressive way. Some people are at times embarrassed when they happen to mix with those individuals.</p>
<p>But the really religious people never create embarrassment. Actually, who should be embarrassed? He who has seen the light, or he who is crying for the light? No! Only he who does not care for the light should be embarrassed. If I as an individual have seen the light, then why should I feel embarrassed to speak to you? And if you as an individual need light and are crying for light, then why should you be embarrassed? He who has and he who needs light will never be embarrassed. We should be embarrassed only when we do not have something that others need and have, and when we do not care for that very thing and do not appreciate the persons who have it. We should be embarrassed only then.</p>  </div>
