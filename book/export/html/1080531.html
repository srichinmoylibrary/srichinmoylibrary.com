  <h1 class="book-heading">67. Faithfulness</h1>
  
 
<p>Faithfulness means, "I am unconditionally for God."</p>
<p>Faithfulness is man's divine soulfulness, which completely satisfies God.</p>
<p>Faithfulness is the inner fulness which does not need any outer help.</p>
<p>Faithfulness is God-satisfaction in man and man-perfection in God.</p>
<p>Faithfulness is the sunlit path. It most amazingly expedites our Heavenward journey.</p>
<p>Because of faithfulness there can be no ultimate failure here on earth, there in Heaven. This is the discovery, the infallible discovery, made by faithful seekers and soulful God-lovers.</p>
<p>God does not fail anybody. This is the most outstanding discovery of a faithful truth-seeker.</p>
<p>Faithfulness is ruthlessly challenged by difficulty. Faithfulness is unreservedly supported by necessity.</p>
<p>Faithfulness always succeeds and proceeds.</p>
<p>Faithfulness shines in our heart's aspiration-cry. Faithfulness shines in our life's dedication-smile.</p>
<p>Today faithfulness is my victory's goal. Tomorrow faithfulness shall be my self-giving role in man's heart, which will grow into the very image of God.</p>  </div>
