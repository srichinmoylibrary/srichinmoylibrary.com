<p>"My Lord Supreme, You are at once Compassion-Height and Justice-Light. Do tell me which of the two You consider to be better."</p>
<p>"My son, if you are brave, then Justice-Light is infinitely better. If you are weak, then Compassion-Height is infinitely better. But I wish to tell you that in the long run both Compassion-Height and Justice-Light reach the same destination. They both fulfil the same purpose.</p>
<p>"In the Cosmic Game sometimes it is obligatory for Me to use Justice-Light. Otherwise, if I use always Compassion-Height, then the progress of the seeker in you will be delayed indefinitely. If the seeker in you can brave Justice-Light, then you are bound to make the fastest progress. But this Justice-Light has to be taken cheerfully, devotedly and soulfully; then only will it serve its purpose. If Justice-Light is taken with reluctance, with fear or just out of necessity's demand, and if there is an inner resistance and rebellious attitude, then Justice-Light will fail in its purpose.</p>
<p>"When I show Justice-Light, My son, you have to feel that it is My Concern in disguise; My Concern for your perfection is coming to the fore. When I show Compassion-Height, it is undoubtedly a slower process. But again, if the seeker in you does not forgive you, although I have forgiven you, if you feel remorse and resolve with your adamantine will not to commit the same mistake, then with My Compassion-Height you can also run the fastest. You can run the fastest by becoming infinitely more conscious and aware and by becoming brutally sincere with yourself and fully charged with divine determination.</p>
<p>"Compassion-Height I use more than Justice-Light, My son, because I know each individual human being on earth is weak. Therefore, I take the slow process. If Justice-Light I could use all the time, then progress would be the fastest. But there is a risk here. The vessel may give way; therefore, I am reluctant to use My Justice-Light as often as I use My Compassion-Height. But when I use Compassion-Height, make it a point to be extremely strict, mercilessly strict, with yourself. It is you who have to be strict with your life so that you can be a better, more illumining, more fulfilling instrument of Mine.</p>
<p>"When I use Justice-Light, take it cheerfully, devotedly and soulfully. When I use Compassion-Height, take it with your gratitude-sea and gratitude-sky and, at the same time, dive deep within and become infinitely more strict with yourself than you have already been. Then there is no blunder that you can commit. Justice-Light and Compassion-Height are one, inseparably one. But according to necessity's demands, My son, I use either Justice-Light or Compassion-Height.</p>
<p>"You, as a divine seeker, a genuine seeker, an unconditional seeker, must remain always happy, whether I use Compassion-Height or Justice-Light with you. If it is Justice-Light, use your happiness in a very constructive way; and if it is Compassion-Height, dive deep within and bring to the fore your gratitude-heart. Then charge your body, vital, mind and heart with adamantine will so that you do not repeat the same deplorable mistake.</p>
<p>"Compassion-Height is the shower, the blessing-shower from above; it is a torrential rain. Justice-Light is the brilliant sunlight, the scorching heat. Both we need equally in order to collect the bumper crop of realisation from the aspiration-seed which germinates slowly, steadily and unerringly according to the Will of My inner Vision and outer Reality."</p>
