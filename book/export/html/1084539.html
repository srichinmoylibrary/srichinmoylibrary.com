<p>I hate my yesterday<br /> Because<br /> She told me a dark lie.<br /> She told me that God-life<br /> Is not meant for me.<br /> I hate my today<br /> Because<br /> She has told me a serious lie.<br /> She has told me that God-realisation<br /> Is not meant for me.<br /> I hate my tomorrow<br /> Because<br /> She is telling me a stupid lie.<br /> She is telling me that there is<br /> And there can be<br /> No God<br /> For an idle fellow like me.</p>
