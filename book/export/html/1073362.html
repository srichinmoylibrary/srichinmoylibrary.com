<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation is not the only way. Two things are of paramount importance: prayer and meditation. Both come from aspiration and it is up to the individual to choose. If prayer comes to him quickly or prayer is more convincing than meditation for him, then he can reach God through his sincere prayer. But if somebody feels that meditation is more helpful, then he can reach God through his soulful meditation. Prayer and meditation â€” there is no other method! Either prayer or meditation or both are necessary to reach God.</p>  </div>
