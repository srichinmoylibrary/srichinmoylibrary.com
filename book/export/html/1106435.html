<p>Today I took predictions from the children singers and others on what I will be lifting with two arms by the time my birthday arrives on August 27th.</p>
<p>Most of the little girls said 270 pounds, but one girl is the best. She predicted I will lift 330 pounds in each arm. Savyasachi said 230, and Mridanga and Dhanu both said 300. Then Pranika had to come and say 550 pounds. Where did she get that figure?</p>
