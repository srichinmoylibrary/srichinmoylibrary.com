<p>My brother Chitta had a special dhoti. When I saw that particular dhoti, I wanted to have it, and I started crying for it. How could my brother tell me that it was for our father when he dies? I was such a fool! I went to my father and told him that my brother had such a nice dhoti and he would not give it to me.</p>
<p>My father got the point. He said to Chitta, "I am not going to die soon. You give it to him!"</p>
<p>When my father uttered the word "die," I felt miserable and tears came into my eyes. After that, I did not take my brother's dhoti.</p>  </div>
