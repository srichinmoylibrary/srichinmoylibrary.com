<p>One morning when I was running in Fort Lauderdale, Savyasachi was following me. Since he was following right behind me in the car, I was running practically in the middle of the street. I wanted to run seven miles.</p>
<p>After four and a half miles, a young man saw me. He looked as if he hadn't gone to sleep the night before, and he had a bottle in his hand. He said, "Hey! Do you want to get run over? Why are you running in the middle of the street?" He didn't know it was Savyasachi's car following me.</p>
