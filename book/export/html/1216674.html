<p>My Beloved Lord, do You want me to wait to receive more from You? Do You want me to wait to give You more?</p>
<p>"No, no, My son, you must not wait. If you wait, your old undivine friends will tempt you and assail you."</p>
<p>"Your old undivine friend, lethargy, will attack your body. Your old undivine friend, fear, will attack your vital. Your old undivine friend, doubt, will attack your mind. Your old undivine friend, insecurity, will attack your heart. Your old undivine friend, impurity, will attack your life. Therefore, do not wait.</p>
<p>"Delay not. Run, fly and dive! Run far, farther, farthest. Fly high, higher, highest. Dive deep, deeper, deepest."</p>
<p>"Delay not. If you delay, you will miss the goal. He who waits cannot succeed. The race is for the swift. He who waits cannot succeed. The fight is for the brave. He who waits cannot succeed. The game is for the divine lover. This is a spiritual race. It is a spiritual fight and a spiritual game also. Here each moment is of paramount importance. At each moment you can expedite your soul's journey. Your love for Me should be ignorant of intermission. Your devotion to Me should be ignorant of intermission. Your surrender to me should be ignorant of intermission."</p>
<p>"Start. Reach the goal. Start again. Again reach the goal; and again start and again reach the goal. The goal is ever-transcending. Along My Eternity's Road become the eternal traveller. A birthless start and a deathless end shall be your own Eternity's Goal."</p>
<p>"My son, delay not. Do not wait. The Hour has struck. It is high time for you to dive deep within and always cry and try and try and cry to become a supremely chosen instrument of Mine."</p>
<p>"Give Me immediately what you have: your heart's gratitude and your life's surrender — a gratitude-heart and a surrender-life. To you immediately, My son, I shall grant My infinite Compassion and My immortal Satisfaction."</p>
<p>"Wait not. Delay not. Here and now start running, until the goal is reached. Again, this goal that you will reach will be the starting point for a new goal, which will be again the starting point for a higher goal. An eternal traveller you are, walking eternally along My Eternity's Road. For you there is only the birthless start. For you there is only the deathless end."</p>
