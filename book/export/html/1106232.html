<p>When I lifted 1,515 pounds a few days ago and also today when I lifted 2,039 pounds, only my Mother Kali was there — nobody else. She did everything to help me. She came with such power and such beauty and stood on the metal plates with one foot on one side and the other foot on the other side. Then she lifted the weights up on the inner plane even before I actually started my lift. Then, just before I began my actual lift, she told me, “My child, you have done it!” Then she got off the weight.</p>
<p>When she stands on the weight, which is so high, the ceiling disappears. At that time you don’t even see the ceiling. The inner plane where the gods and goddesses appear is far beyond the physical plane, so the physical surroundings don’t interfere at all.</p>
<p>If I see the video, I will be able to see Mother Kali. She has become part and parcel of the video because her consciousness in the room was so powerful. With the third eye one can see it. The original video has the fragrance of her consciousness. I do not know if she will appear on copies.</p>
