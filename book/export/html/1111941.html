<p>At the start of the Westchester Half-Marathon, I was standing in the eight-minute-pace section. Whom did I see? Fred Lebow! As soon as I saw him, I greeted him and said, "Good morning."</p>
<p>He said, "I will see you next week at the hundred-miler."</p>
<p>I said, "Definitely I will be there."</p>
<p>Every year our team counts laps at the hundred-mile race.</p>
