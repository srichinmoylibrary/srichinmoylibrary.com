    <title>Question: I wonder, Sir, if you could tell us a little bit more explicitly what you mean by the term &amp;quot;God,&amp;quot; and whether you could perhaps compare this with what the word &amp;quot;God&amp;quot; means in Judaism, Christianity and Islam?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, I would like to say that when we try to define God, we bind and belittle Him. God transcends all definitions. But each individual has the right to define God in his own way, in spite of the fact that God is beyond definition. He is infinite. He is eternal. He is immortal. You, as a seeker of the infinite truth, may say that God is Infinite Consciousness. The gentleman sitting beside you may say that God is Infinite Power. A third person may say that God is Infinite Energy. And a fourth may say that God is a divinised human being. Everybody is right in his own way. God is what each individual sees Him as. He can be a Man; He can be a Woman; He can be power; He can be light; He can be peace.</p>
<p>If you want me to tell you what I feel, I wish to say that God is man, and man is God. We are all God's children, but we have not yet realised our highest height. Man is God yet to be realised in totality, in the highest plane of consciousness. God is man yet to be manifested fully here on earth. This is my definition. You have every right to define God in your own way. Nobody's definition has to be accepted as the only one with real authority. In defining God, everybody is perfectly right in his own way.</p>  </div>
