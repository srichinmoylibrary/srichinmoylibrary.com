<p><em>SHANTI (gentleman visitor from Miami):</em> Sri Chinmoy's philosophy, as we all know, is love, devotion and surrender. And through them, one can attain God-realisation. But I feel that the real help that the Guru is giving is a secret help, one that is not written down and is not spoken about in words. His is a special touch that reaches inside each one of us. Without it, we would never feel the Truth or get self-realisation.</p>  </div>
