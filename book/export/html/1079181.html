<p><em>You want God. You need God. You have God. You are God.</em></p>

<p>You want God and you need God.</p>
<p>When you are in your vital, you want God. <br /> When you are in your heart, you need God.</p>
<p>Your vital demands God's choice Hour. <br /> Your heart devotedly waits for God's choice Hour.</p>


<p>When your vital knocks at God's door, no answer. <br /> Frustrated, you break open God's door. <br /> Alas, alas, God is not to be found in His room. He is elsewhere.</p>


<p>God knocks at your heart's door. <br /> You immediately answer. <br /> God blesses your devoted head. <br /> God embraces your surrendered heart.</p>


<p>You want God in order to dominate His vast creation.<br /> You need God in order to emancipate your little world.</p>


<p>You have God and you are God.</p>
<p>You have God; therefore you can look up.<br /> You are God; therefore you can dive within.</p>
<p>You have God; therefore the world loves you.<br /> You are God; therefore it is you alone who can expand your universal consciousness, it is you alone who can always transcend your ever-transcending height.</p>
<p>You have God. Your sea-deep eyes can prove it.<br /> You are God. Your sun-vast heart is the proof.</p>
<p>You have God. Your body of sound can prove it.<br /> You are God. Your soul of silence is the proof.</p>
<p>You have God; therefore death bows to you.<br /> You are God; therefore Immortality claims you.</p>
<p>You have God; therefore you are unmistakably great.<br /> You are God; therefore you are ceaselessly good.</p>


<p>  God you want?<br /> Then your first friend is temptation,<br /> Your second friend is frustration,<br /> Your third friend is destruction.  God you need?<br /> Then your first friend is love,<br /> Your second friend is devotion,<br /> Your third friend is surrender.  God you have.<br /> Your first friend is aspiration,<br /> Your second friend is liberation,<br /> Your third friend is realisation.  God you are.<br /> Your first friend is revelation,<br /> Your second friend is manifestation,<br /> Your third friend is perfection.</p>


<p>  God you want? Be careful.<br />  God you need? Be hopeful.<br />  God you have. Whom else do you need? No one!<br />  God you are. Who does not need you? No one!</p>


<p>Everybody needs you, for you have God and you are God.<br />  You are the body,<br />  You are the vital,<br />  You are the mind,<br />  You are the heart,<br />  You are the soul,<br /> Of what you have and what you are.<br />  What you have is a vast heart.<br />  What you are is a glowing soul.</p>


<p>  God you want.<br />  God you need.<br />  God you have.<br />  God you are.</p>
