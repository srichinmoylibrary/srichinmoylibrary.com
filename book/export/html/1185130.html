<p>Lord Supreme, You have forgiven me.<br /> You have forgiven the teeming lapses<br /> Of Your servant.<br /> I am always intoxicated by beauty's love.<br /> But You have made me immaculate.<br /> My gratitude-heart I have offered to You<br /> And You have offered me Your Promise-Light.<br /> You have accepted the animal in me,<br /> The human in me,<br /> The divine in me<br /> As Your very own.</p>
