<p>God has offered you<br /> Not one, but two compliments.<br /> His first compliment is:<br /> You are His chosen child.<br /> His second compliment is:<br /> Your cry is of Him,<br /> Your smile is for Him.<br /> Man's first and only compliment<br /> To you is this:<br /> He can perfectly live his life without you.<br /> He is more than self-sufficient.</p>
