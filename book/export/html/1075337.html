<p>My soul is homesick.<br /> It wants to go back<br /> To its Fulfilment-Home.</p>
<p>My heart is homesick.<br /> It wants to go back<br /> To its Oneness-Home.</p>
<p>My mind is homesick.<br /> It wants to go back<br /> To its Vastness-Home.</p>
<p>My vital is homesick.<br /> It wants to go back<br /> To its Dynamism-Home.</p>
<p>My body is homesick.<br /> It wants to go back<br /> To its Ignorance-Home.</p>
