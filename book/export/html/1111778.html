<p>Sunanda is a first-class blind disciple. Today I was running behind her for 200 metres down the 150th Street hill, with only a 50-metre gap between us. I saw her, but she didn't see me.</p>
<p>Later I saw her again near Jamaica High School. Databir was screaming her name from the car, but still she didn't see me.</p>
<p>I have so many blind disciples. I saw Saroja running, but she was so discouraged that she didn't see me. Sunanda had been running quite fast, but Saroja was running slowly. Perhaps she was disappointed in her running.</p>
<p>Then I saw Pratibha. She was looking at my car, but she didn't recognise it.</p>
