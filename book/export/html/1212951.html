<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, I am curious to know from you why a great spiritual Master like Sri Krishna had to display a certain amount of <em>chicanery</em>.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, may God bless your curiosity, since I can’t. First of all, what you call Sri Krishna’s <em>trickery</em>, I call an unavoidable necessity. Secondly, the human in us cannot judge the divine Sri Krishna. There was an ultimate and divine purpose behind everything he said and did. The divine in you will gladly justify him whom you call Krishna the trickster.</p>  </div>
