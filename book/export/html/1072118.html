<p>Obscurity says to Beauty: "Beauty, why are you so beautiful?"</p>
<p>Beauty answers, "Obscurity, better ask me how I am so beautiful and not why. I am beautiful because my heart's soulful cry always touches the feet of God."</p>
<p>Purity speaks to Beauty: "Beauty, I wish to stay with you for some time."</p>
<p>Beauty answers, "Purity, certainly you may. I would love to have you. But don't forget to bring your identification."</p>
<p>"What is my identification? " asks Purity.</p>
<p>"Don't you know what your identification is? Your identification is your life-long spontaneity."</p>
<p>Austerity speaks to Beauty: "Beauty, you are a fool. You never aspire. I am really sorry to tell you that you are God's only failure."</p>
<p>"Austerity, granted, I am God's failure. But certainly you are no better than I am. Remember, God is all Love. Remember, God is all recreation."</p>
<p>Calamity says to Beauty: "Beauty, I loved you. Look at my deplorable consciousness. Look at time which has deserted me. Look at my fallen life!"</p>
<p>"Calamity, I can solve all your problems, once and for all. Give me your deplorable consciousness. From now on, it will live with my inner life. Give me the time that has deserted you. From now on, it will live with my inner breath. Give me your fallen life. From now on, it will live with my inner Goal."</p>
<p>Dignity speaks to Beauty: "Beauty, I understand perfectly why others bow down to you, but I do not know what makes me bow to you."</p>
<p>"Dignity, your heart's necessity tells you that I have the power to increase the capacity of your nobility's light."</p>
<p>Hostility says: "Beauty, my name is Hostility. I want to destroy you. I want to banish you from God's world. I want to destroy your beauty, both inner and outer, here and now."</p>
<p>Beauty says, "Hostility, you can never destroy me because inside me God the Necessity is immortalising me. Outside me, God the Omnipotent Reality is protecting me, cherishing me and fulfilling me."</p>
<p>Divinity whispers: "Can you tell me, Beauty, why I need you throughout Eternity?"</p>
<p>"Mother, you need me because within me you see your own everlasting divine sovereignty."</p>  </div>
