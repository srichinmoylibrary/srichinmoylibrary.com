<p>To cheer his divine birth<br /> He invited the cosmic gods.<br /> The gods simply flew down<br /> To the earth to cheer him, love him, embrace him.</p>
<p>To mourn his human death<br /> He invited his earthly comrades, earthly devotees, earthly adorers.<br /> Some came late,<br /> Some came not at all,<br /> Some just sneered<br /> At his audacious invitation.</p>

<p>O Lord Buddha,<br />   Please tell me the difference<br />        Between<br /> Sujata's sweetmeat<br />            And<br /> Chunda's venom-meat.</p>
<p>"Brother, the difference?<br />   Practically none!<br /> Sujata's sweetmeat<br /> Helped me openly in unlearning<br /> The lessons of Ignorance.<br /> Chunda's venom-meat<br /> Helped me secretly in learning<br /> The message of Nirvana."</p>

<p>"O Dear brother,<br /> Of all people, how is it that You, my wise brother,<br /> Do not understand my simple message?<br /> On earth I am my Father's Face,<br /> In Heaven I am my Father's Eye.<br /> In that sense we are one, inseparable.<br /> This is what I meant when I said:<br /> 'I and my Father are one.'
