<p>You know I like bargaining. While I was in Florida, we were buying an exerciser that cost around $139, but the man came down to $109.</p>
<p>I said, "Since you are so kind, can you not come down to $100?"</p>
<p>Then he said, "I am better than you-$99."</p>
<p>What an experience!</p>
<p>Then his wife said, "Please take your picture now, and when you lose weight with the help of our exerciser, send us another picture. Then we will keep both pictures here in our store so that people can see how much weight they can lose."</p>
<p>I was so amused, but I didn't have a camera with me.</p>
