<p>The people are so nice here! Everywhere I go, people say, "Good morning, good morning!" When I am out walking, I want to enter into my own meditation, but at least twenty times people say, "Good morning!" If there are three ladies passing by, all the three ladies have to say, "Good morning!"</p>
<p>My answer is to smile. Again, how many times I have to smile! Sometimes I am walking so fast and I find it difficult to think of smiling at them. This happens on the path right in front of the hotel.</p>
