<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Wings mean that the disciples have soaring aspiration. They are not the wings of an angel or the wings of a bird, but soaring aspiration that flies very, very high, infinitely higher than a bird. It is absolutely true that my disciples are most sincerely trying to develop and increase their power of aspiration. They have intense aspiration. Disciples who aspire definitely have these inner wings, which are called aspiration.</p>  </div>
