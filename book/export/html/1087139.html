  <h1 class="book-heading">A German consciousness</h1>
  
 
<p>I went into a store in Spain. A boy said, "Are you an Indian?"</p>
<p>I told him, "Yes!" Then I used my intuitive capacities and said, "And you have a German consciousness.</p>
<p>He said, "I was born in Cologne."</p>
<p>Then I asked him to write down Cologne the way they write it in German. He said his parents are from Spain, but his father worked in Germany for a few years and that is where he was born. He knew a little bit of German, and he started saying things in German.</p>
<p>I went out to search for some of our German boys who could talk to him, but by the time I found them, this little fellow had disappeared.</p>
