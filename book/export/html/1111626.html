<p>Today we had a "Rosie Ruiz." She started walking at one point during the race. Then she cut across the course and came out near the end. She didn't run six or eight hundred metres of the course, and then she said that she had won. Fortunately, two other runners told Tarak what had happened and he disqualified her.</p>
