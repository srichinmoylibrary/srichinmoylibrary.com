<p>This morning I was running on Hillside Avenue at about ten o'clock. Just before I reached Parsons Boulevard, I saw several policemen with guns and walkie-talkies. Somebody had told them that a man on the street had a gun. For one man who was reported seen near that place, how many policemen were there!</p>
<p>As soon as I ran by, a black man who was smoking said to me, "Shrai, Shrai, you are here? You invited me to come to a concert of yours, but I could not come. Can I have an interview with you?" He even wanted to shake hands with me. Four or five Puerto Rican children nearby started saying, "Sri, Sri." Then one of the policemen looked at me and gave me a big smile.</p>
