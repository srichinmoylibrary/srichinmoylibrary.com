<p>A childlike heart is of supreme importance if we sincerely want to fulfil the beautiful dream of the child's world. And who are the ones unmistakably qualified to perform this momentous task? It is the peace-lovers and the truth-servers who are singularly qualified. The Secretary-General says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our task is to plant the seeds of peace in the mind of every child. Young people must be brought up in the spirit of peace, justice, freedom, mutual respect and understanding. We must heed the Declaration of the Rights of the Child which insists that each child must be able to develop normally in health and with freedom and dignity. We must never forget that children everywhere are entitled to our special protection and care."</p>
