<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are some souls that have tremendous admiration, devotion and adoration for other souls. The souls that care for more light, more beauty, more divinity and more divine fulfilment look for the souls that are already endowed with measureless divine qualities. With their appreciation, admiration, adoration and selflessness they long to remain around these divinely and infinitely superior souls. So you can say that the souls that badly need something from these other souls serve the purpose or play the role of loving guards. They are not actually appointed by the superior ones, but they get abundant delight in giving their divine existence-reality to the superior ones. And their conscious alertness and awareness does prevent the wrong forces from attacking the divine territories of their beloved superiors.</p>  </div>
