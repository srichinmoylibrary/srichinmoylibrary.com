<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The experiences naturally lead to its expansion. When we speak of the soul’s expansion, we mean the manifestation of the Divinity inside the soul. Then when we have the experience of the soul, we expand our consciousness and gradually it becomes all-pervading. At the same time we manifest the Divinity that is within us. So expansion and manifestation go together. They are both the soul’s experience.</p>  </div>
