<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to see true beauty in your outer life, then it has to come from your pure life. Your purity-heart will be reflected in the beauty of your face, of your eyes and of your entire being. When you can bring to the fore your purity-heart, then you are bound to see real beauty in your face, in your eyes, in your hair, everywhere. Bringing forward a purity-heart is the only way for a seeker to make his or her outer existence beautiful. When purity comes forward, you will see a totally different aura around that person.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I went into a music shop. The man was looking at me and looking at me. Finally he said, "How beautiful you are! I am seeing your aura." In no way was he flattering me so that I would buy his musical instruments. He was seeing one of my auras. With such sincerity he was looking at me and admiring my aura. So here is the proof. The revelation of my purity-heart he saw in my outer face.</p>  </div>
