<p>There are one or two disciples who have very short life lines. If a palmist looked at their palms, he would say that they won't live beyond the age of thirty-five. But just because they are connected with the spiritual life, just because they are in our boat, they will definitely live beyond thirty-five. If they leave the boat, then God alone knows. There are one or two whose lives would have ended by now if they weren't in the spiritual life, because of drugs and this and that.</p>
<p>The left hand represents the past. On the left hand you will notice more lines, more marks. The left hand is like the storehouse; the right hand is the showhouse. Usually the lines are transferred from the left hand to the right hand.</p>
<p>We always say that boys have impurity problems and girls have insecurity problems. This is true, as we see in the outer life. But your hands declare something else. Some of the girls, I tell you, have much greater emotional problems than the boys, but the girls keep these problems under control, and subdue them. The boys do not keep them under control.</p>
<p>And one or two individuals I am seeing with tremendous will power. One boy has tremendous will power, but he is not using it at all. It is dormant. In hundreds of ways he could have used it.</p>
<p>You have shown me your marriage lines. Some of the boys and girls here are married. But if they had remained in the outer world, by this time they would have married at least three times. I am not joking. And some of you who would have got married are unmarried. So I am saying how fate can be changed if you follow the spiritual life.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is a matter of luck. Some of the girls have better luck than the boys. The girls will unfortunately not work as hard as the boys, but how far can luck take you? A dollar has dropped. You have not worked for it, but you can use this dollar to go and buy something from the store. The boys will work hard the whole day for one cent. Then gradually, gradually, they will make one dollar and go on, go on. In the girls' case, some of them have very good luck, but those girls do not have consistent determination to go beyond, beyond.</p>  </div>
