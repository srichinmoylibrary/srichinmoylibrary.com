<p>Akbar once asked Birbal, “After death, who are the people that go to Heaven and who are the people that go to hell?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty,” replied the minister, “only clever people go to Heaven after death. The fools go to hell.”</p>
<p>“Why is that?” asked the Emperor. “Why do the clever people go to Heaven? How do they become clever?”</p>
<p>“They become clever by knowing that there is only one thing worth having, and that is love. When they give love to the world and receive love from the world in return, everything is done. Only those who love the world and get love from the world are clever, and they go to Heaven. Those who don’t love the world and do not get love from the world go to hell.”</p>
<p>The Emperor was silent.</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>Birbal’s answer is almost perfect. His only mistake is to say “clever” when what he really means is “wise.” Now we have to know whether we love the world for its own sake, or whether we love God inside the world. If we feel that the Creator and the creation are one, then by loving the Creator of the world we can love His creation as well. Otherwise, we will love the world and expect love from the world in return. And if we do not get love from the world, we will feel sad and miserable.</p>
<p>According to spiritual philosophy, only those who love God in mankind and do not expect anything in return go to the real Heaven. Only those who offer love constantly and unconditionally to God in man can go to the highest abode of Peace, Light and Bliss after death. Those who do not do that will naturally go to an inferior world where these divine qualities are found in less sufficient measure.</p>
<p>But again, where is Heaven? Heaven is not just a place where we go after death. We go to Heaven and hell every day. Heaven and hell are states of consciousness. In the perfection of the mind, in the peace of the mind, Heaven abides. In the frustration of the mind, in the depression of the mind, hell lives. Every day we experience Heaven and hell in our lives. Frustration, depression, insecurity, worry, doubt, fear, anxiety and jealousy all make us live in hell. Security, beauty, joy, peace, light and love all allow us to dwell in Heaven at every moment.</p>  </div>
