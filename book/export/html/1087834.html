<p>DISCIPLE: Master, if I ask you a question, will you tell me the God-honest truth?</p>
<p>MASTER: Of course, my child, of course.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: Before you realised God, did you have any occasion to disobey God?</p>
<p>MASTER: My child, let me search my brain. Give me some time.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: Master, even forty years ago when I told you a lie, I still remember it. How is it that you do not remember whether you have told God a lie or not? You say that you can read our past lives like an open book. How is it that you do not remember what you did?</p>
<p>MASTER: My child, in the process of my spiritual awakening, spiritual experiences and highest realisation, I gave up telling lies to God and definitely NOT when I was on the verge of God-realisation.</p>  </div>
