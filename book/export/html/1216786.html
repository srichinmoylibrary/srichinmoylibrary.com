<p>At the airport the plane was an hour and a half late. I was chatting with the disciples in the lounge, cutting jokes and just killing time. As usual, the disciples were looking at me with affection, love and devotion, as though they were all about to realise God in the next second.</p>
<p>One middle-aged man was observing us. When it came time to board, strangely enough the disciples were allowed to come very near the entrance to the plane. So that man got mad. He came up to me and said, "Who do you think you are — God? These people are worshipping you as if you were God. Since you are God, you enter first!"</p>
<p>I said, "I am not blocking your way. You please go first."</p>
<p>Standing in front of him were Agraha and Brad. Immediately they wanted to go with me into the plane to protect me, but I said it was not necessary.</p>
