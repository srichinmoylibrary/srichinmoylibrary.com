<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not use the term ‘technique’. In my case it is not like that. Each individual seeker I deal with according to his own aspiration and according to his own receptivity. I enter into the soul of the individual seeker and if I feel that he is extremely sincere and if it is God’s Will, then inwardly I give him a specific meditation. Each seeker needs a specific meditation, but it is not a technique. It is only a way of teaching him how he can enter into his deepest inner being. If a seeker consciously enters into my boat, then it is the business of the boatman to carry him across the sea of ignorance to the Golden Shore of the Beyond. But there is no hard and fast technique that I use.</p>  </div>
