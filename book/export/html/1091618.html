<p>A child had been sick for a long time. From time to time, his mother had to take him to the hospital for treatment. One day he was supposed to go to the hospital, but his mother had something very urgent to do. The mother was saying, "O God! How can I send my son to the hospital today?"</p>
<p>Then the mother thought of a young man who was their neighbour. The mother went to him and said, "My child has to go to the hospital today, but I have such an important thing to do. Will you be able to take him for me?"</p>
<p>The young man answered, "Of course! Of course!"</p>
<p>Then she said, "Will you be able to drive him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, certainly!"</p>
<p>The mother said, "I will give you some money."</p>
<p>The young man replied, "No, please do not. I love your son very much. I will not take any money from you."</p>
<p>The mother was very moved. She brought her child to the young man, and he started driving the child to the hospital.</p>
<p>On the way, the child folded his hands and said to the young man, "Are you not God?"</p>
<p>"I am God?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes! My mother was praying to God. 'Who will take my child to the hospital?' Then Mother brought me to you and now you are taking me. I am sure you are God!"</p>
<p>The young man said, "I am not God! I am not God!"</p>
<p>"But my mother prayed to God."</p>
<p>He said, "Yes, your mother prayed to God and God listened to your mother's prayer. I was free, and I am so glad that I am able to take you."</p>
<p>The boy said, "When I grow older, I will never forget you. I will also try to do you some favour. Please remember, I will never forget your kindness."</p>
<p>The young man patted the boy on his shoulder and said, "I am doing you a favour. When you reach my age, God alone knows where I will be! I may not be in the same house. You may not be here."</p>
<p>The little boy said, "I know. But my heart is saying that we shall be together. Somehow we shall be together."</p>
<p>The young man said, "All right! All right! Because of you I have to become a good person. Your mother prayed to God and so I became God's instrument. I am not a good person, but I have to become good."</p>
<p>The little boy said, "No! You are so good and so kind to me."</p>
<p>Then the young man said, "This is my promise to you. When I start working, I will give you a job in my office. In case I cannot get a good job, if you become a big shot, will you give me a job?"</p>
<p>The boy said, "Of course! Of course! I will give you a very good job! I will even make you my partner!"</p>
<p>Then the older boy laughed and laughed. "I am ready to be your partner!"</p>
<p>Twenty years passed. This little boy was very brilliant. He did very, very well and became an executive officer. But he never forgot his older friend. He always remembered that his friend had helped him when he had to go to the hospital.</p>
<p>The executive found out that his friend was working as an ordinary postal clerk, so he went to see him. The executive said, "You were my God. Now please come with me. I am now an executive, and I want you to be my partner. I have a very large office." He made his friend his partner, giving him a half share of everything.</p>
<p>This is how good people act! After he saw the little boy, the older boy said, "I have to become a good person. I want to become good." The little boy changed his older friend's fate.</p>  </div>
