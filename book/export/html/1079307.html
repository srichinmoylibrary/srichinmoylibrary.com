<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No matter on what plane the Master initiates you here on earth, that is more than enough. Initiation means that the Master teaches you how to swim. Once he teaches you how to swim, he will constantly inspire you to swim across the sea of ignorance. He will not have to teach you again and again how to swim. Once he teaches you, that is enough. He will constantly inspire you, guide you, shape you and mould you until you reach your Goal, your transcendental Self, your highest Reality.</p>  </div>
