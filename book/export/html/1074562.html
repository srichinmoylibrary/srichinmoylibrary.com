  <h1 class="book-heading">49. She</h1>
  
 

<p>To think of Her<br /> Is to become a chosen instrument of God.</p>
<p>To meditate on Her<br /> Is to reach the heights of Paradise unchallenged.</p>
<p>To see Her<br /> Is to sit on Infinity's Transcendental Throne.</p>
<p>To feel Her<br /> Is to become Immortality's Bliss.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">50. The date of his birth is controversial</h1>
  
 

<p>The date of his birth is controversial.<br /> The soul of the earth says:<br /> "He was born on August 27, 1931."</p>
<p>The heart of the earth says:<br /> "He was born on August 30, 1931."</p>
<p>The vital of the earth says:<br /> "He was born on August 27, 1936."</p>
<p>The mind of the earth says:<br /> "He was born on August 27, 1938."</p>
<p>The body of the earth says:<br /> "He was born on August 27, 1950."</p>
<p>God says:<br /> "He was born twice:<br /> Once before the beginning of Life<br /> in the Heart of Silence,<br /> Once after the end of Death<br /> in the Head of Sound."</p>
