<p>She had a car accident and her car was damaged. She expected her insurance company to fix the car or give her the money to pay for repairs. She came to the Master and said, “Either you do something with my car or cure my husband, who constantly accuses me of insanity. I know clearly that he has become senile, insane, but he thinks that it is I who have become insane. So either you cure him, or do something with regard to my accident. And I have another serious problem with my husband which I told you about previously.”</p>
<p>The Master gave her a broad smile and said, “All these matters I would like to place at the Feet of the Supreme.”</p>
<p>She said to the Master, “Since you have no true concern, no personal concern for me, why do I have to remain your disciple?”</p>
<p>She left.</p>  </div>
