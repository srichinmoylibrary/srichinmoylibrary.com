<p>As usual, Sona barked when the boys took prasad this morning. Then Sona went over to Kanu’s bed and lay down in it. Kanu was standing there. In silence, he was telling Sona to get out, but Sona did not listen to him.</p>
<p>I also was begging Sona to get out, but Sona would not go. I said to Kanu, “What can I do? I am begging him. Do I have to go and grab him?”</p>
<p>Kanu was waiting for Sona to go, but he would not. go. So, after some time, Kanu went to Sona’s bed.</p>
