    <title>Question: The night I met you I had a very dramatic experience. During the meditation you came over to me and put a flower into my hands. My hands weren&#039;t moving at all, but there seemed to be a tremendous power that was pulling them. I was looking at you and I thought, &amp;quot;What is he pulling me for?&amp;quot; Then when you looked at me I felt as though my inner being was whirling around and exploding through the top of my head. Can you tell me what this means?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your outer world burst into pieces and entered into the inner world, where you have not only accepted me, but felt and realised my spiritual achievement and realisation. Your outer world of turmoil finally surrendered to your inner world of spiritual infinitude. This is a most beautiful and high experience.</p>  </div>
