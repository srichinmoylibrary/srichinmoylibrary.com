<p>Man is a wonderful guest!<br /> He brings with him<br /> Nothing<br /> When he goes to God.<br /> He feels that since God<br /> Has everything and is everything<br /> He needs no gift from a poor mortal.<br /> God is a wonderful host!<br /> He carries with Him<br /> All that He has and all that He is<br /> When He comes to man.<br /> For He knows<br /> That He houses within Himself<br /> Eternity's infinite wealth.<br /> He knows that man is helpless,<br /> if not hopeless;<br /> Hopeless, if not effortless;<br /> Effortless, if not loveless;<br /> Loveless, if not Godless.</p>
