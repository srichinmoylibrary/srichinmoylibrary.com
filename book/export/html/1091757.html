<p>Once the young Prince Salim, the future Emperor Jahangir, said to his father, "Father, how is it that you have allowed one of your Hindu Ministers to erect a temple and spend so much money? The top of the temple is even studded with diamonds. Why did you allow him to spend so much money for the Hindu religion?"</p>
<p>Akbar said to him, "My son, I love my own religion. Is there anything that I will not do for my religion? Will money ever stand in my way? If I wanted to build a beautiful mosque, would I care about the amount of money that it cost? The Hindu Minister also loves his religion. If he wants to spend money for his religion, what right do I have to prevent him?</p>
<p>"I love something because it is my very own. Does he not have the right to love the thing that is his very own? I cannot ask him not to spend money on his religion, for I know that I would do the same thing for my religion."</p>  </div>
