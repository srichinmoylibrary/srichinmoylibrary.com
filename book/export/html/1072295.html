<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The message that prayer and meditation can help them in all aspects of their lives. If they want to become physically strong, then they can gain much by practising prayer and meditation. On the strength of my prayer and meditation, I have been able to build up my strength and to accomplish something in 15 months which otherwise would have taken me 30 or 40 years to do. Or perhaps I would never have been able to do these things. So my message is that if one needs strength, then uncovering oneâ€™s inner strength through prayer and meditation is the fastest and most effective way to get it.</p>  </div>
