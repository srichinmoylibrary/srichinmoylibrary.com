<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us take all religions as members of one family. In a family there are many members, and each one is entitled to have a different opinion. But they do know that they all belong to the same family. True religion is like a life-tree; it has many branches with countless flowers, fruits and leaves. When we deal with different parts of the life-tree, we see diverse opinions on world issues.</p>
<p>Each individual seeker views the Creator and the creation according to his own aspiration and level of development. What we need is light to illumine our inner and outer differences. It is through our oneness-life that we will walk, march and run to the Supreme. We must have appreciation for and sympathetic oneness with all religions in order to create a harmony that will spread throughout the length and breadth of the world.</p>  </div>
