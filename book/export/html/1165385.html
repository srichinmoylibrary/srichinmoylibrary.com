    <title>Question: While I was watching the film about you that was shown in Berkeley recently, one of the striking things that I noticed was the way your eyes were constantly quivering. This gives one the sensation of inner ecstasy. Can you comment about that?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To an unaspiring person, the flickering of the eyes looks like a restless movement. But for the sincere seekers, this movement of the eyes will be a different matter altogether. There are seven higher planes of consciousness. Since I am a spiritual man and at the same time I am in a meditative consciousness, I am flying from one plane of consciousness to another. I am acting like a divine bird, flying from one branch to another. When my eyes move, I enter into one plane of consciousness and the treasure of that consciousness enters into my being; then I reveal this treasure through my eyes. While I am entering into another plane of consciousness, I acquire and reveal the wealth of that plane of consciousness.</p>  </div>
