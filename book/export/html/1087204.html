<p>The manager of the Marine Midland Bank told his wife that I had met the Pope and that I was going to present him with an autographed picture.</p>
<p>His wife didn't believe that I would sign the picture for him.</p>
<p>The manager begged me to autograph the picture so he could prove to his wife that we are friends.</p>
