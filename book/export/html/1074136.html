<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the marathon runner. If the marathon runner is a seeker, a God-lover, then that person can have a connection with the Cosmic Gods. Again, in the West, people do not believe in the Cosmic Gods the way people in the East, specially in India, believe. Unfortunately, in India good marathon runners can be counted on the fingertips! And even then, who knows if they are spiritual?</p>
<p>So it entirely depends on the runners. If the runners pray to the Cosmic Gods and Goddesses, if they meditate on them, then only can they have free access to them. Then the Cosmic Gods and Goddesses will protect that person while he or she is running or doing any physical activity.</p>  </div>
