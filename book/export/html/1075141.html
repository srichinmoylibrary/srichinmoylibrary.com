<p>HE NEEDS MORE</p>
<p>The more an earth-bound man has,<br /> The more he needs.</p>
<p>He has doubt;<br /> He needs more.</p>
<p>He has despair;<br /> He needs more.</p>
<p>He has failure;<br /> He needs more.</p>
<p>The more a heaven-soaring man has,<br /> The more he needs.</p>
<p>He has faith, faith in himself;<br /> He needs more.</p>
<p>He has courage, courage to brave ignorance;<br /> He needs more.</p>
<p>He has love, love to feed the world;<br /> He needs more.</p>
