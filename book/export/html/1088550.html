<p>Babar was the first of the great Moghul emperors of India. When his son Humayan was a young man, he fell seriously ill. Day by day his condition grew worse, until his death seemed imminent.</p>
<p>Then a saint came to Babar and said, "If you sacrifice something most precious to you, only then will your son be cured. The Kohinoor diamond is most precious."</p>
<p>The Emperor said, "The Kohinoor is my son's possession. What kind of sacrifice would that be? I have to sacrifice something of my own. My life alone is most precious. I am ready to give my life."</p>
<p>Then he walked around his son's bed three times, offering this prayer: "Allah, take my life instead of my son's. Let me die in his place, and let him live on earth. This is my only prayer and my most willing sacrifice."</p>
<p>To Babar's wide surprise, after he had completed three rounds, his son stood up completely well. But immediately Babar fell ill and in three months' time he died.</p>  </div>
