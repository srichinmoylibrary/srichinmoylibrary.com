<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In three years, more or less. But the important fact is that I don't care to have a great number of disciples. I care for the sincerity and aspiration of the student. There are some teachers who want a great number of disciples. I, on the contrary, am very strict with my disciples. I do not accept hippies, alcoholics, or drug addicts, or those with problems due to a perverted nature. There are spiritual teachers who accept all comers. In my case I say differently. A person must at least be ready to follow this path. This does not mean that those persons cannot go to other teachers to learn about Truth. There are different methods</p>  </div>
