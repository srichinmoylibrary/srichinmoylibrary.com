<p>Before the concert in Germany, the technicians were looking at me with such respect, admiration and awe. It was because they saw how my disciples were behaving.</p>
<p>One of the security guards came near me and asked, "Are you nervous?"</p>
<p>So in a joking way I deliberately started shaking and trembling.</p>
<p>Then he said, "Don't be nervous, don't be nervous!"</p>
<p>â€” 29 March 1984</p>  </div>
