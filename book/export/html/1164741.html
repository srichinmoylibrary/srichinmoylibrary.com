<p><em>(Evening. Krishna and Arjuna are walking along the street. It is quite dark. A woman sees them.)</em></p>
<p>WOMAN: It seems to me that both of you are lost in the dark, and that both of you need a place to stay tonight. I shall be happy to have you as my guests tonight.</p>
<p>ARJUNA: That is a splendid idea.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Let us stay at her place.</p>
<p>WOMAN: I shall be happy to have you as my divine guests.</p>
