<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because you sleep more than I do. In the outer life I don’t sleep, and also in the inner world I don’t sleep. Spiritual Masters have very little rest in the inner world. When you become an expert in something you know many, many things. Now what do I know about a car? A mechanic will know more because he is an expert on cars. You people are just like cars. You have an expert and he will take care of you.</p>  </div>
