<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God wears ties at every moment, from His birthless Silence to His deathless Sound. From the beginning of His creation and throughout the ever-continuing creation, He has always worn ties. When a human being wears a tie, it is for a few hours. Then he changes his tie or he takes it off. But in Godâ€™s case, He has been wearing His ties since the creation of humanity. Birthless and deathless ties of oneness He has been wearing all throughout His creation, and He will continue to wear these ties of oneness eternally.</p>  </div>
