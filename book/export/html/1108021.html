<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To see blue light is a very good, very high experience. Blue light is the light of pure spirituality and also the light of the infinite. If you see blue light around someone or around yourself, it means that your inner being is responding to the vast infinity or that your own spirituality is now maturing and you are entering into something very vast. Your spirituality has entered into your whole inner and outer existence. If you see blue light around some spiritual Masters, it is because some of these Masters have predominantly blue light, as in the case of Lord Krishna, although they also have all types of light.</p>  </div>
