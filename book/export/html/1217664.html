<p>Any method of spiritual discipline will have two inevitable and inseparable wings: absolute patience and firm resolution.</p>
<p>A progressive self-giving and an absolute confidence in God can easily challenge the strength of impossibility in one's spiritual journey.</p>
<p>March forward just three steps and God is won. Now what are the three steps? The first step is aspiration. The second step is self-giving. The third step is reliance on oneself, reliance on the Divine.</p>
<p>In the early stages of spiritual practice, to leave everything to the Divine and to think that personal effort is unnecessary is to dance before you can walk.</p>
<p>Tapasya (intense or austere discipline) says to the aspirant: "I shall make you see God." Surrender says to the aspirant: "I shall make God see you."</p>
<p>Faithfulness is the only key that both Tapasya and Surrender possess to open God's door.</p>
<p>In the ultimate analysis, no distinction can ever be made between Tapasya and Surrender. Surrender, when complete and effective, is the result of, and nothing other than Tapasya.</p>
<p>The more complete the aspirant's surrender, the brighter the smile of his psychic being.</p>
<p>Surrender is fondly influenced by the psychic being.</p>
<p>Knowledge is boldly influenced by the Will.</p>
<p>Surrender is the most suitable net to entrap the Divine.</p>
<p>It is at once wisdom and power in action.</p>
<p>Spontaneous obedience is the husk. Conscious surrender is the rice.</p>
<p>Active surrender says to God: "Father, I am looking at you. Be pleased to look at me. Let us look at each other." Passive surrender says to God: "Father, I need not look at you. You just look at me. That will do."</p>
<p>There are three ways of fulfilling a soul's need: either the aspirant steps forward to see the Divine; or the Divine steps forward to make the aspirant see Him; or both the aspirant and the Divine step forward simultaneously towards each other.</p>
<p>When the aspirant bitterly starves his questioning mind and feeds his surrender sumptuously, God says: "The time is ripe. I come."</p>
<p>Surrender can never be a one-day achievement. Likewise realisation, when attained, is not a one-day wonder. Although regularity in spiritual practice may appear mechanical, it is a constant blessing from above and shows the development of some inner strength.</p>
<p>To see God only during your surrender at meditation is to declare that God is absent from you more than He is present.</p>
<p>True meditation has a free access to the inner Being. True self-consecration has a free access to the right consciousness and attitude.</p>
<p>When the mind and the vital close their eyes for good, surrender, the inner strength, opens its eyes for good.</p>  </div>
