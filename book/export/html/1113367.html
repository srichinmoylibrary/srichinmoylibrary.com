<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are quite a few qualities which you have to develop in order to attain spiritual freedom, but three particular qualities are most important: dynamism in your outer life, a sincere and devoted oneness with the inner messages that you receive from the Supreme in me, and the transformation of your restless mind into a mind flooded with poise. If you can have these three things, then you are bound to attain spiritual freedom.</p>  </div>
