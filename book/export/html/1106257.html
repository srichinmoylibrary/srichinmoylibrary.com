<p>Your progress and triumphs during the last year are not only evidence of your success as a weightlifter but, also, they are testimonies of your perseverance and self-discipline. These are the very qualities that make of you an outstanding human being and an example to society.</p>
<p>In the past you have excelled in writing, painting and meditating. Now as you join the world of sports, you prove that determination and will power triumph in any field man sets himself to conquer.</p>
