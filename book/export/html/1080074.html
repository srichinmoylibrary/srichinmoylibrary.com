<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are three ways to look at the evolution of the soul of the United Nations. One is the human way, another is the divine way and the third is God's way.</p>
<p>The human way is the way that our physical mind understands the evolution of the soul of the United Nations. Right now, when we assess something, when we try to determine something, we use our physical mind our earthbound mind. But the human mind, the earthbound mind, cannot see the soul of the United Nations. If the physical mind tries to see the evolution of the soul of the United Nations, then it sees it as a seed that is quite uncertain of future growth. It feels that the seed may not germinate at all; there will be no plant, not to speak of a tree. This is how our physical mind regards the evolution of the soul of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Then there is the divine way. The divine way is the way of the heart, which identifies itself with the soul of the United Nations according to its loving capacity. On the strength of its identification with the soul of the United Nations, the heart sees and feels clearly the actual growth, evolution, progress and success of the soul of the United Nations. When the heart observes or feels the evolution of the soul of the United Nations, it sees a tree, a powerful tree. This tree is the soul-tree of peace, harmony, light and delight. And it sees that there are countless human beings consciously or unconsciously seated at the foot of this tree. These human beings who are seated at the foot of this tree have an iota of aspiration in the inmost recesses of their hearts. If they consciously try to become one with the soul of the United Nations on the strength of their most sincere prayer and most sincere meditation, then the soul of the United Nations cheerfully, unreservedly and unconditionally shares with them its wealth, which is universal love, universal light and universal delight.</p>
<p>From God's point of view, from the highest, absolute point of view, the United Nations embodies the seed that the mind observes; it embodies the tree that the heart feels; and also it embodies the fruit. From the highest point of view, this tree of peace, light, bliss and harmony has already started bearing fruit, the fruit of oneness, universal oneness. This fruit some God-lovers have already seen and felt. Let us use the term "Truth-lovers," since there are many people who do not consciously admit the fact that God exists. But for them, Truth exists. We know perfectly well that God and Truth are identical, inseparable; they are like the obverse and reverse of the same coin. But if someone likes the idea of Truth as the only reality, as the ultimate Goal, let him remain with his realisation. Your realisation that God is the only Reality is exactly the same.</p>
<p>When we see the evolution of the soul of the United Nations from the point of view of the Transcendental God, then we feel that the soul of the United Nations is quite mature. It is evolved to a considerable degree. We who love the principles, the ideals, the goals of the United Nations are consciously aspiring to eat the fruit, which the soul of the United Nations has already become. Again, since we believe in the process of evolution, we feel that there is no end to the progress that the soul of the United Nations will make. Evolution is from within and without, whereas transcendence is something that we grow in as we achieve great, greater, greatest perfection in life, in nature and in our multifarious activities. So, if we believe also in the process of transcendence, then we feel that the light, the peace, the bliss that the United Nations has already received and achieved and become is being transcended every day, every hour, every minute, every second.</p>  </div>
