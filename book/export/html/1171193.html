<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First you have to bring to the fore all your own good qualities. It is very difficult for us to see the good qualities in others while we either cherish or see our bad qualities. On the one hand, it is very easy to find good qualities in ourselves. On the other hand, we have to know how much sincerity we are using. Very often our imagination tells us that we have many more good qualities than our friends or our dear ones. That is why we see them as an object of pity or we feel we cannot associate ourselves with them. My advice to you is to bring forward all the good qualities that you feel you have within and make them living. Make them not only visible, but vibrant with life-energy. After you have done this, you can try to see the same good qualities or a few other good qualities in others. Then automatically your good qualities will reflect on them or their good qualities will come forward.</p>
<p>When we show someone a rose, that person also wants to show us a rose. We have to offer our good qualities which are pure and loving. Then these good qualities will act like a magnet and others will bring their good qualities right in front of us. When your good qualities are absolutely alive, you will be able to see the good qualities in others.</p>  </div>
