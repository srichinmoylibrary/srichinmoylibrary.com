<p>When I run near Dobbs Ferry, I start near the Hudson River and run for three miles. The first mile is all uphill. At one point I run fifty metres straight to the top of a hill. Right at the top I am always attacked by dogs.</p>
<p>Once Nathan was bragging that the hills he runs in Arizona are very steep. So I told him, "You come with me." At first he didn't want to admit that the hills I ran were steeper. But when I started barking at him, he confessed that these were steeper and more difficult.</p>
