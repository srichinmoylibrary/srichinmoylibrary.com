  <h1 class="book-heading">Realisation</h1>
  
 
<p>Experience is a rented house, while Realisation is a permanent Palace.</p>
<p>If you have sincerity, God-realisation becomes easy. And in addition to sincerity, if you have patience, God-realisation becomes easier. And in addition to sincerity and patience, if you have self-sacrifice, God-realisation becomes easiest.</p>
<p>A perfect renunciation and a complete self-surrender are the obverse and reverse of an ambrosial coin.</p>
<p>As the prayer, so the answer. As the sacrifice, so the reward. As the realisation, so the union.</p>
<p>What does liberation teach you? It teaches you that like Purusha, Prakriti is also above all disturbances, although she is to be found ever in the whirlwind of work.</p>
<p>An individual liberation and perfection are a thousand miles from God's supreme intention. What He wants is the universalisation of the individual perfection and liberation.</p>
