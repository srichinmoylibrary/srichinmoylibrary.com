<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the Divine Father enters into a human consciousness and with His human consciousness judges His children’s aspiration, then in the twinkling of an eye frustration will assail Him. But if the Divine Father remains in His divine Consciousness, then He is not disturbed by His children’s deplorable aspiration for He knows that He deals with Eternity’s patience-light.</p>  </div>
