<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can accept everyone who works at the United Nations as our very own provided we feel that there is only one source. Let us say that the source is the soul of the United Nations. If we love the soul of the United Nations and soulfully and devotedly claim it as our own, very own, then automatically we will accept all the members of the United Nations. It is like loving and claiming our father and mother. If we love our mother and father, if we claim them as our own, then all the members of the family also become ours. The soul of the United Nations embodies all the members of the United Nations. Only by loving and claiming the source as our own and by becoming consciously one with the source can we claim all the members as our own.</p>
