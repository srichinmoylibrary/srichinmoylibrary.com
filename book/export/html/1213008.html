  <h1 class="book-heading">Two brothers: Madal and Chinmoy, part 3</h1>
  
   <div id="node-1213009" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">101 Inadvertently</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, what shall I do when people <em>inadvertently</em> offend me?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, my simple suggestion to you is that when anyone offends you <em>unintentionally</em>, forgive him. And when anyone speaks ill of you intentionally, try to perfect him if you can.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213010" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">102 Inane</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, is he not <em>inane</em> who thinks that God loves even an atheist?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, you think that one <em>is silly and lacking in sense</em> if he thinks that God loves even an atheist. But I wish to assure you that even a stark atheist can never escape the boundaries of God’s Love. Never!</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213011" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">103 Incarcerate</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, when we speak ill of God, do the cosmic forces <em>incarcerate</em> our inner beings and inhibit their spiritual freedom?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, when we speak ill of God, the cosmic forces do not <em>imprison</em> our inner beings. What actually happens when we speak ill of God is that we imprison God in the prison cell of our own ceaseless ignorance.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213012" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">104 Incongruous</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, my life is short, but my desires are as long as an endless train. My life and my desires are an <em>incongruous</em> pair.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, since you feel that your life and your desires are not <em>harmonious in character</em>, why not replace your long train of desires with a long train of aspiration? I assure you, God will flood your life with inner and outer harmony.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213013" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">105 Indigent</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, when will India end its existence as an <em>indigent</em> country?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, India will no longer be <em>poverty-stricken</em> only at God’s choice Hour. Perhaps that Hour is fast approaching.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213014" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">106 Injunction</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, I live in a hostile neighbourhood. The people there flatly defy <em>injunctions</em> which come from the city authorities.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, if your neighbours defy <em>court orders</em>, then you can go to the inner Supreme Court. I am sure the Supreme Justice of the inner court will listen to your plea. Just try it once.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213015" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">107 Insipid</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, what makes our human life so <em>insipid</em>?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, it is our unawareness of God’s Presence in all our activities that makes our lives <em>dull, uninteresting and uninspiring</em>.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213016" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">108 Intransigent</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, alas, I have an <em>intransigent</em> vital.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, don’t feel sad. Aspire more devotedly, more soulfully and more unconditionally. Then you won’t have to suffer from your <em>stubborn and resisting</em> nature. One thing I must tell you: you have a most sincere heart.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213017" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">109 Intrepid</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, be frank with me, please. Among your disciples, who are more <em>intrepid</em>, the boys or the girls?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, rest assured, I am not a stranger to frankness. When it is a matter of conquering the depression-dragon, my boy disciples are more <em>fearless</em> than my girl disciples. But when it is a matter of surrendering to the divine Will quickly and cheerfully, my girl disciples are more <em>courageous</em> than my boy disciples.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213018" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">110 Jocose</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, I wish to be a circus clown so that I can always inspire people to be <em>jocose</em>.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, a circus clown is <em>funny and playful</em> in public, but in private his life may swim in the sea of tears. If you want to be merry and cheerful within as well as without, then think and feel that you are only four years old, and not forty.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213019" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">111 Judicious</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, is it <em>judicious</em> on my part not to sleep at all, but to meditate all day and night so that I can realise God in a few months’ time?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, be <em>wise</em>; don’t be a fool. At your present state of spiritual development your body needs at least seven hours of sleep each night. If you deny the body its legitimate demands, then long before you reach God, death will reach you and clasp its arms around you.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213020" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">112 Juncture</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, how is it that there are some people on earth who do not think of God even at the most crucial <em>juncture</em> of their existence — when they are about to leave this world for the other shore?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, they do not think of God at that critical <em>moment</em> because their ignorance makes them feel that God is a stranger to them.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213021" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">113 Ken</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, please be sincere: what is beyond your <em>ken</em>?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, I am totally sincere. Man’s feeling of unworthiness is beyond <em>my range of knowledge</em>.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213022" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">114 Laconic</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, sometimes your answers to spiritual questions are <em>laconic</em> and sometimes they are not. Why is it so?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, usually when the audience is very receptive, my answers are not <em>brief</em> at all. It depends on the magnetic pull of the questioner — that is to say, the sincere necessity of the questioner. If the questioner is sincere and the audience is receptive, my answer can never be brief, for God has kindly given me a few most delicious fruits to share with others. These fruits are Peace, Light and Bliss, which I am always ready to give to others in abundant measure.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213023" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">115 Lugubrious</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, there are some spiritual Masters who constantly think of and talk about their ex-disciples. Is this not a <em>lugubrious</em> pastime for them?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, it is true that it may <em>be sad or overly mournful</em> when the spiritual Masters talk of their ex-disciples. But one thing you do not know and perhaps will never know is that the souls of the ex-disciples cannot and do not leave the Masters so easily. That is why the sincere concern and compassion of the Masters extend to their ex-disciples.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213024" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">116 Magnanimity</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, how can I have a heart of <em>magnanimity</em>? At times I am so mean.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, you can have a heart of <em>generosity and nobility</em> if you consciously join yourself with God’s Heart and feel that His infinite children are all your children.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213025" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">117 Maudlin</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, do you subscribe to the common view that women are always <em>maudlin</em>?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> No, Madal, I don’t. Women are not always <em>tearfully emotional and sentimental</em>. But women almost always are insecurity incarnate, and men are almost always impurity incarnate.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213026" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">118 Mellifluous</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, I am extremely happy when you play the flute, but your harmonium does not have <em>mellifluous</em> tones at all.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, I don’t disagree with you. True, my harmonium does not <em>have sweetly flowing</em> tones, but it has been my most faithful friend. This childhood friend of mine is dearer than the dearest and sweeter than the sweetest to me.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213027" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">119 Miscreant</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, I have a friend who is nothing but a <em>miscreant</em>. How can I get rid of him?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, since he is your friend, you can advise the <em>evildoer</em> to meditate on God daily for at least four hours. After hearing your suggestion, he himself will leave you.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213028" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">120 Moribund</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, do you concur with me when I say that all religions are <em>moribund</em>?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, I do not agree with you. Religions and the leaders of all religions are quite alive. It is our human faith in religion that is <em>dying</em>, and we are already seeing the results of this deplorable state. But Yoga will come to the rescue of all people, whether they have faith in religion or not. Yoga will show them a most significant road that will lead them directly to God-realisation, even if they do not care for any specific religion or even for religion itself.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213029" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">121 Mulct</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, very often I am <em>mulcted</em> of all my money by my deceitful friends. What shall I do with such friends?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, those who <em>extract</em> money from you <em>by fraud or deceit</em> can never be your friends. But you have one Friend who will never cheat you, and that Friend is God.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213030" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">122 Niggardly</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, can a <em>niggardly</em> disciple be well-liked by you?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, certainly a <em>stingy</em> disciple can be well-liked by me if he has some good and divine qualities which compensate for this bad quality.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213031" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">123 Nomad</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, some of the Indian swamis live like <em>nomads</em>. Do you approve of this way of life?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, you are right. Some of the Indian swamis have no permanent home and are constant <em>wanderers</em>. But who am I to approve or disapprove of their conduct? I can only say that I shall never sail in their boat.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213032" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">124 Nugatory</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, is there anything on earth which is always <em>nugatory</em>?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Yes, Madal, from the spiritual point of view, earthly success is of <em>no real value</em>.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213033" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">125 Obdurate</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, who gave me this <em>obdurate</em> vital?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, nobody gave you an <em>obstinate</em> vital. It was you who wanted it and accepted it from the ocean of ignorance. Again, it is you who can get rid of it if you just jump into the ocean of Light.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213034" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">126 Objurgatory</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, are you ever <em>objurgatory</em> when you deal with your spiritual children?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Yes, Madal, sometimes I am. But to tell you the truth, my spiritual children are so fond of me that they don’t mind my vehemently <em>reproachful</em> voice and my imperious nature. I am trying hard to be more loving and more sympathetic.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213035" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">127 Obstreperous</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, it is said that God is extremely fond of children. To me, all children seem <em>obstreperous</em>. Hence, I literally hate them. Do you care for children?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, I do care for children. I like them, I love them, I adore them. You hate <em>unruly, boisterous</em> children and my budding disciples hate their unruly thoughts. So you and my disciples can be in the same boat sailing towards the same destination — nowhere.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213036" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">128 Onerous</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, why do I feel that my life is an <em>onerous</em> duty?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, you feel your life is a <em>burdensome</em> obligation because you do not appreciate the beauty of duty and the greatness of responsibility.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213037" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">129 Ostentatious</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, what do you do with your <em>ostentatious</em> disciples?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, I love my disciples who are <em>given to pretentious display</em>. I bless them and try to perfect them.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213038" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">130 Paragon</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, who is the <em>paragon</em> of perfection in the spiritual life?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, in the spiritual life an unconditionally selfless seeker is the <em>ideal model</em> of perfection.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213039" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">131 Parsimonious</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, in your inner life you are most generous. I am glad that you are not <em>parsimonious</em> in your outer life either.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, God has not made me <em>miserly</em> in the least, for He knows well that if I cherish that kind of attitude, my disciples will be totally embarrassed and disheartened.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213040" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">132 Peccadillo</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, do you consider your disciples’ <em>peccadillos</em> as your own?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Yes, Madal, I do, and I always shall accept their <em>trifling faults</em> as my own, for my disciples are, after all, my own extended consciousness.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213041" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">133 Peremptory</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, does God use a <em>peremptory</em> tone of voice when He deals with the hostile forces?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Yes, Madal, He does, for only His <em>imperative and imperious</em> commands can silence and transform the hostile forces.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213042" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">134 Perfidious</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, tell me, what is most <em>perfidious</em> in our human nature?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, self-doubt is the most <em>treacherous and deceitful</em> thing in our human nature.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213043" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">135 Perfunctory</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, every day, being very busy, I meditate for fifteen minutes in a rather <em>perfunctory</em> manner. I wonder if my soul forgives me.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, your soul will forgive you, but a day will come when you will not be able to forgive yourself. If you meditate in a <em>hasty and superficial way</em>, your God-Realisation will always remain a far cry.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213044" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">136 Periphery</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, what do you do with the disciples who are on the <em>periphery</em> of your spiritual circle?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, I try to give those unfortunate disciples inner capacity and outer opportunity so that they do not remain on the <em>external boundary</em> but enter into and become members of my inner circle.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213045" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">137 Perspicacity</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, I wish to be a great writer; therefore, I need some <em>perspicacity</em> in my imagination.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, just knock soulfully at the door of aspiration. Once the door of aspiration is opened, you will find <em>keenness of perception and insight</em> in your imagination and fulfilment in your literary manifestation.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213046" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">138 Pithy</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, please give me a bit of <em>pithy</em> advice.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, here is my advice, <em>short yet full of meaning:</em> “Love God, serve man.”</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213047" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">139 Placid</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, my mind and confusion are intimate friends. Will I ever have a <em>placid</em> mind in this lifetime?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, don’t speak like a fool. You will, before long, have a <em>calm and still</em> mind. Your life of illumination is fast approaching.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213048" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">140 Plethora</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, today’s America enjoys a <em>plethora</em> of material wealth. Can you tell me what will be its fate tomorrow?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, I clearly foresee America’s future fate. It will also enjoy a <em>superabundance</em> of spiritual wealth.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213049" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">141 Polemic</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, my intellectual mind likes philosophical <em>polemic</em>. Do you also have the same type of mind?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, fortunately God has not blessed me with an intellectual mind. I really find it most difficult to appreciate <em>any argument or controversial debate</em>. Simplicity satisfies my heart. My heart tries to satisfy God without the aid of the mind. Who knows, perhaps one day my heart will really and truly satisfy God.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213050" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">142 Poltroon</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, who is the better of the two — an aggressive friend or a friend who is a shameless <em>poltroon</em>?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, to me an aggressive person and a <em>wretched coward</em> belong in the same boat. I warn you not to have any unnecessary connection with either of the two.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213051" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">143 Potpourri</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, it seems to me that human life is a <em>potpourri</em> of fear, doubt, anxiety, worry, depression and frustration.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, it seems to me that human life is a <em>mixture</em> of opportunity, achievement and progress.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213052" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">144 Pragmatic</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, does God forgive the spiritual Masters who are not at all <em>pragmatic</em>?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, God does forgive the spiritual Masters who are not <em>practical</em>. If you need any proof, then in me you will find radiant proof.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213053" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">145 Preponderate</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, it seems to me that I have a few divine qualities. Please tell me, according to you, which quality in me <em>preponderates</em>?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, your true loving surrender to God’s Will <em>outweighs</em> your other divine qualities.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213054" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">146 Pristine</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, is there anything on earth that can forever retain its <em>pristine</em> beauty?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Yes, Madal, our soulful gratitude to God can forever remain <em>unspoiled and uncorrupted</em>.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213055" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">147 Procrastinate</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, why do some spiritual Masters <em>procrastinate</em>? Why do they not give away all their spiritual wealth to their disciples immediately?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, you are wrong. The spiritual Masters do not <em>delay</em> in offering their inner wealth to their disciples. It is the disciples’ lack of receptivity and unconscious unwillingness that are responsible for this sad delay on the part of the spiritual Masters.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213056" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">148 Prognosticate</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, can you <em>prognosticate</em> my future by looking at my palm?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, I can easily <em>predict</em> your future without looking at your palm: you are bound to realise God either in this incarnation or in a future incarnation.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213057" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">149 Propinquity</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, is physical <em>propinquity</em> to one’s Guru a blessing or a misfortune?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, if the disciple uses his <em>nearness</em> to his Guru properly, then it is a stupendous blessing. If nearness is not properly used, then it is a true misfortune — the beginning of the disciple’s downfall through jealousy, vanity, doubt and insecurity.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1213058" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">150 Protean</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, is it true that a Yogi has a <em>protean</em> body? Can he even assume the form of an animal?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Yes, Madal, a Yogi can readily assume different forms at his sweet will. But you have to know that only a third-class Yogi enjoys assuming the form of an animal, whereas a first-class Yogi enjoys the divine life in a human body.</p>  </div>
