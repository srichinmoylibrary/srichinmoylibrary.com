<p>Today Pahar and I ran while Peter drove alongside us. We went on Union Turnpike to Springfield Boulevard and then to Northern Boulevard. At around seven and a half miles there was a very steep hill. I was dying, but Pahar was dancing inwardly and outwardly.</p>
<p>An elderly couple saw us running. The lady, who was quite fat, looked at me and said, "Keep going, keep going!" because I was panting so hard. I should have invited her to join us. I was dying and she had to say, "Keep going, keep going!"</p>
