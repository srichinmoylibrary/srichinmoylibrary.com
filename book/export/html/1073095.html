<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two special qualities that Americans can work on to help bring forward all their potential divinity. These two divine qualities are the feeling of universal oneness and constant and cheerful self-giving to the Supreme Pilot, who is manâ€™s own highest Reality.</p>  </div>
