<p>At five o'clock this morning when I went out to run, inwardly I blessed X's soul because today is his birthday. Then, a little after six-thirty, I went out to run again and this time I saw X in the physical. He was near Y's house. I was running down the 150th Street hill when I saw him press his wristwatch and start running with long strides. I thought that I would turn around and meet him. But then I said to myself, "I will never be able to catch him."</p>
