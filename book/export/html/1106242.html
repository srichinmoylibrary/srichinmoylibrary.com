<p>Once some nuns invited Bill Pearl to speak to some disabled people about fitness. He got so nervous. When he saw those unfortunate people, he could not speak. Nothing was coming out. Finally he said, “Sorry, I can’t say anything.”</p>
<p>He was comparing his experience to what happened when I led a meditation at the bodybuilding exhibition in Vancouver. Since it was a new world for me, he thought in front of 2,000 people I would also behave that way. But I didn’t get frightened. I only had to meditate; I didn’t have to say a word.</p>
