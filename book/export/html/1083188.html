<p>At our New York Centre there are many dishwashers â€” boys and girls who wash the dishes most thoroughly and devotedly. They are really successful in washing the dishes. In the near future, I am pretty sure that they will start washing their vital life, too, most thoroughly. Then, how will I dare to say that the transformation of their nature can remain a far cry?</p>  </div>
