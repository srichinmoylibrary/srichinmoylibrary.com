  <h1 class="book-heading">When I discover God</h1>
  
 
<p>When I discover God in Himself, I see the living, growing and glowing God. When I discover God in me, I see the starving, sleeping and crying God. When I discover God in Himself, He is the eternal Wonder. When I discover God in me, He is the eternal Mystery.</p>
<p>I discover God's infinite Power and cry out: "Give me Your infinite Power." God says: "It is yours."</p>
<p>God discovers my limitless weakness and cries out: "Give Me your limitless weakness." I say: "No, my wealth, absolutely mine."</p>
<p>God fails, I win. God fails to illumine me. I win to destroy me.</p>  </div>
