<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> When You hide from me, You are beautiful. When You appear before me, You are beautiful, blessingful and fruitful. When I try to hide from You, I think that I am going to accomplish something very great. When I do not hide from You, when I come to You with what I have and what I am, I see clearly and feel unmistakably that I have accomplished everything gloriously.</p>  </div>
