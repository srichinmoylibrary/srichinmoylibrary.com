<p>Krishna's perfection for humanity<br /> Was responsible for his world-mission.<br /> Buddha's compassion for humanity<br /> Was responsible for his world-mission.<br /> Christ's dedication to humanity<br /> Was responsible for his world-mission.<br /> Your aspiration for humanity<br /> Is responsible for your world-mission.<br /> My resignation before humanity<br /> Is responsible for my world-mission.</p>
