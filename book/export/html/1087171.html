<p>In Pondicherry I went to a sari store whose owner had been my classmate in the Ashram. We had studied together for five or six months.</p>
<p>He immediately recognised me when I came in. Then he started insulting his workers mercilessly so that he could show me who was the boss. He was insulting them without rhyme or reason!</p>
<p>Suddenly he got a phone call from his house about some emergency, and he went away on his motorbike.</p>
<p>After I finished shopping, the bill came to 1,100 rupees. My friend's assistant said, "Since you two are good friends, I am sure the boss will reduce the price. So do not fill in the amount on the cheque. Just take the material and tomorrow I will ask him what discount to give you."</p>
<p>I said to myself, "I didn't ask for a discount. He is such a nice fellow."The following day I was shopping in the same area, so I went into the store and asked the assistant if he had spoken to the boss.</p>
<p>He said, "My boss didn't come back to work. But you don't have to worry. He knows your brother Chitta so well." I said, "For God's sake, take the 1,100 rupees. Then I don't have to worry." But he insisted that I not fill in the amount on the cheque.</p>
<p>Two hours later, while still shopping in the area, I saw my friend on his motorbike. I shouted to him, "For God's sake, tell me the reduction on the things I have got from your store so that I can pay."</p>
<p>He said, "I already told them this morning."</p>
<p>When I got home, I said to my brother, "This fellow is such a liar. Now you have to go there."</p>
<p>So my brother went to the store with 1,100 rupees. When he saw that they were going to give me a reduction of only 23 rupees, he got mad. He said, "You keep your 23 rupees. We will not take any reduction at all."</p>
<p>There the story does not end. Afterwards, my brother said, "I tell you, you will definitely get the same saris much cheaper in other stores."</p>
<p>So I took one of the saris I had bought and found almost the identical sari for less than half the price at another store. At my friend's store I paid 89 rupees, and in this store it was only 43. I couldn't believe that I had bought so many saris from my friend for twice the amount that other stores were selling them for.</p>
