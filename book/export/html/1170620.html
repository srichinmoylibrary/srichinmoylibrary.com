<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's Compassion-Eye acts like a magnet. It pulls into itself all the suffering, weaknesses, wrong-doings and other defects of human beings. It has an immediate magnetic pull. God's Compassion-Heart absorbs everything; it takes everything inside itself. His Compassion-Heart just grabs all the seeker's suffering and holds it inside. Fatherly affection we get from the third eye, but motherly affection we get from the heart. God's Compassion-Feet embody protection. There is not much practical difference between God's Compassion and Protection, because inside Protection there is tremendous Compassion.</p>
<p>God's Feet are always ready, again and again, to show their Compassion aspect, whereas God's Eye after some time will bring forward its Justice-Light. God's Compassion-Heart will show Compassion many more times than His Compassion-Eye, but far fewer times than His Compassion-Feet. If God's Eye shows Compassion ten times, His Heart will show it forty times; but His Feet can go on to one hundred or two hundred times.</p>
<p>Once somebody takes shelter at the Feet of God, no matter how many times that person does something wrong, God is ready to forgive him. The seeker is always protected at the Feet of God. No matter how many times he makes mistakes, God will say, "At least let him stay on the spiritual path."</p>  </div>
