<p>Yesterday I was returning home after having covered only two miles. Suddenly, somebody from behind said, "Hey, hey! Hello, hello! Hello, Guru!" Now, you guess who it was. It was one of my disciples.</p>
<p>Then I told him to run according to his own speed. So he ran very fast, but he halted at an intersection. I continued running and I came very near him — 100 or 150 metres away. I was watching him. There was no car there, no red light, nothing. Even then he was waiting there. I said, "Oh, he is my perfect disciple. He can say that he is at an intersection, so it is all right to take rest there."</p>
