<p>Nolini-da said: "But you forgot to mention about my best time for 200 metres: 31.6 seconds."</p>
<p>I said: "I am so sorry. I shall insert it."</p>
<p>I was glad that Amrita-da was present. Although I had asked him twice to come, he told me he was not feeling well that day.</p>
<p>After the meeting was over I was meditating in the Meditation Hall. Amrita-da called me and I went to him. He placed his hands around my shoulders and pressed very hard, saying: "Chinmoy, I am blessing you, I am blessing you," with tremendous affection and love.</p>  </div>
