<blockquote>
<p>"The childhood shows the man, As morning shows the day."</p>
<p>— Milton</p>
<p><em>Paradise Regained</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As every canon admits of exception, even so this truth does not always hold. But in the life of Rabindranath it is absolutely true.</p>
<p>The more we make a child happy, the more we can expect good of him. It is but a child's cheerful face that can frighten away the teeming ills of the world.</p>
<p>To serve a unique purpose Tagore invites a child to appear on the world-scene.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They [men] are cruel in their greed and their envy, their words are like hidden knives thirsting for blood.</p>
<p>"Go and stand amidst their scowling hearts, my child, and let your gentle eyes fall upon them like the forgiving peace of the evening over the strife of the day.</p>
<p>"Let them see your face, my child, and thus know the meaning of all things; let them love you and thus love each other.</p>
<p>"Come and take your seat in the bosom of the limitless, my child."</p>
<p><em> — The Crescent Moon</em></p>
