<p>I had just started running very slowly and I passed a little boy about six years old playing with his older brother on 150th Street. The younger boy said, "What are you doing? Just showing off?"</p>
<p>His older brother said to him, "Don't say that. He is a very great man."</p>
<p>The younger one said, "My daddy is far greater."</p>
<p>The older boy said, "Our daddy is not as great as he is."</p>
<p>The younger one said, "No, he is just showing off."</p>
<p>"Don't say that, don't say that, don't say that!" the older one told him.</p>
<p>When I was coming back after covering one mile, the two children were still playing. The little one again said to me, "You are just showing off. Go home, go home!"</p>
<p>The older brother got furious and shouted, "Don't say that! Don't say that! Don't say that!"</p>
