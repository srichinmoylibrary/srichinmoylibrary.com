<p>Humanity, you are a rogue!<br /> You have taken my sincere service<br /> And have kicked me aside.</p>
<p>Divinity, you are a fool!<br /> I told you that I would<br /> Serve you, love you and fulfil you.<br /> But I have kept myself away,<br /> Millions of miles away from you.<br /> Lo, you have failed to capture my existence.</p>
