<p><em>Sri Chinmoy and the disciples were speaking about the benefits of burning incense.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In addition to creating an atmosphere of worship and purity, the ascending fragrance and aspiration which accompany the burning of incense bring down from Heaven certain spirits and higher beings. They are invoked through the consciousness of sincere devotion. Incense has been used for thousands of years in India and when it is used, it invokes certain ancient, divine forces. Incense brings certain beings down from Heaven.</p>
<p>If you want to go from here to New York, you have to spend $120. But these spirits come from the higher planes out of their infinite love for us. In this world, if you have money, you can travel, but for that world, money will not do. It is something which only from their love you can have.</p>
<p>Sometimes when these beings come, they have their own language. Your physical minds, your bodies with their human tongues have their own language, but when these spirits come, they teach you their language. In a second or a minute they can teach you to speak to them in their own language. This language you forget afterwards. When they come, they teach your physical mind and then you can talk to them for some time and then they go away and you forget them and their language.</p>  </div>
