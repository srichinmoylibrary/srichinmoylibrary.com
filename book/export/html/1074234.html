<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The moon is in touch with an infinitely higher consciousness than any ordinary human being can offer. But a human being who has realised God can easily transcend the moon’s consciousness. I have millions of times entered the moon world. When the astronauts went to the moon, I felt miserable because the astronauts couldn’t see anything. But there are so many beings there. When the astronauts landed on the moon, there were so many beings welcoming them. I was watching on television that day, and on the television screen I saw three beings — such beautiful, powerful beings. Usually when a foreigner comes, immediately we become suspicious: is he good, is he bad? But in the case of the moon, the beings there felt that they were appreciated and loved and that was why the astronauts were coming.</p>  </div>
