<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Universal Reality is the reality that is not seen or felt in infinitesimal measure. You cannot take out a portion of the Universal Reality; it is not something that can be broken into various pieces. You can’t separate a portion from Existence. Universal Reality means the Reality from which nothing can be taken out. It is whole, complete, unlimited. Universal Reality means the Reality that came from the Transcendental Vision of the Supreme. The Transcendental Vision and the Universal Reality are one. They cannot be separated. The Supreme’s Transcendental Vision is universal. The Creator came down from above and then He became the universe.</p>  </div>
