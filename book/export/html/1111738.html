<p>Yesterday at about five-fifteen in the morning I was running near my two-and-a-half-mile point on Union Turnpike. A young man was talking on the phone in a telephone booth as I passed by. All of a sudden he started screaming, "Look, look! Sri Chinmoy is running!" He was so excited. He was telling the person he was talking to on the phone that he was seeing me run by.</p>
<p>I stopped and gave the young man a smile. He was in the seventh heaven of delight. He was tall and clean-shaven, with curly hair, and he had a pack on his back.</p>
<p>These people who greet me in the morning are in some ways my first-class disciples. They get up early in the morning, and they are so happy to see me.</p>
