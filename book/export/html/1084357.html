<p>His dark insincerity<br /> Is as deep as man's weakness.<br /> Yet God loves him.<br /> What else can poor God do?<br /> His fleeting sincerity<br /> Is as shallow as man's goodness.<br /> Yet God loves him.<br /> What else can poor God do?<br /> His dreaming perfection<br /> Is as impossible as man's immortality.<br /> Yet God loves him.<br /> What else can poor God do?</p>
