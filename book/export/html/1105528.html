<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is a very good question. A disciple who has made surrender to the Master has to feel at every moment that the Master is his harbinger and that he exists only for the Master, here on earth and there in Heaven. There are two worlds, Heaven and earth. Each disciple has to feel that he came to earth only for the Master and that in Heaven he will exist only for the Master.</p>  </div>
