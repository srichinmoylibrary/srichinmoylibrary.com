<p>Now that your heart-path<br /> Is paved with hope-light,<br /> God's Silence-Delight<br /> Will beckon you<br /> From God's Golden Shore.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187052" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1402</h1>
  
 

<p>I know, I know,<br /> My heart's beauty-flames<br /> Were born inside<br /> My Lord's Responsibility-Fire.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187053" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1403</h1>
  
 

<p>Your believing heart-prayer<br /> God immediately answers.<br /> Your surrendering dedication-life<br /> God proudly treasures.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187054" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1404</h1>
  
 

<p>Confidence<br /> Is not a life of complacency.<br /> A heart of confidence<br /> Is God's perfection-blossoming Dream<br /> In man and for man.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187055" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1405</h1>
  
 

<p>My heart-dreams are dancing today,<br /> For from today on<br /> My life will be able to study<br /> In God's Satisfaction-School.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187056" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1406</h1>
  
 

<p>Alas, alas,<br /> Just because I am<br /> A little bit different<br /> From my Lord Supreme,<br /> I am compelled to carry<br /> The heaviest load<br /> Of worries and anxieties.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187057" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1407</h1>
  
 

<p>Unless your mind gives up<br /> Its desire-hallucinations,<br /> Your heart will never be able<br /> To grant your mind<br /> Its aspiration-dreams,<br /> The dreams that you keep safe<br /> In God's Bank.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187058" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1408</h1>
  
 

<p>Instead of bringing opportunity<br /> To your doorstep,<br /> You are chasing opportunity away<br /> With your stupid, self-undermining<br /> And self-criticising mind.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187059" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1409</h1>
  
 

<p>How can and why should God<br /> Liberate you and your life<br /> If you do not<br /> Cheerfully and powerfully terminate<br /> Your long-cherished,<br /> Self-imposed isolation-life?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187060" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1410</h1>
  
 

<p>Now that you have jumped<br /> The hurdles of doubt and suspicion,<br /> God's final Decision<br /> Is to make you<br /> A choice representative of His<br /> Here on earth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187061" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1411</h1>
  
 

<p>Your mind-life<br /> Has no faith in itself.<br /> Therefore your aspiration-boat<br /> Is sinking fast, very fast.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187062" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1412</h1>
  
 

<p>If your outer life is expert<br /> At denying the purity-faith<br /> Of your inner life,<br /> Your inner life can also<br /> Easily and satisfactorily deny<br /> The very existence of the impurity-doubt<br /> Of your outer life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187063" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1413</h1>
  
 

<p>My brave mind<br /> Came into the world to succeed.<br /> My pure heart<br /> Came into the world to proceed.<br /> My compassionate soul<br /> Came into the world to precede.<br /> My unaspiring body<br /> Came into the world only to concede.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187064" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1414</h1>
  
 

<p>You have all along been<br /> An authority on the failure-life<br /> Because you did not dare to send<br /> Your resignation-letter<br /> To your ignorance-master.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187065" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1415</h1>
  
 

<p>Unless and until<br /> You make your heart-room spacious,<br /> God will not grant you<br /> His precious Key<br /> To open His Heart-Door.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187066" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1416</h1>
  
 

<p>You want to know<br /> Where my confidence-delight comes from.<br /> It comes from<br /> My sleepless and breathless hope-light.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187067" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1417</h1>
  
 

<p>This is not the only world<br /> That my Lord has.<br /> He has many, many worlds.<br /> He listens to my soulful prayer<br /> When I beg of Him<br /> Not to show me the face<br /> Of the life-lowering gossip-world.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187068" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1418</h1>
  
 

<p>What your mind has<br /> Is only desire-dollar bills.<br /> With these bills you can buy<br /> Only stark frustration-goods.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187069" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1419</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord is doing something special:<br /> He is placing<br /> The laurel wreath of surrender<br /> Inside my aspiration-heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187070" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1420</h1>
  
 

<p>Just because I never untied<br /> The knot that tied me taut<br /> To my Lord Supreme,<br /> God is now ready to write<br /> Secretly and regularly<br /> My earth-illumining speeches.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187071" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1421</h1>
  
 

<p>As my Lord has no time<br /> To be tired,<br /> Even so I do not have time<br /> To be disappointed,<br /> Either in myself<br /> Or in the world around me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187072" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1422</h1>
  
 

<p>You are proud that your mind<br /> Is stubbornly unchanging.<br /> I tell you,<br /> Soon your heart's invisible divinity<br /> Will threaten, frighten and enlighten<br /> Your mind.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187073" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1423</h1>
  
 

<p>You are fooling yourself twice:<br /> Once when you say<br /> That God has infinitely<br /> More important things to do<br /> Than to think of you,<br /> And once when you say<br /> That you do not need God's Help<br /> To make you happy and keep you happy.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187074" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1424</h1>
  
 

<p>How can you ever mourn<br /> The death of your doubting mind<br /> If your heart has already become<br /> Inseparably one with God<br /> On the strength of its constant<br /> Self-offering?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187075" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1425</h1>
  
 

<p>Do you know<br /> What an intellectual pygmy<br /> Does to me?<br /> He just hates me<br /> In season and out of season.</p>
<p>Do you know<br /> What a spiritual giant<br /> Does for me?<br /> First he tells me what I should do<br /> To please God all the time.<br /> Then he himself does it for me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187076" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1426</h1>
  
 

<p>An educated man<br /> My mind respects.<br /> A self-giving man<br /> My heart loves.<br /> A God-becoming man<br /> My entire being needs.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187077" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1427</h1>
  
 

<p>If your heart loves God<br /> In God's own Way,<br /> If your life serves God<br /> In God's own Way,<br /> I cannot understand<br /> How you can ever suffer from<br /> An inner energy crisis.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187078" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1428</h1>
  
 

<p>My heart has been suffering<br /> For a long time<br /> From insecurity-flu.<br /> My soul-doctor has tried<br /> All kinds of medicine<br /> With no satisfactory result.<br /> Now for the first time<br /> My soul-doctor is trying to cure<br /> The insecurity-flu of my heart<br /> With God's Oneness-Injection.<br /> I am sure this time<br /> Insecurity-flu will be transformed<br /> Into security-rapture.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187079" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1429</h1>
  
 

<p>Now that you have discovered<br /> Your heart's life-purifying tears,<br /> Failure can no longer hover<br /> In your mind's hesitation-sky.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187080" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1430</h1>
  
 

<p>Alas, he fails to notice<br /> The bondage-chains<br /> Binding his heart.</p>
<p>Alas, he fails to notice<br /> God's Compassion-Beauty<br /> Illumining his eyes.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187081" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1431</h1>
  
 

<p>Your life<br /> Is your insincerity-serpent.<br /> How can you ever dare<br /> To lead the life of an angel<br /> On earth?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187082" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1432</h1>
  
 

<p>No matter which new song I sing<br /> To please my Lord,<br /> It has always been available<br /> In my God-Eternity's Songbook.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187083" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1433</h1>
  
 

<p>You keep your hopes hidden.<br /> Naturally<br /> Your hopes will remain unheeded<br /> By God's Compassion-Light.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187084" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1434</h1>
  
 

<p>This world of ours<br /> Is indeed a prayerless world<br /> Of illusion and delusion.<br /> Yet everybody expects<br /> That God's Love-Light<br /> Must reign supreme on earth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187085" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1435</h1>
  
 

<p>My heart knows<br /> What God-dependence is.<br /> My life knows<br /> What self-transcendence is.<br /> And I know<br /> What the Satisfaction-Smile<br /> Of God's Descent is.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187086" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1436</h1>
  
 

<p>Although I suffered for years<br /> From mind-analysis,<br /> I did nothing to cure<br /> My self-styled mind-patient.<br /> Now to my extreme sorrow<br /> I am stuck with<br /> My heart-paralysis.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187087" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1437</h1>
  
 

<p>You want to know, after all,<br /> What God's Compassion-Flood<br /> Has done for you.<br /> I want to tell you<br /> That God's Compassion-Flood<br /> Has totally knocked<br /> Your ugly ego-life to the ground.<br /> What more can you expect from God?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187088" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1438</h1>
  
 

<p>Enthusiasm:<br /> This is what my mind<br /> Unmistakably needs.<br /> Aspiration:<br /> This is what my heart<br /> Sleeplessly needs.<br /> Realisation:<br /> This is what my life<br /> Immediately needs.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187089" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1439</h1>
  
 

<p>Because his life's surrender-story<br /> Was written<br /> With his heart's purity-pen,<br /> God's transcendental Satisfaction-Shore<br /> Is beckoning him.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187090" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1440</h1>
  
 

<p>A faithless life<br /> Is an endless death.<br /> An endless death<br /> Is governing the soulless mind<br /> Of the modern earth-bound society.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187091" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1441</h1>
  
 

<p>Never, never tell a lie<br /> To any human being!<br /> If you tell a lie<br /> To a human being,<br /> He will ruthlessly insult you<br /> And torture you,<br /> And at the same time,<br /> He will not forgive you.<br /> But if you ever tell a lie to God —<br /> Which you must not<br /> And should not —<br /> Then God will forgive you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187092" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1442</h1>
  
 

<p>Since God calls<br /> Both Heaven and earth<br /> His Home,<br /> He always keeps<br /> A few things for Vision<br /> In Heaven<br /> And a few things for Manifestation<br /> On earth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187093" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1443</h1>
  
 

<p>Do not sleep<br /> In front of the ocean of delight.<br /> Jump into the ocean!<br /> Throw your life's devouring discontentment<br /> Into the ocean!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187094" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1444</h1>
  
 

<p>O earth,<br /> Do not worry.<br /> God will take care of you, too.<br /> How long can He live<br /> Only in the Heaven-Light-Room,<br /> Ignoring the earth-darkness-room?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187095" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1445</h1>
  
 

<p>He has measurelessly increased<br /> His familiarity<br /> With his inner world's faith-family.<br /> Therefore God has granted him<br /> His transcendental Satisfaction-Crown.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187096" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1446</h1>
  
 

<p>One of God's great successes:<br /> When one of His children<br /> Can soulfully say,<br /> "In me a new quality<br /> Has come to the fore<br /> Which previously I did not have<br /> Or I did not use —<br /> The heart-quality."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187097" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1447</h1>
  
 

<p>Every day God asks you to enjoy<br /> The prosperity of your self-confidence.<br /> Instead of doing that, you enjoy<br /> The prosperity of your self-indulgence.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187098" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1448</h1>
  
 

<p>O my physical heart,<br /> Without you I cannot continue<br /> My earthly existence.<br /> O my spiritual heart,<br /> Without you I cannot even start<br /> My Heavenward journey.</p>

<p>A God-seeker is he<br /> Who first surrenders<br /> And then becomes<br /> And finally wins the race.</p>

<p>Yesterday you felt<br /> Farther than the farthest from God,<br /> But today<br /> Your soulful meditation<br /> Is making you feel<br /> Closer than the closest to God.<br /> Every day<br /> A soulful meditation<br /> Is the only thing<br /> That God needs from you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187103" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1453</h1>
  
 

<p>Although it is the most difficult<br /> Choice to make —<br /> God or me —<br /> I have successfully solved<br /> This most serious problem.<br /> When I need something,<br /> I shall say, "God, only God."<br /> When I do not need anything,<br /> I shall say, "Me! Who else can there be?"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187104" class="section-2">

<p>The Supreme is not losing heart<br /> Even though His Mission on earth<br /> Right now is only a tiny plant.<br /> For His inner Vision knows<br /> That this tiny plant<br /> Will ultimately become<br /> A divine banyan tree.</p>
