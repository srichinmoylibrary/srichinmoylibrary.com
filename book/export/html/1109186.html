  <h1 class="book-heading">A humane peace</h1>
  
 
<p>The absence of war is not and cannot be the real peace. Real peace is the unmistakable establishment of celestial harmony and universal love. The head of the United Nations family graciously tells us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The peace that we desire is not the peace of the cemeteries, the peace of the concentration camps or the prisons. It is a profoundly humane peace, free from all physical or spiritual violence and founded on two indissociable values which are none the less difficult to reconcile: justice and freedom. The feeling of world solidarity which I mentioned earlier as a force for peace can inspire only men who are free and aspire to equality."</p>
