<p>Here in America I saw the Supreme once as a Golden Purusha. Do you know where? In Woodstock. Near the end of 1964 I was meditating at Cherry Hill. There, with my naked human eyes, I saw my Supreme as the Golden Purusha. In the Vedas it is described. How beautiful and tall my Supreme was. He was running with me and holding a golden wand â€” like a magic wand. I was overwhelmed with light and delight. This kind of experience can never, never be forgotten.</p>  </div>
