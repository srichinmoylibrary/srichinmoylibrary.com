<p>THE BUDDHA'S PROBLEMS</p>
<p>Lord Buddha,<br /> Your first problem was suffering.<br /> Your second problem was desire.<br /> Your third problem was ignorance.<br /> Your fourth problem was the absence of inner light.<br /> All your problems<br /> You solved<br /> Eternally for yourself.<br /> And now the Heart that<br /> You left behind on earth<br /> Is trying and crying,<br /> Crying and trying<br /> To solve the same<br /> Giant problems.<br /> As you succeeded,<br /> So also your Heart<br /> Will succeed,<br /> Without fail.</p>
