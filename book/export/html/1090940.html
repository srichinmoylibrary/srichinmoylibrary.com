<p>As an illumined Yogi of the highest order, Sri Chinmoy does not normally "lecture" about meditation. He teaches meditation in silence, through the inner contact he establishes with a seeker. From time to time, however, he has answered specific questions on meditation. Some of those questions have been collected in this present volume.</p>  </div>
