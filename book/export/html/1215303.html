<p>Today I walked 100 metres on my toes in 54.49 seconds. I took 144 strides. Then I walked 100 metres on my heels in 26.86 seconds. This time I took 104 strides. I am aiming to do them both in 50 steps eventually; then automatically my timing will be better.</p>
<p>Today I also tried something new: I held my breath for 30 steps and then I breathed out for 4 steps. I feel that it did help. Nowadays I am getting tremendous power from my legs. I feel I can improve my timing to 18 or even 15 seconds for the heel, but toes will improve a maximum of 4 seconds.</p>
