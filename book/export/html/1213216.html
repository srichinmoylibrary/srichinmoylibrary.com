<p><em>Madal:</em></p>
<p>Chinmoy, there are some spiritual masters who constantly think of, and talk about, their ex-disciples. Is it not a <em>lugubrious</em> attitude on their part?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>Madal, it is true that it is ridiculously <em>sad and painful</em> on the part of the spiritual Masters when they think of their ex-disciples. One thing you do not know, and perhaps you will never know, is that the souls of the so-called ex-disciples do not and cannot leave the Master so easily, and that is why the sincere concern and compassion of the masters extends to their ex-disciples.</p>  </div>
