<p>Individuals and nations alike are receiving powerful glimpses of the peace-fulfilling reality-body, the United Nations. The Secretary-General's confidence-surcharged message is that the United Nations is at once earth's colossal hope and Himalayan promise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is now a time of opportunities which we must seize. Nations are talking to one another again, and more openly. They have reached important new agreements such as on disarmament, arms control and the protection of the ozone layer. They are more willing to use the techniques and institutions the Charter provides. Nations now recognise yet again that only the purposes and principles of the Charter can guide us to a peaceful and prosperous world. They understand once more that, ultimately, they can end some of the world's most stubborn threats to peace only by using the United Nations."</p>
