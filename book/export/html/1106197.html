<p>Today I lifted up 450 pounds. It was my second day of practice and my seventh attempt altogether. Before I lifted, I gave this prayer:</p>

<p>My Lord Supreme, do give me the strength<br /> That can love the world in Your own Way.<br /> Do give me the strength<br /> That can serve the world in Your own Way.<br /> Do give me the strength<br /> That will fulfil the world in Your own Way,<br /> My Lord, my Lord.</p>

<p>Then, while I was lifting the weight, Lord Krishna was blessing me with His divine Presence. I saw Him in His golden form. He was holding the sudarshan chakra in His Hand and this disc was rotating very fast.</p>
<p>Now I have put 503 pounds on the rack, so let us see how long it takes.</p>
