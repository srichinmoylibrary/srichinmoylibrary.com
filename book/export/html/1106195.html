<p>About six months ago I went to a leg specialist. The lady examined my legs and said they were so weak that she wondered how I could walk. Then she gave me exercises to strengthen my legs. She told me to put five-pound weights around my ankles and lift. And she charged me $100 for that message.</p>
<p>She did it all by computer. The computer gave the message that my legs were so bad. We should send her a picture of my calf raise.</p>
