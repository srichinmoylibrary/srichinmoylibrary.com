<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You need not have two physical bodies to live simultaneously in two worlds. One physical body is enough. If you have greatly developed your spiritual faculties, you can function not only in two worlds, but in many worlds or in many places at the same time. The physical body will be in one place, but you can get the knowledge of some other place, some distant place either in this world or in some other world, from your intuitive faculty, your inner vision or your inner beings.</p>  </div>
