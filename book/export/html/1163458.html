<p>Shivaji used to have only one meal a day. He would eat something that is like what we call biryani. It was rice and dhal mixed together and boiled in butter. Shivaji did not eat meat.</p>
<p>Once Shivaji had some English guests at his court. They were voracious meat eaters. Even though Shivaji and most of his followers did not eat meat, he was kind enough to satisfy his guests by preparing meat dishes for them.</p>  </div>
