<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to practise self-discipline. It is by doing something, by becoming something — not necessarily something great or famous — that we can overcome our reluctance. It is through moving — which is progress — and achieving — which is another type of progress — that we can overcome reluctance. In order to overcome reluctance, we have to have a goal and we have to try to reach that goal. By always moving and progressing toward a goal, you not only become a better runner but you also become a better instrument of God.</p>  </div>
