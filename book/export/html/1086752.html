<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If "you" is general, then I wish to say that there is no fixed rule as to when a soul will again take human incarnation. It can be three years, it can be six years, it can be forty years, one hundred years or two hundred years. It entirely depends on God's Will. But if 'you' is directed towards me, then I wish to say there is no hope, no possibility and no necessity for me to come back to earth. Whatever work is to be done after my death, I will be able to do from Heaven in and through my disciples. I do hope at that time that my disciples will have become better than they are now.</p>  </div>
