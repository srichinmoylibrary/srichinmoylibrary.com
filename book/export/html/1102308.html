<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is entirely a matter of love. When the developed countries offer their guidance, unfortunately, the less developed countries sometimes show a kind of resentment. They feel miserable that they are not already endowed with the qualities and capacities that they are crying for, and their resentment takes the form of a rebellious or sulking attitude. When this occurs, the developed countries must act like human parents. They have to bring to the fore the parent-child relationship when dealing with the less developed members of their human family, who are at times unconscious, ungrateful or resentful.</p>  </div>
