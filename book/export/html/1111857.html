<p>While I was running in Flushing Meadow Park, one of the boys on the road crew was driving behind me. Three girls who were visiting from other Centres were in the back seat — X, Y and Z — and W was asleep in the very back</p>
<p>A middle-aged man came out of his car and said to me, "What do you think you are — a very important person?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, I don't think so."</p>
<p>Then I ran 200 metres. When I came back he again came up to me and asked, "Why do you need so many bodyguards, especially girls?" He didn't see W because W was still sleeping. He saw only the three girls. The man was smiling and joking with me.</p>
