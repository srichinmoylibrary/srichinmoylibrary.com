<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on them. They will get freedom. When someone is a child, the parents and the elder members of the family say what is good for him. Then, when he grows up, he can decide for himself. He may say, “I am satisfied. I don’t want to work for You.” The Father will say, “All right. As long as you know that I am your Father and you are my son, that is enough.” If they accept Buddha’s path, they won’t care for manifestation. But if they accept other paths, they will care for it.</p>  </div>
