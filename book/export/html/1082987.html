<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In God's dictionary there is no such word. What we see in His dictionary is "experience." "Failure" is an experience. "Success" is an experience. We can and we should accept them with the same joy. When God does something on the outer plane, because of our own preconceived ideas we call one result success and one result failure. But God does not use His Mind. God manifests an experience which the human being needs to go through. He gives whatever experience is necessary to have. But human beings have preconceived ideas about what success is. They depend on outer results. "Failure" immediately ruins all their inspiration and "success" carries them up to the skies. In God's case, it is all experience. When He starts, does and ends, He is only having a series of experiences.</p>  </div>
