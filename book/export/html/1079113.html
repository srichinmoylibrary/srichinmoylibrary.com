<p>My aspiration is telling me that someday I shall be able to reach God's Heaven-Height.</p>
<p>My meditation is telling me that God is already inside my heart and that He is now trying to grow perfectly with me and glow satisfactorily for me.</p>

<p>My Supreme, my Lord Supreme, my Beloved Lord Supreme, do give my heart the capacity to sleeplessly love Your Vision-Eye in Heaven. Do give my life the capacity to unconditionally serve Your Manifestation Feet on earth.</p>

<p>Yesterday my Lord Beloved Supreme decided to tell me three most illumining and fulfilling stories. Today He told me two of the stories. The first one was about His Love. He told me how He has been loving my soul-bird right from the beginning of His creation. He also told me how He has been loving my heart-flower right from the day in the hoary past when He created my aspiration-heart.</p>
<p>The second story was about His Compassion. He told me how He blessingfully showers His Compassion upon my entire being, no matter how many mistakes I have made or how many mistakes I shall make in the future. He also told me how He grants His Compassion-Light unconditionally to each and every heartbeat of mine.</p>
<p>He told me that before the day ends, He will tell me His third story. He said this story will be entirely about me. He will tell me in full detail how devotedly, how soulfully and how self-givingly I aspired in my previous incarnations. My old aspiration-story, which is buried in oblivion and which I have completely forgotten, my Lord Beloved Supreme will resurrect. And once more He will energise me to aspire soulfully, devotedly, self-givingly and unconditionally. Something more: He will show me, inside my aspiration-story, the blossoming of my realisation-life-tree.</p>

<p>My Lord, I want to have a life of success, and You want me to have a life of progress. My Lord, my Lord, my Lord, is there any way that my success can be turned into my progress and my progress can be turned into my success?</p>
<p>"My child, My child, My child, there is a secret and sacred way.</p>
<p>"As soon as you have achieved any success, pray to Me, and while praying, sing for Me your surrender-song. Then I assure you that your success will be turned into your progress.</p>
<p>"As soon as you have made any progress, meditate on Me, and while meditating, dance for Me a gratitude-dance. Then I assure you that your progress will be turned into your success.</p>
<p>"Needless to say, your new progress and your new success will be My new progress and My new success as well."</p>

<p>My Lord, my Lord, my Lord, I am praying to You this morning to command my mind not to dictate anything to me anymore.</p>

<p>"My morning child, do not think of your inadequacy; do not think of your incapacity. Just pray to Me to bless you with morning humility.

<p>My sweet Supreme, what happens to You when I am soulfully with You?</p>
<p>"My illumined child, you considerably increase the beauty of My transcendental Vision."</p>

<p>My Supreme, my Lord Supreme, my Beloved Supreme, do tell me the names of the things that I have to do without fail during the day.</p>
<p>"My sweet child, My divine child, My perfection-loving child, you have to change your earthly age twice a day. That is the only thing you have to do. First you have to think that you are only a three-year-old child who knows nothing about the ugly existence of doubt-night. Then you have to think that you are a 99-year-old human being who soon will pass behind the curtain of Eternity. Since your days are numbered, it does not become you to make friends with your volcano vital.</p>
<p>"My perfection-loving child, if you faithfully change your age twice a day and live as an eternal child in the heart-garden of your soul, then your life's perfect perfection and My complete Satisfaction in you will before long dawn. Try, My child; you will succeed! You are bound to succeed, for you are destined to manifest and fulfil My Immortality's Vision-Light here on this planet earth.</p>

<p>"My child, you may not be able to think of Me as many times as I think of you, or for as long, but you can think of Me a little more often from today on. But do it devotedly and soulfully to give your heart utmost joy and to give My Heart perfect Satisfaction."</p>

<p>"But you can do one thing every day devotedly and soulfully. You can repeat hundreds of times daily, 'My Lord, You are my mind-sincerity's All, You are my heart-purity's All, You are my life-duty's All.' This will expedite our joint victory."</p>

<p>Two cannot agree. When God agrees with my desire-life, His suffering becomes unbearable. When I agree with God's ever-transcending Vision, my suffering becomes unbearable, for I am not ready to be one with Him at every moment of my life. But I am begging my Lord Supreme not to agree with my desire-life, but to give me the capacity to become one with Him devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally-always and always.</p>

<p>My Lord Supreme, what do You do when I make mistakes?</p>

<p>"My child, My child, do not plan; do not plan! I have already planned everything for you. Just play with me and play for Me. I shall not fail you. I shall not only take you to your destined goal but also give you My Heart of infinite Love and My Eye of infinite Compassion."</p>
