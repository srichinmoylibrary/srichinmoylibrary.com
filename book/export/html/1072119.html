<p>Aspiration you want? Knock at the door of Silence. Silence you want? Knock at the door of Surrender. You will get what you want and something more: Liberation.</p>
<p>I repeat God's name, not because I feel that by repeating God's name I shall be able to unseal God's ears, but because I see Him in different forms of inner beauty while each time I repeat His name.</p>
<p>Love of God is the beginning of human wisdom. Surrender to God's Will is the flowering of divine wisdom.</p>
<p>God shoots the arrows of concern from the bow of compassion. Man shoots the arrows of ingratitude from the bow of ignorance.</p>
<p>Self-control is the root of higher wisdom.</p>
<p>Self-realisation is the tree of inner wisdom.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the eye of fear has a free access to God's entire creation. Fortunately the heart of courage also has a free access to God's entire creation.</p>
<p>If you can make your heart the cow of love, your body the dog of devotion, and your mind the deer of surrender, your liberation is absolutely certain.</p>
<p>Human life is always given strength to fly the kite of hope.</p>
<p>Anger is ink spilt and thrown over one's graceful heart of sweetness.</p>
<p>The tree of life can never be separated from the tree of love. The tree of love can never be separated from the tree of realisation. The tree of realisation can never be separated from the tree of transcendental perfection.</p>  </div>
