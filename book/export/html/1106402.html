<p>For my standing double-arm lift today I did 140 pounds. Nowadays I do not have to scream as much when I lift. I feel that I will be able to go to 150.</p>
<p>When I showed Abakash the video, he said, “Why are you saying that you are lifting 140 pounds? It is 280. It is like a bench press. There you do not say how much is in each hand. You are dividing it, but you are actually lifting 280 pounds.”</p>
<p>Abakash is so wise!</p>
