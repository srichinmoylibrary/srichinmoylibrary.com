<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First, think of purity all the time: purity not only in the physical, but also in the mind and heart. Then, keep around you things that embody purity. A bench and table will not embody the same amount of purity that flowers or incense will have. If you keep a flower in your room, on your shrine, purity enters into you from the outer world. During your meditation, if you burn a candle, the flame will make you think of purity. There are many things on earth that we know have purity in them, and if you keep them around you, from them you get purity. Also, you can get purity by mixing with people who you feel are purer than you. They will inspire you and help you gain purity.</p>  </div>
