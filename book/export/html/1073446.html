<p>Eagerness is the purity of my life's tears.<br /> Eagerness is the beauty of my heart's smiles.<br /> Eagerness is my closeness to God the creation.<br /> Eagerness is my oneness with God the Creator.</p>
<p>My eagerness is my glorious privilege<br /> To see one step ahead, unlike others.<br /> My eagerness does not expect surprises,<br /> For my Captain has fully convinced me<br /> That He not only knows the Way<br /> But also has already planned everything for me.</p>
<p>From my Captain my eagerness has learned<br /> To see every second as the birth of a new day,<br /> And in it the complete life of a new year<br /> To please Him in His own Way.</p>
<p>My Captain says to me,<br /> "My child, because of your life's eagerness<br /> I am giving you My Eternity's Life.<br /> My child, because of your heart's eagerness<br /> I am giving you My Infinity's Heart.<br /> My child, you are your<br /> Aspiration-spontaneity-eagerness,<br /> And I am My<br /> Satisfaction-Immortality-Fondness."</p>
