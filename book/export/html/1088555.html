<p>The great King Shivaji was a hero of the highest order. He was from Maharashtra, so he was called the Maratha King.</p>
<p>Once Shivaji went to a temple and saw his spiritual Master at the temple gate begging for alms. People were giving him a little rice or money, whatever they wanted to give. When the King saw his Master reduced to this condition, he wrote something down on a small piece of paper and put it in his Master's bowl.</p>
<p>The Master was curious to see what his disciple had written. He opened the note and read: "I am placing my kingdom at your feet. I am here and I want to be your slave."</p>
<p>The Master asked Shivaji, "Do you mean it?"</p>
<p>The King replied, "I mean it. I am not going back to my kingdom. I shall remain here at your feet. I am not a king; I am your slave now."</p>  </div>
