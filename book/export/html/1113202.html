<p>I said to Nolini-da: "It seems that you have immortalised Sahana-di in your recent writings."</p>
<p>"Chinmoy, I don't write anything false. She deserves my sincere appreciation."</p>
<p>"Will you please tell me how old you were when you passed your matriculation?"</p>
<p>"Ah, I was only fourteen. My father thought I was too young for the matriculation examination. He wanted me to wait a year or two so that I could pass the examination without any difficulty, but my uncle did not agree with him. My uncle was very wise. He told my father that I would definitely do well in the examination. So I did take the examination. Unlike my uncle, my father did not know how ripe and clever I had already become."</p>
<p>Then he burst into laughter.</p>  </div>
