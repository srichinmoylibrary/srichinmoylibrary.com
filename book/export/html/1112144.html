<p>John has my heart's deepest appreciation for two reasons. First, he did extremely well; his timing was 2:32. Also, he was running side by side with Greta Waitz for such a long, long time. So many times his Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team T-shirt was clearly visible on television. I was so delighted and excited to see it on TV. It had a very special inner significance.</p>
