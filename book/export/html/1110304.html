<h2><em>Professor Gerard Morris:</em> In the eternity of time, when God has perfected His present creation, will He start a new creation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My dear Professor, when one has free access to the Absolute Reality, one clearly sees that God's creation will forever and forever remain in the process of perfect perfection. Perfection has no culmination. It is an endless process.</p>
<p>When we look at a flower bud, we see that it is perfect, and we are absolutely satisfied. Later we may see that the bud has opened. The fully blossomed flower has another kind of perfection. Even then the process may not be complete. We may place the flower on our shrine or use it in a particular way. This new situation gives us a unique satisfaction and enhances the flower's perfection in our eyes.</p>
<p>It may happen, however, that our mind will come forward and say that our satisfaction is not enough. Our mind will try to convince us that there can be a bud more perfect, a flower more beautiful, a shrine more spiritual. Then we are no longer satisfied. In our human life, perfection is nothing other than satisfaction. When we are satisfied, we say everything is perfect. When we are dissatisfied, we see imperfection everywhere. A plant in its seed-form is perfect. When it germinates and becomes a tiny seedling, it is perfect. And when it becomes a huge, full-grown tree, it is perfect. Then it returns to its seed-form perfection once again.</p>
<p>The important thing is at what point in the process of evolution we are satisfied. When we are satisfied with something, at that very moment it is perfect. Perfection can never be separated from satisfaction. They go together. God's creation will always be in the process of perfection. Perfection is an endless process of blossoming reality.</p>  </div>
