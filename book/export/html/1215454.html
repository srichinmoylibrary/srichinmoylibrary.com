<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. Sri Krishna gave when he found that Arjuna was in a position to receive. The Christ gave to his disciples when they were in a position to receive. Today also, Masters give when the disciples are in a position to receive. It is like being in a school. The teacher gives the degree at the end of the course; he does not give the degree before the students complete the course. In the spiritual life, one has to complete the course. Then only will the Master give the spiritual diploma. One has to be with the Master and the Master teaches him. Then there comes a time when the Master sees that the student can receive everything that the Master has and everything that the Master is.</p>  </div>
