<p>Today for the first time Chidananda followed me in the car when I was running on my loop. Twice I looked around but I didn't see the car there. Then I saw that his car was a hundred metres behind me. Usually people driving with me stay only twenty or thirty metres behind me, but he was a hundred metres behind.</p>
