<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the beginning it seems to me that they revolt. But gradually they become one with the happiness-will power of the lifter. Nobody likes to be forced. At first the muscles didn't like lifting weights. But when they saw that by virtue of their strength I was able to lift so many pounds, when they saw the accomplishment, at that time they became proud and started cooperating with my will power happily.</p>  </div>
