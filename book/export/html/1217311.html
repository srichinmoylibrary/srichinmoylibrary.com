<p>Your question shows a remarkable sense of spiritual values. Granted, the world is all imperfection. Life stands as a huge question. Evil is seen everywhere. These are the problems that we face every day. Moreover, the more spiritually advanced a man is, the greater is his suffering; due to the present conditions of the world He sees the disease, he feels the disease, but he has no proper medicine. Even if he has a remedy, it is not enough to cure all earthly ailments. So he often feels that his fight will be of no avail and therefore takes the easier path, the path of escape into the Bliss of the higher planes.</p>
<p>But this can never be the case with a divine warrior. He will fight until the victory is won. Now what do we mean by his "victory"? it is the establishment of the Kingdom of God here on earth and not in some higher world. As he knows that the Divine is omnipresent, he seeks to reveal Him in everyday life. If we are not satisfied with the world as it is, that is no reason for leaving it. On the contrary, we should try to change it â€” physically or intellectually or spiritually, depending on our own development and capacities.</p>
<p>God is perfect Perfection. This Perfection can be achieved only when there is an inseparable union between Matter and Spirit, between the outer and the inner Life.</p>  </div>
