  <h1 class="book-heading">Sarojini Naidu</h1>
  
 
<p>We need not waver between doubt and certainty to hold that no other Indian woman has won her laurels in so many walks of life as did Sarojini Naidu. She was a unique poet, a superb politician, a trumpet call of patriotism, a stirring speaker on public platforms, a woman of tremendous executive drive, a staunch congressional worker. She revealed herself in a succession of amazements.</p>
<p>To the patriots she was an irresistible enthusiasm. To the poets she was a never-failing fountain of beauty in earthly and Heavenly expressions. There is a magic spell of delight and wonder woven around the name of Sarojini Naidu in this great subcontinent.</p>  </div>
