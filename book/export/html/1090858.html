<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you are meditating you <em>are</em> looking everywhere. Your consciousness at that time is expanded. You are not only one person among many on earth; you feel that the whole world belongs to you and that you belong to the world. The world can claim you at that time as its very own. Right at this moment you cannot claim the world as your own at all. Your brother, your sister, the rest of your family â€” these are yours, but that is all. But when you feel that you are seeing everything around you during your meditation, everything is yours, everyone is yours. Inwardly you can claim everything, and everything that is around you can claim you also as its very own. This is a very good experience.</p>  </div>
