<p>During the summer of, 2006, the annual Sri Chinmoy 3,100-mile Self-Transcendence Race took place in Jamaica, Queens. The fifteen runners participating in this event, which is the longest footrace in the world, circled a city block whose circumference is just under one mile. Sri Chinmoy visited the race several times every day to offer the runners his encouragement, support, concern and love. From June 21st until the last runner finished on August 10th, he also offered them a daily prayer. These beautiful and deeply meaningful prayers were distributed to each runner and also posted on the bulletin board at the counting station. The runners and helpers all derived boundless inspiration from Sri Chinmoy's morning prayers. The 51 prayers are reproduced in this book in Sri Chinmoy's original handwriting.</p>  </div>
