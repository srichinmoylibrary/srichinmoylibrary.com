<p>Shephali and I were finishing together. Six hundred metres from the end, they asked me to run outside the chute, because I didn't have a number.</p>
<p>A husband and wife were watching. The husband said, "Look! Sri Chinmoy and his T-shirt."</p>
<p>The wife looked at Shephali, who was wearing our Centre T-shirt, and at me, and asked, "Which one is Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>Shephali and I were very near them at the time, but Shephali didn't hear.</p>
