<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I used to run the one hundred metre dash, in a matter of ten or eleven seconds, God knows how many times I meditated on Him. I stood first in the running race, yet while standing first my mind was on God. You may say, "How could you be thinking of God so devotedly? If your mind is on God, you will change lanes on the track and be disqualified." But no, I did it. So if you have developed the power of meditation and you are an expert in meditation, then you are in a position to do meditation while driving. Everything depends on the development. If you are in a position to meditate while driving, you are not doing anything wrong. But if a beginner in the spiritual life tries to meditate while driving, then he will have an accident.</p>  </div>
