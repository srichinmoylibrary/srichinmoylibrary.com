<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Perhaps they will be happy only when their children go to an early grave! Is it necessary to wait until it comes out in the newspaper that some children have had a heart attack after running a marathon or some other long distance? When the newspaper gives the message, then the parents will not allow their children to run! Even in short distances, if parents are forcing their children to run, it is very bad.</p>  </div>
