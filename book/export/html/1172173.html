<p>While I was in India, magazines, newspapers and radio were telling about statues of Ganesha drinking milk. This miracle happened in many places around the world. But in one case it was not true. About forty metres away from my house there is a Ganesha Mandir. Always I heard the music. It was one house away from our house. Unfortunately, that Ganesha was not thirsty. At every hour of the day and night, women were sleeping in front of the temple and outside on the street, but this particular statue did not accept the milk that they offered.</p>  </div>
