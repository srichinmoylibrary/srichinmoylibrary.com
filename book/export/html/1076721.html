<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, I do not leave my body when I enter into my highest consciousness. Nobody has to leave his body in order to enter into his highest consciousness.</p>
<p>When I enter into my highest consciousness, I do not allow my physical mind to operate, I do not allow the earthly physical consciousness to operate at all. When I give extemporaneous talks, I stay most of the time in a state of consciousness far beyond the mind. But when I answer questions, my knowing and illumining mind operates. Sometimes during my talks I look to this side and that side in order to get sublime ideas. And at that time I get divine thoughts either from within or from without. When I answer questions, it is altogether a different matter.</p>  </div>
