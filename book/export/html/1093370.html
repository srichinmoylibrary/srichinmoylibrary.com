   <div id="node-1093371" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I am utterly lost.<br /> My child,<br /> You and I are in the same boat.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093372" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 

<p>It took my Lord Compassionate Supreme<br /> A whole day to teach me how to laugh,<br /> A full month to teach me how to giggle,<br /> And an unending 365 days to teach me how to chuckle.<br /> Then God said to me, "My child, you may be a very slow learner, But now you have become a perfect professor."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093373" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Is there any way<br /> I can make You laugh?<br /> Just ask Me to trust you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093374" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> How is it possible for You<br /> To remain always happy?<br /> My child,<br /> Unlike you, I talk to Myself,<br /> And I listen to Myself.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093375" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Are You aware<br /> Of the bad things<br /> That I do?<br /> My child,<br /> No, I am not aware,<br /> And I don't want to be.<br /> My Lord, why?<br /> Just because<br /> You don't care to know<br /> How many good things I do.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093376" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Do tell me<br /> When You are really<br /> Pleased with me.<br /> My child,<br /> I am really pleased with you<br /> Only when you hate Me.<br /> My Lord,<br /> How? How can it be true?<br /> How, my child?<br /> That is the only time<br /> That you think of Me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093377" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> How can I become perfect?<br /> My child,<br /> You can become perfect<br /> Just by teaching Me<br /> For 99 years and 365 days<br /> All that you have learnt.<br /> From your ignorance-teacher.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093378" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Have You ever<br /> Told me a lie?<br /> Many, many times.<br /> Why, my Lord, why?<br /> Just to be even with you,<br /> My child.<br /> As you know,<br /> I never accept defeat<br /> From anybody.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093379" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Will You help me<br /> To be as great as You are?<br /> No.<br /> I can't allow you<br /> To be as great as I am.<br /> Why?<br /> My ego-head will be crippled.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093380" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Will You allow me<br /> To be as good as You are?<br /> Certainly.<br /> Do you know why,<br /> My child?<br /> Why, my Lord?<br /> Because,<br /> If you become as good as I am,<br /> Then I will be able<br /> To enjoy My retirement,<br /> Which I so desperately need.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093381" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Do you enjoy it<br /> When I quarrel with You<br /> Unnecessarily and foolishly?<br /> My child,<br /> Let Me add-<br /> And unpardonably as well.<br /> Am I correct,<br /> My son?<br /> My Lord,<br /> Perhaps You are.<br /> My Lord, tell me,<br /> Why do You allow me<br /> To indulge<br /> In quarrelling with You?<br /> My child,<br /> If I do not allow you<br /> To empty<br /> Your overflowing poison-ocean into Me,<br /> Then who will and who can?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093382" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> People say that I am<br /> Extremely beautiful.<br /> Do You agree with them?<br /> No, never!<br /> My Lord,<br /> Why are You so cruel to me?<br /> Because you do not<br /> Give any credit<br /> To the Source.<br /> Who is the Source<br /> And what has the Source<br /> Done for me?<br /> I am the Source<br /> And I tell you once and for all,<br /> The beauty that you have<br /> Is a loan from Me.<br /> At any moment<br /> I can compel you<br /> To return it.<br /> My child,<br /> I can never understand<br /> How a beggar-borrower<br /> Can ever be happy and proud.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093383" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I wonder how You answer<br /> All my questions<br /> So easily and perfectly.<br /> My child,<br /> Don't forget that I am<br /> A little bit older than you.<br /> My Lord,<br /> That means when I equal<br /> You in age,<br /> I shall be able<br /> To answer all Your questions.<br /> No.<br /> I shall always remain<br /> Older than you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093384" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> What shall I do<br /> With my mind?<br /> Do give me some advice.<br /> I do not want you<br /> To live without a mind.<br /> Again, with a mind either.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093385" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I am always afraid of You.<br /> Are You ever afraid of me?<br /> Of course, of course.<br /> I am always afraid<br /> Of your tearful eyes.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093386" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> What are You doing now?<br /> I am arguing with Myself.<br /> My Lord,<br /> What are You arguing about?<br /> My child,<br /> I want to know for sure<br /> Whether I am a failure<br /> Or you are a failure.<br /> Also, I want to know<br /> If both of us are failures.<br /> My Lord,<br /> You may be a failure,<br /> But I am not, never.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093387" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> They tell me that<br /> When everything else falls,<br /> Try prayers.<br /> My Lord,<br /> Is it true?<br /> No, it is not.<br /> When everything else fails,<br /> Start blaming Me.<br /> My Lord, why?<br /> Why?<br /> Because My world-happiness-machine<br /> Is always out of order.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093388" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> If I give You<br /> My mind's precious hallucinations,<br /> What will You<br /> Give me in return?<br /> My child,<br /> I shall immediately give you<br /> My Heart's spacious Reality.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093389" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Do You want to know from me<br /> Why I am so fond<br /> Of my ego?<br /> I am so fond of my ego<br /> Because my ego is the only thing<br /> That I can always depend on.<br /> It always claims me.<br /> Vice versa.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093390" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Now that my mind<br /> Is in abysmal abyss,<br /> What shall I do?<br /> Tell your mind<br /> That there is only one direction left â€”<br /> Up.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093391" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">21.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Please tell me if I am alive.<br /> My child,<br /> Resurrect me first.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093392" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">22.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Even when I do not<br /> Have the right questions,<br /> How do You<br /> Have the right answers?<br /> My child,<br /> At least one of us<br /> Has to be right.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093393" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> When I do not allow You<br /> To be inside my heart,<br /> Where do You go?<br /> My child,<br /> No particular place.<br /> I become a homeless vagabond,<br /> Plus a sonless Father.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093394" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I forget so many things so often.<br /> Do You ever forget anything?<br /> My child,<br /> You are very rich,<br /> Specially in your mental world.<br /> I am not as rich as you are.<br /> Therefore, you can afford to forget.<br /> Poor as I am.<br /> I cannot afford to forget.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093395" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I am so grateful to You,<br /> For You have given me so much.<br /> My child,<br /> I want to remain satisfied<br /> With your gratitude-heart<br /> Don't ask Me for anything more<br /> Who knows?<br /> This time I may disappoint you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093396" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">26.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> How can I shut up my mouth?<br /> My child,<br /> Just open up your heart.<br /> Your mouth will automatically<br /> Be sealed.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1093397" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">27.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I have discovered happiness<br /> By deceiving myself.<br /> How have You discovered<br /> Your happiness?<br /> My child,<br /> I have not yet discovered happiness.<br /> Perhaps you can teach Me.<br /> Who knows, your way may be<br /> The only way for Me to be happy.</p>
