<p>These are his own thoughts:<br /> He wants to invite God<br /> To his home;<br /> He wants to keep God for himself only;<br /> He wants to spend all his time<br /> With God and God alone.<br /> He will not let anybody see God's Face<br /> Or hear about God's arrival.<br /> He wants God only for his own<br /> Satisfaction-necessity.</p>
