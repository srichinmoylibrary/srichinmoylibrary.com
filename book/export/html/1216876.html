<p>This morning, while walking around London, I went into an Indian store that sold magazines and candy. Magazines I didn't get, but I did buy a chocolate bar — I think it is called "Tiger" — for 19 pence.</p>
<p>As soon as I came out of the store, a tall man said to me, "Good morning! Last night I was at your concert and I heard your music. I also am a musician. I play music, but you <em>are</em> music itself!"</p>
<p>Since he was flattering me, I gave him a piece of the chocolate bar. He took it with such joy and appreciation.</p>
