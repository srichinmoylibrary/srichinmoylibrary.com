<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Guru communicates with these souls through God's inner Light. God being omnipresent means He is everywhere, so through God's Light Guru communicates with the souls while they are on earth and after they leave the earth. Through this inner Light, Guru can easily enter into all souls. Whether they are on earth or in Heaven, God's Light can easily enter into them and talk with them.</p>  </div>
