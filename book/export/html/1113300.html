<p>"This evening I shall read in my room. Nowadays the incense that you are burning in my room has a very good fragrance. Do you have any idea how long each incense stick lasts?"</p>
<p>"I have no idea, since I sit outside," I said.</p>
<p>"By the way, invite Nitya Gupta."</p>
<p>"Shall I invite his wife as well?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Of course, of course," he said. In the evening, after a few people had gathered, Nolini-da said, "Has everybody arrived?"</p>
<p>Somebody said: "Sujata has not yet come."</p>
<p>Amrita-da said: "From now on we shall take attendance. People must give a good excuse if they don't come or if they come late." All burst into laughter.</p>
<p>"The other day I read out to you 'Hymns to the Darkness'. Today I shall read out 'Hymns to the Light'. Then I shall read out an English translation of Rama Prasad's Bengali poems and the English translations of modern Bengali poets."</p>  </div>
