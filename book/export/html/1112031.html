<p>Originally I wanted to run seven miles every day during the 1,000-mile race. I felt that if I tried to do 13 miles, I would not be able to continue. But at the end of the race I had completed 208 miles — an average of 13 miles a day for the 16 days of the race.</p>
<p>Three people completed the full distance: 1,000 miles! Here is the proof that there are a few things the mind cannot understand — when the soul operates through the heart or through the vital. To run 1,000 miles is beyond the comprehension of the mind; the mind cannot imagine it!</p>
<p>Perhaps now people will be inspired to sponsor 1,000-mile races.</p>
<p>By the first week of August I do hope to complete my 1,000 miles. I am going on, going on. God knows if I can do it!</p>
