  <h1 class="book-heading">Mike Katz’s prophecy comes true</h1>
  
 
<p>When Mike Katz heard that I had lifted up 160 pounds in each arm, he said, “I am amazed but not surprised. For Sri Chinmoy, 170-pound or 180- pound dumbbells in each arm would not surprise me.”</p>
<p>His prophecy was so powerful. In two days it has come true. Today I have lifted up 170 pounds in each arm. One hundred and seventy was my goal for April 13th and I have got it today.</p>
<p>It is true that after one hundred years people will wonder whether I am one man or ten. In each field I have acted like a cyclone!</p>
