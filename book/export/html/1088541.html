<p>Chakravarthi Narasimhan, Narasimhan!<br /> You are your service-beauty's fragrance-dawn,<br /> UN's mountain-choice, UN's fountain-voice,<br /> UN's failure-tears and its victories to rejoice.<br /> Tall in the body, deep in the heart and vast in life<br /> For God's Joy, Smile and Pride ever to last.</p>

<p>Dear Brother Narasimhan, your life was supremely chosen by the Supreme Himself to serve the United Nations and its illustrious leaders with your brilliant mind, your dynamic life-energy and, above all, your universal oneness-heart.</p>  </div>
