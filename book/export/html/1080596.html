<p>In 1976, the centennial of Pablo Casals' birth, United Nations staff members and delegates joined together in a programme sponsored by <em>Sri Chinmoy: The Peace Meditation at the United Nations</em> to pay tribute to the great cellist. The programme took place in New York on 11 October. The Spanish Ambassador to the United Nations, Don Jaime de Pini√©s, paid homage to Pablo Casals as "a symbol of the power of the spirit."</p>
<p>Other staff members recalled the beautiful "Hymn to the United Nations" that Pablo Casals composed in 1971 at the request of U Thant. The Secretary-General awarded him a United Nations Peace Medal for this work.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy concluded the programme by reading extracts from his meeting with Pablo Casals in which the Maestro spoke of the child as a miracle of God.</p>

<p>O Pablo Cassals</p>
<p>O Pablo Casals, O Pablo,<br /> Your wonder-cello-flames<br /> Eternally shall love and hallow<br /> Our diving and climbing human frames.</p>
<p>Charmingly short in earth's body-height,<br /> Supremely long in Heaven's soul-length,<br /> O child of tomorrow's dawn, no night<br /> You saw in your beauty's world of strength.</p>
