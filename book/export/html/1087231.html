<p>While I was shopping, I wanted to buy some Chinese egg rolls. The lady didn't understand my English, and I didn't understand her English. I said, "No meat, no fish-only vegetables."</p>
<p>She understood "vegetables."</p>
<p>Outside in the display case the egg rolls had meat, fish and God knows what inside them, so she brought me egg rolls from inside. She repeated the words, "No meat, no fish!"</p>
<p>She was so simple and humble, but I suspected her. I said, "Can you cut one for me?"</p>
<p>When she cut it, I saw that it was full of fish. See how she wanted to deceive me!</p>
<p>I said, "I was going to get them, but now I don't trust you." Then I started going away.</p>
<p>She said, "Please wait for a few minutes. I will make special ones for you."</p>
<p>I sat there waiting for five or six minutes. I said to myself, "This time I hope she will be sincere." When she brought the egg rolls, I didn't have the heart to ask her to cut them again. When I brought them home, I saw they were all vegetables.</p>
<p>I go shopping and bring back a Mahabharata of stories!</p>
