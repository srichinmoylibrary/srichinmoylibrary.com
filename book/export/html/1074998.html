<p>My Lord,<br />   How is it that there is nothing<br />   Permanent on earth?   "Who told you so?<br />   Is jealousy not permanent on earth?<br />   Is doubt not permanent on earth?<br />   Is insecurity not permanent on earth?"</p>
<p>My Lord,<br />   True, they are.<br />   But when are You<br />   Going to make them impermanent?   "Son, the moment the world wants Me to."</p>
<p>My Lord,<br />   Why do You blame the poor innocent world?<br />   After all, who created the world?</p>
<p>"Son, by creating the world<br /> I feel I have played My role.<br /> Now I feel the world should play its role<br /> By embracing love,<br /> Faith and oneness.<br /> And you know, son,<br /> I am more than ready,<br /> I am more than eager<br /> To assist the world<br /> In its noble adventure."</p>
