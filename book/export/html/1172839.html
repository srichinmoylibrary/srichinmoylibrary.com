<p>I have faith in Joy Days! Please see how often you can have Joy Days. When you have Joy Days, use your fertile brain to discover how you can spread your Guru’s light! During Joy Days you are happy and relaxed. When you are relaxed, you can think of spreading light, light, your Guru’s light. I will be very happy if you can have more Joy Days.</p>
<p>When there are Joy Days in Europe, sometimes 700 or 800 disciples take part. My joy at that time knows no bounds! I believe three times a year there are over 700 disciples present. Sometimes I call and speak to them. The other day, I think it was in Ukraine, there were more than 800 disciples present for Joy Days. I did speak to them.</p>
<p>In my physical absence, how many people take part three times a year! They all meet together for two full days.</p>
<p>Joy Days, Joy Days! Nothing gives me as much joy as Joy Days. When my children meet together to pray, meditate and play, they feed their souls, they feed their hearts, they feed their physical existence. What else do they need?</p>
