<h2>1.</h2>

<p>To analyse is to misjudge a soul. To love is to fathom a soul’s depth. Analysis takes place in the mental world, which is often frequented by the hooligans doubt and deception.</p>
<p>A genius always stands far beyond the reach of the common run. He is far above us, yet he is always for us. Einstein’s wife, Elsa, offered a world of illumination to her husband’s critics and dear ones alike when she said: <em>“You cannot analyse him, otherwise you will misjudge him. Such a genius should be irreproachable in every respect. But no, nature doesn’t behave like this. Where she goes extravagantly, she takes away extravagantly. You have to see him all of one piece. You cannot put him under one heading or another heading. Otherwise, you have unpleasantness. God has given him so much nobility, and I find him wonderful, although life with him is exhausting and complicated, and not only in one way, but in others.”</em></p>
<p>Unprecedented was Elsa’s service to her scientist-husband. She rightly deserves the loftiest appreciation for her endless and sleepless devotion to him. No wonder a friend of theirs lovingly voiced forth: “Your Elsa guards the mortal that the immortal may live.” Needless to say, Einstein unreservedly saw eye to eye with his friend.</p>
<p>At times it is quite difficult for an individual to get appreciation from his dear ones and from the immediate members of his family because of their demanding nature and their expectations, founded upon familiarity. But to our great joy, Einstein’s daughter-in-law, Hans’ wife, tells the world what she saw in the scientist: <em>“Dr. Einstein has been the sweetest, kindest, most understanding father-in-law any woman could have, he is a good and wonderful man.”</em></p>  </div>
