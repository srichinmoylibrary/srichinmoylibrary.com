<p>Today, when I came back from the UN, I went for a walk. On the way, I saw two young girls who were very tall, very thin. They were about to cross the road in front of me, but then they felt shy and they waited for me to go by.</p>
<p>As I was passing them, one of them said, “You are very strong. Is your name Sri Chinmoy?”</p>
<p>I said, “My name is Sri Chinmoy.”</p>
<p>Then they asked, “Where do you live? Do you live around here?”</p>
<p>I replied, “I live near 150th Street.”</p>
<p>Both of them were very, very nice. Instead of walking to their destination, they followed me for some time, staying about thirty or forty metres behind me. Then they came very close and said, “Bye!”</p>
