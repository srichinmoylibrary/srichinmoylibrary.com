<p>This afternoon I went to Woolworth's and bought a book that had answers to all kinds of questions. While I was in the store, a man came up to me and said, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes," and I smiled at him.</p>
<p>He said, "I wish to give you a piece of advice: you run too much! I always see you running on 150th Street, on the Grand Central Service Road and at other places. At our age we should walk.</p>
<p>"I saw you the other day while I was walking. I tried to catch up with you to tell you not to run, but you ran ahead. I know you are not going to accept my advice. So keep up what you are doing."</p>
<p>What could I do? I thanked him profusely.</p>
