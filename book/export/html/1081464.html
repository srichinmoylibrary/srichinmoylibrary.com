<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> By self-giving and by being sincere in our inner cry. The more sincere we are in our inner cry, the sooner our heart-power increases. Sincerity is the living force, the quintessence, of everything divine in us. It is the motivating force that increases the heart-power in us. When we cry sincerely and soulfully, the right cause will present itself. Then we will throw our entire existence into this cause. We will give it all our aspiration-power and dedication-power. At that time, we will find that the power of the heart increases immensely.</p>  </div>
