<p>Each individual has some heroes. Dilip Kumar Roy, the Golden Voice, happens to be one of my heroes. For us, he was known as Dilip-da. Let me start with my own personal connection with this great Gandharva Loka soul. [fn:1] Then I shall tell some other stories about him. Some stories are well-known, while others are known only to a few.</p>
<p>I beg to be excused for taking the liberty of paraphrasing some conversations between Dilip-da and other important figures.</p>  </div>
