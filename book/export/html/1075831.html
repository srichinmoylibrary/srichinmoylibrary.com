<p><em>(The Mother and an inmate of the Ashram.)</em></p>
<p>INMATE: Mother, we know that you are always with us. But in what sense? Please throw some light on this query of ours.</p>
<p>MOTHER: "I am with you, that signifies a world of things, because I am with you on all levels, in all planes, from the supreme Consciousness down to the most physical; here, at Pondicherry, you cannot breathe without breathing my consciousness ... There is a special personal tie between you and me, between all who have turned to Sri Aurobindo's and my teaching, â€” it is well understood, distance does not count here, you may be in France, you may be at the other end of the world or at Pondicherry, the tie is always true and living. And each time there comes a call, each time there is a need for me to know so that I may send out a force, an inspiration, protection or any other thing, a sort of message comes to me all of a sudden and I do the needful ... With those whom I have accepted as disciples, to whom I have said 'yes,' there is more than a tie, there is an emanation of me."</p>  </div>
