<h2>Corazon Aquino Was President Of The Republic...</h2>

<p><em>Corazon Aquino was President of the Republic of the Philippines from 1986 to 1992. She was brought to power by a plebiscite known as "people power", which overthrew the former military dictatorship. Mrs. Aquino has often referred to "people power" as "prayer power".</em></p>
<p><em>During her term in office, Mrs. Aquino reinstated many democratic institutions, including freedom of the press and a democratic constitution.</em></p>  </div>
