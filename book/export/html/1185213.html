<p>Michelangelo loved to glorify the human body in its pristine form â€” that means, as natural as possible. He was wont to create his figures as God made them, with the fewest of clothes. He was ruthlessly assailed by certain moralists for his <em>Last Judgement</em>. A Vatican official felt that this particular painting was another name for a shocking and unspeakable experience. In order to console the poor official, Michelangelo made a few changes. He added a donkey's ears and a snake's tail. The immortal artist proved to be an overnight trickster.</p>  </div>
