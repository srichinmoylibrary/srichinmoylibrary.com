<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Homeopathic medicine is more subtle than ordinary medicine. The subtler the reality, the stronger its capacity. Pure spirituality is subtler than the subtlest, and its power is beyond measure.</p>
<p>Homeopathic medicine should try to become one with the inner medicine, which is oneness with the Will of the Supreme. When the homeopath gives medicine to a patient, he should first pray and meditate. Then he should feel that he is offering the result of his prayer and meditation in the form of homeopathic medicine. He has prayed and has meditated, and he has got some spiritual essence and substance from his prayer and meditation. Then, on the human level he is giving this in the form of homeopathic medicine.</p>
<p>Some of the Indian homeopaths have done this and have been successful to a great extent. A friend of mine was of that type. He used to pray and meditate and then the reality that he received from his meditation he used to give in the form of homeopathic medicine.</p>  </div>
