    <title>&lt;em&gt;Donna Halper:&lt;/em&gt; I think there is a tremendous precedent for that. If I remember correctly, in the Bible it says that the best time to pray is in the morning, because you start out your day thinking about spiritual things, and that carries you through the rest of the day. So what you are saying is not really very different from what we call Western religion.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is not so much difference as people think between Western and Eastern religion. We are all God's children. We speak in different languages, but when it is a matter of the heart — your heart, my heart, his heart, her heart — we are all in tune. It is only the mind that creates problems. The aspiring heart is constantly in communication with the soul, and the soul is the representative of God. There is always an abiding truth inside all of us. When it is a matter of real spirituality, there is no geographical barrier — no East, no West, no North, no South. There is only the heart's oneness. It is through our heart's oneness that we fulfil ourselves and fulfil God in and through us.</p>  </div>
