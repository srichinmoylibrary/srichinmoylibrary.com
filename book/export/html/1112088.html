<p>At one point Howard told me, "All your people have soft legs."</p>
<p>What he meant was that they were not racewalking properly. They were not straightening their legs.</p>
<p>He said you have to strike always with the heel first. Our people were touching with the toes or the middle of the foot.</p>
