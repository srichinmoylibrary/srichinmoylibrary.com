<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can love God even though you don't know Him in the same way that you can love yourself without knowing what you truly are. Once you know yourself, you will see that you are none other than God. Right now, you love yourself thinking that you know yourself. But that is absurd; you do not know yourself. Similarly, you can also love God whom you do not know.</p>  </div>
