  <h1 class="book-heading">Death, may I come in?</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, may I come in?<br /> "No, definitely not!<br /> You are a shameless liar;<br /> You are a worthless coward,<br /> An impossible creature!</p>
<p>"Hundreds of times<br /> You have begged me<br /> To allow you<br /> To enter into my lifeless Hall,<br /> And I have given you<br /> My immediate permission.<br /> Yet you have invited fear<br /> To capture your heart.</p>
<p>"No more opportunity<br /> Shall be given to you.<br /> With you I shall not share<br /> My nectar-pleasure<br /> And my silence-treasure,<br />     Never!"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163559" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Delayed arrival</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, I do not deny<br /> That I have badly disappointed you.<br /> I have been delaying and delaying my arrival.<br /> But you can easily forgive me<br /> Because my mother,<br /> My father, my brother,<br /> My sister and many<br /> Bosom friends of mine<br /> Have committed suicide.<br /> They came to you;<br /> They entered into your Hall<br /> Long before they were due.<br /> I am sure their early arrival<br /> Can stand against my late arrival.</p>
<p>"You fool, they came in<br /> Before I had invited them.<br /> They were unpardonable intruders.<br /> Never do I forgive such intruders,<br /> Nor does God forgive these life-takers.<br /> I have thrown<br /> The members of your family<br /> And your friends<br /> Into the lowest hell,<br /> Far below your imagination's flight.<br /> Ceaseless torture<br /> Has embraced them.</p>
<p>"I give you my first and last<br /> Piece of advice:<br /> Never take your life away,<br />        Never!</p>
<p>"Although in your case the time has<br />  already expired,<br /> And in spite of my immediate need<br /> And demand for your presence,<br /> I am ready to wait for you<br />        Indefinitely!"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163560" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Death, where are my brothers?</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, where are my<br /> Divine brothers,<br /> Sri Krishna and the Christ?<br /> Do you know anything<br /> About them?<br /> Did they enjoy your company?<br /> Did you enjoy their company?</p>
<p>"I hate your divine brothers.<br /> They did not say a word<br /> In my favour<br />   On earth.<br /> They spoke only of Eternal Life,<br /> My eternal enemy.<br /> But my big heart forgave them;<br /> I immediately showed them<br /> The way to the highest Heaven.<br /> I must say that<br /> Gratitude did not altogether<br /> Desert your divine brothers.<br /> The pride of the East<br /> And the pride of the West<br /> Both garlanded me<br /> Before they left me<br /> For their Father.<br /> Needless to say,<br /> Their Father and my Father<br /> Are eternally one<br /> And supremely inseparable."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163561" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Death, why do you live?</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, why do you live?<br /> "I live because<br /> Your human life needs divine rest,<br /> Your human life deserves supreme rest<br /> After you have fought<br /> In the battlefield of life."</p>
<p>Death, when will you die?<br /> "I shall die<br /> The moment<br /> Bondage and ignorance<br /> Forget your life<br /> And the life of Earth."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163562" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Death, tell me something, please.</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, tell me<br /> Something about yourself, please.</p>
<p>"I shall tell you<br /> The most important thing<br /> About myself:<br /> I love God because He is supremely great.<br /> I love man because he is hopelessly helpless."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163563" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Death, how old are you?</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, how old are you?<br /> "I am as old as your friend, Life."</p>
<p>Death, unfortunately<br /> I know not my friend's age.<br /> "You fool, don't you know that<br /> Your friend is as old as his earthly hope?"</p>
<p>Death, what is earthly hope?<br /> "Earthly hope is man's future eye,<br />         future heart,<br />         future role,<br />         future goal."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163564" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Death, tell me why?</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, tell me, please,<br /> Why some people love you<br /> And some people hate you.<br />            Why?</p>
<p>"My lovers love me<br /> Because I don't think of them at all.<br /> My haters hate me<br /> Because I think of them<br /> When their hour is due."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163565" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Death, what do you and God speak about?</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, how often do you speak to God?<br /> "I speak to God constantly."</p>
<p>Can you tell me<br /> What both of you talk about?</p>
<p>"We talk about our achievements<br />         And<br /> Our disappointments.<br /> I tell God about my achievements<br />           On earth<br /> And my disappointments in Heaven.<br /> God tells me about His achievements<br />           In Heaven<br /> And His disappointments on earth."</p>
<p>I see.<br /> Thank you, Death.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163566" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Death, do you have a God?</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, do you have a God like me?<br /> "Yes, I do."<br /> Perhaps we have the same God.<br /> "Yes, we have the same God.<br /> But unlike me<br /> You have two Gods."</p>
<p>No, never!<br /> I have only one God,<br /> And I pray to only one God.</p>
<p>"You liar!<br /> When wild frustration<br /> Embraces you<br /> And untold disgrace<br /> Dances around you,<br /> Whom do you pray to?<br /> To me, my child, to me.<br /> You pray to me:<br /> 'O Death, O bountiful Death,<br /> Do come and embrace me.<br /> I need your immediate presence.'<br /> You must know that<br /> Whoever you pray to<br /> Is your God,<br /> Your real God.<br /> Therefore at times<br /> I become your God,<br /> Your only God."</p>
<p>O Death, my stupid curiosity<br /> Deeply admires your Wisdom-Reality.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163567" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Death, how often do you speak to Satan?</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, how often do you speak to Satan?<br /> "I never speak to Satan.<br /> I hate him!<br /> I hate his brutality;<br /> I hate his ignorance-existence-reality.<br /> He is just impossible!"<br /> Why, Death, why?</p>
<p>"You know why.<br /> I love both Heaven and earth.<br /> I love Heaven's flower of beauty.<br /> I love earth's fruit of duty.</p>
<p>"Rascal Satan is always eager<br /> To destroy the flower of God's own Heaven<br /> And the fruit of God's own earth.<br /> One day I shall conquer Satan.<br /> I shall devour Satan.<br /> And then I and my Dream-boat shall enjoy <br /> God the Beauty,<br /> And I and my Reality-shore<br /> Shall enjoy God the Duty,<br /> Unreservedly and eternally."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163568" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Death, please illumine me.</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, please illumine me.<br /> Some people are killed<br /> While defending their own country<br /> When they come to you,<br /> What do you do with them?</p>
<p>"When they come to me,<br /> I bless them and bless them.<br /> I embrace them and embrace them<br /> Until they are tired of my embrace."</p>
<p>And what about those<br /> Who are killed<br /> While attacking another country<br /> And killing its people?<br /> My question is,<br /> What do you do with those aggressors?</p>
<p>"Aggressors? I hate them,<br /> I literally hate them!<br /> I hate them to the same extent<br /> That I hate Satan.<br /> And when they come to me,<br /> I turn them all<br /> Into a huge football<br /> And kick them and kick them<br /> With all the strength of my Thunder-Feet,<br /> Until I am completely exhausted!"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163569" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Unfortunate deaths</h1>
  
 

<p>UNFORTUNATE DEATHS</p>
<p>Death,<br /> I know<br /> You vehemently detest suicide-death.<br /> What about the unintentional, unavoidable tragedies:<br />         Fire-death<br />         Water-death<br />         Famine-death<br />         Car-death<br />         Aeroplane-death<br />         And other<br />         Unfortunate deaths?</p>
<p>"I tell you,<br /> It is mischievous Satan<br /> Who is responsible for all<br /> Sad happenings on earth.<br /> He creates such problems for me!<br /> At times I find it extremely difficult<br /> To house those unfortunate human beings properly,<br /> To my real satisfaction.<br /> I hate Satan<br /> At each hush-gap,<br /> And I really mean it."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163570" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Death, do you have telephones in your country?</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, here on earth we have telephones.<br /> Do you have telephones in your country?<br /> "Yes, we do."</p>
<p>I am so delighted to hear that.<br /> Now, do you make long-distance calls<br /> As we do from America to Russia?<br /> "Yes, we do.<br /> At every moment<br /> My assistants make thousands<br /> Of long-distance calls<br /> On my behalf."</p>
<p>Thousands of calls?<br /> Good gracious!<br /> To whom do they make so many<br /> Long-distance calls?<br /> "They speak to Heaven and hell on the phone.<br /> At every moment,<br /> Thousands of human souls<br /> We have to dispatch<br /> Either to Heaven or to hell.<br /> We inform Heaven and hell first<br /> Before we send them new members.<br /> We throw those members down,<br /> Who are meant for hell,<br /> And we push those members up,<br /> Who are meant for Heaven."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163571" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Death, I am extremely curious</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, I am extremely curious to know<br /> Something from you.<br /> "Just ask me,<br /> And my answer will be immediate."</p>
<p>Death, when a desiring man dies,<br /> What do you do with him?<br /> When an aspiring man dies,<br /> What do you do with him?<br /> When a realised man<br /> Leaves the body,<br /> What do you do with him?</p>
<p>"When a desiring man dies,<br /> I immediately give him<br /> The book of frustration to read.<br /> When an aspiring man dies,<br /> I immediately give him<br /> The book of determination to read.<br /> When a realised man <br /> Leaves the body,<br /> I immediately give him<br /> The Kite of Liberation to fly."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163572" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Death, how do you know</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, how do you know<br /> That you do not give us<br /> A false rest?</p>
<p>"Pilgrim, how do you know<br /> That your life on earth<br /> Is not a splendid illusion?"</p>
<p>Death, I know that my life on earth<br /> Is not an illusion<br />        Because<br />   I play here on earth<br />   With God and His Sound-Life.</p>
<p>"Pilgrim, come and enter into me.<br /> You will see me playing<br />  With God and His Silence-Soul."</p>
  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Destruction and dissolution, haven and heaven</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, are you destruction<br />           And<br />     Dissolution?   "Yes, I am."</p>
<p>Death, are you haven<br />           And<br />     Heaven?   "Yes, I am."</p>
<p>Death, how?  "Pilgrim, easy<br /> I just destroy and dissolve<br /> The demands of the human body<br />        And<br /> Comfort and immortalise<br /> The tears of the divine soul."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163574" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">The quick surrender, the brave fight</h1>
  
 

<p>Old men slowly, helplessly<br />      And peacefully<br /> Enter into the Hall of Death.</p>
<p>Death proudly, deliberately<br />      And triumphantly<br /> Enters into the Life-chambers<br />      Of young men.</p>
<p>O Death, I like the quick surrender<br />  Of the old men,<br />      And<br /> I love, admire and adore<br />  The brave fight<br />      Of the young men.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1163575" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">How he plays with God</h1>
  
 

<p>It matters not<br />      If<br /> A man actually dies.</p>
<p>It matters not<br />     Where and when<br /> He eventually dies.      But</p>
<p>It matters much,<br />   It matters more,<br /> It matters most      How</p>
<p>He plays with God<br />   On earth<br /> In the Garden<br />   Of Love-Light.</p>

<p>            When<br /> Is death afraid of you?<br /> When you smile.<br />            Why?<br /> Because the brother in death<br /> Needs your smile.            When<br /> Is life afraid of you?<br /> When you despair.<br />            Why?<br /> Because the mother in life<br /> Hates your despair.            When<br /> Is truth afraid of you?<br /> When you give up.<br />            Why?<br /> Because the father in truth<br /> Wants you to try<br />  Time and again.<br />     Never give up.<br />        Never!</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Instant illumination</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, when a spiritual Master visits you<br /> On his way to Heaven,<br /> Do you give him a special reception?</p>
<p>"Yes, I do.<br /> But I am so lucky<br /> That God has turned only very few human beings<br /> Into spiritual Masters<br /> Since the very birth of His creation.<br /> Only on very rare occasions<br /> Do I have to welcome a spiritual Master."</p>
<p>O Death, my poor ignorant friend,<br /> Those days are buried in oblivion!<br /> Nowadays thousands of spiritual Masters<br /> Are offering their loftiest Height,<br /> Purest Light<br /> And<br /> Deepest Delight<br /> To their younger brothers and sisters in spirit.<br /> To your wide surprise,<br /> There are some spiritual Masters<br /> Who have the capacity —<br /> Unlike Krishna, the Buddha<br /> And the Christ —<br /> To grant Illumination,<br /> Liberation and Salvation<br /> In the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>Again, there are some<br /> Who are simply unique.<br /> Do you know what they do?<br /> They initiate<br /> Over ten thousand people<br /> At a time!<br /> And their initiation has<br /> The thaumaturgic power<br /> To offer their disciples<br /> Illumination, Liberation and Salvation<br /> All at once!</p>
<p>"Is it so?<br /> I must immediately go to Heaven<br /> And inform my comrades Krishna, Buddha and Christ<br /> About the incredible<br /> And unprecedented capacities<br /> Of these spiritual Masters.<br /> I shall tell Krishna, Buddha and Christ<br /> That if they really want to be<br /> Worthy of their successors,<br /> Then they must<br /> Immediately come down<br /> And be their most humble disciples.<br /> I assure you, my divine friends<br /> Are extremely sincere seekers.<br /> They will immediately<br /> Come down<br /> And kiss the very dust<br /> Of the feet of these Masters<br /> Who are granting<br /> Instant Illumination, Liberation and Salvation<br /> Like the earth's instant coffee.<br /> I am so grateful to you<br /> For offering me<br /> This creation-illumining news."</p>
<p>Death, I am so happy that at last<br /> My most dedicated service<br /> Has been of some use to you.</p>
