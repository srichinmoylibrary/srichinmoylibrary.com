<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, our physical abilities depend on how much determination, perseverance and aspiration we have. If we have very few abilities, it does not mean that we were undivine in our previous incarnations. No, it is only that some people don't try; they don't work hard. In this world nothing can be achieved without working very hard for it.</p>
<p>Today I was very sad about the standard of our sports. It is not going higher. If this had been our first year of doing sports, I could say that we had no opportunity or facilities to train. But for the last few years we have been training and still our standard is not good. There has been no satisfactory progress.</p>  </div>
