<p>His rich life<br /> Is a variety of absurdities.<br /> He became God before he was born.<br /> He married Heaven, his mother,<br /> When he was a minute old.<br /> He married earth, his daughter,<br /> When he was a trillion years old.<br /> He loved himself only twice:<br /> Once when he denied his supremacy,<br /> Once when he affirmed his total surrender.</p>
