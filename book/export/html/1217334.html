<p>Don't think of doing anything. Just keep the door of your consciousness open, but see whether it is a thief or a friend who is coming in. Allow in only those whom you want. Keep out the lower thoughts. Open the door to higher, sublime thoughts. This is the first step in working on your consciousness. The following steps will come to you from within.</p>  </div>
