    <title>Question: Do you think that the system of &amp;quot;one country — one vote&amp;quot; is democratic? If not, do you see any alternative before the time arrives when the accumulated wisdom of nations&#039; souls becomes the yardstick in voting?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is always advisable for each country to have a vote, but this vote should not express its individual will but rather grow out of the general will. It is not an individual will that is being executed. Otherwise, it will be like many minds going in many ways. At that time, nothing will be settled and there will be no hope of reaching any conclusion. So the unity of the collective reality has to voice forth, with each country participating. Then there will be one united vote, one will, one reality and one illumining and fulfilling choice.o</p>  </div>
