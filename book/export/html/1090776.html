<p>It is the duty of the individual soul to cry for God in the heart of his meditation. It is the duty of the divine soul to constantly guide and assure the individual soul on its eternal journey. When a cry goes up, immediately assurance, God's Blessing-Assurance descends. In the past several years Sri Chinmoy has been approached by untold numbers of aspirants seeking his inner and outer assurance in their life of aspiration. This book, a collection of questions and answers, represents a portion of that dialogue.</p>  </div>
