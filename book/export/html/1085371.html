<p>There was a great political leader named Vallabh Bhai Patel. He was one of the right-hand men of Gandhi and everybody admired him. He had tremendous will and was known as the iron man of India. He encouraged and inspired millions of people to fight against the British rule.</p>
<p>Once he was giving a talk about the freedom of India. He spoke of how India could have freedom and liberate itself from the British. In the middle of the talk a mailman came to Vallabh Bhai Patel and gave him a telegram. He opened it only to learn of the quite unexpected death of his wife. But Vallabh Bhai Patel didn't say a word to anyone. He continued lecturing for an hour or so. Then he answered everyone's questions with utmost calm and quiet.</p>
<p>Afterwards, tears were flowing from his eyes. Everybody came up to him, asking, "What happened? What is the matter?"</p>
<p>He showed them the telegram.</p>
<p>"How could you answer questions so calmly and quietly, and how could you finish such an inspiring lecture?"</p>
<p>The great political leader replied, "Duty comes first. My Motherland comes first. My wife was dear to me, but my Motherland is infinitely dearer. Therefore, I have done my duty to my Motherland first. This is infinitely more important than to think of one's wife. I have done my first and foremost duty. Now I am performing my next duty: I am crying for my wife."</p>
