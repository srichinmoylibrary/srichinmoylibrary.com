<p>Put your right hand over your heart and your left hand on your head. Please press both your head and your chest a little hard. As quietly and slowly as possible, you will breathe in and out. Now say, "I am now contemplating. I can vividly see my Lord Beloved Supreme right in front of my vision-eye, and He is telling me that He is eager to play with me the hide-and-seek game."</p>  </div>
