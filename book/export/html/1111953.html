<p>At our West Coast triathlon, I was supposed to draw a number in a kind of lottery. It was read out over the loudspeaker — number 644.</p>
<p>The woman with that number could not hear; she was almost deaf. A man did something with his fingers, and then she understood. Then she came up and became speechless because she had won. So the deaf became dumb.</p>
<p>Then she said that she had been dying to go to Hawaii, and now she had got the round-trip ticket free. Over 700 people joined and she won the ticket!</p>
