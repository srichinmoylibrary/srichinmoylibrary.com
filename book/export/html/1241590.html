<p>For the past few days, every time I opened the front door, a particular cat would try to enter into my house. A fight was going on between that cat and me.</p>
<p>Cats are much less evolved than lions. Lions have developed good and noble qualities. House cats cry for constant affection, and by pouring and pouring affection into a cat, you can change its nature. But, in general, lions are much more evolved.</p>
<p>So many of the disciples have had lion incarnations. We started with Dulal!</p>
