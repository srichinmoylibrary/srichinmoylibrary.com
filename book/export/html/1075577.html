<p>Krishna, Krishna,<br /> Hurry up, hurry up!<br /> Come down, come down!<br /> The world needs your immediate presence.<br /> "Chinmoy, I am in deep meditation.<br /> For God's sake, don't disturb me."<br /> Thank you, Krishna,<br /> You have always been clever.</p>
<p>Thakur, Thakur,<br /> Look, look! Earth needs<br /> Your presence desperately.<br /> "Chinmoy, I am sorry.<br /> My Mother has given me<br /> Much work to do here, upstairs.<br /> Therefore<br /> I simply can't think<br /> Of going downstairs.<br /> I am sorry."<br /> Thank you, Thakur.<br /> You too have become clever.</p>
<p>Naren, Naren,<br /> Once more Mother-Earth<br /> Needs your warrior-heart<br /> To fight against ignorance-night.<br /> "Chinmoy, tell Mother-Earth<br /> That I have been fighting<br /> More powerfully, more devotedly,<br /> For her from here,<br /> Against her Ignorance-Night.<br /> Therefore<br /> She does not need my<br /> Physical presence."<br /> Thank you, Naren.<br /> I shall be also as clever<br /> As you are,<br /> When my turn comes.</p>
