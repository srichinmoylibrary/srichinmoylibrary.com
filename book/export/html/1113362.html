<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God calls you always with the name that you have: Sanatan. But He has different messages for you at different times of the day. In the morning He asks you to wake up. At noon He asks you to look up. In the afternoon He asks you to look around. In the evening He asks you to dive deep within. And at night He asks you to watch your obedience-life grow and glow inside your self-expanding gratitude-heart.</p>  </div>
