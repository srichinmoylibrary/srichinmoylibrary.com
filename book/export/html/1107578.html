<p>God’s World and man’s world.</p>
<p>In God’s World there is no such thing as imperfection. It is all perfection, all-illumining and all-fulfilling perfection. In man’s world there is no such thing as perfection. It is all imperfection. The outer nature of imperfection is discouraging. The inner nature of imperfection is disheartening.</p>
<p>In God’s World there is no such thing as impurity. It is all purity. Purity is the oneness-delight of God the Transcendental Beloved Supreme and God the Universal Lover Divine. In man’s world there is no such thing as purity. It is all impurity. Impurity is at once impulsive and repulsive. The very nature of impurity is to destroy the entire being.</p>
<p>In God’s World there is no such thing as failure. It is all experience. Experience is the precursor of realisation and realisation is oneness within and without. In experience we notice two things: success and progress. Success eventually surrenders to progress, for progress is always encouraging, illumining and fulfilling, whereas success at times proves to be a disaster in disguise. In man’s world there is no such thing as success. Even when so-called success comes, it never brings abiding satisfaction.</p>
<p>In God’s World there is no such thing as sacrifice. It is all closeness-perfection and oneness-satisfaction. In man’s world also there is no such thing as sacrifice. Here it is all division-wall and destruction-volcano.</p>
<p>God’s World is always ready to inundate man’s world with Infinity’s Love, Eternity’s Concern and Immortality’s Life. It is man’s world that must needs accept the blessingful gifts from God’s World with a tiny gratitude-flame from the very depths of its heart. </p>
