<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They did. They used flimsy planes, like the Japanese planes during wartime. It started in the Ramayana era. There were very few planes, only two or three. They didn’t have petrol or gasoline. But they knew how to control the life force, life energy, with occult power. They used consolidated energy; it was tangible, not fluid. It was energy you could grip, energy in solid form. But you had to know how to use this energy. I used to do it in my previous incarnations. When I did it the first time, it was such magic. You won’t believe it.</p>  </div>
