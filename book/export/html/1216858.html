<p>One morning the disciples held a race for the public. Two runners were going ahead of me, and one of them was telling the other, "This guy is everything. Turn around." He wanted his friend to see me properly.</p>
<p>After the race somebody else came up to me and said, "Why do you not allow people to eat meat and fish?" Perhaps he had become very hungry from running.</p>
