<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For ordinary people, it is true. If they run a few miles, they need more sleep. But for spiritual people, especially advanced seekers, it is not necessary. By drawing down cosmic energy, in two minutes they can get the rest of two hours, three hours, four hours. It depends on how effectively you can draw in the cosmic energy. But ordinary runners do have to sleep longer.</p>  </div>
