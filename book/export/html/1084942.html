<p>You have deserted your honesty.<br /> Lo, God's Duty-Tree<br /> Which has been pleasing you<br /> Is dead.<br /> You have completely deserted your humility.<br /> Lo, God's Beauty-Flower<br /> Which has been enlightening you<br /> Is unmistakably dead.<br /> You have deserted your purity.<br /> Lo, God's Spontaneity-Fruit<br /> Which has been nourishing you<br /> Is helplessly dead.</p>
