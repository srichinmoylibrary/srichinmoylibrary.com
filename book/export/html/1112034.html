<p>Yesterday morning at about 5:30 I was running on 150th Street near Sandhani and Snigdha's house. Suddenly Navina's soul came to me for blessings. I said, "Fine. Why did you not come to New York after the April celebrations?" I decided to ask Kailash why Navina had not come.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I was walking to circus practice. On Snigdha and Sandhani's steps I saw three persons standing: Snigdha, Durga and a third person. So I smiled at them. Snigdha was pointing out the third girl to me, but I couldn't recognise her. I am blind! Then I saw it was Navina. Navina was with them, but her hairstyle had transformed her face.</p>
