<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The sun is losing its heat and brilliance. It does not have the same brilliance that it had when it was created as a star. With the occult eye, the third eye, you can see that it is not the same. When the Vedic Seers gazed at the sun, or even forty or fifty years ago when people looked at the sun, it was much brighter. But if the Supreme wants to, He can again inject into the sun new energy â€” infinite energy, infinite heat and infinite light.</p>  </div>
