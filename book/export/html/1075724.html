<p><em>(The Abode of Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. Mind has not been born there. The One without a second and the Mother of the Trinity are rapt in trance in the holy Fire. The teeming Gods go round the Infinite and the Mother of the Golden All, singing anthems to them.)</em></p>
<p>1ST BAND OF THE GODS: The face of Truth is covered with a brilliant lid; that do thou remove, O Fosterer, for the law of the Truth, for sight. [fn:1]</p>
<p>2ND BAND:</p>

<p>From the non-being to true being,<br /> From the darkness to the Light,<br /> From death to Immortality.<br /> OM. Peace! Peace! Peace!<br /> So be it. [fn:2]</p>

<p><em>(Their creation has compelled the primaeval parents to descend upon earth for the Divine Play and thus to terminate the earth's ceaseless pangs.)</em></p>
<p>BRAHMA: It is I who create. None save I is the Infinite's creative Power. Therefore, no equal have I.</p>
<p>VISHNU: It is I who uphold. I am His preserving Power. Hence, matchless am I.</p>
<p>SIVA: I am Rudra. I am His force of Destruction. Boundless also is my Compassion for the doleful earth. It is I who lead the earth and her children towards a new creation. Therefore, unique am I.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Earth sows, Heaven reaps. Our supremacy amongst each other can be proved only on the earth, and there alone shall we be able to find which of our devotees are truly superior.</p>
<p>VISHNU: I see eye to eye with you.</p>
<p>SIVA: Needless to say, I shall accompany you. We are but the triune limbs of the Supreme. We exist simply because we must needs help Him in his Divine Play.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Has the earth invoked our presence there? Without their mounting cry how can we descend?</p>
<p>VISHNU: I shall sow the seed of yearning in the heart of the mortals. With a heart full of devotion they will pray to us.</p>
<p>SIVA: Remember, the Asura with his hosts will not remain asleep. How can the earth hail our advent, she who has been under the octopus tentacles of the brooding Giant of Evil?</p>
<p>BRAHMA: We are fully aware. Mahadeva, you will be our Captain! It is you who will ruthlessly destroy the Adversary and found our victory on the aspiring soil.</p>
<p><em>(Behind the curtain a tremendous call and yearning)</em></p>
<p>O, save the earth! O, save the creation! Do flood the earth with the sanctified waters of the Truth and cast the Falsehood down into the Chasm of Nothingness. Set the earth-life free from the roaring den of Death. Brahma, Vishnu, Siva! deign to alight on this orphan earth where Ignorance reigns supreme. We yearn to see your divine Play on the sorrowful dust.</p>

<p><em>OM. Anandamayi Chaitanyamayi Satyamayi Parame.</em><br /><em>OM. Anandamayi Chaitanyamayi Satyamayi Parame.</em><br /><em>OM. Anandamayi Chaitanyamayi Satyamayi Parame.</em></p>

<p>THE MOTHER: Alas, the earth is inundated with ceaseless sorrows and pangs. Her throbbing heart compels my descent. I am the Mother. Who but I can save my children?</p>
<p>THE INFINITE: I, too, on earth shall descend. My advent the East shall acclaim, thine the West.</p>
<p>THE MOTHER: My Grace shall give Immortality to earth. With me will I carry the flame of fire-pure Transformation.</p>
<p>THE INFINITE: I will found thy supernal Kingdom on the neglected earth.</p>  </div>
