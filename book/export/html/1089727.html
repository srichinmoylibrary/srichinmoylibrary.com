  <h1 class="book-heading">The policemen</h1>
  
 
<p>Four policemen were playing cards at the police station. They had nothing else to do. They were enjoying their card game, and they played for a long time. Then they became bored. All of them started complaining, "Life is so boring! For the whole week, there have been no fights, no murders, no accidents â€” nothing, nothing, nothing. We have had absolutely nothing to do. Sometimes when we have nothing to do, we enjoy relaxing. But now it has gone on for so many days that we feel restless."</p>
<p>The captain overheard their conversation and said, "Wait, wait! Human nature never changes. In a day or two, once again we will have to rush to save people."</p>
<p>As soon as the captain finished speaking, the phone started ringing. Then one calamity after another started taking place. Somewhere there was a burglary. Somewhere someone was murdered. Somewhere a gang was fighting. The phone did not stop ringing.</p>
<p>The captain said, "Look, I told you, human nature will never change. So let us rush, let us run to do the needful."</p>
<p>So all the policemen went in various directions to attend to their urgent duties. The captain was so wise: human nature never changes. That is why it is always compared with the tail of a dog. You can hold the tail and try to straighten it. But as soon as you release it, it curls.</p>  </div>
