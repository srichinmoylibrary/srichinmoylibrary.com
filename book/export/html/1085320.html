<p>We all know that the game of dice is a most deplorable and most tempting game. After playing for a while, people lose their brains and become senseless. People who are addicted to the game do not remain normal.</p>
<p>Even the most pious, generous and kindhearted people — men such as Yudhishthira — were fond of this game. So many kings lost their kingdoms and became poorer than the poorest because of dice. But they did not give up this game.</p>
<p>Now, who introduced this game? It was Lord Shiva, nobody else. He and his consort, Parvati, used to play this game. Shiva taught his wife how to play because it was her wish to become as good as he in as many ways as possible. She played extremely well, and they had wonderful games together.</p>
<p>In playing dice, Shiva's consciousness did not descend, as is the case with ordinary humans. Parvati too maintained her highest consciousness. They played dice for the sake of the game. But for ordinary human beings it has always been a dangerous game. One has to lose. One has to win. For ordinary humans who are nothing short of weaklings, naturally the intoxication of the game will prove to be their ruin. Kings would give away their kingdoms, even their wives who were dearer than the dearest to them, to keep their promises when they lost.</p>
<p>But Shiva and Parvati did not become losers. They played dice with innocent joy. So it is not what one plays but who plays that is of paramount importance. For ordinary humans, this kind of life ends in utter destruction.</p>
