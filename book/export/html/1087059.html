<p>I wanted to buy a steam machine to lose weight. Sanatan took me to Brooklyn, and he got lost going there, so we went to Manhattan on the way from Queens to Brooklyn. Then, once we got there I couldn't believe what a horrible place it was! It was full of old hospital things - everything used and second-hand. Sanatan wanted me to buy a machine that was very large and very old. I was ready to buy it, but then my mother's soul appeared and said, "This is a hospital. You don't have to come to a place like this."</p>
<p>I didn't like the machine at all, but I would have surrendered to Sanatan. But when my mother interfered, I did not buy it. This machine was three times as large as the one I eventually did buy.</p>
