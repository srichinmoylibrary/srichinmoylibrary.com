<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your dream was only preparing you. If you hadn't known, your shock would have been more severe. Even if you had known only three hours before her death, it would have helped you to strengthen yourself. When your mother's death took place, on the one hand it was frightening and on the other hand your dream helped you to become stronger.</p>  </div>
