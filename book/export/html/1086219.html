<p>Pulak said to me, “Here is an envelope, on the occasion of my mother’s birthday.” He gave me a love-offering in honour of his mother’s soul, and I thanked him.</p>
<p>I entered into Pulak’s car, and I invoked his mother. Immediately, most devotedly, his mother came to me. I blessed his mother unreservedly. Then I saw her soul seated on Pulak’s seat. In the inner world she started massaging Pulak’s right knee, and then his left knee. I said, “What are you doing? I do not think your son has any problem with his knees.”</p>
<p>She said, “No, but you have problems with <em>your</em> knees! I do not dare to touch your knees, so I am massaging my son’s knees with the hope that you will feel a little better.”</p>
<p>Pulak had not yet entered into the car, but on his seat, his mother’s soul was massaging his right knee and then his left knee. How much is happening in the inner world!</p>
<p>You may call it a cock-and-bull story, but I enjoy these stories, because I know they are true. I get such joy when the souls come and tell me this kind of story!</p>
<p>The soul’s world is as real as this world, but there is a wall between the two worlds. Then again, that wall can be transparent for some individuals. When it is transparent, you can see what is on the other side. For one eye, the third eye, everything is transparent. For our ordinary naked eyes, nothing is transparent. Even if somebody stands in front of you, there is a lid, there is a cover, so you cannot see his inner reality. But when you can use the third eye, there is no obstruction, no cover.</p>
<p>One day you, like me, will have millions of juicy stories in your life. When you realise God, at that time you will be able to tell millions of stories. That day has to dawn, either in the near future or in the distant future.</p>
