<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes before we go to sleep we eat undivine food. Then, it is not because wrong forces enter us that we have bad dreams, but just because of the food which has entered into our system. If we have wrong thoughts while eating, we may think that it is all over; but it is not. At night those wrong thoughts may create problems. So bad dreams are sometimes caused by food and sometimes they are caused by what we do while we are eating.</p>  </div>
