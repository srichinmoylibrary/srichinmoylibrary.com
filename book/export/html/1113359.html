<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As human beings have more than one language, so also do plants and flowers have more than one language. We speak in different languages to communicate with the rest of the world. Plants and flowers also use different languages to communicate among themselves. They have also a special way to communicate with mankind. Plants usually communicate with man's longing for height. Flowers usually communicate with man's longing for beauty. Mankind, too, communicates with the plants and flowers. Mankind usually communicates with their aspiration-capacity and dedication-divinity.</p>  </div>
