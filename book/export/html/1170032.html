<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dear Daniel, sweet boy, I feel sorry for you. At the same time, I also feel sorry for your teachers. You feel that your teachers are always mean. The teachers feel that you children are always unruly and undisciplined. The teachers do love you, but right now they deal with you in a way that is familiar to you: by shouting and yelling. They feel that this is the best way, since you are familiar with this way.</p>
<p>But there is another way, and your teachers are eager to show you that way. The moment you become calm, quiet and obedient, your teachers will give you a soulful smile and their fruitful wisdom lovingly, steadily and completely.</p>
