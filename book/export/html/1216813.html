<p>Tagore wrote that the Japanese don't show emotion, and before I came to Japan I believed him. But now I see that perhaps Tagore touched the Japanese mind, whereas I am touching the Japanese heart.</p>
<p>When we were leaving, three Japanese women disciples were crying and crying at the airport. Psychically it was their souls that were crying. So Tagore was wrong. If you touch the heart, even if it is a stone heart, it will show emotion.</p>
