<p>One day, when Khurram was a young man, Nur Jahan invited him to come to a special fair. This fair was organised by the palace women. They had little stalls where they sold trinkets, fabric and other items. There Khurram first saw Arjumand Banu, who was Nur Jahan's niece. To Nur Jahan's great joy, he fell in love with this young girl and later married her, thus strengthening the Persian presence at the court.</p>
<p>Arjumand Banu was henceforth called Mumtaz Mahal, 'Chosen One of the Palace'. Shah Jahan loved her above all others and she was to bear the Emperor fourteen children.</p>  </div>
