<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not sleep; you are making a mistake there. While you are meditating, your mind is entering into the world of calmness and silence. There you donâ€™t have to create any movement or be dynamic. This world of silence is not the ordinary sleep where one becomes totally unconscious. On the contrary, it is a very good state. Try only to grow into that state with utmost sincerity, humility and devotion.</p>
<p>However, if meditation proper has not taken place, if you are merely preparing to meditate and you feel sleepy; it means that inertia and sloth are present. But if it is after a good meditation that this feeling comes, it is not sleep at all. You are entering into the world of silence and mistaking it for sleep.</p>  </div>
