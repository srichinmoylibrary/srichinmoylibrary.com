<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I use my mind, it is impossible even to imagine doing all these things. But when I use my heart, I feel that everything is possible because I know I am a mere instrument of God's Compassion and, according to my receptivity, God does everything in and through me. It entirely depends on my own receptivity. God's Grace is like the sun. If I keep all the doors and windows open, naturally the sunlight will enter into the room in abundant measure, whereas if I leave only one tiny window open, then very little light will be able to enter. In exactly the same way, if we can open our heart-door completely, then God's Grace enters into us.</p>  </div>
