<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to tell you a story. A merchant once said, "By God's Grace I went to the store and bought something for such and such a price and I sold it for such and such a price. Why did I sell it for a higher price? Because God's Grace acted in and through me. God wanted me to make a profit so that my business would flourish. If I don't make money, then how am I going to prosper? So it is all God's Grace."</p>
<p>In your case perhaps someone will snatch your money and he will say, "By God's Grace I am getting your money."</p>  </div>
