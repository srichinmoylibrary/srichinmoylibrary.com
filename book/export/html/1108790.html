<p>Introduction by the editor to the first edition:</p>
<p>This book brings together some of Sri Chinmoy’s most significant utterances about the meaning of life, world peace and his spiritual philosophy, which he has given on various occasions and in diverse countries over the past decade.</p>
<p>It also includes the details of the ceremonies for two significant awards which Sri Chinmoy received during 1998: the Pilgrim of Peace Award from the International Centre for Peace Among People in Italy and the Corazón de Oro (Heart of Gold) Award from the Society of Authors and Composers of Music of Mexico.</p>
<p>As we approach the New Millennium, Sri Chinmoy continues to travel untiringly from country to country, offering meditations, Peace Concerts, exhibits of his peace-bird drawings and athletic events. Of himself, with utmost humility, he writes,</p>
<p>“I am a peace-collecting pilgrim-soul.”</p>  </div>
