<p>One runner who was doing his first marathon had been told never to stop while drinking water. This is what he learned from the elite runners. When he took a cup of ERG, half went into his eyes and half into his mouth and ears. Then he was apologising to the people who were around him. It came out in an article afterwards.</p>
