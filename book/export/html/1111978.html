<p>During the 20-mile race in Central Park today, one old man was looking at me and telling another old man, "He is the director of the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team!" Then two ladies — not disciples — started calling me, "Guru, Guru!"</p>
<p>The first two miles Prabhir was ahead of Sarama, although she was running and he was walking. She had her jacket around her waist. People were dying and she was carrying extra weight! Then she went ahead of Prabhir.</p>
