<p>Today we have been allowed to use the tennis court at the Bali Beach Hotel. Why? Because the ballboy is a Hindu!</p>
<p>At first when we asked if we could play, he said, "No can play. Last night, many, many rain!"</p>
<p>He told us that his name is Jana. He was very proud that he was a Hindu.</p>
<p>I said, "I am also a Hindu."</p>
<p>Then he was so moved. So he went to the higher authorities and got us permission to play on the court, even though it was still a little bit wet.</p>
