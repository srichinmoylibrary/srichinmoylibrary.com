<p>Courage is the most devoted servant of one’s own faith in oneself and God.</p>
<p>Timidity says, “God is forever unknowable.” Courage says, “God is at present unknown, but only for a while.”</p>
<p>Cowardice is an extra load to carry in the march of your day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Courage is an ever-willing extra porter to carry your wealth, inner and outer, according to your soul’s volition.</p>
<p>Courage is perfection only when it springs from one’s oneness with the vision of God.</p>
<p>There is no other way to please your inner self than to be, yourself, a perfect emblem of courage.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm in its purest expression is courage.</p>
<p>Against one’s inner courage, death itself contends in vain.</p>
<p>Courage is God’s successful inspiration in Man’s body, mind, heart and soul.</p>  </div>
