<p>Perhaps Subhas had some premonition of his early death. On 8 February 1943, just before going on board a German submarine with his aide-de-camp to be taken to a rendezvous with a Japanese submarine off the coast of Madagascar, Subhas was able to send his brother the following note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My dear brother,</p>
<p>Today I am once more embarking on the path of danger. But this time towards home. I may not see the end of the road. If I meet with any such danger, I will not be able to send you any further news in this life. That is why today I am leaving my news here — it will reach you in due time. I have married here and I have a daughter. In my absence please show my wife and daughter the love that you have given me throughout your life. May my wife and daughter complete and successfully fulfil my unfinished tasks — that is my ultimate prayer.</p>
<p>Please accept my pranam and convey the same to Mother....</p>
<p>Your devoted brother,</p>
<p>Subhas"</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
