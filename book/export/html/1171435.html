<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is spiritual. He is a giant, not only physically but spiritually. His name, Mahasamrat, means 'emperor sovereign'. He is not only extremely strong physically, the 'Best Built Man of the Twentieth Century'. Spiritually also, he is very powerful, very strong. People who are very strong spiritually will immediately recognise me spiritually. People who are not spiritually strong will not recognise me the way he has recognised me. As soon as he saw me, he saw my aura. And when I first heard his name in Japan, even though I had never heard about him before — at that time bodybuilding was not my line — the very name 'Bill Pearl' was ringing and ringing inside my heart for hours and days because he is inwardly very strong, a spiritual giant. Both in his inner life and in his outer life, he is a giant.</p>  </div>
