   <div id="node-1079013" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, are You great or good?"</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, betwixt and between.</p>
<p>Son, are you great or good?"</p>
<p>"Fortunately, I am both."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079014" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, when I meditate on You, You give me prolonged applause. When You meditate on me, should I also give You a big hand?"</p>
<p>"No, you mustn't. When I meditate on you, you must maintain all silence to receive and achieve Me."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079015" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, it is a blooming shame that I have to live in an ignorant world."</p>
<p>"Son, don't be a blooming fool. It is you who have created the world around you. I have created only the world within you, My son."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079016" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, I was not born yesterday, hence I know much about Your Divinity."</p>
<p>"Son, I am glad that you know it. Since I was born before you, not only do I know much about Divinity, but also about humanity."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079017" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, do You get joy when You boss us around?"</p>
<p>"No son, I get joy only when I do not have to bother My children."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079018" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, will You please give me a brain-wave so that I can get some inspiration to be really spiritual?"</p>
<p>"Son, you want to have a brain-wave. Good! But you want the wrong wave. Try to grow love-waves and devotion-waves, you will automatically become spiritual."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079019" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, perhaps by this time You know that my love for You is strong."</p>
<p>"Son, perhaps by this time you have felt that My love for you is strong too. Something more, My love for you is constant."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079020" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, I am sorry to tell You that You always defeat me in everything."</p>
<p>"Son, My poor son, don't you know that you have been defeating Me all the time in stark stupidity?"</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079021" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, tell me frankly, do my spiritual children really love me?"</p>
<p>"Son, tell Me secretly, do you unreservedly love them?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Father, I do. If not, I would have begged You, and forced You in Your unconditional Compassion to take me to the other world."</p>
<p>"Son, you are right, you are absolutely right. Now, tell me, when you are in a cheerful frame of mind, what do you think of your children? What do you think of their love?"</p>
<p>"Father, I think they are trying, I feel they are trying."</p>
<p>"Son, I know they are succeeding. I assure you they are succeeding."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079022" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, how is it that I am acting like a beggar? Why do I need my children's love? Is Your Divine Love Infinite not enough for me?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, My son, My Divine Love Infinite is more than enough for you. Unfortunately, you and I are suffering from the same disease, eternally old disease. We want to be loved by our nearest and dearest ones. We want to be loved by our creations."</p>
<p>"Father, please tell me in a few words what love actually means."</p>
<p>"Son, love means complete and perfect oneness and fulfilled reality."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079023" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, I want to be independent."</p>
<p>"That's fine, My son, that's fine with Me. Only don't forget to make Me constantly dependent on your joyous love and gracious concern."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079024" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, You are most compassionate. Why?"</p>
<p>"Son, you are most affectionate. Why?"</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079025" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, I want to understand You."</p>
<p>"Son, then allow Me to surround you."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079026" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, I love to travel."</p>
<p>"Son, I travel to love."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079027" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, when I am angry in my outer life, I criticise You. When I am hungry in my inner life, I invoke You."</p>
<p>"Son, when you are angry, I forgive you, I bless you, and when you are hungry, I love you and feed you."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079028" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, I need Your mightiest ability."</p>
<p>"Son, I need your deepest necessity."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079029" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, I am old. Don't expect much from me."</p>
<p>"Son, since you are My son, I am older than you. Why then do you expect everything from Me?"</p>
<p>"Father, why do You forget that You are God, the Lord Supreme?"</p>
<p>"Son, why do you forget that you are My son, you are My very own?"</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079030" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, do You have the same responsibility as I have?"</p>
<p>"Son, what is your responsibility?"</p>
<p>"I have to speak to so many children."</p>
<p>"Son, you know that I have infinitely more children than you have. Naturally I have to shoulder a little more responsibility than you do."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079031" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, women are careless, and are insincere. What about Yourself?"</p>
<p>"Son, I am forgiving, all-forgiving."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079032" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, a poet-brother of mine said something very beautiful."</p>
<p>"What has he said?"</p>
<p>"He said, 'A thing of beauty is a joy forever'."</p>
<p>"Wonderful. Now son, I am going to tell you something more beautiful: A thing of beauty is the mother and father of Divinity's Light and Reality's Height."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079033" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">21.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, yesterday the whole day I suffered from a serious headache. I prayed and prayed to You to cure me, but You did not listen to my prayer."</p>
<p>"Son, I am sorry. But son, you will be happy to know that I have spent the whole of yesterday in curing your malignant cancer, Doubt, which I have discovered in your mind. An aspirin can take care of your headache, but I am the only one who can take care of your mind."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079034" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">22.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, I really wish to worship You everyday with flowers, but unfortunately nowadays flowers are very expensive."</p>
<p>"Son, I find your surrender infinitely more expensive. I have practically spent all my savings — love, concern and compassion — to buy surrender from you daily."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079035" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, I have the capacity to read Your mind. You are now thinking of my life's bitter frustration."</p>
<p>"Son, I have the necessity to read your mind. You need my constant consolation."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079036" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, are You not proud of me when I speak to so many people all about You?"</p>
<p>"Son, I am proud of you because so many gods and goddesses listen to you."</p>
<p>"But Father, sometimes unlike the divine gods and goddesses, the human gods and goddesses look ugly and dirty."</p>
<p>"But son, you have the capacity to make them clean, tidy, beautiful and soulful."</p>
<p>"Father, You have told me all about my capacities. Now tell me something about Your own capacities."</p>
<p>"Son, I have only one capacity. Everyday I empty your Ignorance-Sea and fill it with My Knowledge-Light."</p>
<p>"Father, I am glad and sorry to tell You that Your one capacity surpasses all my proud capacities."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079037" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, why are You so kind to me?"</p>
<p>"Son, why are you so blind to me?"</p>
<p>"Father, where is Your home?"</p>
<p>"Son, where do you roam?"</p>
<p>"Father, how high do You soar?"</p>
<p>"Son, how often do you roar?"</p>
<p>"Father, I roar when I offer You to humanity."</p>
<p>"Son, I soar when I offer you to Immortality."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079038" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">26.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, You are telling me that still there is plenty of time, and I must not give up. Father, You are fooling me, it is already too late."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079039" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">27.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, I wanted to be a great poet."</p>
<p>"My child, go and make friends with hope. It is not too bad to hope against hope."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079040" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">28.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, why do You want me to be a singer?"</p>
<p>"Son, I want you to be a singer because I feel that if you can sing, then My entire creation will not hesitate to sing."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079041" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">29.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, why don't You want me to be a dancer?"</p>
<p>"Son, there are two reasons why I don't want you to be a dancer: your body's dance will ruin the aspiring mankind; your soul's dance will never be appreciated by the desiring mankind."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079042" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">30.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, why don't You want me to be a scientist?"</p>
<p>"Son, I have already many scientists. I do not need your contribution to add to the lofty discoveries of My scientist-children."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079043" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">31.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, my human ancestors of the hoary past are afraid of my Knowledge-Sun. My divine ancestors of the hoary past are afraid of the Ignorance-Night in front of me. My human ancestors are proud of me because they feel that I am really great. My divine ancestors are proud of me because I am surpassing them."</p>
<p>"Son, I am afraid of you because, on rare occasions, you get angry with Me, and I am proud of you because you always listen to Me."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079044" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">32.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, my predecessors are simply amazed at my Perfection-Dawn. My successors are totally amazed at my Imperfection-Thorn."</p>
<p>"Son, I am silently amazed at your glowing illumination and brooding frustration."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079045" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">33.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, meditation is the most complicated word. Please let me hear from Your lips what meditation is."</p>
<p>"Son, meditation is at first the end of death, and then the breath of death."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079046" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">34.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, I am surprised to see that Your Goal is everywhere."</p>
<p>"Son, no wonder why your Goal is nowhere to be found."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079047" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">35.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, please tell me, when do I actually act like a fool?"</p>
<p>"Son, you act like a great fool when you say that you have no need for Me. You act like a greater fool when you think that I am all Justice. You act like the greatest fool when you think that I am all occupied and have no time to think of you."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079048" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">36.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, please tell me something about the occultists. To be frank with You, I do not care for them. Anyway, I am curious to know from You something about them."</p>
<p>"Son, there are three types of occultists: amateur, professional, and God-Realised. An amateur occultist feeds the sleeping and snoring mankind. A professional occultist feeds the curious and unaspiring mankind. A really spiritual and God-Realised occultist feeds the sincere and aspiring mankind."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079049" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">37.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, excuse me. After all, You have no other choice."</p>
<p>"Excuse Me, son. After all, I am trying to help you."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079050" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">38.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, Light and Darkness are mutually separable. Space and Time are mutually inseparable. The outer fear and the inner courage are always separable."</p>
<p>"Son, I wish to add that your Father and His Compassion are eternally inseparable."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079051" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">39.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, I am sorry to tell You that my fear has already bought my coffin."</p>
<p>"Son, I am sorry to tell you that your doubt is digging your grave."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079052" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">40.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, I am happy to tell You that my aspiration is crying for my Goal."</p>
<p>"Son, I am happy to tell you that your realisation is your only Goal."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079053" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">41.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, You govern my life, that's all. But I not only govern Your Compassionate Indulgence, but also shamelessly demand Your Illumining Forgiveness. At least in the matter of eyeless autocracy I have long surpassed You."</p>
<p>"Son, I don't dare to deny it."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079054" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">42.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, the height of Truth, the height of Love and the height of Compassion, please let me know where they exist."</p>
<p>"Son, the height of Truth is at My Feet. The height of Love is inside My Heart. The height of Compassion is inside My Crown."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079055" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">43.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, when I am Your partner I have all admiration for my will-power."</p>
<p>"Son, and when you are Death's partner, Death has all admiration for your child-like innocence."</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079056" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">44.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, when You command me to make a promise, and then You command me again to break the same promise, each time I please You. But my critics, not knowing the real reason, sneer at me. My enemies mock at me, my well-wishers pity me and my friends avoid me."</p>
<p>"But son, I not only console you, but extol your surrendered heart to My Transcendental Height."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079057" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">45.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, what is wrong with You? Why are You so miserly? Why can't You out of Your Infinite Bounty, empty a little bit of Your Ability into my receptivity's rejection-box?"</p>
<p>"Son, what else have I been doing all along?"</p>
<p>﻿</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079058" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">46.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Sisters and brothers, attention please! My Father is coming to replace me, my ignorance!"</p>
<p>"Children, attention please! My son's impulsive role of explosive ignorance is just over!"</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1079059" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">47.</h1>
  
 
<p>"Father, is there anything I can do to please You constantly?"</p>
<p>"Son, if you can realise that you are of Me in Heaven and for Me on Earth, then you will please Me constantly."</p>
