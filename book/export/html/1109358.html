<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, but you should feel that this conscious effort is not just the result of your physical discipline or mental discipline. No, it has a deeper source. There are many who cannot stop smoking. Why? Because they have not got in touch with their soul's will or the determination of their inner being. It is just an idea to which they are giving some importance; they are giving more importance to one idea than to another. But they are not touching the source, where the tendency can be nullified or negated. It is only in the soul or the inner being that the actual determination can take place. If it comes from there, then easily you can stop smoking. Even if you have been smoking for twenty years, you are going to succeed. Just because you have heard from someone that eating meat is not good, you will not be able to stop eating meat. No, it is impossible. It is just an idea, and another idea will come and fight it. Your determination has to have a connection with a deeper source. The outer mental discipline, the physical or vital discipline, cannot succeed unless and until it is backed by the soul's adamantine will power. So the success that you have achieved in your inner life is all due to your soul's will power; it is not due to your conscious physical effort.</p>  </div>
