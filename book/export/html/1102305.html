<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The United Nations needs most from the Member States a true sense of compassion in the inner world and a true sense of cooperation in the outer world. The sooner the Member States become more self-giving and more cooperative, the sooner world harmony, world peace and world-satisfaction will come into being.</p>  </div>
