<p>This evening, at about 5:30, I went out for a run. When I crossed my 800-metre mark, I saw a tall, black girl wearing an absolutely flamboyant outfit. She was running quite fast towards me. She started screaming, "Hi!" When she screamed, "Hi!" to me, I asked myself, "Who is she? She is not one of my disciples, but she is speaking to me as if she knows me quite well." I was guarded because I did not know her at all. Perhaps she was happy to see another runner.</p>
