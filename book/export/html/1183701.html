<p>In October 1988, when I was in Washington to meditate at the Pentagon, I visited Atmatyagi’s little school. Although the school was at that time smaller than the smallest, I said that the lofty vision that it embodies will one day cover the length and breadth of the world. I gave it the name ‘Oneness-Family-School’. I answered questions from the children and did some drawings with crayons.</p>
<p>When I was that age, I was very, very restless, plus I was what you call naughty. I used to pinch my elder brothers and sisters. Sometimes my mother caught me red-handed! But just a few tears in her eyes and I used to stop immediately. Her tears had infinite power.</p>  </div>
