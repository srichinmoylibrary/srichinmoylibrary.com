<p>I said to Nolini-da: "Yesterday at the playground you told us that you were sharing with us your last life experience. I was so sorry to hear that."</p>
<p>"Tell me, what else do I have to write? Have I not completed my life-story?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so. You have not told us about your sports life in your younger days. I have heard so many stories about you as a great football player."</p>
<p>"I see, I see. But you know that in those days there was neither <em>Mohan Bagan</em> nor <em>East Bengal</em> to inspire us. Anyway, I shall try to write about my football and sports capacity."</p>  </div>
