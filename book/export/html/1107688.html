<p><em>University of Massachusetts; Amherst, Massachusetts, USA</em><br /><em>24 April 1970</em></p>
<p>He who does not aspire thinks that Immortality is an impossibility. He who aspires feels that Immortality is a sure possibility. He who has realised God knows that Immortality is an absolute reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ ‘Impossible!’ That is not good French,” says Napoleon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“ ‘Impossible!’ That is not good self-discovery.” This is what I say. Today’s self-discovery is tomorrow’s Immortality.</p>
<p>It is good to be immortal, but it is infinitely better to be divine. Socrates said something quite memorable: “All men’s souls are immortal, but the souls of the righteous are both immortal and divine.”</p>
<p>If Divinity looms large inside Immortality, then only can reality be all-embracing, all-sustaining and all-fulfilling.</p>
<p>The outer life is humanity. The inner life is Immortality. The life around is reality. The life above is Divinity. The life below is obscurity.</p>
<p>When Divinity descends into humanity, the soul of humanity becomes hopeful. When Divinity descends into Immortality, the soul of Immortality becomes meaningful. When Divinity enters into reality, the soul of reality becomes fruitful. When Divinity enters into obscurity, the soul of obscurity becomes prayerful.</p>
<p>God inspires man with His immortal Inspiration. Man realises God with his immortal self-consecration. God meditates on man for his immortal perfection. Man meditates on God for His immortal Manifestation.</p>
<p>To copy others is an act of stupidity. To copy oneself is an act of absurdity. To imitate God is to imitate Immortality. When we imitate God, our life of imagination ends and our life of realisation dawns.</p>
<p>How can we imitate God when we do not know who God is? God is the Man Divine, supremely inspiring there in Heaven and supremely sacrificing here on earth.</p>
<p>What is Immortality? Immortality is the Consciousness divine that eternally grows and endlessly flows. While growing, it reaches God the Transcendental; while flowing, it reaches God the Universal.</p>
<p>The body says, “Life is but pressure.” The vital says, “Life is but pleasure.” The mind says, “Life is the homeland of ideas.” The heart says, “Life is the homeland of ideals.” The soul says, “Life is the homeland of experiences.” God says, “Life is the homeland of Immortality.”</p>
<p>Mother Earth symbolises human aspiration. Hence, it is a woman in the Upanishads, Maitreyi, who teaches humanity the highest aspiration towards God: “Of what use to me are things that do not make me immortal?”</p>
<p>Let us be inseparably one with Maitreyi and feel that mortality’s binding consciousness is bound to be flooded with the boundless consciousness of Immortality.</p>
<p>O aspiring man, go deep within. Listen to God whisper, “My child, you are good. Therefore, I have made you My Infinity’s Heart. My child, you are nice. Therefore, I have made you My Eternity’s Breath. My child, you are great. Therefore, I have made you My Immortality’s Life.”</p>  </div>
