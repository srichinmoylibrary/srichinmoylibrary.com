<p>Adversity tells me<br /> God has to be sought,<br /> God has to be caught.<br /> How?<br /> By becoming more vigilant.<br /> Prosperity tells me<br /> God has come to me;<br /> I don't have to go to God.<br /> God has already fed me;<br /> I am sure<br /> He does not expect<br /> Anything in return.<br /> What He really wants from me<br /> Is a satisfaction-smile<br /> From Perfection-sun.</p>
