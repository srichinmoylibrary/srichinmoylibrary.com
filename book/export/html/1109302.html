<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly! By chanting AUM, you can easily reveal inner and outer perfection, for AUM embodies the highest height and the deepest depth. AUM embodies Universal Consciousness, Transcendental Consciousness. AUM is the embodiment of God the Creator, God the Preserver and God the Transformer. God as the highest Creator, the best Preserver and the most powerful Transformer of your ignorance-life, is within you. By chanting AUM and invoking Him, you can embody and reveal perfect perfection in your life and in the life around you.</p>  </div>
