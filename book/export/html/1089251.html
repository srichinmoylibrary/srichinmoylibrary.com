<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They look to me and bow to the Supreme. I always tell them: everybody's Master is God, and this Master is inside me and inside you. When they bow to me, I know who is getting it — it is the Supreme in me — and when I bow to you, I know who is getting it — the Supreme in you. Not to me, not to the body, not to Sri Chinmoy but to the Inner Pilot of Sri Chinmoy they bow, and I bow to the Inner Pilot of their own existence.</p>  </div>
