<p>Always I go to the airport early to buy things or to eat. On the trip to India, I ate so much and gained four or five pounds. This time I went to a restaurant in the Bombay airport to have a little juice and some Horlicks, a hot drink.The man told me the price-five dollars. Indian rupees they do not accept-only American dollars or British pounds. I had Indian currency, but the only American currency I thought I had was a hundred-dollar bill. So before I ate, I asked the man if he would be able to give me change.</p>
<p>The man said, "Yes, easily!"</p>
<p>When it was time to pay, I looked in my bag and found both a hundred-dollar and a twenty-dollar bill. I said, "I can give you a twenty-dollar bill."</p>
<p>The man said, "No, you give me the hundred-dollar bill. I will be able to give you change."</p>
<p>He took the hundred-dollar bill, and then he gave me a ten-dollar bill in return. He was looking for more money, but be had only three one-dollar bills.I said, "Give me back my hundred-dollar bill and take my twenty-dollar bill." What kind of rogue God created! He said I hadn't given him a hundred-dollar bill. He said I had only given him the twenty.</p>
<p>My blood boiled! I said, "I am calling the police!" and started to walk away.Then he gave me my hundred dollars back. I had got thirteen dollars from him in change, and he was supposed to give me two more dollars, but I just called him a rogue and threw my twenty dollars at him.</p>
<p>Then I left the place, absolutely furious. Even now when I tell the story, I feel such disgust for rogues like this.</p>
