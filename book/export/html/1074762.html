<p>Are you a favourite daughter of God?<br />   Then you need nothing, absolutely nothing,<br /> Either from Heaven or from earth.</p>
<p>Are you a favourite daughter of God?<br />   Then feel that your Lord<br /> Is not only within your soul-boat<br />   But also of your life-river.</p>
<p>Are you a favourite daughter of God?<br />   If you think that your Father does everything for you,<br /> Then you are mistaken.</p>
<p>If you feel that your Father will do everything for you,<br />   Then you are mistaken.<br /> If you feel that He has already done everything for you,<br />   Then you are right, absolutely right.</p>
<p>Indeed, He had done everything for you<br />   Long before your soul came into the field of manifestation.<br />   You just become in the life of your heart<br /> What you eternally are in His Soul:<br />   His, only His.</p>
