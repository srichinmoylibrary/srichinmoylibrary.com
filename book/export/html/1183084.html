<p>A well-known swimmer came into her life. She wanted to marry him and she was also greatly influenced by a very close friend of hers to marry this swimmer. But the Master did not like the idea. The Master said, “You will swim in the sea of ignorance. ”</p>
<p>She said to the Master, “Your sea of wisdom has not given me any satisfaction. Let me at least try to swim in the sea of ignorance and see if it is really so bad.”</p>
<p>She left the Master, but by God’s Grace and the Master’s concern, she became disappointed in the swimmer. Finally she left him to go back to her old boyfriend, who was a married man with three children.</p>  </div>
