<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some of you have asked me for a spiritual name, your soul's name, and I have given it to you. When you repeat your own soul's name, I assure you that you will be able to bring to the fore all your divine qualities; you will be energised with your soul's divine power. You can do this if you don't care to repeat 'AUM' or 'Supreme'.</p>
<p>But just by repeating your own name, the name given to you by your parents, you will not achieve anything. Western names do not have the mantric quality of Sanskrit words. If you go on repeating your American name, nothing divine will happen from that. But if you slowly repeat your spiritual name just ten times, a new and fruitful consciousness will dawn in you. The divine qualities of your own soul will come to the fore.</p>  </div>
