<p><em>(Shanker Chetty's house. Some months later. Aurobindo in a room on the top floor. Moni and Bijoy.)</em></p>
<p>MONI: You have fasted for the last 23 days. When are you going to stop it?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(With a smile)</em> To-day.</p>
<p>MONI: To-day! What shall we prepare for you?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Nothing special. Normal food.</p>
<p>BIJOY: All your ways are strange. How was it possible for you to carry on your eight-hour walk, your literary activity and meditation, every day with no omission of any item during such a long fast? May I know? And now instead of starting with bits of fruit and suchlike things you'll take a full normal meal!</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Do Yoga and you will understand. You are aware that in the Alipore jail I fasted for ten days. I was then in the thick of Yogic practices. No doubt, I began losing weight. But I could easily lift above my head a big pail of water, which I could not do before.</p>
<p>MONI: Is it ever possible to prolong life without food?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Certainly.</p>
<p>MONI: But how?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: By drawing energy from the Vital Plane instead of depending on the physical elements and nourishment.</p>
<p>MONI: I shall try it. Bijoy, do you want to follow me?</p>
<p>BIJOY: Most gladly, and by all means. But first you come out successful. After all, life is very precious.</p>
<p>MONI: Not for nothing did Rabindranath sing, <em>"Ekla Chalo Re"</em> ["Walk your way alone"].</p>
<p>BIJOY: But not for long are you to walk alone. I shall dog you the moment I see a particle of success in your risky adventure.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(With a smile)</em> Moni, it seems you are putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p><em>(Bijoy bursts into a roar of laughter. Moni looks crestfallen.)</em></p>  </div>
