<p>My mother’s faith was always in her worship, in God, never in doctors. Whenever anybody in the family was sick, my sisters and brothers were responsible for calling the doctor and nursing the patient. My mother would immediately go into the temple. Day and night she would pray, but she would hardly come to see the patient. She was with her God, inside the temple, praying because she did not believe in medicine. She was worried like anything, but she thought that medicine could not help; only her prayer to God and God’s Compassion would cure us.</p>  </div>
