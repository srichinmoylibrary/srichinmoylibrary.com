<p>Who will read my poems?<br /> Man? Never!<br /> Since he has so many<br /> Important things to do,<br /> I just forgive him.</p>
<p>Who will read my poems?<br /> God? Why not?<br /> He has to,<br /> Since it is He who<br /> Has written all these poems<br /> In and through me.</p>
<p>Naturally He has to<br /> And<br /> He always does,<br /> Carefully,<br /> Lovingly,<br /> Cheerfully.</p>
