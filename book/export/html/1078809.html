  <h1 class="book-heading">Gratitude</h1>
  
 
<p>We are grateful to God, for He is with us here and now. We are grateful to God, for He has created within us a genuine hunger for Him. We are grateful to God, for He has given us a long express train of hope. We are grateful to God, for He has repeatedly told us that He will keep His promise. What is His promise? His promise is that He will not be satisfied unless and until each creation of His satisfies Him in His own way.</p>
<p>How can we please God in His own way? First of all, we are now aware of God's way of operating. Also, we may feel that something will please God, but how can we know if we are correct in our feelings, or whether it is all mental hallucination? There is a way to know whether we are pleasing God in God's own way. We have to dive deep within and destroy or transform the thought-world and replace it with will power, adamantine will power. If we are afraid of God's Will Power, which is all-powerful, then our life will always remain in untold fear.</p>
<p>We are on earth, here and now, only to please God in God's own way. It is a difficult task indeed, but we get joy only when we cross hurdles. If we do not cross hurdles, then there will be no lasting reality and there will be no lasting satisfaction. If we do not do everything here and now, then there will be no satisfaction whatsoever, for today's goal is only the beginning of tomorrow's new journey. This new journey and the journey's goal will come and greet us, for the achievements of the soul and the journey's goal are inseparable.</p>
<p>When we cry with gratitude, it is the journey's soul that acts in and through us, which is a splendid achievement. And when we smile with gratitude, it is the journey's goal that has become one with aspiration's starting point and with aspiration's ever-transcending horizon.</p>
