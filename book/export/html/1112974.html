<h2>Question: Does God create at the animal level?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, He does. God Himself is in the process of ever-transcending perfection. It is He Himself who becomes the animal and it is He who will become the man. God wants to experience Himself through various forms of manifestation. A potter, when he makes a pot, changes the shape constantly until it reaches a standard that satisfies him. Similarly, God is perfecting Himself through the animal kingdom as well as through humanity, because He Himself is the Spirit which has descended into all matter. This is His divine Game.</p>  </div>
