<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you become proud when you wear your Attendant's uniform, then your consciousness is bound to descend. But while wearing your uniform, if you feel that you are getting an added opportunity to remind yourself of your unreserved devotedness to the Will of the Supreme, then your consciousness is bound to ascend and receive ever-increasing and ever-illumining light.</p>  </div>
