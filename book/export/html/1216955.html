<p>I was supposed to play the organ at St. Peter's Basilica, but at the last minute Kulai cancelled the appointment because he thought that I would not get there on time. Fortunately, they were able to reschedule the appointment.</p>
<p>People were already gathering for the mass when I started to play, so there was no time for me to meditate or anything. I was fighting against the clock.</p>
<p>While I was playing, sunlight was shining on a framed picture of a dove. It was very beautiful.</p>
<p>The priest who was observing me was stiffness incarnate. He was watching to see if I was going to break the organ. After five minutes he placed his hand on my shoulder, indicating that it was time for me to stop so they could begin the mass. The mass lasted for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>The man in charge said I could play for as long as I wanted when the mass ended. He was so kind to me. I played for fifteen minutes. Afterwards, he thanked me and said, "Bravo, bravo!"</p>
