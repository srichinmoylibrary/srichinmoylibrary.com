<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soulâ€™s face is infinitely more beautiful than the physical face and it need not look like the physical face. Again, if the soul wants to take the form of the physical, it does. It can take any form, but it is always infinitely more beautiful than the physical.</p>  </div>
