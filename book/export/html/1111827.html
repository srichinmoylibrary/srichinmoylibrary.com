<p>Towards the end of today's 20-kilometre race in Eisenhower Park, a little boy said to me, "The street is yours."</p>
<p>He was telling me that I could run on the street, but I went onto the sidewalk and continued my running there.</p>
<p>At one point we took a wrong turn, but Niriha saved us and told us the correct way. She was there videotaping my running.</p>
