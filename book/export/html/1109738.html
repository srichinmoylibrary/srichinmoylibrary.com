<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ask your conscience. If the person is a real beggar, if he is blind or crippled, then you can give if you are inspired to do so. But if you suspect that someone just does not want to work and he has taken to begging as the easiest job, then why should you give him your hard-earned money?</p>  </div>
