<p>Since there were no shops open in Berlin when I went out walking this morning, I went into the hotel shop when I came back. I bought a magazine.</p>
<p>Then I saw a sweater that cost 1,000 marks. I said, "Expensive!"</p>
<p>The saleslady said, "First of all, it is expensive. Second, it is for ladies!"The sweater was not in the men's section.</p>
