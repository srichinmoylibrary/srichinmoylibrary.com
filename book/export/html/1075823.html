<p><em>(1923. Pondicherry. Sri Aurobindo's residence.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter T.V. Kapali Sastri, an eminent Sanskrit scholar of South India)</em></p>
<p>KAPALI: <em>(Bowing his head to Sri Aurobindo)</em> Sir, six years back when I first came to you I asked you about India's possibilities and you gave me an inspiring answer, 'not possibility but certainty.' This time you are giving me another inspiring thing â€” your golden complexion. It is no longer deep brown as before. In you, Yoga incarnate carries now its true complexion.</p>
<p>Now I have come, my mind made up once for all, to throw myself at your feet and upon your Grace for ever. Pray, how should I proceed in the first step of your Yoga?</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: My Yoga aims at transformation of the whole being, not excluding the physical.</p>
<p>KAPALI: How and where to begin?</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: One has to bring the Divine Consciousness right down into the very cells.</p>
<p>KAPALI: Too difficult even to think of. But I cannot try the too-hard so soon. I repeat, I throw myself at your feet and upon your Grace, now and for ever. Do with me as you please.</p>
<p><em>(Sri Aurobindo gives a gracious smile and a nodding assent. With a parting pranam Kapali leaves the Master's presence, profoundly happy.)</em></p>  </div>
