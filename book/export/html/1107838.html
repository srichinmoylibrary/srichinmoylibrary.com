<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day, early in the morning, I concentrate on each of my dedicated and devoted disciples. Those who are my true disciples are fully aware of the fact, but I am sorry to say that a few of you disappoint me mercilessly with your emotional and other problems. So I ask you, for your sake, for my sake, for the Supreme's sake, please try to purify your vital world. I will become most divinely proud of each of my spiritual children. My disciples have to become very sincere, dedicated and responsible in their emotional lives as well as in their spiritual lives. I am not scolding you, but if the emotional life is not transformed, then the spiritual life, the true divine life, will only be a kind of self-deception. There can be no God-realisation.</p>
<p>Emotion itself is not bad; it is how you use emotion. Emotion has to be transformed into divine emotion. If you are using it for self-indulgence, then you will ruin your aspiration. But if you use it for your liberation and self-illumination, then emotion is your strongest power.</p>
<p>Let us use our emotion for liberation, for self-illumination. Let us fully purify our vital world. If the vital is dirty, then in the spiritual world we act like a mad elephant. A mad elephant will never reach the goal; it will only run from this side to that. I am trying my utmost to please you in your inner life, so I would be most grateful if you could try also to please me in the inner life, especially in the vital world.</p>  </div>
