<h2>Question: When the aspirant decides to follow a spiritual path, is this human opportunity, divine opportunity, or both?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the aspirant decides to follow a spiritual path, it is not a human opportunity; it is a divine opportunity. More than that, it is a supreme opportunity. Human opportunity once lost is lost forever. Divine opportunity comes and goes and goes and comes. The supreme opportunity has the magnetic pull to lift the seeker to the highest plane of consciousness.</p>  </div>
