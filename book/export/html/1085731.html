<p><em>(Vishwamitra is invoking Saraswati. Enter Saraswati.)</em></p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Saraswati, you have deceived me. You have deceived me! Now you deserve punishment. I shall destroy you. No. Just by destroying you I won t get enough satisfaction. I shall degrade you. I shall dishonour you. Everybody says your water is extremely pure. Everybody drinks your water. I am going to turn your water into blood. Nobody will ever drink your water again. It will be disgusting-all red.</p>
<p>SARASWATI: My water, my existence, will be all red?</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Yes, everybody will loathe you. Nobody will come near you. Nobody will dare to touch your water. Nobody will ever want to look at you.</p>  </div>
