<p>In this life there will be a few things that the 1,000-mile runners will never be able to forget. This 1,000-mile race is one of them.</p>
<p>The runners will feel sad today that the race is over and that they are not on the course running. The handlers will feel happy.</p>
<p>We do not have much money-power, but we have heart-power. Other organisations may have so much money and thousands of people. But money-power does not work and man-power does not work. It is with our heart-power that we put on the 1,000-mile race.</p>
