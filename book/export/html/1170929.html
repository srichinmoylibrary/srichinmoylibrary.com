<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The human in me at every moment is bored. The divine in me will never be bored. The human in me sees everything as uninspiring, unchanging, unenthusiastic, unprogressive. Therefore, the human in me is bored. But the divine in me is never bored because the divine in me sees in everything, in every person, at every moment, not only a new possibility of hope but also a promise, and this promise comes from the divine Source: our Lord Beloved Supreme.</p>  </div>
