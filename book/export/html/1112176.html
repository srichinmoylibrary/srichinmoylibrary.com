<p>The other day I walked six miles. After two miles I entered into a small grocery store and bought a Snapple, an Orangina and a corn muffin. They put it all in a paper bag.</p>
<p>When I was near Suradhuni's bakery on my way back, I said to myself, "Let me have some fun with the bakery."</p>
<p>I had eaten a little more than half the muffin. The rest I put in the brown bag, which I left in front of the bakery door. I said, "If Suradhuni or Pratibha come, they will be blessed with my prasad."</p>
<p>I was hoping that they would be in tune with my consciousness and take it. But my hope was not fulfilled. Pratibha came first, and she thought the paper bag with the muffin was left by some vagabond or hooligan. So she threw it away.</p>
<p>Later I called to give them my "blessings." Suradhuni was absolutely innocent, so she escaped my blessings. But Pratibha I scolded to my heart's content!</p>
<p>Once, many years ago, I had left a hat for Lavanya on top of the water bottle she had hidden for herself along her running route. I laid the hat out very nicely, so I was hoping she would know I had left it for her.</p>
<p>Afterwards, she said she thought the hat might have come from me. But part of her was afraid it might have been left by some bad person, who might have also drunk from her water.</p>
<p>So she left both the hat and the water.</p>
