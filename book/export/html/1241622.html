<p>For the last few days, I have been practising my cello in front of the middle door. I sit there because of these two great, divine dogs!</p>
<p>As soon as I come down from upstairs, they open their eyes and start crying. But if I sit in front of the middle door, they do not see me. So they do not cry.</p>
<p>It is all right with them if they hear the cello. As long as they do not see me, they do not cry.</p>
