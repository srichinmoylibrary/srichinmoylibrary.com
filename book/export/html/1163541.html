<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to say that it is through inner cry that you raise your consciousness, and in order to maintain your highest consciousness you have to establish considerable purity in the vital. First, with your inner cry, with your aspiration, you go up. Then how do you remain stationed there? It is through purity in the vital that you will be able to stay there for good.</p>  </div>
