<p>Along one of my running routes a little girl of five or six and her father were entering into a car. The father was getting into the driver's side and the daughter was getting in the other side. As I ran by, the daughter said, "Hi, Guru!"</p>
<p>The father said to her, "Call him by his real name: Sri Chinmoy." Then he said to me, "I have no objection to her calling you 'Guru', but I just wanted her to know your real name. We have some tenants who always talk about you."</p>
