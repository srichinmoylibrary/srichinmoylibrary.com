<p>In an instrument store in Kyoto, I was looking at an expensive trumpet. The shopkeeper was laughing at me because I couldn't play it. Usually the Japanese don't laugh like that!</p>
<p>Then I went away and came back again. As soon as he saw me, the man started laughing again. I said, "I am going to get the sound." Finally I made some sound and he was so happy. Then I bought it.</p>
