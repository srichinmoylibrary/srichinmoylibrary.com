<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you work beyond your capacity, at that time you are tired mentally and vitally. Then if you continue to work just for the sake of extra hours, you will ruin everything. So the best thing is to stop. Work devotedly, soulfully, for three hours or five hours or seven hours, and then give up. Otherwise, what is the use of going on and on and making mistakes? When your concentration falls and you get tired, this is the time to give up. Then, try to develop receptivity. Pray and meditate so that you can work for a few hours more; try to develop the capacity to work more.</p>  </div>
