<p><em>(Darjeeling. Benoy, Mano and Auro are returning from school. On the way they happen to meet a Sannyasin. Many people have gathered about him. He smokes profusely.)</em></p>
<p>A VILLAGER: Sadhuji, please give me some religious knowledge.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: All I can give you is a bit of advice. I am afraid, although my advice will reach your sceptic ears, you will never apply it in the practical field. <em>(Some of the villagers burst into a peal of laughter.)</em> My advice, you know? The world is an illusion. Have no link with it!</p>
<p>A MERCHANT: Be pleased to read my palm.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: You, you wallow in the pleasure of wealth. Am I right?</p>
<p>MERCHANT: Absolutely perfect. But, Sadhuji, I have not seen the face of peace even for a fleeting second.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: Ah, peace! peace is not to take birth here in this world. It is the offspring of another world. This world is made of din, dust and dizzying demonstrations.</p>
<p>MANMOHAN: Please run your eyes over my palm, and drop a few hints about my years to come.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: Ah, a poet, a fine poet. This is what your future says.</p>
<p>MANOMOHAN: <em>(Pointing at Auro)</em> And how does the fate of my younger brother run?</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: <em>(Looking ahead he meets Aurobindo's curious eyes; and in the twinkling of an eye sprints off.)</em> His future is at his command.</p>
<p>MANMOHAN: Only a few days back Auro composed a beautiful poem on Kanchanjunga. The teachers have appreciated it greatly.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: No wonder, he is not a common boy. He will be a great Yogi who has to play a great part on the world scene! Brahman! Brahman! O Lord of my breath, Thou art verily Thy unfathomable mystery.</p>  </div>
