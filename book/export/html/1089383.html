<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When one's kundalini is awakened, one becomes conscious of his inner psychic power, but this does not mean he is realising God. God-realisation is infinitely superior to the awakening of the kundalini and infinitely more fulfilling. When one's kundalini is awakened, one feels the inner vibration and inner power at his command. But this inner power does not mean the infinite Peace, Light and Bliss of the Supreme.</p>
<p>When the kundalini is awakened, it is like having a penknife with which one can do various things. But when one realises God, one feels that he has the capacity to use the atom bomb. When one realises God, his divine consciousness bursts into the earth's atmosphere and spreads over all, the length and breadth of the world. But when the kundalini is awakened, one has only limited power. After the awakening of the kundalini, one sees the limitation of kundalini power. Then one wants to go high, higher, highest and naturally one will march on until the infinite Goal is realised.</p>  </div>
