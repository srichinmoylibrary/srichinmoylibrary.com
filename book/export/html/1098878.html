<p>Those were the poverty-stricken days! On three or four occasions, at night, I went to Bloomingdale’s to try to get extra work carrying heavy boxes and unloading the delivery trucks. At first they would not give me a job because they thought I was not strong enough. Then they said to me, “You are strong, but you need a social security number before we can hire you.”</p>
<p>Poor me! If you work at the Indian Consulate, you do not get a social security number because the Indian Government takes responsibility for you. And I did not have a green card either. So I could not get work at Bloomingdale’s. I could not become a porter to carry boxes from one place to another just so that I could earn a little extra money. O God, O God!</p>  </div>
