<p>Yesterday I was walking to Circus practice. As I was passing my mile-and-a-half point, near the St. John's University tennis courts, all of a sudden I heard my name: "Sri Chinmoy!" A man who was playing on the courts was greeting me through the fence. He had come to pick up his ball and saw me walking by. He said to me, "You look so smart!" I was walking very smartly.</p>
<p>I do not know who he was. I couldn't see his face.</p>
