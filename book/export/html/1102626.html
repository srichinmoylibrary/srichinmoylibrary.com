<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Joy, spontaneity and self-giving always go together. If you have a joyful and spontaneous heart, that means you also possess a self-giving heart. Self-giving is the hyphen or connecting link between joy and spontaneity. Again, inside joy you will find spontaneity and self-giving.</p>
<p>You ask how you can become self-giving? You can become self-giving by constantly feeling joy in every part of your existence, from the soles of your feet to the crown of your head. If you can feel that a river of spontaneous joy is flowing in and through you, then automatically you become self-giving in whatever you say, do or grow into.</p>
