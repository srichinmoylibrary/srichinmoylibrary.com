  <h1 class="book-heading">The soul</h1>
  
 
<p>Each soul is not only an important page in the Book of Fate, but also essential to it, for without it the Book must needs be incomplete.</p>
<p>Each soul is a representative and a presentation of the Supreme on earth. When the representative is recognised by its owner, the presentation fulfils itself in the Supreme.</p>
<p>The soul comes into birth for experience. And its experience will be complete when it brings down all the perfection of the Divine into Matter.</p>
<p>God touches Matter. Lo, the miracle of miracles: the psychic being comes into existence. Earth-consciousness is the Mother of the child, which develops into an individuality perfected and guided by the Supreme Himself.</p>
<p>The psychic being stores up the quintessence of past experiences and it has very little to do with form and personality.</p>
<p>The Promised Land is for him who perpetually lives in the widening pastures of the soul.</p>
<p>Selfless emotion has an appreciable function of its own. When it knocks, the psychic being cannot help opening the door.</p>
<p>Whenever our soul gets the opportunity of breaking open the door of our ignorance, it speaks in silence to our wakeful mind: "Think not of today's failure, but concentrate on tomorrow's victory."</p>
<p>The smile of our soul is the inner strength given to our life to brave the buffets of unavoidable adversity.</p>
<p>The vital can sit at most at the foot of the mountain; the mind near the top of the mountain; the soul sits right on the peak.</p>
<p>In the relation between the human soul and the Divine soul, the former embraces, the Latter blesses.</p>
<p>Our sleeping mind feels God as an inexpressible sigh. Our soul feels God as an unexpressed All-Loving Smile.</p>
