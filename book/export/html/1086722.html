<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is definitely God's Will. If Sri Chinmoy's disciples become more sincere, more devoted and more surrendered to the Will of God inside Sri Chinmoy, Sri Chinmoy's work, which is actually God's work and not his own, will spread Light throughout the length and breadth of the world.</p>  </div>
