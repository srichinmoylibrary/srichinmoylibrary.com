<p>Every morning and evening<br /> I am determined to sing and dance<br /> On the highest peak<br /> Of my sun-flooded aspiration-mountain.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186951" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1302</h1>
  
 

<p>If you are serious<br /> In your surrender-life,<br /> Then the precious panorama<br /> Of perfection<br /> Cannot remain a far cry.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186952" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1303</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> How can I satisfy You<br /> All the time?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> Just ask your mind<br /> To walk forward<br /> Slowly and steadily.<br /> Just ask your heart<br /> To dive inward<br /> Speedily and unreservedly.<br /> That is all.<br /> This is the only way<br /> You can please Me all the time."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186953" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1304</h1>
  
 

<p>I do not think of my mind.<br /> I do not even allow my mind<br /> To think of anything.<br /> I just think of my Lord Supreme.<br /> And what does He do?<br /> He smilingly and lovingly<br /> Takes care of me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186954" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1305</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> My love is love<br /> Only in You.<br /> Even my human love<br /> Is immediately transformed<br /> Into divine love.<br /> And my human love<br /> Is all for You.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186955" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1306</h1>
  
 

<p>Yesterday<br /> You descended in your inner running.<br /> But today<br /> Again you are climbing up<br /> Once more to give immense joy<br /> To your Lord Supreme<br /> And bring Him divine glory.<br /> Therefore<br /> Your Lord Supreme is extremely proud<br /> Of your heart<br /> And divinely grateful<br /> To your soul.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186956" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1307</h1>
  
 

<p>When hope and he parted company,<br /> He completely lost<br /> His forward thinking mind<br /> And his upward seeking heart<br /> In life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186957" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1308</h1>
  
 

<p>In my case,<br /> Failure comes quite spontaneously<br /> Before my success.<br /> Therefore, when failure comes first,<br /> I never pay any attention to it.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186958" class="section-2">

<p>Realisation-fruit entirely depends<br /> On our expectation-flowers.<br /> Expectation-flowers entirely depend<br /> On our patience-trees.</p>

<div id="node-1186959" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1310</h1>
  
 

<p>All your Lord's<br /> Life-illumining Requests<br /> Are written in letters of gold<br /> On the golden tablet of your heart.<br /> There He sees<br /> Whether or not<br /> You are truly obeying Him<br /> And pleasing Him.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186960" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1311</h1>
  
 

<p>Unlit humanity<br /> Thinks only of what it had,<br /> Its past glories.<br /> It does not think<br /> Of today's aspiration-cry<br /> And tomorrow's dedication-smile.<br /> It is completely bound<br /> To yesterday's stagnation-life-pool.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186961" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1312</h1>
  
 

<p>You may feel<br /> That you are a hopeless seeker.<br /> But you will be saved<br /> By the sincere pangs of remorse<br /> That torture your heart<br /> The very moment<br /> You do anything wrong.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186962" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1313</h1>
  
 

<p>Inwardly and outwardly<br /> Our Beloved Supreme has proved<br /> That He is right.<br /> But you are deliberately,<br /> Consciously, stupidly and unpardonably<br /> Trying to prove<br /> That our Beloved Supreme is wrong.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186963" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1314</h1>
  
 

<p>God will definitely prove His Worth<br /> Before long.<br /> You just ask your wiseacre mind<br /> To accept God on a trial basis!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186964" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1315</h1>
  
 

<p>It takes only a fleeting moment<br /> To faithfully remind yourself every day<br /> Of your inner resolutions,<br /> Which are nothing other than<br /> Your soulful promises<br /> To your Beloved Supreme.<br /> And these promises<br /> Are not only for today,<br /> But for as long<br /> As your aspiration remains unfulfilled.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186965" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1316</h1>
  
 

<p>If your Lord Supreme scolds you,<br /> Your divine attitude will immediately say:<br /> "I failed,<br /> But please let me try again!<br /> Please give me another chance<br /> To please You,<br /> To please You in Your own Way!"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186966" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1317</h1>
  
 

<p>If you send your heart-letter to God<br /> With insufficient faith-postage,<br /> How do you expect it<br /> To reach God's Home?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186967" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1318</h1>
  
 

<p>His is the Inspiration-Light<br /> That will help<br /> The hearts of sincere seekers<br /> No matter in whose boat<br /> They are sailing<br /> Towards the destined Goal.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186968" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1319</h1>
  
 

<p>Whoever can<br /> Soulfully and powerfully<br /> Smile the oneness-smile<br /> Before the game,<br /> During the game<br /> And after the game<br /> Is undoubtedly the real winner.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186969" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1320</h1>
  
 

<p>You want your Beloved Supreme<br /> To write to you,<br /> But how can His Letter reach you<br /> When you have not given Him<br /> Your proper address:<br /> Your heart's<br /> Love-devotion-surrender-home?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186970" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1321</h1>
  
 

<p>He perfectly knows<br /> That each cent he gives<br /> Gladly, cheerfully, soulfully,<br /> Unreservedly and unconditionally<br /> To mankind<br /> Is his love-offering<br /> To his Lord Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186971" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1322</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Your unconditional Grace<br /> Has given me the Himalayan height<br /> In the inner world.<br /> Now can Your Grace not give me<br /> The larger-than-the-largest heart<br /> In the outer world?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186972" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1323</h1>
  
 

<p>My mind invited me<br /> To come and stay a few days<br /> In its guest house.<br /> Alas, I accepted its invitation<br /> Only to meet with utter frustration.<br /> My frustration embarrassed my mind<br /> And awakened it from ignorance-sleep.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186973" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1324</h1>
  
 

<p>God is an eternal Child<br /> Playing with His friends<br /> In the world-garden.<br /> He has established His Oneness<br /> With His creation<br /> To such an extent<br /> That He does not mind<br /> If all His children<br /> Are playing different games.<br /> In fact, He enjoys it most<br /> When His children play<br /> The game of multiplicity<br /> Inside the heart-home of unity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186974" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1325</h1>
  
 

<p>Why did God aspire?<br /> He aspired to transform His Vision<br /> Into His Reality.<br /> He was successful.<br /> He aspired to transform His Revelation<br /> Into His Manifestation.<br /> He was again successful.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186975" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1326</h1>
  
 

<p>God can help you only twice:<br /> Once when your heart's cry<br /> Is sincere,<br /> And once when your mind's smile<br /> Is sincere.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186976" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1327</h1>
  
 

<p>God's Justice-Bank<br /> May one day go bankrupt,<br /> But His Compassion-Forgiveness-Bank<br /> Will never go bankrupt.<br /> This is the joint realisation<br /> Of Heaven and earth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186977" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1328</h1>
  
 

<p>God was with His creation<br /> When it started,<br /> He is with it now,<br /> And throughout His endless Future<br /> He will always remain —<br /> Whether wanted or not —<br /> A permanent Member of His creation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186978" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1329</h1>
  
 

<p>Who makes progress?<br /> A child.<br /> He has hope, he has promise.<br /> He looks forward and upward.<br /> God is the eternal Child<br /> Because His Vision is constantly<br /> Transcending Itself.<br /> God with His Vision is constantly<br /> Moving forward, flying upward,<br /> Diving inward.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186979" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1330</h1>
  
 

<p>You can underestimate<br /> The capacity of any human being<br /> On earth.<br /> But don't ever underestimate<br /> The aspiration of a God-seeker<br /> And the dedication of a God-lover.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186980" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1331</h1>
  
 

<p>Countless people are wallowing<br /> In the pleasures of ignorance,<br /> And they are satisfied in their own way.<br /> To them, ignorance itself<br /> Is a kind of bliss.<br /> But their happiness<br /> Is no happiness at all<br /> To the truth-seekers<br /> Who are thinking of God calmly,<br /> Praying to God soulfully<br /> And meditating on God unconditionally.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186981" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1332</h1>
  
 

<p>Before you were aspiring,<br /> You were happy with the world.<br /> But you have to know<br /> That that happiness<br /> Is not the same happiness<br /> You are now longing for.<br /> That happiness<br /> Was your temptation-fulness-happiness.<br /> This happiness<br /> Is the manifestation of God-Satisfaction<br /> In and through you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186982" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1333</h1>
  
 

<p>You say that<br /> You can dare to deny God.<br /> But, you fool,<br /> Do you ever dare to imagine<br /> That God can easily dare<br /> To love you,<br /> Illumine you and liberate you<br /> From your self-styled clown act?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186983" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1334</h1>
  
 

<p>A true seeker has to remain<br /> Always an eternal student.<br /> It is through him<br /> That the Beauty of God's Vision-Reality<br /> Will be manifested and fulfilled.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186984" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1335</h1>
  
 

<p>An unaspiring man is so useless.<br /> He does not want any higher wisdom,<br /> Although there is so much to know,<br /> So much to learn<br /> And so much to become.<br /> He wants to change the face and fate<br /> Of the world<br /> Before he even dreams<br /> Of changing his own.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186985" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1336</h1>
  
 

<p>Why do I not want to see You, my Lord?<br /> Is it because I shall disappoint You<br /> Or is it because You will disappoint me?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> If your heart is not sincerely aspiring,<br /> You will disappoint Me,<br /> And if your mind is doubtful,<br /> I shall disappoint you."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186986" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1337</h1>
  
 

<p>You can show your sweetest kindness<br /> Even to those<br /> Who are vehemently standing<br /> In your way.<br /> But under no circumstances<br /> Must you surrender to their way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186987" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1338</h1>
  
 

<p>When God saw His detachment-child,<br /> He was so pleased<br /> That He immediately granted His child<br /> A long interview —<br /> His first marathon interview with God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186988" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1339</h1>
  
 

<p>You will always remain inexperienced<br /> In the art of self-transcendence<br /> If you allow the blinding fog of uncertainty<br /> To invade your mind and heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186989" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1340</h1>
  
 

<p>You went to God<br /> Only to pay a courtesy call,<br /> To see Him as briefly as possible.<br /> How then can you expect God<br /> To treasure and cherish you?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186990" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1341</h1>
  
 

<p>O my doubting, earth-bound mind,<br /> You may not feel it<br /> But my aspiring heart<br /> Definitely gets joy<br /> From my Master's very presence.<br /> It feels that his mere presence<br /> Feeds my soul.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186991" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1342</h1>
  
 

<p>Because you are not sincere<br /> And because you have forgotten<br /> To write your return address,<br /> God did not take the trouble<br /> Of answering your prayer-letter.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186992" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1343</h1>
  
 

<p>There is no reason<br /> Why we cannot hope<br /> That one day our hope<br /> Will be transformed into reality.<br /> We will, without fail, be able<br /> To see God's Vision-Eye,<br /> Feel His Reality-Heart<br /> And manifest His Oneness-Perfection<br /> On earth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186993" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1344</h1>
  
 

<p>Why are you resting indefinitely<br /> On the bottom rung<br /> Of the wisdom-ladder?<br /> Do you not know that others<br /> Have already started climbing<br /> Up the ladder?<br /> And even now they are seeing<br /> That there are infinitely more rungs<br /> To climb.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186994" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1345</h1>
  
 

<p>How do I dare<br /> To measure up to God's Height?<br /> I do so<br /> Just by quenching every day<br /> My hope-thirst.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186995" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1346</h1>
  
 

<p>"The race is to the swiftest."<br /> This is one theory.<br /> Again, in the inner world<br /> The race can be to the one<br /> Who has the utmost patience.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186996" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1347</h1>
  
 

<p>East and West<br /> Are two wings of one blue-green bird.<br /> This bird needs<br /> Both the poise of the East<br /> And the dynamism of the West<br /> To fly in the firmament of the Beyond<br /> And spread God's Light and Delight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186997" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1348</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Keep silent for a few minutes!<br /> Please let me do the talking!<br /> O my heart,<br /> When will you start talking<br /> So that I can immediately<br /> Start listening to you?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186998" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1349</h1>
  
 

<p>His life was to serve<br /> The Supreme in his Master.<br /> Every time<br /> His Master needed something<br /> To be done<br /> For the divine manifestation,<br /> He offered his services unreservedly<br /> To his Master.</p>

<p>In every possible way<br /> She is displeasing God.<br /> But she is apt in making herself feel<br /> That she is indeed<br /> Pleasing Him.<br /> What a deplorable seeker!</p>

<div id="node-1187000" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1351</h1>
  
 

<p>Play your role soulfully.<br /> You will reach your goal<br /> Unmistakably.<br /> Something more:<br /> God will beat your victory-drum<br /> Thunderously.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187001" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1352</h1>
  
 

<p>My mind has disappointed me.<br /> Therefore<br /> I want to desert my mind.<br /> My heart has pleased me.<br /> Therefore<br /> I want to treasure my heart.<br /> My soul has embraced me.<br /> Therefore<br /> I want to manifest my soul's dream.<br /> My Lord has blessed me.<br /> Therefore<br /> My entire earth-existence<br /> Is all gratitude to Him.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187002" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1353</h1>
  
 

<p>If you are a true seeker,<br /> You will feel that to be<br /> With your Master,<br /> Near your Master,<br /> Beside your Master,<br /> Is undoubtedly a true form<br /> Of meditation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187003" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1354</h1>
  
 

<p>We have only one goal<br /> And that goal<br /> Is transcendence-perfection.<br /> It is not only your goal,<br /> His goal and my goal,<br /> But it is everybody's goal —<br /> Including that of our Eternity's<br /> Beloved Pilot Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187004" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1355</h1>
  
 

<p>You yourself must first become<br /> Infinitely more spiritual,<br /> Infinitely more self-giving<br /> And infinitely more perfect<br /> In your own way.<br /> Then only you will get<br /> The inner assurance<br /> That you will be able to change<br /> The world around you.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1356</h1>
  
 

<p>You are enjoying your rash whims.<br /> God is enjoying His prolonged absence.<br /> Only one member of your inner family<br /> Is suffering sleeplessly:<br /> Your poor little heart.</p>

<div id="node-1187006" class="section-2">

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> I am not listening to You,<br /> He is not listening to You —<br /> Nobody is listening to You.<br /> Are You not by this time<br /> Totally sick of Your creation?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> I am a perfect stranger to sickness.<br /> But if you want to teach Me<br /> How to fall sick,<br /> Then do come and teach Me.<br /> I am all ready."</p>

<div id="node-1187007" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1358</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> I have displeased You.<br /> How can I please You again?<br /> "My child,<br /> This question has been asked<br /> By each and every seeker.<br /> Again,<br /> Each and every seeker<br /> Has answered it.<br /> Just try once more.<br /> This time give Me<br /> Your Eternity's surrender-life."</p>

<p>Why do you exaggerate your mistakes?<br /> I assure you,<br /> Your offences are not as serious<br /> Or as dangerous as you think.<br /> Do not allow your stupidity-mind<br /> To powerfully increase<br /> Your baseless negative feelings<br /> About yourself.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1361</h1>
  
 

<p>He is such a fool!<br /> He thinks that he is<br /> Either very good or very bad.<br /> He finds it difficult to see<br /> That his status is really<br /> Somewhere in between.</p>

<div id="node-1187011" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1362</h1>
  
 

<p>That you remain in the spiritual life<br /> Is undoubtedly a sign<br /> Of your spiritual progress.<br /> True, your life<br /> Is nowhere near perfection-light.<br /> But just because you have been<br /> A truth-seeker and a God-lover<br /> For such a long time,<br /> You are definitely progressing —<br /> Of course,<br /> Maybe not to your satisfaction.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187012" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1363</h1>
  
 

<p>Step by step<br /> Each genuine seeker<br /> Is going forward.<br /> If he is bad,<br /> He will unmistakably become good.<br /> And if he is already good,<br /> He will become better<br /> And then best.<br /> For God will not allow<br /> His Vision-Light to remain<br /> Unmanifested through him.</p>

<p>If we have the capacity<br /> To make mistakes,<br /> Then our Beloved Supreme also<br /> Has the capacity to forgive us.<br /> He is in no way<br /> Weaker than we are.<br /> His Forgiveness-Light<br /> Is infinitely stronger<br /> Than our mistake-night.</p>

<p>I have some good news for you.<br /> This news will save your life.<br /> You are dying<br /> Because you have got<br /> What you wanted.<br /> From now on, be wise!<br /> Try to claim only<br /> God's Aspiration-Sun<br /> As your own.</p>

<p>You have committed so many blunders<br /> That you now feel<br /> You can no longer become perfect.<br /> But that is absurd, absurd!<br /> Your Beloved Supreme<br /> Will never be satisfied<br /> Unless and until you become perfect<br /> To prove to Him that His Vision of you<br /> Was absolutely perfect.</p>

<div id="node-1187016" class="section-2">

<p>Life is God's Game<br /> And He has invited you<br /> To play with Him.<br /> Right now you are not<br /> Scoring properly,<br /> But do not worry.<br /> Again and again<br /> God Himself will teach you<br /> How to score successfully.</p>
