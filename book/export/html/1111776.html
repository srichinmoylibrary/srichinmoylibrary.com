<p>At one point in the sixth mile of the North Carolina course, there was a 300-metre hill. What could I do? Perhaps when the boys were measuring the course, they were half asleep, so they did not even notice the hill.</p>
<p>The San Francisco course was absolutely the best, so far, of all the "Fifty Oneness-State-Songs" courses. It was totally flat.</p>
