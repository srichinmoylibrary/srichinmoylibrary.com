<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We do not lose anything, for it is the spiritual world that will give us our highest realisation. If we live in the inner world, the spiritual world, then automatically we get the invaluable wealth of the spiritual world. And we will see that the occult forces and all the other forces are housed there. So we do not lose anything by not concentrating on the occult world.</p>  </div>
