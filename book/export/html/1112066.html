<p>In the ladies' group some of the participants are a little overweight and have grey hair. Others look quite thin and smart; in comparison, they look quite young. But when the race starts, sometimes those grey-haired ladies go so fast, and the younger-looking ones, who are thin and light, are useless.</p>
