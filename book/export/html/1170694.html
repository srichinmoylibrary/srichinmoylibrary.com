SCA 233-241. Sri Chinmoy was interviewed by an independent film-maker on 28 August 1993 in Chicago in connection with his participation in the World Parliament of Religions. These are excerpts from that interview.</p>
<h2>Question: What do you feel is the significance of this Chicago Parliament of Religions, which may be the largest gathering of the world's religions ever to be held?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual significance of this Parliament, according to my aspiring heart, is interdependence. The one and the many have to realise their interdependence. Just as the tree and its branches, leaves, flowers and fruits are interdependent, so we are all interdependent. Here many religions are meeting together to sing the oneness-heart-song.</p>  </div>
