<p>I went to visit my original Home.<br /> Alas, my parents were not there.<br /> I missed their presence badly.</p>
<p>I was told by the sun,<br /> The moon and the stars<br /> That my parents left their Home<br /> To visit my home on earth.</p>
<p>I came back home hurriedly<br /> Only to find a short note:<br /> "Son, your father, God,<br /> And your mother, Goddess,<br /> Need you here on earth<br /> And nowhere else."</p>
