<p>In spite of the general belief that beauty and truth are two separate things, Keats has told us that “Beauty is truth, truth beauty.”</p>
<p>Beauty and Tagore were inseparable friends — one soul in two bodies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The world being nothing but Spirit made visible, is, according to Tagore, fundamentally a thing of beauty. The scars and spots that are on the surface have to be removed and mankind has to repossess and clothe itself with that mantle of beauty. The world is beautiful, because it is the image of the Beautiful, because it harbours, expresses and embodies the Divine, who is Beauty supreme.”</p>
<p>— Nolini Kanta Gupta <em>Poets and Mystics</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beauty is always sweet. But why is it so? Here is the answer given by Tagore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Beauty is sweet to us, because she dances to the same fleeting tune with our lives.”</p>
