<p>The following afternoon Dhanu, Databir and quite a few visitors were watching me walk along Main Street. There we have a very accurate course marked off every hundred metres. All the marks on my courses are now accurate because Nirvik has done them. He has done a most careful and accurate job, measuring everything while walking with the wheel.</p>
<p>Since I didn't know where some of the new marks were, Databir went ahead of me to show me. At one point an old, very fat black lady — twice my size, but very short — saw us as we were crossing the street. She had two shopping bags, one in each hand. I think that Databir may have said something to her — God knows. But as I came closer, she was so kind. When I was two metres away, she took the bag from her left hand, put it in her right hand and gave me the right of way. I said, "Thank you so much."</p>
<p>Then she looked into my eyes and said, "Amazingly beautiful!"</p>
<p>Again I thanked her. Then she walked away.</p>
