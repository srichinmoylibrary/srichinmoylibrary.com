<p><em>Sri Chinmoy answered the following questions about weightlifting on 26 August 1989 at Aspiration-Ground, Jamaica, New York.</em></p>
<p><em>Question:</em> What is the soul doing when we lift weights?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we are in a good consciousness, the soul watches us. If we are not in a good consciousness, the soul does other things which are infinitely more important.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Does the soul get more joy when one muscle is developed rather than another?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. According to the aspiration of the bodybuilder and according to the aspiration of the muscle itself, the muscle is developed. The soul does not enjoy any competitive sport.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Is humanity fitter than it was a thousand years ago?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is a very complicated question. Some will say that definitely in those golden days people had better physiques. They depended on help from nature. Now the machine world has come and in many ways it has corrupted the simplicity, sincerity, purity and spontaneity of mankind.</p>
<p>Again, others will say that the modern-day world has not destroyed these qualities. If one wants to maintain the pristine beauty, purity, simplicity and all the divine qualities, one can. In fact, the modern world, the scientific world, can be of great help to the world of inspiration and aspiration.</p>
<p>So the answer depends on the individual. Some will say that a thousand years ago people were more physically fit, while others will say no. Each individual has to see and feel the answer in his own life.</p>  </div>
