<p>We shall now try to empty the mind. Indeed, this is the most difficult task, but we shall do it. Our mind has made friends with teeming thoughts. These thoughts are unhealthy, uncomely, unaspiring and undivine. The moment our aspiration-heart eliminates one thought, to its wide surprise another thought immediately crops up. It seems that we are forced to play an endless game.</p>
<p>But there is also another game, and that game is the will-power-game. We have inherited that game from our Father, the Lord Supreme. When we play that game we transform our thought-world into the will-power-world.</p>
<p>Where do we get this will-power? We get this will-power from our heart's calmness-sea. From where do we acquire this calmness-sea? We acquire it from our soul's freedom-sun and oneness-sky.</p>
<p>A man of will-power braves all the storms and tempests of life. He knows that he is not the earth-bound body but the Heaven-free soul. His body is not earth-bound; his life is not earth-bound. He also knows that he is not his nature's slave, but a supremely chosen instrument of his Inner Pilot, his Beloved Supreme. What he truly has and what he truly is, is aspiration-flame, and this aspiration-flame makes him feel that he is always Heaven-free. He is in the world, true; but he is not of the world. At the same time, he knows that he is <em>for</em> the world, for the world's transformation and for God's manifestation in and through the world. He is always for this world.</p>
<p>Let us try to empty the mind. In our mind's emptiness will loom large Infinity's Peace, Eternity's Light and Immortality's Delight. Let us try to empty the mind.</p>
