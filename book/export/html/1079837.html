<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all you must feel that your fellow man is part and parcel of your own existence. I have two eyes. Now if my left eye does not function as well as my right eye, what do I do? Do I become angry with my left eye? Do I take it out of my body? Do I keep my left eye closed or cover it with my hand and say, "I won't let you see"? No. At that time I have the feeling of oneness. I simply accept my left eye as less capable then my right eye, but still as a part of me. If my left eye does not see well I use my right eye also. Whenever I have to use my eyes I use both eyes, and the eye that is more powerful naturally does more work.</p>
<p>You must regard the persons around you as limbs of your own body. Without them you are incomplete. You may feel they are less developed, but they also have their role to play. Your thumb is much more powerful than your little finger. But the little finger also has its job. God has created five fingers. Although some are shorter and weaker than others, you know that only when you have five fingers are you perfect. Now your middle finger is the tallest. If you feel that for this reason you don't need your shorter fingers, then you are sadly mistaken. If you want to play the piano or if you want to type, then you need all five fingers.</p>
<p>You can love the people around you only when you feel the necessity of real perfection. If you remain isolated as an individual, then your achievement will be limited. Your very sense of perfection will be limited, very limited. But when you think in terms of unlimited perfection, then you have to love humanity. For it is only by accepting humanity as part and parcel of your own life, and by perfecting humanity with your own illumination, that you can fulfil yourself.</p>  </div>
