<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some Christian missionaries made this mistake. They said, “Either accept us or there is no salvation for you.” We can say that if you accept us, we feel that your salvation will come sooner. That much we can say. But we will never say that if you don’t accept us, you are doomed and you have to go to hell. That we will never, never say.</p>  </div>
