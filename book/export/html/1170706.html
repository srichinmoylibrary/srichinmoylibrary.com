<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On very rare occasions it has happened that a feminine body with a feminine soul is being born, but in the occult world Mother Kali, let us say, wants a masculine body with a masculine soul. At that time, a spiritual Master has had to use his highest, fastest and strongest occult power. For more than seven hours the Master was fighting and fighting. It is very difficult when the material body is already formed. One has to completely change the heart and remove the soul so another soul can come in.</p>  </div>
