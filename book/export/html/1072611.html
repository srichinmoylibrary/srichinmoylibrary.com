<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on who is meditating. If someone is an aspirant of the highest rank and if his meditation is bearing fruit, solid fruit, at that time it does affect the planets. It enters into the planets and creates new life. From the world atmosphere it brings a kind of subtle spiritual energy into the planets. But if a spiritual Master meditates, his meditation can enter into any planet anywhere in Godâ€™s universe, if he wants. A highly advanced seeker who is on the verge of realisation can also affect the planets. When these people meditate, they can enter into the planets, or they can offer the result of their meditation to the planets. That is being done almost every day.</p>  </div>
