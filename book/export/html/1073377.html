<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul knows that there is an eternal Time, and the soul is constantly growing, growing in the eternal Time. Unfortunately, when we remain in the physical mind or in the physical consciousness, it is simply impossible for us to think of something immortal or eternal. We limit ourselves to the earth-bound time. Earthbound time is broken up into fragments: one minute, two minutes, three minutes. But when we pray and meditate, we do not break up time in this way. Instead, at a glance we see the infinite and eternal Time, which is a smooth, unbroken flow; and we enter into eternal Time.</p>  </div>
