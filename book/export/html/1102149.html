<p>"My Lord, I am in Your celestial Palace. Do You have a name for Your Palace? I am at Your Feet. Do You have any special name for Your Feet? Do you have any special name for Your Throne, my Lord? My Lord, do You have any special name for Your Crown?"</p>
<p>"Yes, My child. The name of My Palace is Justice. The name of My Feet is Compassion. The name of My Throne is Aspiration. The name of My Crown is Realisation. My dearest child, all these are yours. I offer them to you. You need them to work for Me on earth. My sweetest child, there you are."</p>
<p>"My Lord, my life of aspiration bathes in the sea of ceaseless gratitude."</p>
