<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely man’s inner, divine capacities are not fully explored or fully used. We can awaken these capacities through our heart’s aspiration and our life’s dedication.</p>
<p>My disciples do learn from me to bring to the fore their inner capacities, and many have succeeded in doing so. A few of them have amazed the world with their most outstanding capacities. One of them, Ashrita Furman, has held as many as thirteen world records, and many others have discovered and developed exceptional capacities in various fields. They may not achieve the same kind of results as I do, because their receptivity is still limited at their level of spiritual development. But because of their inner aspiration, their regular meditation and their sincere devotion to the life of the spirit, they have achieved or will achieve far more than they would have or could have, had they led ordinary lives.</p>  </div>
