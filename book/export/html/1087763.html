<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We don't have to go to hell or any particular place to see hostile, undivine forces. They are all around us, and also within us. It is only when we change our consciousness that wrong forces are really transformed. The world we are living in is full of ignorant forces, and they get malicious pleasure when they can disturb the poise of the divine forces. We have to try to avoid and ignore these malicious forces that intentionally try to disturb our poise.</p>  </div>
