<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we are thirsty, we all drink water. But different people call it different things. In Bengali I call it ‘jal’. In Italian it is ‘acqua’ and in Spanish it is ‘agua’. But it is the same thing. If I am thirsty, I will run for ‘jal’. If you are thirsty, you will run for ‘acqua’. If he is thirsty, he will run for ‘agua’. We are running for the same thing, but we are calling it by different names.</p>  </div>
