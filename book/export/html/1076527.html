<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I was speaking, you observed me closing my eyes. It is not that I was concentrating; it was only that I was entering into various worlds. There are seven higher worlds and seven lower worlds. When I close my eyes and then open them, this blinking that you see indicates that I am moving, my soul is moving from one region to another.</p>
<p>During my talk, I was in a very high consciousness. Hence my soul got the opportunity to move from one plane of consciousness to another.</p>  </div>
