<p>When he was in Heaven,<br /> His heart-flower opened<br /> And he compassionately said:<br /> "Let me go down and help<br /> The suffering earth."<br /> Alas, when he came to earth,<br /> He immediately said:<br /> "Is there anybody in God's universe<br /> As stupid as I?<br /> Let me go back to Heaven!"</p>
