<p>Poetry that springs from a devout heart leads kindred hearts to the ever-sweet One and makes of them a Republic with Him for President. No other divine faculty perhaps has a greater power of transcendence over limits to the illimitable. In the bright days that are dawning upon the earth well may we look for the leaven of transcendental poetry to uplift the whole human mass.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to replace one desire for a better one, it is worthwhile to attempt a transcending desire, so that in a trance one may intuit Him who hears one's heart's call and is ever ready to lend one His helping Hand.</p>
<p>When men worship God in the hope of getting their miseries removed, they may meet with frustration and are apt to lose their faith in God.</p>
<p>The gods are ever ready to help us, but when we demand of them something quite absurd, and in our human weakness we refuse to undergo the troubles and tribulations that are necessary for our development, we may lose the chance of the descent of their grace.</p>
<p>The poet has the divine faith, the inner intuition that the existence of the One Supreme Divine has hardly anything to do with the commonly sought spiritual experience side-by-side with common miseries.</p>
<p>In order to write a poem, the poet must transport himself to the sphere of the Muse and lose himself there. He has to be like a flame that burns away everything but itself.</p>
