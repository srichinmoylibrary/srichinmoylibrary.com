<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the human law contradicts God's Will, at times God uses His Force in the inner world to change the law and at times He uses His immediate, most powerful Willpower to smash the power of the law. But it is done mostly in the inner world. Therefore, sometimes He finds it very difficult for His Will to take effect on the outer plane. But on rare occasions He uses His adamantine Willpower and corrects and perfects the outer law, the human law.</p>  </div>
