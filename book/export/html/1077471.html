  <h1 class="book-heading">Love: attachment and detachment</h1>
  
 
<p>If human affection is not always reliable, it is also not always harmful. Foolish is he who thinks that affection should be turned into indifference in order that God might come to him. Alas, he has yet to learn that God is All-Affection.</p>
<p>Affection and attachment need not always go together. An entire rejection of all relations can never be the promising sign of progress towards Realisation.</p>
<p>Controlled desire is good. Better is non-attachment. Best is it to feel oneself removed from the snare of nature. Suppression is as hostile and undeserving as attachment. It is our non-attachment that is the only master of nature.</p>
<p>Desires and hungers have one common enemy: detachment.</p>
<p>Detachment and not possession should be the bridge between you and the object of your love. Spiritual detachment intensifies the seeking of our hearts, purifies the vibrations of our bodies, transforms the ignorance of our consciousness into knowledge.</p>
<p>Granted, loneliness is a kind of spiritual disease. But human association can never be its lasting medicine. The only permanent cure for it is Inner Experience.</p>  </div>
