<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please try to avoid meat and fish; and, of course, liquor and tobacco are out of the question. All fruits and vegetables, as well as dairy products, are fine. Processed foods may also be eaten as long as they do not interfere with good health. Also, coffee and tea are not good, except for herbal teas. To me, coffee and tea are slow poison. They just take a little longer time to kill you. Of course, each person has some power of resistance, so if it is a very slow poison, if we fight we can win the battle. But we must not squander our power by using it to fight against these slow poisons.</p>  </div>
