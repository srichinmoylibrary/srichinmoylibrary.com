<p>Marty Gallagherâ€™s soul has been coming to me. Three or four days ago this started. Since then, his soul has come three times. Half an hour before I received the message outwardly that he will be coming to New York, his soul came to tell me the news.</p>
<p>Jim Smith is taking ten British weightlifters to Puerto Rico to compete in a competition. He is the leader of the British contingent. Ashrita and Agraha have assisted him in making all the travel arrangements, so $100 less each person is paying to the airlines.</p>
