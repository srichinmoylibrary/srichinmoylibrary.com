<p><em>Madal:</em></p>
<p>Chinmoy, I have a professor friend. Whenever he talks I feel that his utterances are full of <em>cant</em>. What shall I do with him?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>Madal, if you know that your professor friend is full of <em>insincerity</em> and his <em>meaningless utterances</em> are creating problems for you, then you should pray to God either to change your professor friend's nature or to free your life from his friendship.</p>  </div>
