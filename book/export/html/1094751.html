<p>My Lord, some friends<br /> Who have betrayed me<br /> And are no longer with me,<br /> And some friends who are<br /> Still with me<br /> But mix with them<br /> And talk with them<br /> And receive wild and absurd gossip<br /> And spread it all around:<br /> What shall I do with them?<br /> “My child, your time on earth<br /> Is extremely precious.<br /> Throw them out of your heart,<br /> Throw them out of your mind,<br /> And throw them out of your life<br /> Immediately.<br /> You do not need<br /> These so-called friends.”</p>
