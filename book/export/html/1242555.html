  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Why is Thomas Jefferson not fully appreciated?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Who has been fully appreciated? Has anybody on earth been fully appreciated? Was the Saviour Jesus Christ fully appreciated? Will anybody who has the high, higher, highest vision be fully appreciated? God knows how many years it will take. Those individuals will be appreciated only long after the unimportant ones are appreciated.</p>
<p>The higher you go, the more you will be misunderstood. Appreciation comes from God, in the form of His Blessings.</p>
