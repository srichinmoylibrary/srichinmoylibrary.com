<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not the size but the strength that matters. There are many excellent sprinters who do not have big calf muscles, but still they have tremendous strength in their calves. Many runners and jumpers whose calf muscles are not so pronounced have enormous strength inside their calves. It is not the size but the strength inside the muscle that is needed.</p>  </div>
