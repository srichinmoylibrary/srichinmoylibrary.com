<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> An ordinary man's greatest treasure is world-recognition and world-possession. A spiritual man's greatest treasure is his conscious, constant, cheerful and unconditional surrender to the Will of the Supreme. Also, we can say that, before he realises God, his heart's ascending cry is his greatest treasure; after he has realised God, his soul's descending smile is his greatest treasure.</p>  </div>
