<p>When I saw Chandika during my seven-mile run, she was so happy. To see Chandika smiling is really something! At that point I was walking — for me to run seven miles is no joke! I was running on the street around the track and Chandika was on the track itself. I saw her three times. I thought that secretly I was seeing her, but later she said that she had seen me.</p>
