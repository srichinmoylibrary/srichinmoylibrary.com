<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we pray or meditate we can increase our faith. Faith is like a muscle. If we take exercise, we develop our muscles. Inner faith also can be expanded. There are many who enter into the spiritual life out of curiosity. They have very little faith. But they go on, continue, continue. Then later on, they feel within themselves deeper faith, greater faith, more fulfilling faith. So, when one sticks to the spiritual path, one is bound to acquire more faith.</p>  </div>
