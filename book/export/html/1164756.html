<p>Every day God Himself teaches you how to speak perfectly the universal heart-language, and how to show lovingly the transcendental peace-sky.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1164762" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 
<p>Your mind is a measureless canopy of beautiful thoughts, and your heart is a measureless canopy of fruitful ideas.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 
<p>Your wisdom-light is indeed a necessity-breath for the inspiration-mind, aspiration-heart and dedication-life of the entire world.</p>  </div>

<p>Your heart-actions are infinitely deeper than the mind-calculations of your deplorable adversaries.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1164766" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 
<p>No, not even your worst possible foes could do you as much harm as some of your intimate friends did. Alas, such is the experience you got from the ingratitude-world.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1164767" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 
<p>Out of your heart's magnanimity, you taught certain students of yours how to be great and good. In return, the students gave the teacher two lessons that they were thoroughly conversant with: meanness and vindictiveness. The teacher refused to accept the students' lessons.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1164768" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>
  
 
<p>Your compassion-depth was not heeded. Your patience-length was not heeded. Your nobility-heart was not heeded. But the thunder-roar of your soul will definitely be heeded before long.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1164769" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13.</h1>
  
 
<p>We beg of you not to associate yourself again with the old and undesirable friends and acquaintances. Who knows, they may again be found among those who are deception-betrayal-incarnate.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1164770" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14.</h1>
  
 
<p>You are well aware of the fact that people whose consciousness is rooted in the suspicious mind thrive on ferocious darkness.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1164771" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15.</h1>
  
 
<p>Some ignorant human beings deliberately do not want to see you as you truly are: a sleeplessly radiating goodness. They only want you to fulfil the ever-rising pyramid of their expectations.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1164772" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16.</h1>
  
 
<p>Only those who believe in world-progress can see that at every moment you are offering your heart's oneness-strength-hand.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">17.</h1>
  
 
<p>In your country, even those who have had many complaints against you in their minds, admire you and adore you secretly in their hearts. Their hearts do know that you love your country most deeply and most self-givingly.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1164774" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18.</h1>
  
 
<p>You are telling the entire world that the mind's warfare will eventually surrender to the heart's welfare.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1164775" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19.</h1>

<div id="node-1164776" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20.</h1>
  
 
<p>Your very name energises others to increase their inner integrity and expand their outer receptivity.</p>  </div>

<div id="node-1164778" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">22.</h1>
  
 
<p>You taught your countrymen how to wake up from a long-cherished slumber. You taught them how to open their eyes and look within, look around and look above. Some of your countrymen were extremely grateful to your unimaginably good heart, while others were displeased with you for putting an end to their cherished ignorance-sleep. Still others foolishly wanted to run faster than the fastest immediately.</p>
<p>Gorbachev, the awakener, lovingly and compassionately said to them: "Comrades, we are by no means ready to run the fastest. We have just awakened. We can and we must first walk slowly and steadily, without fear, without doubt, without suspicion and without self-abnegation." Alas, the coach who was teaching them how to play life's vastness-oneness-reality-game became a victim of ruthless attacks.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1164779" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23.</h1>
  
 
<p>In spite of being humiliated by those whom you taught the ABC's of democracy, kindness towards them still echoes and re-echoes in your heart.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1164780" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24.</h1>
  
 
<p>From the Crimean experience you learned the truth that diving deep within is the only way to go beyond the tentacles of the outer world.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1164781" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25.</h1>
  
 
<p>Your heart adds and adds to the world's inner poise; whereas there are some deplorable human beings who just add and add to the world's outer noise.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1164782" class="section-2">

  <h1 class="book-heading">28.</h1>

<div id="node-1164785" class="section-2">

  <h1 class="book-heading">30.</h1>

<div id="node-1164787" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">31.</h1>

<p>About a year ago-to be precise, 10 months and 23 days ago-President Gorbachev came to visit Japan, Beauty's Land and Duty's Hand. At a dinner in the Emperor's Palace his oneness-heart voiced forth, "Our countries and peoples are neighbours. Our ties are many centuries old. There are many historical documents testifying to the mutual attraction between the Russians and the Japanese."At the same dinner, the unparalleled peace-lover in him also proclaimed, "Allow me also to express the wish that the presciently chosen name of the era of Your Majesty's rule, 'Heisei,' which means "achievement of universal peace," may also come true in relations between the Soviet Union and Japan."</p>
<p>May the morning light of Japan and the serving heart of President Gorbachev together grow and glow to accelerate the perfection-promise of humanity.</p>

<h2>5 January 1992</h2>

<p>Happy Birthday! most esteemed Sister Raisa Maximovna Gorbachev.</p>
<p>On this most auspicious occasion, I am praying to the Absolute Lord Supreme to grant you His choicest Blessings, Love, Joy and Satisfaction.</p>
<p>You are the only real Queen of the immortal Soviet Union that proudly embodies our Beloved President Gorbachev's unparalleled Hope and Promise. You are the only woman down the sweep of centuries to help her husband with the loftiest inspiration and the strongest encouragement to transform his dream-sky into his reality-sun.</p>
<p>To the extreme joy of the aspiring humanity, our President chose the 25th of December, (the day the Saviour Christ blessed the earth), to render his vision-flooded, historical resignation.</p>
<p>Our President is not dethroned. No, never! On the contrary, he is unquestionably and permanently enthroned inside the gratitude-heart-garden of the freedom-searching and peace-loving humanity.</p>
<p>O First Lady of the Soviet Union, I have read your book <em>I Hope</em>. Your book at once houses and reveals the Illumination of your radiant mind, the Aspiration of your blossomed heart and the Dedication of your self-giving life in a unique way. May we request you most fervently to enrich the Gorbachev-thirsty and Gorbachev-hungry world with many more successors of your <em>I Hope</em>.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy</p>

<p>14 March 1992</p>
<p>O Queen of the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>My most esteemed sister Raisa Maximovna,</p>
<p>It was most kind of you to autograph for me your immortal book <em>I Hope</em> with your deep and compassionate affection. I shall treasure it inside the very depth of my gratitude-heart. My German student Petra Menge was so fortunate to have met with you and to have been able to offer you a rose, which I wanted her to give you from me. Like me, everybody must treasure your invaluable book.</p>
<p>I was extremely happy to meet with your dearest daughter, Irina, in New York last month. While I was talking to her, I was so clearly feeling and seeing her parents' infinite wisdom, light, compassion and sacrifice.</p>
<p>You are a supreme authority on art. In May there will be an art exhibit in New York of my paintings which will last for about a month. I am going to dedicate this exhibit to you. I shall be so deeply honoured and grateful if you could come and bless the exhibit just for fleeting five minutes. It will mean so much to me and to my students from all over the world.</p>
<p>I am praying to my Lord Supreme most fervently for your good health and for an extra supply of dynamic energy for you.</p>
<p>With my heart's warmest compliments and gratitude,</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy</p>  </div>
