<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What has been lost? Our conscious oneness with the Absolute Supreme has been lost. Through our inner search we are trying to gain or regain our conscious inseparable oneness with Him. We are seeking for Truth and Light. Once upon a time, we were possessors of this infinite Truth and Light. But unfortunately, we made friends with ignorance-night and lost our inseparable oneness with Infinity's Light and Bliss. It is through conscious seeking — our conscious inner search and inner mounting cry — that at God's choice Hour we shall once again get back our inner wealth.</p>  </div>
