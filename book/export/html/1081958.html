<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here on earth you have something that keeps you alive, and that is your life-breath. So, if you can feel inside each breath the living Light and living Reality of the Supreme, then you are bound to love the Supreme with utmost intensity. When you hold your breath for a few seconds, you feel that you are about to die. Then, when you breathe, you feel such intensity. Inside that living breath, if you can feel the Supreme's Light and the Supreme's Love, then you will definitely love the Supreme.</p>
<p>This Light has something most significant to offer to your existence. And who is the Source of this Light? It is the Supreme. If you are constantly aspiring to go to the real Source, if you are all the time crying for a free access to the Source, then you will feel a real intensity from your inner cry and aspiration.</p>  </div>
