<p>One day I was walking in front of my house and also exercising at the same time. The old German lady who lives on our block — the one who has the dog — came up to me and said, "Now I know why you are very strong and why you are very skinny."</p>
<p>Then she came near me and pushed my left shoulder. Whenever she sees me, she always pushes my shoulder in an affectionate way.</p>
