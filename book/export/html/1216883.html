<p>I have an amusing, inspiring and illumining story about Ketan the great.</p>
<p>Last night he phoned our Madrid hotel from America. The switchboard connected him with my room. When I said, "Hello," Ketan said, "Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! I wanted to speak to Bipin."</p>
<p>I said, "Give me some news."</p>
<p>He said, "Oh no, they have made the wrong connection!"</p>
<p>I said again, "Give me some news. What is happening in New York?"</p>
<p>But Ketan just hung up. I was begging him to give me some news, but he got upset and frightened and just hung up.</p>
