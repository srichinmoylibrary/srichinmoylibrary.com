<p>For eight months Subhas was with Deshabandhu<br /> In the same jail.<br /> The closer he became,<br /> The deeper grew his love and admiration<br /> For his mentor.<br /> The saying "Familiarity breeds contempt"<br /> Was, for him and also for others<br /> Who subscribed to his view,<br /> Nothing short of absurdity.</p>
