<p>It was around midnight and I was going back home. There were some grocery stores that were open twenty four hours, so I went into one and bought a Tab, some fruit and juice â€” no candy at that hour. Two or three other people were also inside the store.</p>
<p>A middle-aged lady was behind the counter. Each time a person wanted to come in, she would open the door from the inside and then bolt it again. She was very nice. O God, suddenly three young men tried to open the door forcefully, but the lady would not let them in.</p>
<p>The three young men were being chased by the police. While the other two were still banging on the door, trying to escape, one fellow hid under a car. There were three or four cars in front of the grocery store. The police were having such trouble getting this man, because they were too fat to get under the car. They were screaming at the fellow, but he continued to stay under the car. The other two had already been arrested, and they were laughing at the police. I said, "O God, O God, I don't want to know the remainder of this story." So I bought four or five dollars' worth of things and I left.</p>  </div>
