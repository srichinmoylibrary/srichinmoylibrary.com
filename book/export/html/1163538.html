<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I look at you as an individual, from your heart I hear one message and from your tongue I hear another message. In the inner world somebody will touch my feet and say, "You are my only Reality. I have seen your transcendental Form. I was going to end my life, but you have saved me." But in the outer world if I speak to that same individual, he will be rude to me to such an extent that you cannot imagine.</p>
<p>One day I am the Saviour. Then three days later I am the worst person on earth, because I have prevented him from taking his life or I failed to fulfil his desires. But why does he feel that it is my capacity that has saved him or that has failed to satisfy his vital demands? It is the Supreme Himself who is giving the command. But the individual cannot believe that it is the Will of the Supreme, so he has to curse me and be rude to me.</p>
<p>When you are identified with the Will of the Supreme, at that time the most unbelievable things you can do if necessity demands. When the Master is identified with the supreme Will and is not fulfilling the human desires in a human way, at that time people say that he is the worst culprit. Spiritual Masters are always at the mercy of the disciples. The disciples want the Master to do something; but that very thing he is not authorised to do. If the disciples are in a high consciousness, then they will not ask for the fulfilment of their desires. If an iota of demand passes through their mind, they will feel miserable. But if they don't remain in that high consciousness, then they blame the Master for everything.</p>  </div>
