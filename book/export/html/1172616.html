<p><em>(At the end of her day’s work, Shaivya comes to the garden to play with her son, but she does not find him there. She calls aloud.)</em></p>
<p>SHAIVYA: Rohitashwa, Rohitashwa! Rohit, my son, my darling, where are you? <em>(She looks around. Suddenly she sees her son lying on the ground fast asleep. She places her two arms around his shoulders.)</em> How strange! Why is my son’s body so cold? What are these marks? My son, my son! A poisonous snake has taken your life away!</p>
<p><em>(Eyes filled with tears and heart completely shattered, she carries her son away in her arms.)</em></p>  </div>
