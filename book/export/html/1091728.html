<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, evil does exist. But what you call evil, I will call ignorance. If somebody is not ignorant, then he will not do evil things, undivine things. The root of evil is ignorance. What is ignorance? Ignorance is the dark mind. It is now night. But you have brought an electric light, so now the room is all illumined. Ignorance is night. But this night can be illumined through inner light. As the outer night can be illumined with the electric light, so can the ignorance of the world be illumined through inner light, the light that we have within.</p>  </div>
