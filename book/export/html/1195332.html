<p>If you are more than willing<br /> To jump with God,<br /> To run with God,<br /> To fly with God,<br /> You may not succeed outwardly,<br /> But you have already succeeded inwardly<br /> Beyond your imagination.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195334" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9602</h1>
  
 

<p>A spiritual Master can show you<br /> Our common Father,<br /> The Lord Supreme.<br /> But it is up to you<br /> To keep a direct connection<br /> With the Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195335" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9603</h1>
  
 

<p>True, you are suffering<br /> From ignorance-disease.<br /> But be joyful that you are at least able<br /> To pray to God<br /> To cure your ignorance-disease.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195336" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9604</h1>
  
 

<p>Every day God tries<br /> To make the seeker see and feel<br /> Exactly where he stands,<br /> So that he will wake up<br /> And climb up the inner ladder.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195337" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9605</h1>
  
 

<p>Be more spiritual!<br /> You will see that your fellow seekers<br /> Will be easily and effectively inspired<br /> By your very presence.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195338" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9606</h1>
  
 

<p>You have done God a big favour<br /> By entering into His Progress-Boat.<br /> Can you not do Him a bigger favour<br /> By being an extraordinary seeker?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195339" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9607</h1>
  
 

<p>Your spirituality is something<br /> That the Beloved Supreme cherishes<br /> And is more than eager to broadcast<br /> At every moment.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195340" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9608</h1>
  
 

<p>O insecurity,<br /> How I wish that<br /> The more you tried to prevent the seeker<br /> From running the fastest,<br /> The sooner his indomitable spirit<br /> Would push you aside.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195341" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9609</h1>
  
 

<p>Perhaps you cannot manifest God's Light<br /> At this moment,<br /> But be happy that you have<br /> The eagerness to do it.<br /> Your eagerness itself<br /> Will give you inner speed.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195342" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9610</h1>
  
 

<p>Make commitments -<br /> At least, outer commitments.<br /> The seekers who make<br /> No outer commitment,<br /> Who do no selfless service,<br /> Are worse than useless.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195343" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9611</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You are so kind to me!<br /> Just because I am devotedly accepting<br /> An iota of Your Peace,<br /> You are making me<br /> Your chosen child.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195344" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9612</h1>
  
 

<p>When he did not maintain<br /> His inner speed,<br /> Others surpassed him,<br /> And he and his stupidity<br /> Were left alone.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195345" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9613</h1>
  
 

<p>When the race is over<br /> We realise that<br /> We received the utmost joy<br /> And achieved the greatest progress<br /> Because of our practice and dedication.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195346" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9614</h1>
  
 

<p>Study in the outer school<br /> Soulfully, devotedly and wholeheartedly<br /> If necessity demands.<br /> But if the outer school<br /> Takes you away from the inner school,<br /> It will be a sad failure,<br /> An irreparable loss to your soul.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195347" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9615</h1>
  
 

<p>I thank you<br /> Because you love me deeply.<br /> I thank you<br /> Because you claim me sincerely.<br /> I thank you<br /> Because you will someday<br /> Manifest me and fulfil me<br /> Unconditionally.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195348" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9616</h1>
  
 

<p>The Supreme is either warning<br /> Or begging<br /> His seeker-children<br /> To be careful in every way<br /> At every moment<br /> While they are leading the aspiration-life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195349" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9617</h1>
  
 

<p>Outer endurance<br /> Helps him meditate longer.<br /> Inner peace of mind<br /> Helps him run farther.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195350" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9618</h1>
  
 

<p>You are practising spirituality.<br /> That means, O seeker,<br /> You believe in the inner world,<br /> Where Eternity, Infinity and Immortality<br /> Are not just vague terms.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195351" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9619</h1>
  
 

<p>God feels very sorry<br /> When hurdles stand in your way,<br /> Just because you are most desperately trying<br /> To manifest His Light.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195352" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9620</h1>
  
 

<p>O Lord, how can this be true?<br /> The darkness around me is not ending.<br /> It is only increasing,<br /> Whereas the dawn in other places<br /> Is becoming bright, brighter, brightest.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195353" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9621</h1>
  
 

<p>What have I done!<br /> With self-doubt<br /> I have pierced a small hole<br /> In my spiritual life.<br /> Today there is only a tiny draft<br /> Coming in from ignorance-world,<br /> But tomorrow there may be<br /> A dangerous ignorance-cyclone.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195354" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9622</h1>
  
 

<p>How to offer inspiration<br /> To others?<br /> Give according to your capacity<br /> And their receptivity.<br /> Be generous and, at the same time,<br /> Be wise.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195355" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9623</h1>
  
 

<p>Do not think of the result.<br /> Your sincere effort to serve God<br /> Is what counts most.<br /> That in itself is the greatest achievement.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195356" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9624</h1>
  
 

<p>Let us pray to the Supreme<br /> For His constant Protection,<br /> For if we fall victim for one moment<br /> To destructive forces,<br /> We may suffer for the rest of our lives.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195357" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9625</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1195358" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9626</h1>
  
 

<p>What a fool!<br /> He is struggling to climb up<br /> The aspiration-tree<br /> By using mental force<br /> Instead of by making his mind<br /> Calm and quiet.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195359" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9627</h1>
  
 

<p>Be spontaneous like a child.<br /> A child does not try<br /> To acquire anything unnatural.<br /> He does not try to be somebody<br /> Or something else.<br /> He approaches God in a natural way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195360" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9628</h1>
  
 

<p>When you give God something good,<br /> Feel that He receives from you<br /> Ten times as much.<br /> When you give God something bad,<br /> Feel that it is lost in Him,<br /> Lost forever.</p>

<p>There is one simple reason<br /> Why God thinks more often<br /> Of His chosen instruments:<br /> They are soulfully receptive.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195363" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9631</h1>
  
 

<p>If you feel<br /> That you are not helping God,<br /> Remember<br /> That even your conscious acceptance<br /> Of what God is offering to the world<br /> Is of unparalleled importance.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195364" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9632</h1>
  
 

<p>You have jumped out of God's Boat.<br /> God does not want to blame you.<br /> God does not want to blame Himself.<br /> God does not want to blame anybody.<br /> He only wants to say<br /> That this is the sad fate<br /> You have chosen for yourself.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195365" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9633</h1>
