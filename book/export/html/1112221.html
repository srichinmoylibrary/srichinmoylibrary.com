<p>Today was the start of our Ultra Trio Race. How strong the Parks Commissioner was! When Gary Ackerman was shaking my hand, he was trying to show his strength. But the Parks Commissioner with both hands pressed my hands so hard! He was very nice. He is also a runner. He told me that he has run a 10-kilometre race.</p>
