<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your soul contacted me at least two years ago. Physically you have come to see your Guru now, but spiritually at least two years ago your soul made its connection with me. Now you have come here for the outer recognition, but the inner recognition was made long ago.</p>  </div>
