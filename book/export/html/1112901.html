<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You people have all had many more human incarnations than I, except for one or two disciples who are in their first or second human incarnation. Otherwise, the rest have all had forty, fifty, sixty, seventy or even more human incarnations. It can take three or four thousand years, and sometimes even six or seven thousand years, to achieve realisation. Some of you do it in one thousand or two thousand years. Sometimes in the street I see people who are animals; they are real animals. If these people do not get any Grace from a spiritual Master, then they may stay on earth for at least one or two thousand years. One can easily stay on earth for fifty years in one incarnation before they are anywhere near ready for realisation. Twenty incarnations becomes one thousand years. So they will have at least twenty incarnations.</p>  </div>
