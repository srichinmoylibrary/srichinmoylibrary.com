<p>When George Gardiner finished the race, he folded his hands when he saw me. But he was feeling very sick, so he went into the medical tent. His son John begged me to please come see his father. So I went into the tent and meditated on him. Then he was all right.</p>
<p>George couldn't believe I was meditating on him in the tent. He sat up and said, "Thank you for everything." Before he got his prize, over the microphone he thanked me for saving his life.</p>
