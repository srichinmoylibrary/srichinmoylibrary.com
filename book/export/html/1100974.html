<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Suppose you see that your father is spending lots of time chatting with others here and there, and he is not paying any attention to you. If you get angry, that is attachment. But if you love your father, no matter how many hours or how many days he is spending with his friends, you will not get angry. That is love. Where there is attachment, you feel that everything has to be done in your way. But where there is love, you feel that the other person can do things in his own way, if what he is doing is right. Love does not get hurt. Love says, "He is doing the right thing."</p>  </div>
