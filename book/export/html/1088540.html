<p>President Woodrow Wilson of America had a daughter named Margaret. Once Margaret happened to find and read a book by the great spiritual Master, Sri Aurobindo. She was extremely moved and wanted to meet the author. But in those days the author of the book was in complete seclusion. Nevertheless, Margaret Wilson went to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, India, and stayed there permanently. Four times a year she used to see the Master, as others did, for two or three seconds each time. But she was deeply moved by Sri Aurobindo's books, by Sri Aurobindo's philosophy, by Sri Aurobindo's yoga. So she stayed in his Ashram.</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo eventually gave her the name Nishtha, which means faith â€” divine faith, intense faith. One who has total faith in the Divine, in God, the Supreme, is Nishtha. Nishtha became the perfect embodiment of divine faith.</p>  </div>
