<p>In the grand old days<br /> My thought was my life's sole pole-star.<br /> My mouth and my heart,<br /> In forms they were two<br /> But<br /> In spirit they were one.<br /> I saw God, my All.<br /> He embraced me.<br /> He needed my love.<br /> I demanded His Love.<br /> His Love nullified all my<br /> Vainglorious power in a twinkling.<br /> My love developed into<br /> A hushed silence.<br /> In that silence grew a seething<br /> Amazement:<br /> My death in God's Immortality<br /> And<br /> God's Immortality in my death<br /> Bloomed in excellence supreme.</p>
