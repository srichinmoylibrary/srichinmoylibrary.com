<p><em>(Alipore Jail. Aurobindo in his cell.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Ten days' fast, with sleep once in three nights, has left me no whit weaker, rather I feel greater energy. Now it's time for <em>sirsasana.</em> <em>(He stands on his head.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter Andrews Frazer, Lieutenant Governor, Bengal, with his aide-de-camp. He is surprised to see the Yogic posture of balancing the body on the head.)</em></p>
<p>FRAZER: What is all this, Mr. Ghosh? <em>(No answer)</em></p>
<p>FRAZER: Mr. Ghosh! <em>(No answer)</em></p>
<p>AIDE-DE-CAMP: He is practising Yoga.</p>
<p>FRAZER: What is Yoga?</p>
<p>AIDE-DE-CAMP: It is a process of seeing God.</p>
<p>FRAZER: Queer! Sheer nonsense.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Frazer and his aide-de-camp. Aurobindo is sitting relaxed. Enter a Scotch sergeant.)</em></p>
<p>SERGEANT: <em>(In a tone of bravado)</em> So, Arabinda, you are at last caught.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Yet shall I escape.</p>
<p><em>(Enter the Jail doctor Mr. Daly)</em></p>
<p>DALY: It pains me to see you confined to this solitary cell. The jail Superintendent has kindly listened to my request. He has allowed you to have a walk in the open courtyard.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(Smiling)</em> I thank you both.</p>  </div>
