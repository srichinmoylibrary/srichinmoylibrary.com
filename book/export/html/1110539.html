<p>The Mother of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and Rabindranath Tagore came to Kamakura in the early 1900s. They and their companions stood and meditated at the exact place where my students and I stood and meditated years later, in front of the statue of Lord Buddha. Can you imagine, they came at the beginning of the century and now it is the end of the century! Lord Buddha is immortal. We shall come and go, but there Lord Buddha will remain, generation after generation.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
