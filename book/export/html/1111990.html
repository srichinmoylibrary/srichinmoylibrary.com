<p>When I was coming back from Boston, a man on the plane said he had waited for the plane for three hours.</p>
<p>The stewardess said to him, "It seems you have just run a marathon."</p>
<p>He said, "Yes, I did. It took me three hours to run the marathon and three hours to wait for the plane."</p>
