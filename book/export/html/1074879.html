<p>SHE AND HE</p>
<p>She is very rich<br /> Because<br /> She always gives,<br /> She always gives.</p>
<p>He is very poor<br /> Because<br /> He always needs,<br /> He always needs.</p>
<p>She is always beautiful.<br /> She is always beautiful<br /> Because<br /> Her surrender divine<br /> Drinks the Beauty of God.</p>
<p>He is always ugly.<br /> He is always ugly<br /> Because<br /> His undivine autocracy devours<br /> the freedom of man.</p>
