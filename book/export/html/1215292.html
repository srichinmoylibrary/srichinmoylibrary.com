<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> I wanted to be the slave<br /> Of Your Heart.<br /> Perhaps it was presumptuous<br /> On my part.<br /> I changed my mind.<br /> I wanted to be the slave<br /> Of Your Eye.<br /> Perhaps that too was presumptuous<br /> On my part.<br /> I wanted to be the slave<br /> Of Your Feet.<br /> Alas, Your lack of response<br /> Clearly showed me<br /> That it was nothing but audacity<br /> On my part.<br /> Now I want to be the slave<br /> Of the dust of Your Feet.<br /> Even the dust of Your Feet<br /> Does not care for the pangs<br /> Of my heart!<br /> My life is dancing inside<br /> My humiliation-pride-room.</p>
