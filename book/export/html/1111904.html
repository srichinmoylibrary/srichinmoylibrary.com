<p>During my marathon in Long Island the Canadian boys were inspired to sing "O Good Canada's Oneness-Heart" so many times! Chandika's group was the best. Then came the Canadian boys and then Viresh's group and Hladini's group.</p>
<p>I may be the world's most absolutely useless runner, but God is so kind to me. He has given me the world's most encouraging disciples. They have such enthusiasm, inspiration and aspiration! It was all their aspiration that was carrying me from the first to the last mile.</p>
<p>My road crew plus the singers and others who helped me in various capacities in today's marathon did me a very signal service. They were not my helpers; they were my saviours. I don't have enough gratitude to offer them, but my Beloved Supreme will definitely, definitely give them something very special in the inner world.</p>
<p>How hard it is to remain outside for five and a half hours cheerfully, soulfully, unreservedly and even unconditionally — helping me in my own way!</p>
<p>As I said before, my Beloved Supreme, my Inner Pilot, will definitely give them something very special in the inner world. My marathon assistants kept me alive.</p>
