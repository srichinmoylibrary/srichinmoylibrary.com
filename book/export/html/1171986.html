<h2>Question: How do you meditate?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each Master has his own way of teaching his students how to meditate. But no matter which path you follow, the first and foremost thing is to make the mind calm and quiet. If the mind is constantly roaming, if it is a victim of merciless thoughts, then the seeker will make no progress whatsoever. The mind has to be calm and quiet so that when the light descends from above, the seeker can be fully conscious of it. In his conscious observation and conscious acceptance of light, the seeker enters into profound meditation. And in his profound meditation he sees the purification, transformation and illumination of his life.</p>
<p>So I tell my disciples outwardly that they should offer their thoughts and ideas and the incidents of the day to the Supreme, the Inner Pilot. Then inwardly I try to bring to the fore their soul's light. When I accept a disciple, I have a free access to that individual's soul. I try to bring the soul to the fore and then the soul convinces the heart and mind to do the right thing. So it is the soul's light that actually meditates in and through the seeker. But each spiritual Master has his own way of teaching meditation.</p>  </div>
