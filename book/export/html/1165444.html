<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am always trying to achieve something. Then, when I achieve something, I feel that I have done it for the world.</p>
<p>No matter what I achieve, I feel that unconsciously or consciously the world has helped me. Therefore, I am extremely grateful to the outer world â€” God the creation. Again, I am also grateful to God the Creator, for He is all my inspiration, all my aspiration, all my realisation and all my satisfaction.</p>
<p>From the outer point of view, I have taken up weightlifting because my knee injury has kept me from running and compelled me to do something else. So the unconscious human in me thought of weightlifting. But the conscious being in me took up weightlifting at the express command of my Inner Pilot. The conscious being in me has listened to and has obeyed implicitly the dictates of my Inner Pilot.</p>  </div>
