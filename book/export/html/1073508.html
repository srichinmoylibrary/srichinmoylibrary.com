<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> I think I breathe in and out and then go. I think I want the air out of me when I go. I made a mistake in Helsinki. All of us jump beforehand every once in a while. But you should always wait for the sound of the gun. Regardless of how quick you are, the body is not going to work without the gun. You get set, hear the noise and you go!</p>
<p>I think it is good to keep the fingers wide open when you run. I used to run with them closed, but now I like the hands open. It is smoother and more relaxed.</p>  </div>
