<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best friend of the worst suffering of man is God's Compassion. God and His Compassion are inseparable. God finds that of all His weapons the Compassion-weapon is the only one that can eventually transform human suffering into divine Bliss; therefore, he uses His Compassion-commander to fight against the commander of suffering, ignorance. The soldiers that obey the commander of Compassion are concern, patience and forgiveness. The soldiers that fight for the commander of suffering are lethargy, darkness and impurity.</p>  </div>
