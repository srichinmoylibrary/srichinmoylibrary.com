<p>God originated Himself from His own Silence.</p>
<p>God was One, but He wanted to become many. Why? He wanted to divinely enjoy Himself, to enjoy His Game, to enjoy the Truth in finite forms. He felt that if He remained all alone, there would be no joy, no <em>Lila</em>. If we want to play any game, we won’t enjoy ourselves alone: we need more players. If we want to play football or soccer, we need players to play on each side. Otherwise there cannot be any game. For His Game, God needed cosmic players. So He created Himself in millions of forms and shapes.</p>
<p>God is the tree and we are the leaves of the tree, God is the ocean and we are tiny drops of water. He is vast, but we have our constant oneness with God, just as the leaves can claim the tree as their very own and the drops can claim the ocean as their very own.</p>
<p>You can look at a leaf or any one of the branches and you can say. “This is the tree.” Or you can look at one of my fingers and immediately you can say, “This is your body,” because the finger cannot be separated from the body. Similarly, when you look at me you can say, “You are God,” because the one God is all-pervading. When you look at God in any of His many forms, it is the same God.</p>
<p>The purpose, the sole purpose of God’s creation is the fulfilment of His Vision and the fulfilment of His Reality. God has envisioned the Truth and the Reality, but He also wants to manifest it. Unless manifestation takes place, God feels that He will not be complete.</p>  </div>
