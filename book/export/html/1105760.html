<p>"My sweet child, My sweeter child,<br /> My sweetest child,<br /> When you come to see Me,<br /> I never ask you to tell Me<br /> What others are doing wrong.<br /> I do not ask you to tell Me<br /> Even what you are doing wrong.<br /> I immediately ask you to tell Me<br /> What you are doing right,<br /> And in how many ways<br /> You are trying to please Me.<br /> My sweet child, My sweeter child,<br /> My sweetest child,<br /> It does not become you<br /> To see others'<br /> Teeming imperfections.<br /> I am constantly dreaming<br /> In and through you<br /> To make you My Eternity's<br /> Absolutely perfect instrument.<br /> Please fulfil My Dream,<br /> My long-cherished Dream,<br /> My only Dream!"</p>
