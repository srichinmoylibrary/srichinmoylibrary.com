<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The safest, surest way is to start gradually. A disciple of mine used to drink tea six times a day, so I asked him to drink it five times, then after a month I told him to reduce it to four times. Eventually he stopped completely. Serious things must be done gradually. If he had stopped all at once, he might have suffered from some serious disease. If the body is not strong, any sudden change in its habits can cause a serious attack upon oneâ€™s health.</p>  </div>
