<p>In my room I keep a book that contains difficult English words. Many times I have looked at that book, marking words here and there.</p>
<p>Today I went to a bookstore and bought another copy of the same book. I thought it would give me inspiration.</p>
<p>I didn't see any other book in the bookstore that I wanted, so just because I wanted to buy something, I bought a book I knew was in my room!</p>
