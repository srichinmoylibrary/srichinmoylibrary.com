<p>The Supreme is dearest to us because He is All-Tolerance. But when we go deep within we see that it is not tolerance at all. It is His all-loving Oneness. The Supreme expresses Himself through human imperfection, human limitations and human failure, not on the strength of tolerance, but on the strength of His spontaneous, soulful Concern for His children.</p>  </div>
