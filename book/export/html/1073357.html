<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you work in your office and get your salary, you put this money inside your pocket. Then you utilise it whenever necessity demands. Early in the morning when you pray and meditate, please feel that you are earning a salary, which is Peace, Light and Bliss. This Peace, Light and Bliss you keep inside your pocket, which is your heart. Then, when you enter into the hustle and bustle of life, when you go to the office or mix with your friends who are not at all spiritual, when the undivine atmosphere is trying to pull you down, then you can enter into your heart and find abundant Peace, Light and Bliss there.</p>
<p>It is not enough just to cry during meditation; when our meditation is over, our life must be an expression of that inner cry. If during meditation we love the world but hate it as soon as our meditation is over, then that is not good meditation. Our meditation must follow us when we enter into the hustle and bustle of life and inspire us to offer our capacity. Our outer life should be an expression of our inner life. In our meditation we realise and in our dedication we manifest. When we meditate, we try to realise the Truth, and when we dedicate ourselves and work in the world, we try to manifest the realisation which we achieved during our meditation.</p>  </div>
