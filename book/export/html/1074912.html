<p>FORTUNE OR MISFORTUNE</p>
<p>Lord, a woman's beauty:<br /> Is it her fortune or misfortune?<br /> Son, it is her fortune.<br /> I gave her the beauty,<br /> I am that beauty.</p>
<p>Lord, a man's duty:<br /> Is it his fortune or misfortune?<br /> Son, it is his fortune.<br /> I gave him the duty,<br /> I am that duty.</p>
<p>Lord, a Yogi's heart:<br /> Is it his fortune or misfortune?<br /> Son, it is his fortune.<br /> I gave him the heart,<br /> I am that heart.</p>
