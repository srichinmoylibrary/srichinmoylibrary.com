<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The role of purity is to make us feel that we are totally one, inseparably one, with God as Consciousness and God as Light. What is Consciousness? Consciousness is the expansion of Light. What is Light? Light is the solidity of the Breath of Consciousness. If we ever want to establish God-Consciousness and God-Light, then we need no other thing save and except purity. Purity is as important as breathing in our spiritual life. Without inhaling and exhaling we cannot live on earth. Purity is like that. It is as important as our living breath.</p>  </div>
