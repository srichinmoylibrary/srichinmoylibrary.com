<p>He is great.<br /> He negates his train of passion<br /> By voluntarily enjoying it.</p>
<p>She is great.<br /> She negates her stream of insecurity<br /> By voluntarily cherishing it.</p>
<p>God is great.<br /> His Compassion forgives man and woman.<br /> God is great.<br /> His Love hides them soulfully.<br /> God is great.<br /> His Light liberates them unconditionally.</p>
