<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Lawyers can become spiritual, more spiritual, most spiritual, provided they can soulfully feel that God Himself is the law, God himself is the lawgiver, God Himself is the verdict and God experiences Himself in and through the different realities in life. Each experience is a fulfilling and illumining lesson for Mother Earth.</p>  </div>
