<p>Good, to read <em>Gitanjali</em>.<br />Better, to explore it.<br />Best, to live its truth.</p>
<p>Before <em>Gitanjali</em> won him world-renown, Tagore was not even a triumphant poet in Bengal, much less a victorious one. Such were then the teeming clouds over the firmament of Bengal.</p>
<p>Tagore became the conqueror,<br />The world became the possessor,<br />in a golden moment of one and the same year — 1913.</p>  </div>
