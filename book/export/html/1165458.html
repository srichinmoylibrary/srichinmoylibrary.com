<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, seeing my physical strength definitely helps you spiritually because you are seeing my aspiration-determination. I do not give up. If I fail today, again I try tomorrow. If I fail tomorrow, again I try the day after tomorrow. As I do not give up, I also do not want my students to give up their aspiration and dedication, but to work more devotedly and more soulfully. It is not an impossible task to have continuous aspiration and dedication.</p>  </div>
