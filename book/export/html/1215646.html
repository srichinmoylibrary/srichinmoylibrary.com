<p>A first class disciple<br /> Is he who sees good<br /> In all, and everywhere.</p>
<p>A second class disciple<br /> Is he who sees good<br /> As good and bad as bad.</p>
<p>A third class disciple<br /> Is he who uses his binoculars<br /> To enlarge the bad qualities<br /> And diminish the good qualities of others.</p>
<p>A fourth class disciple<br /> Is he who enjoys his good qualities<br /> And enjoys others' bad qualities.</p>
<p>A fifth class disciple<br /> Is he who tries to devour<br /> Others' good qualities<br /> And ignores his own bad qualities.</p>
<p>A sixth class disciple<br /> Is he who feels that<br /> Even God Himself is not always<br /> Perfect, let alone his Master.</p>
<p>A seventh class disciple<br /> Is he who thinks that he has made<br /> A serious mistake<br /> In accepting the spiritual life.</p>
