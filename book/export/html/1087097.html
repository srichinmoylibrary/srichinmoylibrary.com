<p>In Florida Savyasachi and I went to a famous bird store, but I have more of a variety in my house. They had only six or eight kinds of birds, but of each kind they had hundreds. What shall I do with number? I was looking for variety.</p>
<p>The lady asked, "Do you have cash? We take only cash."</p>
<p>Savyasachi said, "Yes, we have cash."</p>
<p>Then the lady said, "If you don't buy at least $300 worth, you have to pay a penalty of $25." Now, am I stupid enough to buy $300 worth of birds just to save $25?</p>
<p>We saw some beautiful lovebirds. I wanted to buy one or two. The lady said again, "Mind you, it is cash!"</p>
<p>Then I got disgusted and said, "I am not going to buy it."</p>
<p>The lady looked at me as though to say, "I was right. You don't have cash!" She didn't know it was because I was disgusted with her.</p>
