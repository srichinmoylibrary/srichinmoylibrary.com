MHOF 22-27. On 22 January 1993, Sri Chinmoy met with Dr. Hubert Reynolds, Professor of Peace Studies at Silliman University, at the South Seas Resort Hotel in Dumaguete. These are excerpts from their conversation.</p>
<h2>Professor Reynolds: I really appreciate your coming to a small city like Dumaguete.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The life-tree has many branches. Some branches are large while others may be smaller than the smallest. But they belong to the same life-tree. Because we love the tree, we love all the branches. If we don't care for our little brothers, then why should our big brothers care for us?</p>  </div>
