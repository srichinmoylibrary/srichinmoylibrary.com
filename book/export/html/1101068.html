<p>Where was I? I was inside the Forgiveness-Heart of my Lord Supreme. Where am I? I am inside the Compassion-Eye of my Lord Supreme. Where shall I be? I shall be at the Protection-Feet of my Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>Who was I? I was God's birthless and death-less Vision-Light. Who am I? I am God's earth-ascending aspiration-cry. Who will I be? I will be God's Heaven-descending manifestation-delight.</p>
<p>When I occasionally think of God, He says to me: "My son, you have to cover the length and breadth of My entire creation walking all by yourself."</p>
<p>When I soulfully pray to God, He says to me: "My son, My son, I am waiting for you. I am expecting you in the blue of My Infinity's Sky."</p>
<p>When I silently meditate on God in the inmost recesses of my heart, He says to me: "My son, My son, My son, your fond invitation-hospitality I am accepting with immense Joy."</p>
<p>My soul unconditionally loves my Lord Beloved Supreme. My heart faithfully loves my Lord Beloved Supreme. My mind cautiously loves my Lord Beloved Supreme. My vital dramatically loves my Lord Beloved Supreme. My body fearfully loves my Lord Beloved Supreme. And I love my Lord Beloved Supreme secretly, breathlessly, openly and sleeplessly. Secretly and breathlessly I love my Lord Beloved Supreme in His eternal Duty. Openly and sleeplessly I love my Lord Beloved Supreme in His universal Beauty.</p>
