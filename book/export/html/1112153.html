<p>Three days ago, before going out to walk, I saw a poem by Shephali the great about my piano performance. The poem was lying on my white table. I was pleased that she had been so inspired by my piano.</p>
<p>Then, at my 200-metre mark, whom did I see? Shephali! As soon as you think of someone, out of the blue that person appears.</p>
