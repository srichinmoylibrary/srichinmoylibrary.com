<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The causal body, the subtle body and the physical body are all, to some extent, impermanent. They lose their existence when the soul leaves the body. As soon as the soul leaves, the physical dissolves into the five elements. But sometimes the causal body stays for a longer time with the soul than the physical and subtle, because the soulâ€™s potentiality is within it in seed form.</p>
<p>Then, when the soul reincarnates, it takes a new causal, a new subtle and a new physical body. First it takes a causal body. Then from the causal comes the subtle body. The subtle body is like the outer body, but we do not see it until we have the inner vision. Then comes the outer body.</p>  </div>
