<p>I thought I was perfect,<br /> O my soul.<br /> But now that I am following you<br /> I clearly see that I was<br /> Millions of miles away from perfection.<br /> Now a hope-dawn you have granted me<br /> To reach the perfection-day,<br /> For I am following you<br /> Sleeplessly and unconditionally.</p>
