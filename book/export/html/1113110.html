<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Life after death is inevitable. If there were only one life on earth, then it would be impossible for us to accomplish the things that we have to accomplish. God, being all Satisfaction, will not allow us to remain unsatisfied. He will always want us to be fully satisfied. In one incarnation we cannot fulfil our aspiration: we cannot reach the Highest. So here we have life and then we pass through a tunnel which we call death. There we take a little rest and then we come back again. If there were no reincarnation, then no soul would be able to manifest the ultimate Truth. In one incarnation it is impossible.</p>  </div>
