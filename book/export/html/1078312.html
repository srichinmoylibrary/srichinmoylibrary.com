<p>THE LOVER IN HIM</p>
<p>The philosopher in him knows<br /> All about Heaven-capacity<br /> And<br /> Earth-possibility,<br /> But does not know<br /> What is inside his heart-room.</p>
<p>The poet in him can tell you<br /> All about God,<br /> But he can never correctly tell you<br /> Where God is.</p>
<p>The lover in him does not want to know<br /> Who God is<br /> And<br /> Where God is;<br /> It is enough for him<br /> That God really <em>is</em>.</p>
