  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Were teachers better in the olden days?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. In the olden days, especially in the Vedic era, the teachers used to consider their students as true members of their immediate family. Therefore, the teachers shared with the students their wisdom-light constantly and unreservedly, and imparted to their students the supreme knowledge: <em>Tat twam asi,</em> "Thou art that, That thou art. In essence and substance, my children, you are the One without a second." The teachers of the hoary past not only inspired their students, but also aspired in and through them to help them see the effulgence of their own inner sun. This is the sun that illumines the darkness of millennia and transforms truth-experience-possibility into truth-realisation-inevitability.</p>  </div>
