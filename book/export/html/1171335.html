    <title>Question: I had a dream where I saw fairies who were like little babies — all different sizes — running away. In another dream, a fairy was making a very silly noise and it made me wake up laughing.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If in a room twenty angels come to you, they will have so much brightness and poise. But in the same room if you have three fairies, it is enough. It will be like a kindergarten. Again, there can be some exceptional fairies. Exceptional fairies are so cute; they are so in tune with the highest Divinity. But it is very, very rare to find that kind of fairy.</p>  </div>
