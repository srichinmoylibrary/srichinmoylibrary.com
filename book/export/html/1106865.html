<h2>Sri Chinmoy: If I were going to give either a rose or a mango as prasad, and you had to make the choice, tell me which one you would choose, and tell the reason.</h2>

<p><em>Christopher:</em> I'm not very aesthetic and I can't really appreciate the beauty of nature through my eyes. I can get more joy through my mouth, my physical. So I would choose the mango because the mango would give me more joy, and the joy I would get would last forever.</p>
<p><em>Matthew:</em> I'd choose the mango as well because when eating it I'd think of your consciousness going through me and becoming part of me. It would come as well with the rose, but I think it would be more difficult for me to think of that. So I would choose the mango because I feel it would become part of me.</p>
<p><em>Ashley:</em> I would pick the rose because even after the rose lost its beauty and its freshness I could still keep the petals. So the rose would stay for a longer time than the mango.</p>
<p><em>Joshua:</em> I would choose the rose because even after it died I could still see and feel its beauty within my heart.</p>
<p><em>Amanda:</em> I would choose the rose because if I ate the mango it would be gone so quickly. But if I had the rose, I could breathe in the fragrance and admire its beauty for a very long time.</p>
<p><em>David:</em> I'd pick the mango because it has good juice.</p>
<p><em>Jennifer:</em> I'd choose the mango because it would be very sweet. As I was eating it, I would think of Guru and get a lot of joy out of it.</p>
<p><em>Sarah:</em> I would take the rose because it reminds me of Guru's heart, whereas the mango wouldn't remind me of Guru's heart so much. The flower is more like the heart to me than the mango</p>
<p><em>Andrew:</em> I would take the rose because I don't like mangoes.</p>
<p><em>Stephanie:</em> I would take the rose because mangoes are messy and the rose smells nice.</p>
<p><em>Christine:</em> I would take the rose because it smells good and it lasts longer than the mango.</p>
<p><em>Daniel:</em> I would take the rose because I feel that the rose would go right to my heart but the mango would just go to my stomach.</p>
<p><em>Brittany:</em> I would take the rose because I find that I can appreciate nature's beauty more than I can appreciate a good taste.</p>
<p><em>Nicole:</em> I would take the rose because after you eat the mango you can't really remember the taste, but when you think back to the rose you can remember its beauty.</p>
<p><em>John:</em> I would rather have the mango because I like mangoes better than roses and I think they taste good.</p>
<p><em>James:</em> I would take the mango because the rose stem has thorns on it and it hurts your hand.</p>
<p><em>Justin:</em> I would take the mango because I would find it easier to appreciate the sweetness and beauty in the mango, and roses make me sneeze.</p>
<p><em>Robert:</em> I would appreciate the rose more because I can appreciate smell much more than taste. Also, the rose would last longer.</p>
<p><em>Heather:</em> I would also pick the rose because I don't like mangoes and I think the rose is much more beautiful.</p>
<p><em>Elizabeth:</em> I would take the rose because it reminds me of the soul's beauty. A mango is good but it doesn't have the same kind of beauty as a rose.</p>
<p><em>Samantha:</em> I would take the rose because it would last much longer. Also, I would be able to see the purity of the rose, whereas the mango I would probably eat in a day or two, and then I wouldn't be able to really remember the taste or anything.</p>
<p><em>Megan:</em> I would take the rose because I could appreciate its beauty and also because it lasts much longer.</p>
<p><em>Joseph:</em> I would take the mango because it tastes much better and I like mangoes. I wouldn't take the rose because it has thorns.</p>
<p><em>Ryan:</em> My mind tells me to take the mango and my heart tells me to take the rose. So I would say the rose because I could appreciate the inner beauty of the flower.</p>
<p><em>Brandon:</em> I would take the rose because of the purity that it offers.</p>
<p><em>William:</em> I would take the rose because it has what I desperately need â€” purity's fragrance.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My nickname is Madal. My real name is Chinmoy. As Madal I would choose the rose and try to see and feel its beauty and fragrance inside my heart-garden. Then I would be able to purify my heart and see and feel my Beloved Supreme in my heart-garden smiling at me. But as Chinmoy I would choose the mango, because while tasting the mango I would think of divine Nectar, which is infinitely sweeter. I know if I can drink Nectar from my prayer and meditation, then I will be immortal and will be able to serve God forever and forever, throughout Eternity.</p>  </div>
