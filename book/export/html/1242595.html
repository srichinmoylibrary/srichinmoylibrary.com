<p>Aspiration is nothing short of God's Compassion. God's Compassion is nothing short of God's Satisfaction. God's Satisfaction is nothing short of God's Perfection. Compassion becomes Reality and Reality becomes Satisfaction and Satisfaction becomes Perfection. What we call aspiration is God the Compassion in us and for us.</p>
<p>Your desire tells you that the world has to be at your feet. Your aspiration tells you that the world does not have to be at your feet, only you have to be where God wants you to be. If God wants you to be at the foot of the reality-tree, then you will be there. If God wants you to be at the top of the tree, then you will be there. Aspiration is God's Satisfaction in us. To please God in God's own Way is real aspiration.</p>  </div>
