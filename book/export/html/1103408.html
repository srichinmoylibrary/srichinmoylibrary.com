<p>My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!<br /> You are telling me<br /> That a seeker does not need<br /> Strict spiritual disciplines.<br /> He does not need austerities.<br /> He does not need the highest<br />   And deepest meditation.<br /> What he needs to realise You<br /> Is only pure, pure, pure devotion.<br /> You are also telling me<br /> That all are equal in Your Sight,<br /> But those who have sincere<br />   Devotion to You<br /> Have a very, very special place<br />   In Your Heart,<br /> And their hearts<br />   Are Your choicest homes.<br /> My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!</p>
