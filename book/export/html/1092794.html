<p>After Subhas had left India, Mahatma stoically announced to the world that the heart-rending slogan "Quit India," which Subhas had wanted him to introduce, was to be used by all Indians. It spread throughout the length and breadth of the sub-continent like wildfire.</p>
<p>Here, again, Subhas was right. When Mahatma said, "Quit India," the entire nation accepted it devotedly, proudly and self-givingly. Alas, at this point, Mahatma's sincerity-heart was found somewhere beyond Infinity's farthest shore. Nowhere did he acknowledge the true source of this slogan.</p>  </div>
