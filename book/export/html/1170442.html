<ol><li>Deshabandhu left the earth. The Master-Seer of the Age, from his silence-hushed Ashram, telegraphed a message to a daily journal that had wired for a comment. "Chitta Ranjan's death is a supreme loss. Consummately endowed with political intelligence, constructive imagination, magnetism, a driving force combining a very strong will and uncommon plasticity of mind for vision and tact of the hour, he was the one man after Tilak who could have led India to swaraj."</li>
