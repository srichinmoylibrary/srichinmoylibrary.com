<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is a very good thing, when the mind tells you to carry it with you. But you have to know what “you” means. At that time, “you” means your intense aspiration. You have become one with your aspiration and inside your aspiration, what looms large is your soul. When you have become one with your soul, you try to go beyond the mind. Now at that time, if the mind says, “Please carry me,” you have to ascertain whether the mind is asking devotedly or with a kind of demand, such as this: “I have helped you all this time and now you are going beyond me. You have to take me with you.” If it is this demanding mind that wants to be carried with you into the regions of the soul, it is very bad. If it goes there, it will only create problems for you it will say, “No, no, this place is very unpleasant. Come down, come down. We experienced much more happiness down there. Come down.” But if it is the devoted mind that wants to go with you to the Transcendental Beyond, it will not create any problems for you. It will cry for illumination and transformation along with you.</p>
<p>To the demanding mind, you have to say, “No, you have created enough problems for me and now if I go into a room that is all light, you will extinguish the light and make me dark again. You will create problems for me no matter where I go. If I go to heaven, you will create hell for me there.”</p>
<p>But the devoted mind will be ready to accept the light. True, it has created problems for you in the past. Around you is darkness, the mind has created darkness and you are in darkness. But this time the devoted mind says, “I have tortured you for a long time. I am very sorry. Forgive me. Now I want to go to the place where you are going. I want to share the light with you. I, too, want to grow into the light. I, too, want to become a conscious instrument of the light.”</p>  </div>
