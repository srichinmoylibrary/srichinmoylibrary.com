<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, your aspiration has not to be specific in that way. Aspiration must not come from the mind. Please do not think that you have to aspire for peace, for strength, for anything specific. If the mind dictates to you, its message will be all wrong. The mind will immediately tell you to pray for a thousand and one things at a time. But aspiration is something spontaneous. It comes directly from the heart. In the morning, or anytime when you start your meditation, a spontaneous feeling will come from your heart. This feeling will compel you to pray for something or to invoke something. This feeling does not operate through the mind.</p>  </div>
