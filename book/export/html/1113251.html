<p>"Nolini-da, I have received a letter from Dilip-da."</p>
<p>"From Dilip? To you?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Recently I wrote an article about his father, D.L. Roy. I asked him to correct my article. He did so and sent it back to me with a letter. He has written much about you."</p>
<p>"About me?"</p>
<p>"You may wish to see it."</p>
<p>Nolini-da read the letter and said: "Mad, mad! Dilip compares me with his most illustrious father. He is really mad. I am sure you have told him that I am writing an article on his father."</p>
<p>I said: "No, I have not told him that. He has heard it from some other source, it seems."</p>
<p>"Anyway, if you answer his letter, tell him that I shall try to write something about his father. But don't say that I <em>am</em> writing something. You know me well. I may not get the necessary time to complete it."</p>  </div>
