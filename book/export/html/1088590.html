<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God alone knows why He favoured India and why He Himself descended there and shined His Light so brightly on Indian soil. One can say that India was more receptive than other countries. Again, one can say that it has nothing to do with receptivity but that God, out of His unconditional Compassion, chose India to receive His Light in infinite measure.</p>  </div>
