<p>Amrita-da said to me: "Chinmoy, I understand that Nolini has said much about me in his class. I am quite eager to know from your lips whether this is true."</p>
<p>"I am so sorry, I did not go to his class," I said.</p>
<p>"Why?" asked Amrita.</p>
<p>"I wanted to, but he didn't give me permission."</p>
<p>"That means he thinks that you know French well."</p>
<p>"No, it is the other way around, as far as I can tell. His students know French far better than I do and I would only create unnecessary trouble for him. That is why he does not want me to attend his French class."</p>
<p>"I am sure you have taken the divine attitude and are not upset at all.',</p>
<p>"Of course, Amrita-da, I know that Nolini-da always knows what is best for me." I told Amrita-da that I would get firsthand information from a most reliable student and bring him the news about what Nolini-da had said about him.</p>
<p>"Chinmoy, whether I deserve it or not is one thing, but still I am eager to know it."</p>  </div>
