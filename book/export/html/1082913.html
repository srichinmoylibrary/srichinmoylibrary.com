<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I can help my soul to smile more often by becoming a conscious instrument, a devoted and surrendered instrument of God, the Inner Pilot. Now how can I do this? How can I become a devoted instrument? I can become a devoted instrument by remembering what once upon a time I was and what I have now become. That does not mean that I will always dig into my past. Only for a second I shall try to recollect what I was twenty years ago and what I have become. Who has made me what I am now? It is God within me, through my soul, who has done it. When I know this, then automatically gratitude comes to the fore. If I can offer gratitude to God, then He increases my power of dedicated service, love, devotion and surrender.</p>  </div>
