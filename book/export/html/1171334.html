<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The cosmic gods and goddesses are infinitely higher than the angels. There is no comparison between the power of the cosmic gods and goddesses and the angels. As I said before, between a real doctor and a nurse, there is a great difference. When there is an emergency, a serious medical problem — a bullet has entered into my chest — the nurse will never dare to operate. The doctor has to come.</p>  </div>
