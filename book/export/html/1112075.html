<p>After being greeted by the man in the van, I made a left turn. At the Kew Motor Inn, two water pipes had broken, and there was a flood, so I had to take a detour. At the one-mile mark also the water was knee-deep. I had to turn one block before that.</p>
<p>But that was not enough adventure for one morning. Before I reached two miles, a Puerto Rican man in a car stopped and said, "Hi! How can I get to the Triboro."</p>
<p>I smiled and said, "I don't know how to get there."</p>
<p>He said, "The hell with you!" and drove away very fast.</p>
<p>Just a mile before that, somebody saw me and was so happy! His morning started with such joy because he saw me. Then a mile later I ruined somebody else's joy.</p>
