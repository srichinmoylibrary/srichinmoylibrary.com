<h2>Question: After I have a good meditation I lose it. What can I do to maintain my meditation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Consciously, you don't want to preserve the treasure. Either you mix with unaspiring people or you don't want to preserve your meditation. You are not valuing the treasure. You think: "Even if I lose it I will get it again tomorrow." No, you have to value it, preserve it in the heart-pocket. I always tell you to assimilate your meditation. Once you eat something you must assimilate it.</p>  </div>
