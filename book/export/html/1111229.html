<p>Yesterday I was running at five in the morning near Thomas Edison High School. At a little traffic island I had to stop for the cars. All of a sudden a car came right into the island, stopping just thirty metres from me. The man seemed drunk. If it had not been for the trees, it would have been a very close call.</p>
