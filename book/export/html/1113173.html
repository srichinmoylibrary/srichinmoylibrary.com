<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no difference between divine love and divine wisdom. They go together. In human love there is no wisdom. At the end of the journey of human love, it is all frustration. But if divine love is there inside human love, then the divine love guides, the divine love illumines and the divine love fulfils the human love.</p>
<p>God is all knowledge, all wisdom. Just because He is all wisdom, He loves me, He loves you, He loves everyone. He feels that there cannot be anything greater or more fulfilling than oneness. This oneness we get only in divine love. So wisdom and love go together. Wisdom gives us the message that we can be the strongest and the most powerful only when we become universal. If you maintain your individuality and I maintain my individuality, then how can we become one? When we become one, we become the strongest. "United we stand, divided we fall." This is the message we get.</p>
<p>Love itself is wisdom and wisdom is also light. The moment the wisdom-sun dawns within us, we feel that the whole universe belongs to us. Our oneness with the universe becomes inseparable. If this is not wisdom, then what else is? This wisdom is founded on divine love, which is the conscious expansion of our existence. So love and wisdom go together. If we cultivate love, wisdom will come; and if we aspire for wisdom, then love will come and inundate us.</p>  </div>
