<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Often yes, but not always. We meet people who were in our past lives, but we also meet new people. Since the Supreme wants us to grow and flower, He may place in our path persons who can help us, teach us, inspire us and lead us. And then there are associations that are not important, people who casually pass us as we carry on our normal activities.</p>  </div>
