<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God lives not only in Guru's heart, but in your heart and in everybody's heart. Why does He live in Guru's heart? When you say He lives in Guru's heart that means that you feel that He lives only in Guru's heart and not in your heart. If this is your feeling, then I wish to say that God lives in Guru's heart because Guru knows that inside his heart is a small room. The name of that room is called gratitude-room. God always lives inside that small room. Since Guru lives in that room, he sees and feels God all the time. When you also do the same, when you also feel gratitude, then you too will discover the gratitude-room inside your heart. You will see that God lives inside your heart as well.</p>  </div>
