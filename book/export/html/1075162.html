<p>IS IT TRUE?</p>
<p>"A great talker<br /> Is a great liar."<br /> I asked God<br /> If this statement is true.<br /> God said, "No!<br /> Son, every second I speak<br /> To My countless children,<br /> And I never tell a lie."</p>
<p>"A great saint<br /> Can never be a liar."<br /> I asked God<br /> If this statement is true.<br /> God said, "No!<br /> Son, your great saint<br /> Has convinced his mind<br /> That he has surpassed<br /> My creation, which is nothing<br /> Other than Myself, in purity.<br /> Can anybody surpass Me in purity?<br /> Son, what else is he<br /> If not a liar?"</p>
