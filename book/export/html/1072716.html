<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Light and delight are inseparable. Both embody the Truth, but each contains particular aspects of the Truth which we can invoke. When we invoke light, we feel that our life of ignorance, which has lasted for millennia, will be removed; we try to illumine our life of darkness. When we invoke delight, we feel that our suffering of millennia will be removed; we try to transform our pangs and suffering into delight.</p>  </div>
