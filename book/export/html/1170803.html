SCA 340-345. Sri Chinmoy had this conversation with A. at Annam Brahma on 11 May 1996, the day after her birthday.</p>
<h2>Please ask me two questions</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please ask me two questions. The first question I will answer because of all the expressions that you have given me to inspire me in my poetry. Since the beginning of creation, you have given me the most expressions! Nobody can come near you. The other question I will answer because you make most delicious salad. So you get two questions.</p>  </div>
