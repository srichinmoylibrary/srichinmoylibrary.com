<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For an unaspiring person, the strongest divine power is Godâ€™s unconditional Compassion. For an aspiring person, the strongest divine power is the power that makes him constantly feel his inseparable oneness with the Supreme. So if one is unaspiring, God shows His infinite Compassion, and that is the strongest divine power. But if somebody is aspiring, then God shows him constant, inseparable, all-pervading, universal oneness. For him, that is the strongest power that God is showing.</p>  </div>
