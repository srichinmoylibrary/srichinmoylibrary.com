 <p>
MPB 2-15. During the first three days of August 1978, Sri Chinmoy offered a number of prayers to his Pilot Beloved after meditations at the Centre, the United Nations, the Centre Church, the 144th Street Gym and the Jamaica High School track. These prayers are reproduced here.</p>
<h2>I do not know</h2>

<p>O my Pilot Beloved, I do not know what I am praying for. But I do know that I am praying to You, to You, to You.</p>
<p>O my Pilot Beloved, I do not know what I am meditating for. But I do know that I am meditating on You, on You, on You.</p>
<p>"My Immortality's child, as long as you know that you are praying to Me and you are meditating on Me, you do not have to know what you are praying for and what you are meditating for. Since your heart's cry is sincere and your life's smile is sincere, I wish to tell you what you are praying for and what you are meditating for. You are praying for My Eternity's Compassion and you are meditating for My Infinity's Vision."</p>
