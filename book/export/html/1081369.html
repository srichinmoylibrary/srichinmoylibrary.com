<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can always see beauty within yourself only by praying and meditating. When you pray, you have to think that your Source is one; and when you meditate, you have to feel that you are for all. When you are praying to the One, you are going up, up, up to the Highest. When you are meditating on the many, you are spreading your light to all.</p>  </div>
