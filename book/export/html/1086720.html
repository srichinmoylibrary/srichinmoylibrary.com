<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God means love. What does love mean? Love means satisfaction. What does satisfaction mean? Satisfaction means a joint action of God and man. What is the joint action? Smile. What is smile? Smile is God's manifested Height and man's discovered depth.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>I am telling you a great secret: you are a fantastic Dream of God</em>, Agni Press, 1974<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/gsdg-10</p></small>    </div>  </body>
