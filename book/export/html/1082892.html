<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many ways to transform human nature. But two main ways I would like to mention. One way is to bring down into the system the divine, all-illumining Light of the Supreme, enlarging one's receptivity-vessel. This is the most important way. Before human nature is transformed, it is full of darkness. Darkness can be removed only by bringing in light, and not by anything else. We have to bring down light from above consciously and constantly and then expand our receptivity. The more we expand our receptivity, the more we can hold light inside ourselves.</p>
<p>Another way is to see the divine light in each human being and not to see anything else. Just because we see something undivine in ourselves and in others it has become impossible for us to transform either our own nature or human nature in general. But no matter what they do, what they say or what they are, if we consciously and constantly see only the divine light in others — the light we are bringing down from above — then automatically human nature has to be transformed. If we see light in each individual and in our own nature, then it is not only possible but also inevitable to transform human nature and earth's nature. While bringing down light and enlarging our receptivity and while seeing light inside others, we transform human nature and our own nature.</p>  </div>
