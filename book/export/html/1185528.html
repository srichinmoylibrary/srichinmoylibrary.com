<p>An unmarried man asked his married friend, “Please tell me, before you got married, what kind of conversation did you have with your wife? And now that you are married, what kind of conversation are both of you enjoying?”</p>
<p>“Well, before our marriage, our conversation always started the same way: ‘I wish to hear more, tell me more, more.’ And at the end of the conversation, we also used to say, ‘I wish to hear more, I wish to hear more.’ Now, after the marriage, our conversation starts this way: ‘Shut up!’ And it ends also with the same message: ‘Shut up!"'</p>  </div>
