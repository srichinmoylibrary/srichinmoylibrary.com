<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No! Human beings are not on earth to suffer. On the contrary, human beings are on earth for illumination. We have to know that our Source is God, who is all Love, all Light, all Satisfaction. He is not suffering; He is all Bliss. Thousands of years ago the Vedic Seers offered us a most significant message: “From Delight we came into existence; in Delight we grow and at the end of our journey’s close, into Delight we shall retire.” Suffering is not the ultimate Reality. The ultimate Reality is Bliss. Sometimes we go through an experience which we call suffering. But eventually we will arrive at Delight, and this Delight is our real Reality.</p>  </div>
