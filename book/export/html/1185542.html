<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each disciple has his own level of development and the Guru has to guide each one individually. If someone is more developed, then the Guru has to deal with him in one way. If somebody is less developed, then the Guru has to deal with him differently. There is no systematic rule. A lion, a cat, a donkey and a monkey will not all be of the same standard. It is not possible. So what the Guru does is tell them “You come individually and meditate with me. I will give you your meditation and I will know when you are achieving something inwardly. Then I shall help you and guide you.” So the Guru cannot deal with all in the same way. God has given us ten fingers, and they are not of the same shape; they are not of the same length and breadth.</p>  </div>
