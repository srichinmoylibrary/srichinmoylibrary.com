<p>In 1964 I went into a store in Greenwich Village. It was a ten-cent store—they said everything was ten cents. I was so happy because I only had two dollars with me. I selected a few things and then I went to pay. They said I owed three dollars.</p>
<p>I said, “What is this? Everything is supposed to be ten cents!”</p>
<p>Then they showed me that on the sign there was an arrow pointing up, just after it said ten cents.</p>
<p>Last month, I went to Greenwich Village to see a doctor for my leg and I looked for that famous ten-cent store. But it is no longer there.</p>  </div>
