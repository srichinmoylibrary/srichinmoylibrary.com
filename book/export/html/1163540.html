<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here we are observing divine silence and not human silence. In human silence we may keep our mouth shut, but our mind is constantly talking, scolding and insulting. The mind is doing everything. But if we can maintain divine silence, then from this divine silence we will immediately get Light from God. Then we can offer this Light to the persons who are creating problems for us.</p>  </div>
