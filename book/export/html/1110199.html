<blockquote>
<p>A great poet looks at society and those who comprise society with a remarkable sense of detachment... The lotus, though born in mud and rooted in mud in which the frogs and other lowly animals live, stands above, unsoiled by the mud. That is how great poets also lived and are trying to live. Greatness comes to them from this detachment.</p>
<p><em>Symbols of Progress</em><br /><em>by Ranasinghe Premadasa</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Detachment â€” what is it? It is an excellent beginning for the journey toward enlightenment. The poet in the President at once embodies the wisdom-light of yore and the vision of tomorrow's dawn. Whoever is for world-illumination and world-perfection can profitably listen to the Seer-Poet-President.</p>  </div>
