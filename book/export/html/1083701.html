<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Saint Madhuri. Madhuri realised God long ago, and now she is only paying God back for her realisation. She is saying, "God, take it back. I don't want to be indebted to You. Then, when the time comes, give it to my son, Christopher." She is depositing money in the bank, so that Christopher without meditating can realise God.</p>  </div>
