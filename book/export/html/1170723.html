<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! If you wake up at any time during the night, for any reason, you will feel something if you wash your eyes, ears and nose and then meditate for five minutes on your bed. You do not have to sit in front of your shrine, and you do not have to sit cross-legged; but you must sit properly â€” with your spine erect.</p>
<p>Then imagine a particular colour. If you want to feel God's infinite Love for you, think of the colour blue. If you want God's infinite Energy or Strength, then think of the colour green. If you want God's Delight or Happiness, then think of the colour purple. You can imagine any colour, but blue is very good because blue represents Infinity. When you invoke Infinity, if it sees that your vessel is very limited, it tries to increase your receptivity by giving you more enthusiasm or eagerness. At that time it acts like a mother. The child has such eagerness to lift up ten pounds, but he has the capacity to lift up only five pounds. So Infinity, like a mother, immediately gives the child the strength, energy, joy and enthusiasm so that he can lift up ten pounds.</p>  </div>
