<p>For me, if ten million people cannot do something and then one individual comes who can do it, it is a miracle. If millions and millions of people cannot do something — on any plane — and one individual does it, it is a miracle. Only our mind gets stuck, that is why we do not use the word. If one individual writes an immortal song, a song that comes from another world — like “Ave Maria” — then, according to me, that is a miracle. Look at all the unimaginable things President Gorbachev and President Mandela have done — are those things not miracles? Sudhahota’s nine gold medals — is that immortal achievement not a miracle? In so many fields, miracles are taking place if we have the eyes to see them.</p>
