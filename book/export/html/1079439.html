<p>“I also need another favour<br /> From you:<br /> You will tell your parents<br /> How happy and grateful<br /> You are to them<br /> For bringing you into this world.<br /> Still one more favour I need,<br /> And this is the last favour<br /> You will have to do for Me,<br /> My child.<br /> You will have to claim Me<br /> All the time,<br /> Not missing a second,<br /> As your own, very own.“</p>
<p>God, I have already started.</p>
