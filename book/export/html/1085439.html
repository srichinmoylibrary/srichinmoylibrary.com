<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to lead a better life, a disciplined life, a pure life, I feel that a vegetarian diet is necessary. Those who eat meat, unconsciously are taking in the consciousness of an animal. In addition to their hostile and other undivine qualities, animals have tremendous restlessness. When we take in mild foods, our consciousness automatically becomes mild, soft and sweet. But when we eat meat, we take in the restless, destructive consciousness of animals.</p>
<p>All the time we are taking in the consciousness of other persons and objects. When we stand in front of a spiritual Master, immediately we take in his consciousness, his vibration. He is offering us what he has to give. Similarly, the animal offers us what it has to give; and what it has to give are its animal qualities. It is up to us to accept or reject these qualities. So for the beginner, or for anyone who is following the spiritual path, it is advisable to have a pure vegetarian diet. This helps considerably.</p>
<p>Purity is also necessary. One has to feel that purity does not come from merely washing the body ten times a day. Some people feel that if they take a shower six times a day they will be pure. Far from il! A fish is in the water twenty-four hours a day, yet the consciousness of a fish is not purer than that of any human. Cleanliness is next to godliness, true. We can take two or three showers a day, but to go on taking showers six or seven times in order to be pure is absolutely wrong. We can easily make the gross physical body pure if we install a living shrine inside our heart for the object of our adoration, who is God. We know that God exists, but where? Where can we see Him first? Inside our heart. God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, but that does not satisfy us. What satisfies us is that God is all love. And where is this love? It is inside our heart. We can establish purity within ourselves by feeling God's Presence inside our heart.</p>
<p>Then, if we really want to lead a better life, a disciplined life, and to have a pure character, we have to mix with those who have already established some purity in their outer lives. Every day a sincere seeker must associate with someone who is fairly advanced in the spiritual life. If the seeker has the opportunity to see his Master regularly, then the living presence of the Master will inundate his outer being with purity. It is not possible for the Master to be physically present everywhere, but if the seeker is sincere, if the seeker can have free access to the Master's heart on the strength of his own inner need, then the Master's divine consciousness can enter into the seeker's life every day and flood his life with purity.</p>  </div>
