  <h1 class="book-heading">The story of Ganapati</h1>
  
 
<p>These are all true stories about a little Bengali village boy named Ganapati. Ganapati came of a large family. He had many aunts, uncles and cousins. One of these cousins, whose name was Suren, was the cause of a most serious tragedy in the family. If ever Ganapati were to write a novel about his cousin’s life, perhaps he would get the Nobel Prize! It is exactly like one of Shakespeare’s plays in which tragedy becomes such wonderful comedy!</p>  </div>
