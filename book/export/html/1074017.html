<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Someone new to meditation can easily tell whether his consciousness is rising, steady or falling. If he feels purity inside his heart, inside his entire being, then his consciousness is steady. If he feels sincerity, then his consciousness is rising. But if he becomes a victim to doubt concerning what he is feeling or observing, then his consciousness is falling.</p>  </div>
