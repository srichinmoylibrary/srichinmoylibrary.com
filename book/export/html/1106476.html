<p>Since last night I have had a cramp in my right side in the region of my waist and it is still there. First I tried to use my seated calf machine, but it was out of order. The force that I was applying was exactly the same force that I used to use every time, but today 900 pounds and 1,000 pounds were failures. I feel that one of the plates has slipped somehow.</p>
<p>Then I tried to lift 200 pounds in each arm simultaneously. I was so disgusted with my first attempt. The dumbbells did not move, they did not talk even. Today is my day of misery.</p>
