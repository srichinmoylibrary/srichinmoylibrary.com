<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your inner running is infinitely more important than your outer running. If you can run two miles a day, I shall be very happy. And if you can only run five times a week, I shall not be as disappointed as you think. But try to run daily, so that your body does not enjoy either inertia or revolt.</p>  </div>
