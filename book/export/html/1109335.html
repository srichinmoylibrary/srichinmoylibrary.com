<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the same way, always in the same way. God the Mother and God the Father are not two separate beings. They are eternally one. Physical parents are two different individuals, but God the Mother and God the Father are one in essence and one in substance. They are one in their Dream-World, and they are one in their Reality-World. Mother and Father are like two eyes. When they look at a flower they see the same perfection with the same divine light, and they smell the fragrance of the flower in the same way.</p>  </div>
