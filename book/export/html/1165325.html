<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why should there be links? If you live in one house and then go to live in some other house, it does not mean that both the houses have to have some physical connection. Today you can pass through New York or Connecticut because they are right next to each other. But if you want to visit another state, it doesn’t have to be adjacent to either of them. Creation is separate from the soul’s evolution. While you are in this house, you are evolving; while in another house you are also evolving. The soul can take one incarnation as a bird and another incarnation as a lion. But that does not mean that birds and lions have any link.</p>  </div>
