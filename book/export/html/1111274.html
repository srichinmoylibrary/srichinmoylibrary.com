<p>After I had run 400 metres more, I saw a group of boys standing opposite one of my disciples' houses. One white boy was so excited to see me running. "Oh, Sri Chinmoy!" he said.</p>
<p>A black boy said, "No good, he takes away everybody's money."</p>
<p>The white boy said, "No, my father said he is a saint like our Christian saints. He never charges any money."</p>
<p>I didn't want to enter into their conversation, so I just kept going.</p>
