<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the outer world we donâ€™t remember in detail all of our experiences. They are real for a few days and then they are totally erased, because they do not stay in our day-to-day consciousness. But we keep the essence of these experiences in our inner life. In the inner world, everything is recorded permanently.</p>  </div>
