  <h1 class="book-heading">Selflessness</h1>
  
 
<p>Man is infinite, man is eternal, man is immortal. But how can we really feel that we are infinite, eternal, immortal? We can do so only on the strength of our selflessness and sacrifice to the Supreme in ourselves and in humanity.</p>
<p>Selflessness must be properly understood. If one feels that it is by virtue of sacrifice that he is becoming totally one with the rest of the world, then that is not selflessness. To be really selfless, one must already feel and realise his oneness with the entire creation. Otherwise, one will always be under the impression that he is doing something grand and great by offering himself and serving someone. But when oneness has already been achieved, felt and realised, at that time selflessness really acquires its meaning. The seeker knows that he is one with the universe, and with this oneness he is now playing his own part. At that time we can't call selflessness something that we are offering. No, it is something that we are growing into. Each selfless act leads us to something greater, and that something greater also is ours.</p>
<p>Real selflessness we see only in God. He did not want to separate Himself from His creation. Creator and creation went together, go together and will forever go together. So it is God's supreme selflessness that we see in His creation. If we can have that selflessness, that reality and vision in our human life, this will be the full manifestation of selflessness in reality. Let us try to realise our oneness with the rest of the world and with God's creation. Then our Goal will be right in front of us.</p>  </div>
