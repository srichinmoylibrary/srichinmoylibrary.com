<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything depends on God's Hour. When the Hour strikes, we see the reality, we feel the reality and we become the reality. This song I composed many years ago in honour of Gary Ackerman. These students of mine will now sing it. They have come from all over the world to observe the anniversary of my arrival in America 29 years ago. They are from Great Britain, France, Austria, Japan and other places.</p>
<p><em>[Sri Chinmoy's students sing the Gary Ackerman song.]</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am Gary's genuine fan.</p>
<p><em>Russell Wilson:</em> He feels the same way about you, Guruji. That's unbelievable â€” really amazing!</p>  </div>
