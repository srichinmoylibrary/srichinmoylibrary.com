<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He will get more understanding, more illumination. He will be able to accept the world rather than negate the world, for the world is God's creation, and Creator and creation always go together. If we accept them together, then we will be able to fulfil the Supreme Reality within us.</p>  </div>
