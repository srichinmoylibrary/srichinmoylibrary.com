<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know that the spiritual life is neither a bed of thorns nor a bed of roses. There are always deserts to be crossed in life's journey. Everybody has to go through these deserts. When your aspiration is wavering, there are various ways to reinforce it. If you find it difficult to meditate, what you should do at that time is read inspiring books written by seekers who are searching for God. Try to feel that the seeker you are reading about is no one other than yourself. Take each inspiring thought or each cry of aspiration as your own. The writer has used his name, but it is your feelings and your aspiration that he is writing about. As he wants to go towards the light, you should feel that you also want to go towards the light. You can also read the writings of great spiritual Masters. When you do this, you should try to feel that compassion is being showered on your soul, heart, mind and vital from these sacred books.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do is mix with seekers who are not having the same difficulties. You can go to a place where spiritual people are praying and meditating, or you can talk to spiritual people on the phone and mix with them. They will be able to help you immensely. You know the saying, "Birds of a feather flock together." In the spiritual life, it is absolutely necessary to have spiritual friends. If today you are feeling disappointed or disheartened, a friend who is near you will be able to lift you up. Then tomorrow, when your friend is down, you will be able to lift him up. In the ordinary world you can create new friends overnight. But to have a true spiritual friend is a great Blessing from God.</p>
<p>Eventually you may feel the necessity of finding a spiritual Master who has the capacity to help you expedite your soul's journey.</p>
