<p>Before the Westchester Half-Marathon we met with the excellent runner Gary Fanelli, and the singers sang the song that I had dedicated to him. In the song I had mentioned his deer-speed. He thanked me and said that quite often he thinks about a deer while he is running. He said, "It is a very beautiful song. I love you all very much. I hope you all have a good race today."</p>
<p>I told him, "You should come first, as you did last year. You show your deer-speed!"</p>
<p>"After this song I am charged, plugged in," he said.</p>
<p>Then I gave him a copy of the song and I returned the pictures of his two daughters, Laura and Celeste, that he had given me. He saw that I had written "Blessings and Love" on their foreheads. He said, "Nothing means more than your blessings in my life."</p>
<p>I am so happy that he won the half-marathon. Many years ago he had been interested in following our path when he was living in Los Angeles.</p>
