<p>The next day we went to another music store and saw four or five most expensive violins. One that I was playing cost $1,200, but I was sorry I heard it.</p>
<p>I said, "This is as bad as my eighth-class disciples." The one Projjwal got me on his birthday was much better.</p>
<p>So money does not talk here!</p>
