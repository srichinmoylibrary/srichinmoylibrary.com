<p>This is such a nice question. Now you are looking at me with your eyes open. You are looking at me, Chinmoy, and you are able to see me. Now <em>(putting his hands over her eyes)</em>, I have closed your eyes. Can you see me? No, you cannot see me. When your eyes are shut you cannot see anybody. But when you keep your eyes open, you can see me, you can see your father, your friends, everyone.</p>
<p>Now you have another eye which is between your eyebrows, and just slightly above. It is your inner eye, your Third Eye. In my case that eye is open. I have kept it open. So I can see God, and I can see everything that is within others. Now Shannon, in your case, just as you cannot see anything when your two eyes are closed, so also you do not see God because your Third Eye is closed.</p>
<p>If you pray to God every day, someday this inner eye will open up. Get up early in the morning and open your two ordinary eyes and see your mother and father and everything that is in your room and then pray to God. One day, as a result of your prayer, you will see that your Third Eye has opened, and you also will be able to see God, just as you see me now.</p>  </div>
