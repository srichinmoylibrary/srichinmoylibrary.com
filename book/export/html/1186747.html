<p>Your clever, tricky mind<br /> Is torturing you daily.<br /> When you need rest,<br /> It tells you that you are lethargic,<br /> Empty of energy-light,<br /> And when you do not need rest<br /> It deliberately wants to make you<br /> Harmful lethargy-pleasure<br /> By telling you that you need more rest.</p>

<div id="node-1186794" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1147</h1>

<p>The divine forces are always ready<br /> To act in and through you.<br /> Is up to you to accept them<br /> In a divine way.<br /> If you do not accept them,<br /> There will be no difference<br /> Between your heart's excruciating suffering<br /> And the suffering of a desire-imprisoned<br /> Unaspiring human being.</p>

<p>Do not expect<br /> What is beyond your capacity to receive.<br /> Do not expect<br /> What is beyond your capacity to achieve.<br /> Otherwise, there will be a serious crash<br /> Between your expectation-car<br /> And your reality-train.</p>

<p>If you allow your sincerity-game<br /> To go on and on —<br /> Again and again confessing,<br /> And then repeating the same mistakes<br /> Without any determination-fire<br /> To burn your insincerity-existence-life —<br /> Then your progress on your<br /> God-realisation-journey<br /> Will be slower than the slowest.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1155</h1>

<div id="node-1186803" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1156</h1>
  
 

<p>If tomorrow I become a better person,<br /> I must offer that better life of mine<br /> To God.<br /> If the next day I again become worse,<br /> I must cheerfully offer that life, too,<br /> To God.<br /> In this way each day<br /> I can go one step forward<br /> Toward my ultimate<br /> Oneness-perfection-delight<br /> With my Beloved Supreme.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1157</h1>
  
 

<p>One day you may be spiritually lame,<br /> And the next day you are the fastest sprinter.<br /> True surrender is to offer<br /> Both your slowness and your speed,<br /> Whatever you have and whatever you are,<br /> To your life's Absolute Supreme,<br /> And to nobody else.</p>

<p>My Lord, I do not know<br /> And I do not want to know<br /> What Your Will is.<br /> For if I know Your Will,<br /> My mind may create only<br /> Confusion and rebellion<br /> And make me feel<br /> That I am not doing the right thing<br /> By obeying You.</p>

<p>If you see your enemy coming,<br /> You can close the doors and windows<br /> Of your life<br /> To keep him out.<br /> But if your enemy<br /> Is already comfortably settled<br /> Inside your heart-room,<br /> It is not an easy task<br /> To grab him and throw him out.<br /> Therefore be extremely careful<br /> Of your enemy within.</p>

<p>Your vital has walked along<br /> Frustration-road for a long time.<br /> Now it is completely exhausted.</p>
<p>Your mind has walked along<br /> Suspicion-road for a long time.<br /> Now it is totally exhausted.</p>
<p>Your heart has walked along<br /> Illumination-road for a long time,<br /> Yet there is no sign of its being exhausted.</p>
<p>Your soul has been walking along<br /> Eternity's Liberation-Satisfaction-Road<br /> From time immemorial,<br /> Yet it will never become exhausted.</p>

<p>O skyward eyes<br /> Of purity-flooded beauty,<br /> I know, I know,<br /> You will not be satisfied<br /> Until you have reached<br /> The Liberator's Liberation-Feet.</p>

<p>You are telling me that you have tried<br /> The conventional approach to realise God.<br /> Alas, your austerity-approach<br /> And your sacrifice-approach<br /> Have not liberated your earth-bound life.<br /> Such being the case,<br /> I am advising you to try<br /> A long-lost conventional approach<br /> Inside your heart.<br /> Indeed, this is your life's<br /> Surrender-flower-approach.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186821" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1174</h1>
  
 

<p>Because your life was raised<br /> On God's Compassion,<br /> Your mind does not have to live<br /> On doubt-poison.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">1175</h1>
  
 

<p>Life was perfect then<br /> When I soulfully whispered:<br /> "I am only for my Beloved Supreme."<br /> Life is totally imperfect now,<br /> For I have boldly declared:<br /> "God is and has to be for me,<br /> For I have far surpassed others."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186823" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1176</h1>
  
 

<p>When I pray to my Lord Supreme,<br /> I say, "My Lord, do keep my heart<br /> In Your Compassion-Net."<br /> When I meditate on my Beloved Supreme,<br /> I say, "My Lord, do make my heart<br /> And my entire being<br /> Your Compassion-Net."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186824" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1177</h1>
  
 

<p>The world thinks<br /> That something is seriously wrong<br /> With my mind<br /> Because my mind has forgotten<br /> How to think.<br /> My Lord Supreme tells me<br /> That my mind has become<br /> The boundless joy of perfection-receptivity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186825" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1178</h1>
  
 

<p>True, God does not ignore anybody.<br /> Therefore He does not ignore<br /> Small-minded human beings.<br /> But it is also equally true<br /> That He never intends to use them<br /> To serve Him in any way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186826" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1179</h1>
  
 

<p>When the doubting mind<br /> Accuses the heart of insecurity,<br /> The loving heart does not<br /> Accuse the mind of impurity.<br /> When the mind accuses the heart,<br /> It immediately creates a blemish<br /> On the heart's beauty.<br /> When the heart does not accuse the mind,<br /> It immediately creates a golden opportunity<br /> For the mind's self-transcendence.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186827" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1180</h1>
  
 

<p>When you are extremely soulful,<br /> God sees you as a beautiful rose.<br /> When you are not at all aspiring,<br /> What does God see?<br /> Only a few thorns.<br /> God highly appreciates the rose,<br /> But how can He appreciate thorns?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186828" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1181</h1>
  
 

<p>Try to reach your highest height<br /> In the twinkling of an eye.<br /> Your highest height may not be<br /> Your Lord's highest Height,<br /> But the very fact that you can<br /> Raise your consciousness quickly<br /> Gives Him tremendous Joy<br /> And immense Satisfaction.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186829" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1182</h1>
  
 

<p>In your meditation<br /> If you are desperately trying<br /> To reach the acme of perfection<br /> But you are failing,<br /> Do not give up.<br /> As one who does the long jump<br /> Rests in between each attempt,<br /> Wait and try again.<br /> Who knows, in your next attempt<br /> You may do extremely well.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186830" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1183</h1>
  
 

<p>There are many who do not want to try<br /> To succeed in the spiritual life.<br /> But you must be a hero-warrior<br /> Who will try again and again<br /> Until success-satisfaction is won.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186831" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1184</h1>
  
 

<p>Always he had more important things to do<br /> Than to pay attention<br /> To his spiritual life.<br /> Indeed, even from a little meditation<br /> He feared a spiritual overdose.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186832" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1185</h1>
  
 

<p>You may do the worst possible meditation,<br /> But as long as you sincerely try,<br /> God will one day shower<br /> His bountiful Blessings upon you,<br /> And you will be able to meditate<br /> Extremely well.<br /> Just try, wait and see.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186833" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1186</h1>
  
 

<p>Each genuine truth-seeker<br /> Needs only one thing:<br /> A sleepless inner hunger<br /> For infinite Peace,<br /> Light and Bliss.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186834" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1187</h1>
  
 

<p>If you see that you are being attacked<br /> By undivine thoughts,<br /> Or if sleep has entered<br /> Into your entire being,<br /> Do not fool yourself into believing<br /> That you are doing your best meditation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186835" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1188</h1>
  
 

<p>You are, indeed, a fool<br /> If you think you have passed<br /> Your inner examination<br /> According to your own standard<br /> And that for you<br /> Aspiration is no longer a necessity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186836" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1189</h1>
  
 

<p>Your Inner Pilot is the only judge<br /> Who can tell you whether or not<br /> You have successfully passed<br /> Your spiritual examination.<br /> It is up to you to have faith<br /> In His infallible Judgement.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186837" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1190</h1>
  
 

<p>On the strength of your sincere practice<br /> There shall come a time<br /> When any time or any place —<br /> Even in the hustle and bustle of life —<br /> You will be able to enter<br /> Your highest meditation<br /> At your express command.<br /> Then you will be a true hero-warrior<br /> Of your Beloved Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186838" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1191</h1>
  
 

<p>My Beloved Supreme tells me<br /> That there is nothing<br /> I will not do for Him<br /> Eventually,<br /> And that there is nothing<br /> He will not do for me<br /> Sleeplessly.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186839" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1192</h1>
  
 

<p>Just as the Supreme<br /> Has made your Master<br /> His supremely chosen instrument,<br /> Even so at His choice Hour<br /> The Supreme will make you<br /> His supremely chosen instrument.<br /> Just be obedient, be patient,<br /> Inwardly and outwardly.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186840" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1193</h1>
  
 

<p>Your Lord Supreme<br /> Is not standing in front of you<br /> With an iron rod<br /> Ready to strike you<br /> The moment you make any mistakes.<br /> Far from it!<br /> Through your obedience-light<br /> One day you will realise<br /> His Oneness-Delight with you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186841" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1194</h1>
  
 

<p>Poor God can count<br /> On His Fingertips<br /> Those very, very few<br /> Who are implicitly obedient to Him,<br /> Both in their inner aspiration-lives<br /> And in their outer dedication-lives.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186842" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1195</h1>
  
 

<p>Today if you can fulfil<br /> Your Lord Supreme<br /> Cheerfully, devotedly and soulfully,<br /> Then there shall definitely come a time<br /> When you will please Him<br /> Unreservedly and unconditionally.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186843" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1196</h1>
  
 

<p>Progress comes from obedience.<br /> Obedience comes from faith.<br /> If you have faith in God<br /> And faith in yourself,<br /> Then automatically you will develop<br /> The power of obedience.<br /> If you obey God,<br /> Then at every moment<br /> You will make progress<br /> Far, far beyond<br /> The flight of your imagination.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186844" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1197</h1>
  
 

<p>Think not of the ferocious tiger<br /> That your ignorance-life now embodies,<br /> But of the beautiful white lamb<br /> Or the swift-moving deer<br /> That your aspiration-life<br /> Hopes to become.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186845" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1198</h1>
  
 

<p>I am a tiny drop<br /> Inside an infinite ocean of light.<br /> I have only to expand slowly and steadily<br /> To become the ocean itself,<br /> And then I shall unmistakably<br /> Be able to claim the entire ocean<br /> As my own, very own.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186846" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1199</h1>
  
 

<p>As long as my heart can soulfully cry<br /> To realise God,<br /> I shall not mind in the least<br /> Even if God deliberately delays<br /> His choice Hour.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186847" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1200</h1>
  
 

<p>O my Inner Pilot,<br /> I have not done anything.<br /> It is You who have done everything<br /> In and through me.<br /> Now may I become only one thing<br /> For the rest of my life:<br /> A gratitude-heart within and without.</p>
