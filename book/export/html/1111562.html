<p>My oldest long-distance running route I discovered by myself. No one on my road crew found it. On this route I go down Union Turnpike to Springfield Boulevard and then to Northern Boulevard, and back. When I first used to take this route, instead of going back to Springfield and home along Union Turnpike, I would forget to turn and keep going straight along Northern Boulevard. Many times I would get lost.</p>
<p>I would be only one or two blocks away from Union Turnpike, and I would start asking people where Union Turnpike was. Sometimes I would have to go back on Northern Boulevard to Springfield because I couldn't find Union Turnpike.</p>
<p>Once I was actually standing on Union Turnpike and I asked someone whereUnion Turnpike was. My mind was so exhausted from my long run that day!</p>
