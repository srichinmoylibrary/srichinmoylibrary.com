<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please think of the Supreme as your most beloved father, mother, sister, brother, everything. And think of Him as someone who is willing to do everything for you unconditionally. No matter how many things you do wrong, a day will come when He will give you everything. God is infinitely higher and more vast than anything you can conceive of as divine or undivine. All that you have, you can offer Him; and He will accept all your darkness as His very own. He willingly accepts it as His very own. In your case, all the negative qualities that stand in your way can be surrendered if you are sincere. Your sincerity will help in establishing oneness with the Supreme's Concern and Compassion-Light. The more sincere you are, the sooner you will reach your Goal.</p>  </div>
