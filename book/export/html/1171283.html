<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> After giving talks on spirituality at various places, I was invited to open up centres where people come to pray and meditate and read my writings. Since I also happen to be a musician, I have offered many concerts all over the world. I have been offering meditations at the United Nations for twenty-nine years. Every Tuesday and Friday I have been going there between one and two o'clock to meditate in silence, and those who are interested in the spiritual life come to meditate with me. I have also given many talks at the United Nations. They have come out in a book called <em>The Garland of Nation-Souls.</em> My talks at various universities have also been published in books, such as <em>Beyond Within</em>, <em>Eastern Light for the Western Mind</em> and <em>The Inner Promise.</em> These are some of my major works. From these books people have come to know about me.</p>
<p>Our mission is like a plant, growing and growing and growing. The seed was sown when I came to America. Now from all over the world, seekers have come to me, and if get a chance, I go to visit their countries.</p>  </div>
