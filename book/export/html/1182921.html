<p>My Lord,<br /> I want to run with You<br /> Sleeplessly and unconditionally,<br /> But I cannot keep pace with You.<br /> What can I do?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> Your very eagerness to run with Me<br /> Is more than I need.<br /> Sleeplessly think of running with Me;<br /> Unconditionally meditate on running with Me.<br /> Lo, sooner than at once<br /> You and I will be easily running<br /> Together."</p>
