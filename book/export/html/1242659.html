<p>King’s College<br />Cambridge<br />22nd July 2003</p>
<p>I hasten to say how great a privilege it was to receive you in the rooms which I now occupy and which Sri Aurobindo used to occupy during his period in Cambridge from 1890-1892. I feel that the rooms do indeed retain a special aura. They are certainly conducive to my work in Sufism and Persian medieval mystical poetry. But whatever their aura might have been before Friday, 27th June, it was enlivened, brightened, made more by your kind presence. I only wish that your visit could have lasted longer, but I hope that you will come again.</p>
