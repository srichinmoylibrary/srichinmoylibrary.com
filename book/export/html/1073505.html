<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> I do a lot of that. Even though I'm one of the best starters in the world, I have to work or I will lose. I work on my long jump mistakes to perfect them. I try to leave the board at a 22-23 degree angle. One degree can make a difference of six to eight inches. In the start, you basically want to get down in the blocks to the set position where you're comfortable â€” with the front leg at about a 90 degree angle. If my shoulders are too low, when I want to come out I have to step and stand up. So just a small difference in angle can make a big difference in the start. Even a person like myself has to keep working on it every day.</p>  </div>
