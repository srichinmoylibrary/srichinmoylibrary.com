<p>I must confess my heart's conscience-guilt.<br /> For aeons and aeons I have succeeded<br /> In concealing it,<br /> But today I have failed.<br /> I am in love with,<br /> To be absolutely sincere,<br /> I have always been in love with,<br /> My old Friend, birthless<br /> And deathless, God.<br /> Him I truly love.<br /> Therefore<br /> To Him secretly I go,<br /> And as you know,<br /> His fathomless life-sea<br /> Has a golden shore.<br /> I sail my love-boat<br /> With my heart's gratitude-cry,<br /> Forever and forever more.</p>
