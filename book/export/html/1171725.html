    <title>Questioner: For example, sometimes I bring her some medication, and she tells me, &amp;quot;Wait a little bit.&amp;quot; Then she meditates and, after a few minutes, she may say to me, &amp;quot;Today I cannot take this medication. After three or four days I will take it.&amp;quot; Like this, very precise answers she gives me. Sometimes she says, &amp;quot;Not now, but on the 13th of the month I can take it.&amp;quot;</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What is wrong with that? If she hears the inner message and she gets joy from the inner message and takes the medicine after a few days, let her do it. But if there is a conflict between the message and the feeling that she is getting, then she should not do it. When she is feeling or hearing that after a few days she should take the medicine, her immediate response has to be happiness.</p>
<p>May I ask, is this lady an artist also? Does she paint?</p>
<p><em>Questioner:</em> Yes, she does a little painting on the computer.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because as I am talking to you, I am seeing her soul, and her soul gave me this information.</p>  </div>
