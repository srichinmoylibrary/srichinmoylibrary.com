<p>Somebody says, "Some people's thoughts need washing even more than their bodies."</p>
<p>The writer is a real mind-reader. He has stolen the secret; but not the sacred experience of the spiritual teachers. The spiritual teachers wash the filth of others, not because they feel that they are great and generous, but because their love of others has made them totally and inseparably one with them.</p>  </div>
