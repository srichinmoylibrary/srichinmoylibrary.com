<p>We do not know at which point God will use His Power to make fun of the giant. A giant can have a huge body, but a tiny drop of poison can destroy it.</p>
<p>In my case, this morning I was trying to tear open a plastic bag to get out a new shaving blade. I could not tear it. I tried using a towel. Then I took the nail cutter to make a very small cut. So this is how God was making fun of me.</p>
