  <h1 class="book-heading">A seeker is a singer</h1>
  
 
<p>A seeker is a singer. Unlike other singers, he sings only two songs: his song of self-giving beauty and his song of God-becoming duty. His heart's soulful cry is his self-giving Divinity-song. His life's fruitful smile is his God-becoming immortality-song.</p>
<p>When a seeker says to the Supreme, "O my Beloved Lord, I am for You only," he sings his song of self-giving. When he says to the Supreme, "O my Beloved Lord, You are my ever-transcending vision's height and my ever-increasing reality's depth," he sings his song of God-becoming.</p>
<p>When a seeker says to the Supreme that his life is constant dedication to the eternal Source, he sings his song of self-giving. When he says to the Supreme that he is devotedly and unreservedly one with His Infinity's Goal, he sings his song of God-becoming.</p>
<p>The seeker's inner resolution is his song of self-giving. The seeker's inner revolution is his song of God-becoming. Inner resolution is an art. Slowly, steadily and unerringly the seeker learns the art of divine love, divine devotion and divine surrender. Inner revolution is also an art. Slowly, steadily and unerringly the seeker learns the art of realisation, revelation and manifestation.</p>
<p>The inner resolution is nothing short of inspiration in action. The inner revolution is nothing but aspiration in action. Inspiration is a bird. This bird carries the seeker on its wings and shows him the Face of his Beloved Supreme. Aspiration is a ladder. The seeker climbs up this ladder and reaches the ultimate Height. There he becomes one with Infinity's Height and Immortality's Life. God is supremely pleased with him. God descends on the same ladder. He comes down and makes the seeker His faithful, devoted and unconditional instrument.</p>
<p>God offers Himself here on earth completely, and His devoted seeker singer sings with Him soulfully and unconditionally. While singing the song with his Beloved Supreme, the seeker increases his realisation-power, realisation-peace, realisation-light and realisation-delight. While singing the song with the seeker-singer, the Beloved Supreme manifests His Divinity, His immortality and His Oneness-Reality here on earth devotedly, unreservedly and unconditionally.</p>
