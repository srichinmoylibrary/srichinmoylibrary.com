<p>There is no such thing as sacrifice in the inner world, in the soul's region. Where is the sacrifice if we really feel that we are all one? When my leg is injured, I use my hand to bandage it. At that time I do not feel that my hand is making a sacrifice for my leg. Similarly, in the spiritual world, when it is a matter of oneness, total oneness, who is making a sacrifice for whom? We are one family, children of God, like limbs on the same body. When one particular limb helps another, we don't say that it is sacrifice. So what we do for humanity, we do on the strength of our oneness and not on the strength of our superiority. Here we are only expanding our limited consciousness into the unlimited.</p>  </div>
