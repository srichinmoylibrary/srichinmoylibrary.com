<p>Do you know that my heart<br /> Is a sacred island?<br /> Perhaps you know.</p>
<p>Do you know that my mind<br /> Is a secret island?<br /> Perhaps you know.</p>
<p>Do you know that my vital<br /> Is an ignored island?<br /> Perhaps you know.</p>
<p>Do you know that my body<br /> Is a treasure-island?<br /> Ah, you didn't know?</p>
<p>Then learn it once and for all.</p>
