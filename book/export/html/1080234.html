<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, very often when we think of will power, we think of it as being inside our head, inside our brain. We never think of will power here in the heart centre. We feel that the heart is feminine and the mind is masculine. In the mind there is a tiger, a lion or a bull there to fight. This is our human conception. But it is not true that will power is inside the head. Will power is inside the third eye, and the third eye is not inside our physical head. None of the centres are inside the physical. If they were there, medical science would have discovered them long ago. Real will power is also inside the heart. The soul's light is will power, real will power. The easiest and most effective way to cultivate will power is to concentrate on the heart. Two years ago I gave two or three exercises on the physical plane on how to develop will power. They were printed in one of my books, I am sure. So read these and you can develop will power. From your will power you can have mental clarity.</p>
<p>You also want clarity. Now you are in darkness and if you have a little light, then you can walk, you can see what is around you. So if you can get even an iota of soul's light, I tell you, you will be able to see everything and walk along the darkest path if you want to. If you can see or feel the soul's light, it becomes all illumination. So, if you want clarity in your mind, concentrate on your heart and then dig there. Think that you have a tool to dig with, and every day dig. But don't be satisfied with your digging. Today you have dug and you have come to a certain point. Then tomorrow again you have to dig further. The deeper you can go, the sooner you will feel and see the light. First you feel, then you see, then you become. First you will feel that there is something inside like a very tiny insect: that is the light. Then you will see it with your inner vision or with your human vision. Finally you will grow into it.</p>  </div>
