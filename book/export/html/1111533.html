<p>Pragati was ahead of me in the two-mile race when we passed the water station. Somebody came to give her water. She didn't want it and waved the person away. Then she herself went to the table to take water. Perhaps she did not like that person.</p>
<p>When we run, at that time we forget everything. I will say I don't need water. Then one second later I realise that I am so thirsty!</p>
