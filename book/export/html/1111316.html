<p>When K. sees me running, at least she smiles at me. V. is so horrible. Either she ignores me or, if she looks at me, she won't smile.</p>
<p>The other day I saw V. and, as usual, she did not smile. A few minutes later I saw K. and she did smile. When V. runs she is not irritated, but she is miserable. Once I even shouted at her when I saw her running, but still she ignored me!</p>
