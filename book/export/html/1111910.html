<p>During our 12-hour walk, some of the walkers were looking at my picture. I thought they were reading. At 3:30 in the morning, when I saw Agraha go by holding something in his hand, I thought he was learning songs. I knew he was not a singer, so I wondered why he was learning songs. No, he was looking at my picture for inspiration.</p>
<p>For some people to do something on the physical plane is such a difficult task! I am the pioneer. I walked 19 miles today. I am extremely proud of myself. The first time I stopped after eight laps. The next time I did five laps, and then I did six. So it came to 19. If I could have continued from the beginning to the end, I could have done 30 miles.</p>
