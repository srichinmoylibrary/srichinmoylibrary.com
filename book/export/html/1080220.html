<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our singing adds inspiration and aspiration to our meditation, and when we have added inspiration and aspiration to our meditation we feel — and it is absolutely true — that we are offering more of our dedicated, devoted and soulful service to the soul of the United Nations. Each time we sing we invoke the soul of the United Nations to appear before us, to make us more active, more dynamic and more self-giving to the cause, the supreme cause: the vision of oneness-family that we have envisioned and we are in the process of manifesting.</p>  </div>
