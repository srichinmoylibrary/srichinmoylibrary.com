<p>Six black teenage girls were in front of me. They were on the other side of the street. They crossed the street and came to my side. They started walking about ten metres in front of me. Then I saw a tall, stout, black lady coming towards me, passing through them.</p>
<p>She said to me, "Sri, Sri, these are terrible people. Please do not be so close to them."</p>
<p>She was advising me and warning me. If she had said it a little louder, perhaps they would have come and attacked her. I listened to her advice and took another route.</p>
