<p>This morning I ran two miles. The wind was killing me. As soon as I started, I met my old lady friend with her dog. First she said with tremendous anger and frustration, "Why are you running in this weather? It is freezing!" She was speaking with her German accent.</p>
<p>Then she said to me, "No bite, no bark, my Pauly!"</p>
<p>At that moment her dog started barking. I said, "As long as there is no bite, I don't have to worry."</p>
<p>But she got mad at her dog for barking.</p>
