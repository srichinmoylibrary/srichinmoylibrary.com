<blockquote>
<p>"No great man ever complains of want of opportunity."</p>
<p>â€” Emerson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true. A really great man has not to depend on outer opportunities. He has abundant faith in his inner capacity. However, to say that a great man never complains of want of opportunity is an ideal affirmation of the state of consciousness for all great men. How I wish that all great men realise this truth and live this truth.</p>  </div>
