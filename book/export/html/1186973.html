<p>God is an eternal Child<br /> Playing with His friends<br /> In the world-garden.<br /> He has established His Oneness<br /> With His creation<br /> To such an extent<br /> That He does not mind<br /> If all His children<br /> Are playing different games.<br /> In fact, He enjoys it most<br /> When His children play<br /> The game of multiplicity<br /> Inside the heart-home of unity.</p>
