  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: With what movement is Swamiji connected in New York?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am not connected with any movement.</p>
<p><em>You came by yourself?</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, I was brought up in a spiritual Centre. I stayed for twenty years in a spiritual Centre in India, the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. For twenty years I stayed there. I went there at the age of one but they were not accepting children. But I stayed there from the age of 12 until I was 32. Twenty years I stayed doing intense meditation and all that. My brothers and sisters were all there. I am the youngest of the lot and my sisters and brothers are still all there. Some of them have been there for thirty years, forty years, in that Centre.</p>
<p>I got the Command from within. The Supreme within me demanded it. In the beginning I was afraid, but I was compelled.</p>
<p>My American sponsors also insisted. I said, “Well, if it is the Supreme’s Will, I have to accept.” And I came here. We do not decide anything. We wait for the Command. Where is India? Where is New York? I had to come.</p>
<p><em>Did you go to Europe first?</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, I did not go to Europe. Only on the way we stopped there for two and a half hours. Otherwise I did not go to Europe. I have been here in the U.S., in New York. I have gone to quite a few states to give talks. I went to Canada. Most probably at the end of my visit here, I will go to California. Again, these are all speculations. We do not know actually what will happen. Here I have come. Who knows if I may come here again. I may not come here at all.</p>
<p><em>You have to come back again.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We don’t decree such things.</p>
<p><em>But you must try to arrange it.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We say that the Guru is always at the command of his disciples. If the disciples want him, the Guru is bound to come. There is no alternative.</p>
<p>If a child cries, the father will not feed himself, but he will remain unfed and he will come to the child, to try and feed the child. It is like that.</p>
<p><em>We need to be fed.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have here so many spiritual figures for guidance. I am so glad that at least Puerto Rico has been blessed with spiritual figures. There are places, unlit places, where spiritual figures have never come and it is quite unfortunate.</p>  </div>
