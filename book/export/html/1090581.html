<p><em>[First citizen in his jewellery shop. Enter a customer. The customer begins looking at a beautiful ring.]</em></p>
<p>CUSTOMER: How much does this ring cost?</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN: One hundred rupees.</p>
<p>CUSTOMER: One hundred rupees? Why, this could not weigh much more than a few cloves of garlic! Let me go next door to the grocery store and see the price of garlic.</p>
<p><em>[Exit customer]</em></p>
<p><em>[First citizen is beside himself with rage and despair. Customer returns]</em></p>
<p>CUSTOMER: The price of garlic is one anna. Your ring certainly does not weigh as much as a whole bulb of garlic, but I will give you one anna for it. And I won't make a report to the King against you for telling me the price was one hundred rupees. Here is one anna. Good bye.</p>
<p><em>[Customer snatches the ring and starts to leave. Jeweller begins shouting.]</em></p>
<p>CUSTOMER: If you shout I will stab you. You know it is the King's order that everything be sold at the same price.</p>
<p>JEWELLER: I know it is the King's order, but I refuse to sell a gold ring for one anna. It's extremely valuable!</p>
<p><em>[Customer stabs the jeweller and runs. Jeweller starts shouting.]</em></p>
<p>JEWELLER: Help, help! Somebody save me! Thief! Thief! Arrest that man!</p>
<p><em>[Immediately from other shops people come on. The customer is caught and brought back in by the police.]</em></p>
<p>JEWELLER: That's the man. He has stabbed me.</p>  </div>
