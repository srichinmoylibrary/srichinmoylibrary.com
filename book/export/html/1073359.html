<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, provided I knew that the one being struck was innocent. Innocent people should always be protected. We have to know the difference between sincerity and stupidity. Spiritual people should not be stupid; they should only be sincere. If they have not attacked someone, then it is their bounden duty to keep themselves free from attack. And if someone else is being attacked they should try to help if they can.</p>  </div>
