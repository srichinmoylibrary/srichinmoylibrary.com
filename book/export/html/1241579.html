    <title>&lt;em&gt;Sri Chinmoy:&lt;/em&gt; The other day I drove to Main Street. When you drive, your hands go this way, your legs go that way. You can do four things at a time on the outer plane. In my case I do the inner and the outer together. You have not yet realised God. Tomorrow you will realise God!</title>

<p><em>Question:</em> Is your physical mind aware of all the things that you do, Guru?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to go beyond the physical. If you do not go beyond the physical, you cannot do two things at once; the inner and the outer you cannot do at the same time. In your case, outer things you can do simultaneously. You are doing something with your hands and something else with your legs. But if you want to do the inner and the outer together, you must go beyond the physical. For you, one door is closed. You have kept the outer door open, so you are seeing what is happening in the outer world. The other door is closed, so you have to go through the door to see what is happening. But if you realise God, although the door is closed, you can see through the door like an X-ray machine. What is happening in the inner world and what is happening in the outer world you can see.</p>
