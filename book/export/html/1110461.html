<p>In 1930, almost in the evening of his life, Rabindranath started devoting himself to painting. In this new field of Art some people found much in him, some found practically nothing. Some admired and encouraged him unstintingly, while some simply threw cold water on him. Tagore observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“People often ask me about the meaning of my pictures. I remain silent even as my pictures are. It is for them to express and not to explain.”</p>
