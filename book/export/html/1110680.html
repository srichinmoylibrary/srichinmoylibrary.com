<p>We enjoy Indian sweets and many other sweets. Each individual will have some sweets that he likes best and feels are most delicious. But devotion is infinitely, infinitely sweeter than the sweetest sweet that has ever been made by any human being, because devotion is made of God’s ever-transcending Breath. Like us, God has breath, but His Breath is always transcending, transcending, transcending. Our human devotion is made of God’s own ever-transcending Breath. Therefore, it has to be sweeter, infinitely, infinitely sweeter than any man-made sweets.</p>
<p>When you have true devotion, you will feel what true sweetness is in your life. Otherwise, without devotion, nobody will be able to imagine real sweetness.</p>  </div>
