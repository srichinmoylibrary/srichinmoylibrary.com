<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dearest child, live in the heart. There are many things which the eye sees that will have no value unless the heart also feels them. The eyes will see something. But if the heart does not identify with that particular thing, immediately we will discard it. Who will say that if we see with our naked eye, then we shall believe? No, no, no! With our naked eye many things we see, but immediately we discard them, because our heart has not identified with those things. Unless the heart has identified with some reality, no matter how many times we see it with our eyes, immediately we discard it. We feel, “It cannot be true. If it had been something else, some different shape or some different colour, then it would have been true.” This is what we feel.</p>  </div>
