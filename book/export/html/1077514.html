<p>The Gita is the Song Celestial, sung by Lord Krishna himself. The Gita is the essence of all Indian scriptures. There are eighteen soul-illumining discourses in the Gita. In the eleventh one, Lord Krishna reveals to his beloved disciple, Arjuna, his Visva-Rupa, his Universal Form. On seeing this overpowering sight, this Divine Form, the surrendered disciple in Arjuna cries out:</p>

<p><em>Tvamadi Deva Purusha Purana...</em></p>
<p>Thou art the ancient Soul,<br /> The first and original Godhead,<br /> And the Supreme resting place of all that lives;<br /> Thou art the Knower and the Known;<br /> the Highest Abode.<br /> O infinite in form, by Thee the Universe was extended.<br /> Thou art Vayu and Yama and Agni and Soma<br /> and Varuna and Prajapati,<br /> Father of creatures and the great-grandsire,<br /> Salutation, Salutation to Thee,<br /> A thousand times over and again,<br /> And yet again, Salutation,<br /> Again and again, Hail unto Thee.</p>
<p>(From the Bhagavad-Gita:XI.38-39)</p>
