<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Expectation is not a bad thing, but if expectation does not meet with satisfaction, then the seeker may experience inner frustration. This frustration is most damaging. But if the seeker goes beyond expectation, then he is bound to see or feel an inner smile each time he offers me his soulful, devoted and unreserved, if not unconditional, service.</p>
<p>As soon as you do something for me, you are bound to see and feel an inner smile. This inner smile is not only the recognition of what you have done but also my assurance that I shall grant you more opportunities and provide you with more capacity so that you can please the Supreme in me more and thus become closer to me. The human in us expects, but the divine in us already has that very thing on the strength of its oneness-will with God's ever-blossoming and ever-transcending Reality.</p>  </div>
