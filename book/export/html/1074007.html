<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is true that we can be conscious with the help of the mind. But the mind cannot be conscious all the time. The mind is a very poor instrument; this moment it remembers something and the next moment it may forget. The mind is not a trustworthy friend. But the heart immediately identifies with both the subject and object. Identification is oneness. Oneness is infinitely more than mere mental awareness, so the heart is by far better than the mind. Once we have established our oneness with something we donâ€™t have to use our mind to know what it is, what it looks like or how many times we can enjoy it. The very fact that we have become one with something is more than enough. Oneness is our actual aim.</p>  </div>
