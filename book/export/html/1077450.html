<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are experiencing pain, it means that you are trying to pull beyond your capacity. Sometimes when we try to pull something beyond our capacity, we get pain. In the spiritual life, there should be no pulling or pushing, but a natural and spontaneous flow. Meditation should be like a river flowing into the sea. There should be a natural flow â€” no pulling, no pushing, no coercing, no strenuous effort. Progress should be made in a very natural, spontaneous way. Then there will be no pain in the forehead near the third eye area.</p>  </div>
