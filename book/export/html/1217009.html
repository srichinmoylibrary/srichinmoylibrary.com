<p>Today I went to a gym near the Holiday Inn. The gym owner recognised me the moment I walked in; he had seen my picture in Muscle Mag.</p>
<p>At first he didn't believe that I was really Sri Chinmoy. Then Savyasachi gave him our brochure, and he said that he had recognised me the moment I had walked in.</p>
<p>Like a child, he was showing me all his different equipment. I told him, "I have come here with some students."</p>
<p>He said, "Please bring them here. For them, everything is free."</p>
<p>I told him that I would lift him. He was so thrilled. He said he would keep the picture of the lift in his office.</p>
