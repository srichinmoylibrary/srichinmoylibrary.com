<p>All people on earth have suffered and are suffering because they ask God for poison. When they pray, unconsciously they think that what they are asking for is all nectar. Then when they become more conscious, that very thing they think of as poison. The greater the awakening we have, the greater our realisation that hundreds of times we have prayed to God for poison, but out of his infinite Compassion He has not given us poison.</p>  </div>
