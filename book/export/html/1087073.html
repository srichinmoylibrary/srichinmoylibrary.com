<p>After I finished talking to the black man, I bought a few books. The price came to five dollars and forty cents. Before I paid the man at the counter, I was talking to him for a while. I asked him if he was the new owner. He said, "Yes, I am."</p>
<p>So I said, "Good luck!" I said many other nice things to him also.</p>
<p>Then, when I reached into my pocket, I saw that I had a five dollar bill, plus a quarter, a dime and four pennies. I said to him, "I have here five dollars and thirty-nine cents. If you do not want to accept it, I will give you a twenty dollar bill."</p>
<p>He grabbed the twenty dollar bill. He wanted to have the twenty, instead of five thirty-nine. Then when he was about to give me the change, he said, "Not worth it!" He returned the twenty, and took my five thirty-nine.</p>
<p>I said, "Fine!"</p>
<p>I should one day give him a hundred books free. His spiritual section is nothing - all rubbish novels.</p>
