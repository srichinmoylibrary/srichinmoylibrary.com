<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. Yoga is not only a cure, but it is the <em>only</em> cure to modern life's restlessness and nervousness. Yoga is conscious, real oneness with God. God is all Bliss, all Light, all Peace. If one has a free access to God, then naturally he will have God's qualities, which are Divinity, infinite Power, infinite Love.</p>
<p>The whole world is captured by restlessness and nervousness. The very aim of practising Yoga is to have peace, peace of mind. When one acquires peace of mind, automatically one possesses indomitable inner strength. How can nervousness enter into a person when he is surcharged with inner strength? There can be no restlessness, no nervousness. Nervousness comes when you take away a part from the whole. Fear comes when you separate something from the whole. God is the whole. God is the Absolute. When you practise Yoga, you touch the Absolute and enter into the Absolute; you do not remain a separate portion of the whole. When you enter into the absolute whole, there is all strength, all power; there is no fear. In Yoga you can cure all nervousness and all restlessness and all imperfection.</p>  </div>
