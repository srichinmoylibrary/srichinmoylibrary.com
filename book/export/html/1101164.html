<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have already found it. Once you accept the spiritual life, that life itself is your role. The two cannot be separated. You can say that once you accept the spiritual life, still you have to do something outwardly. It is true that you can excel in some earthly career, but your real career is your spiritual career. Your spiritual life is your main role. Your role is to love and serve God in God's own Way. So the day you accepted the spiritual life, your spiritual role started.</p>  </div>
