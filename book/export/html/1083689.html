  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: How can we fool God?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The question is not how we can fool God, but whether we are fooling God or not. I wish to say that at every moment we are fooling God, although God is all wisdom, all-pervading Wisdom. God is eternally wise, but He has created two things to guide His entire creation. One is His Compassion and the other is His Forgiveness. As long as God is all Forgiveness and all Compassion and as long as He has asked us to enter into the world-arena, He Himself looks upon us quite often with a human eye and with a human heart â€” that is to say, not with His unlimited wisdom and unlimited capacity, but with a little more capacity than poor human beings have. He feels that if He hides His infinite Capacity and keeps forward only a little of His capacity, then the human beings will get the inspiration and aspiration to catch Him, to run with Him.</p>
<p>In a hundred-metre dash, if one runner is seventy metres ahead of another runner, then the one who is so much behind will not have the inspiration and inclination to run and overtake the runner who is ahead of him. But if the leading runner is only a few steps ahead, then the one who is behind has the determination to overtake him. God stays only a few steps ahead of us so that He can be seen. He feels that in this way we will be able to see Him running with us and competing with us.</p>
<p>When God is playing the game with us with a little more capacity than we ourselves have, out of His infinite Compassion, infinite Forgiveness, He allows us to fool Him on the physical plane. He feels that after deceiving Him on the physical plane, we will feel repentant. Then His Compassion-power and Illumination-power can work. The after-effect of His action will inspire some sorrow in us. Then we will try to illumine that sorrow and finally we will try to do the right thing: we will try to serve God and love God.</p>  </div>
