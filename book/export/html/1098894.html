<p>One of my colleagues, N. C. Acharya, knew of my love for music and he asked me to give a concert. That is how my concert at the Indian Cultural Centre came about. The person in charge of the Cultural Centre donated a hall for free and the date was fixed for 20 March 1966.</p>
<p>Quite a few hundred people came to the concert. For me to get over one hundred people in those days was really something. But they came and they appreciated my singing.</p>
<p>I sang ten devotional songs in Sanskrit and Bengali, and I gave a short commentary on each one.</p>  </div>
