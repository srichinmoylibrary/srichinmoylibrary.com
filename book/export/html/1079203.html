<h2><em>Question: When you speak of someone seeking enlightenment, doesn't that imply that the person does not have it inside him? And how can one ever attain it by seeking it?</em></h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is like this: I had something, but I have misplaced it. Suppose I had something precious in my room. It was I who had it and I who misplaced it, and now it is I who am searching for it. It has always been mine, but I do not know where it is. But when I begin searching for it, I know that after some time I will find it. Through constant seeking I will get back my inner wealth, which is illumination.</p>  </div>
