<p>Any champion must be God’s champion. Sri Chinmoy is a champion of God. He is a very special person, a chosen instrument. I feel I too am chosen. We are the same — we have been touched by God. He is the best because he is a champion of the heart and soul.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy shows that with God there is nothing that is impossible! We can do anything. Sri Chinmoy has proven this in the physical. To stay locked in the spiritual while performing in the body is so hard but so important. That spiritual bond, that link that Sri Chinmoy has, makes all things possible.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy is not the normal athlete; he is a special athlete; he is a super superathlete. It is spirituality that separates superathletes from super superathletes. Sri Chinmoy is a super superathlete.</p>
