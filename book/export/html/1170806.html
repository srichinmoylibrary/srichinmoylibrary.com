<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why do you have to know the past? The past is dust. Did you realise God in your previous incarnations? Your goal is God-realisation! If the past did not enable you to realise God, then what good is it? Stupid curiosity is useless. At times we start with curiosity. Then we enter into real spirituality. Then comes one of two things: either frustration, which is destruction; or hope-flowers, which become beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful. Finally we see the reality, and then we get real satisfaction.</p>  </div>
