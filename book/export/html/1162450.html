  <h1 class="book-heading">MY SUPREME’S ABSOLUTE COMMAND</h1>
  
 
<p>In the small hours of this morning, my soul was in my transcendental consciousness and my heart was in my universal consciousness.</p>
<p>My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme stood in front of me and said to me, “No retirement, no retirement, no retirement for you, My child!”</p>
<p>I said to my Supreme, “What more do You want from me, what more?”</p>
<p>He said to me, “Seventy-seven thousand.”</p>
<p>Immediately I said to Him, “Is it Your Wish, is it Your Request, is it Your Will or is it Your absolute Command?”</p>
<p>He said, “It is My absolute Command.”</p>
<p>Then I said to Him, “I do not think I am going to live on earth that long.”</p>
<p>He said to me, “My child, I command you to start, I command you to start. You know and I know how long you are going to be on earth, but I want you to start. This is My absolute Command.”</p>
<p>“My Supreme, my Supreme, I shall obey Your Command, I shall.”</p>
