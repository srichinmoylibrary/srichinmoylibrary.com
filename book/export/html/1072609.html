    <title>Question: Guru, once you said that you tried to help three disciples whom you saw were destined to die. You said that with two of them you succeeded, and the third you weren’t sure of at the time. What does it all depend on? The person’s receptivity?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Mostly receptivity. I am ready to give. If they can receive, they will be all right; otherwise, they will not. Sometimes they resist, or do not have any life-energy. If there is even an iota of life-energy, if the doctor gives an injection, then perhaps the person may revive. At least there is some possibility and hope. But if the person is absolutely dead, what good will an injection do? Similarly, no matter how much Power you bring down from above, the case is absolutely hopeless if the person’s life-energy is too limited.</p>  </div>
