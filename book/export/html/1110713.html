  <h1 class="book-heading">Sincerity</h1>
  
 
<p>Sincerity is always available in the heart. Sincerity is quite often absent from the mind, the vital and the physical existence.</p>
<p>With simplicity we can go right up to Godâ€™s Door. But God will open His Door only if He sees sincerity in our mind, in our vital and in our physical existence.</p>
<p>Sincerity needs cheerfulness. Sincerity needs intensity. Sincerity needs soulfulness. Sincerity needs bliss at every moment. Then only can it act faster than the fastest.</p>  </div>
