<p>When I was running, at one point two Indians were passing me. One of them said, "Namaste, Guruji. Namaste, Guruji."</p>
<p>Then the other one said, "Oh, Guruji is running."</p>
<p>I said, "No, Guruji is dying."</p>
<p>They said, "Don't die, don't die!"</p>
<p>They were both wearing T-shirts with my picture on the front, which they had gotten at some other race.</p>
