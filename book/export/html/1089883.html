<p>Simplicity is the most valuable treasure in God's creation, in God's realisation and in God's manifestation. God is always simple, but we think of Him as complex. With our fertile mind, it is we who make God complex and then create problems for ourselves. The simpler we can become, the sooner we shall reach our destination. A life of simplicity is a life of constant progress. It is in simplicity that we can make the fastest progress, progress which is everlasting.</p>
<p>Simplicity is our natural or conscious awareness of reality. The moment we realise our highest transcendental Reality, we become simple. In the spiritual life, the higher we go, the deeper we go; the farther we go, the more we will see that Reality is only the song of simplicity and nothing else. The entire cosmic Game is extremely simple, but we look at it from a different angle in an obscure way. That is why we feel it is very complex, but everything is simple.</p>  </div>
