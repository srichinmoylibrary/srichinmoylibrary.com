<p>Birbal was one of the nine gems of Akbar's court. He came of a poor Brahmin family from Trivikrampur (now known as Tikawanpur) on the banks of the river Yamuna. Though popularly known as Birbal, his real name was Maheshdas. He also wrote poetry under the pen-name "Brahma".</p>
<p>By virtue of his wisdom and wit, he rose to be Akbar's favourite Minister and court jester. He was also an excellent soldier and administrator.</p>
<p>When Akbar formed his own faith, the <em>Din-e-Elahi,</em> which was a synthesis of Muslim and Hindu beliefs, there was only one Hindu among its followers â€” Akbar's true friend and sympathiser, Birbal.</p>
<p>Birbal met his death in battle while on an expedition to Afghanistan. Akbar was so grief-stricken that he burst forth:</p>
<p>"Birbal, you never hurt the helpless.</p>
<p>You always gave them whatever you had.</p>
<p>I am helpless now, and yet you have left nothing for me."</p>  </div>
