<h2>Question: What is the spiritual conception of responsibility and how does it differ from the human conception?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, our human conception of responsibility is founded upon an incorrect belief. Every person feels that he has far too much responsibility. We feel bound, limited, tied hand and foot to other people. But when we go deep within we come to realise that God is responsible for you, for me, for everybody. Every day He is fulfilling all His responsibilities in infinite ways, yet God is not bound by anything. Responsibility is not something that binds. The more we are conscious of our responsibilities as divine opportunities, the more we can expand our consciousness. If we live in the human consciousness, responsibility is bondage: But in the spiritual life responsibility is the expansion of our wisdom-light.</p>  </div>
