<p>Of all the animals, the cow received the most from me spiritually when I lifted it up. Then came the bull. The donkey was the worst. The deer received a little. One horse received a lot. The lamb also received.</p>
<p>Both the elephants received so much. The big one, Jack, received a lot. Before the lift, I garlanded it and said, “You are my friend, my heart’s friend, my soul’s friend, my life’s friend.”</p>
<p>Karen, the little elephant, also received, but Jack’s soul is more mature, much more advanced. Jack will have a human incarnation, whereas Karen will take a few more animal incarnations.</p>
