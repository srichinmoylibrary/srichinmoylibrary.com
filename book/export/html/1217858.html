  <h1 class="book-heading">Questions and answers</h1>
  
 <p>
These questions were put to Sri Chinmoy after his usual Sunday afternoon talks on Yoga, held at the Aum Centre.</p>
<h2>Question: I would like to ask something. What is the difference between the Voice of the Silence and the Voice of Yoga? Or is there a difference?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a difference. The Yoga encompasses everything. In Yoga you will get Silence, you will get Peace, Light and Power. You will get everything.</p>
<p>The Voice of the Silence, on the other hand, will give you a particular truth. You enter into your inner being, into the inner realm where the Silence actually exists. There, in the realm of the Silence, if you need a particular message, you will get it. The Voice of the Silence will give you a particular piece of knowledge, a particular truth.</p>
<p>But the Yoga is the whole, entire field and the Voice of Yoga is for all the seekers and especially for those who have seriously entered into the spiritual life. The Voice of the Silence is meant for a particular seeker at a particular time. During your meditation, for example, you can go deep within and you will hear the Voice of the Silence. But the Voice of Yoga you can have all the time. During your outer as well as your inner movements, you can hear the Voice of Yoga.</p>
<p>You have entered into the path of the spiritual life ... Yoga ... so you will get spiritual vibrations, thoughts, ideas and messages. All these divine things will be coming to you from the Voice of Yoga.</p>
