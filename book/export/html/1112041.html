<p>Last week two children came up to me while I was walking and wanted to walk with me. One asked why I was wearing the belt that I always use to support my back. I smiled at him.</p>
<p>The other one said, "Can't you see that he is fat?" So they had an argument.They walked with me for about 400 metres arguing back and forth. I was enjoying the argument.</p>
