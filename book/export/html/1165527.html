<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A blessing is that which keeps us consciously aware of God’s Presence. Everybody knows how to spell the word ‘God’ — G-O-D. It is in the dictionary. But how many hours a day are you aware of God’s Presence in your life, in your thoughts, in your actions? If you can be consciously aware of God’s Presence in your life during the entire day, then it is God’s Blessing. Unconsciously you may know that God does exist, you may believe in God, but if you are not consciously aware of God’s Presence in your life, that is not God’s Blessing. For a spiritual person, God’s Blessing means to consciously feel God’s Presence during the hours that you are fully awake. To think of God’s Presence, even if you do not feel it, is also a real Blessing for a seeker.</p>  </div>
