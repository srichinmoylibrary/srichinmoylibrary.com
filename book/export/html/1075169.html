<p>CONVERSATIONS</p>
<p>God said to me:<br /> "Son, you deserve God-realisation today<br /> And I am now granting it."</p>
<p>Satan immediately said to God:<br /> "No, not today, God.<br /> Tomorrow You may grant him realisation,<br /> If You are so consumed with that desire.<br /> Tomorrow will be the best time,<br /> I tell You, God."</p>
<p>God said to me:<br /> "Son, of late I have not been pleased with you.<br /> Therefore, I want to delay your God-realisation."</p>
<p>Satan immediately said to God:<br /> "God, I tell You once and for all<br /> That delaying will not satisfy You.<br /> Please cancel Your promise, God, for God's sake.<br /> I am telling You that if he is not ready by this time,<br /> In spite of Your infinite Compassion,<br /> He will never be ready.<br /> This is not only my unmistakable conviction,<br /> But also my immutable realisation."</p>
