<p>She and her husband and their two little daughters became the Master’s disciples. The wife felt sad and miserable that her children were not getting as much attention as the children of some of the other parents.</p>
<p>One day she came and threatened the Master. “Master, be impartial. My children are also God’s children. How is it that you don’t care so much for my children?”</p>
<p>The Master said, “I have equal love for each child, but some receive my love and concern in abundant measure while others do not receive it at all. In your children’s case, unfortunately, they do not receive my affection and love. I am not the culprit.”</p>
<p>She said, “Then who else is the culprit? Don’t fool me anymore. You can fool only my husband. Let him stay with you. I and my children are leaving you. I am not as stupid as my husband. Stupidity is not spirituality. Sincerity is spirituality. I am that sincerity.”</p>
<p>The Master said to her, “You stay with your sincerity, and I will stay with your husband and his stupidity.”</p>  </div>
