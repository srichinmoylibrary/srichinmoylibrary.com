<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are part and parcel of God the absolute Supreme. We are totally and inseparably one with Him. But we have come from the Source in order to take a conscious part in God’s cosmic Game. God is the eternal Player and we are participating in His cosmic Game. We have come into the world as representatives of God for the sake of manifestation. In order to manifest the divine within us, we come back to earth again and again. Inside us is strength, but if this strength is not utilised, we do not feel satisfied. Inside us is love, but if this love is not offered, we remain unfulfilled. Inside us is service, but if this service is not rendered, it does no good at all. If we do not manifest on earth what we have inside us, then our divinity is all in Heaven; it is all in dreamland, let us say.</p>
<p>But why do we come down the cosmic Tree when we could have stayed on the top of that Tree? It is because it is God’s Plan. God did not want to remain as one. He wanted to become many. He was one, but He thought He would like to enjoy Himself in infinite forms and shapes. That is why He created us. The song of multiplicity He is singing. It was for His own supreme Satisfaction that He made Himself into many forms. Seekers are consciously trying and non-seekers are unconsciously trying to arrive at the same satisfaction. Unless and until our divinity is manifested, we are not satisfied and we do not or cannot regain our Source.</p>  </div>
