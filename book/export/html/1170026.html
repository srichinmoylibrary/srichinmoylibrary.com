<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The supreme duty of an educator is to give himself away thrice: before he begins teaching, while he is teaching and after he has taught.</p>
<p>Before he begins teaching, he has to give himself away soulfully. While he is teaching, he has to give himself away unreservedly. After he has taught, he has to give himself away unconditionally.</p>  </div>
