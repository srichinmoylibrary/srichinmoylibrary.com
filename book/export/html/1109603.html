<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The philosophy of the mind can only satisfy the mind. This satisfaction is not real satisfaction at all because the mind is always dividing and dividing and multiplying and multiplying, doing all kinds of addition and subtraction. But the philosophy of the heart is only oneness, oneness, oneness. There you do not count or multiply or subtract. Only you try to become one with a particular reality. In that way you can satisfy your entire being.</p>
<p>The mind will look at a brick wall and immediately start scrutinising it. It will calculate how many bricks were needed to make this wall, what quantity of sand and so forth. But the heart does not calculate. It will only look at the wall and try to identify with it. This is the difference between the philosophy of the mind and the philosophy of the heart.</p>  </div>
