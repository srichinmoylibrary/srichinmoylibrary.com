<p>We pray and we meditate.</p>
<p>We pray for our protection. We meditate on God’s Perfection.</p>
<p>We pray to become divinely great and supremely good. We meditate to realise who we eternally are.</p>
<p>We pray so that we can see the beauty and the divinity of the higher worlds. We meditate so that we can receive invitations from the inner worlds.</p>
<p>When we pray, our Father-Friend lovingly feeds us. When we meditate, we soulfully feed our Father-Friend.</p>
<p>When we pray, our pure hunger itself is our striking success. When we meditate, our sure satisfaction itself is our illumining progress.</p>
<p>Our soulful prayer makes us our Lord’s choice instruments. Our fruitful meditation makes us our Lord’s Vision-Voice.</p>
<p>Our heart’s prayer-cry serves the divine in us. Our life’s meditation-smile awakens and enlightens the human in us. </p>
