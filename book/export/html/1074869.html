<p>HIS KNOWLEDGE AND HIS UNDERSTANDING</p>
<p>He knows everything.<br /> He knows everything<br /> And understands nothing.</p>
<p>He understands everything.<br /> He understands everything<br /> And knows nothing.</p>
<p>To be in the world of the soul<br /> Is to know everything.<br /> To be in the world of the mind<br /> Is to understand nothing.</p>
<p>To be in the world of the vital<br /> Is to understand everything.<br /> To be in the world of the body<br /> Is to know nothing.</p>
