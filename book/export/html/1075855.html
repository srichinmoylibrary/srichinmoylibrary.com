<p><em>After lunch</em></p>
<p><em>Foreman (turning to the Judge):</em> Your Honour, our fully considered verdict is unanimous so far as Aurobindo is concerned. We all are of the opinion that he is Not Guilty. As regards the others...</p>
<p><em>Beachcroft:</em> I accept your verdict and acquit Aurobindo of the charges brought against him. <em>(Turning towards C. R. Das)</em> Mr. Das, I congratulate you on your laborious study, patience, endurance and your able conduct of the case concerning your client Aurobindo.</p>
<p><em>C. R. Das:</em> I thank Your Honour for your kind appreciation of my personal efforts. I thank also the members of the jury for their unflagging patience and energy in following the case in detail from day to day and for giving their well-considered verdict.</p>
<p><em>Norton (coming forward and shaking C. R. Das by the hand):</em> You have the reward of your labour. I congratulate you.</p>
<p><em>C. R. Das:</em> Thank you very much, my learned friend.</p>  </div>
