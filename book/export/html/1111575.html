<p>From the start to the finish, I passed about thirty or forty people in the New Jersey race. Whenever I saw that someone was no more than ten metres ahead of me, I would run faster to catch him. Then, again I would see new people ahead of me and I would try to catch them.</p>
<p>One child about ten years old was competing with me mile after mile. He was not running; he was dancing and jumping. I didn't see his feet touching the ground!</p>
<p>Then he saw a little girl who was younger than he was go ahead of us and his ego came forward. He could not bear it. He ran very fast to go ahead of me and catch her. Then he saw that she had stopped; she had surrendered. After five miles the little boy himself surrendered and I didn't see him anymore.</p>
