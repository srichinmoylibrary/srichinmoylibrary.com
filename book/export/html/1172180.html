<p>When I was leaving, the main doctor happened to be there. I said, "I have to talk to you."</p>
<p>The doctor said, "Please, please come."</p>
<p>I went to the doctor's room, and we talked and talked. The doctor was very, very nice. With his compassion he melted my heart. I have no complaint against either of the doctors. While we were talking, I was praying to the Supreme that the Florida lady would leave. When I came out, she was not there. I was so happy.</p>  </div>
