<p>He has very strange theories about God.<br /> He thinks that he can live<br /> Without thinking about God,<br /> Whereas God cannot live<br /> Without thinking about him.<br /> He also thinks that there are two Gods.<br /> One God is a strict disciplinarian.<br /> This disciplinarian God wants nothing<br /> But perfection from the world.<br /> The other God is God Himself<br /> Who always remains Self-enamoured<br /> And Self-satisfied.</p>
