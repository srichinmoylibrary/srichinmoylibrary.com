<p>I wanted to buy two small garlands for R. I thought that the little girl who was selling them said that they were five bahts, but then she said, "No, that is for the shorter ones."</p>
<p>Then Savyasachi helped her by saying, "These are a little larger."</p>
<p>I wanted to buy two for five bahts, but she said, "No, five for each."</p>
<p>Finally I said to myself, "I have to buy them. " So I gave her 10 bahts. Then she started giggling because she had gotten such a high price.</p>
