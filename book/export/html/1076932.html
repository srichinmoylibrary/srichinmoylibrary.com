<p>But in the spiritual life, God gives us the capacity to do what He wants. Our surrender to Him is our way of helping ourselves, because He gives us the right attitude and tells us the kind of action that should take place in the outer world. God's Power and God's Light give us the capacity to help ourselves. We have to make an effort, but we must all the time remember that God is our Source. It is He who is giving us the capacity to help ourselves. We have to be His instruments. We do the work, but we have to do it for God. You are God's child and He will fulfil all your needs. Just as you fulfil your own child's needs, God will fulfil your needs.</p>  </div>
