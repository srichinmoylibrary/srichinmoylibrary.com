<p>I was working in Amrita-da's room. Amrita-da said: "I understand that Nirmala is not doing at all well today. Last night she didn't sleep at all."</p>
<p>I said to him: "Amrita-da, she talks too much."</p>
<p>"Ah, for that I do not have to go very far. How easily I could say the same about your Amrita-da."</p>  </div>
