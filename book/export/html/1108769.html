<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My message is very, very simple. When we talk about God, immediately we think of Heaven; God is somewhere high, higher, highest. We do not feel God's Presence on earth. Often we say that God is everywhere, but as soon as we start praying, we look up to the sky. If God is everywhere, then we have to see Him here on earth as well-inside you, inside me, inside nature.</p>
<p>Dumaguete's beauty, simplicity and purity are inspiring me far beyond my imagination. About an hour ago I was telling my students that Dumaguete is paradise. If I did not have responsibilities — as you know, I have students all over the world — I would have stayed here in Dumaguete for at least another month because it reminds me of the Indian village where I was born. I was born in a village in Chittagong, which is now part of Bangladesh. Previously it was in India. Dumaguete is exactly the same as that village, especially when it comes to nature's beauty. The only difference is that some buildings here are modern. The same simplicity, the same serenity, the same purity I see all around.</p>
<p>These divine qualities are Dumaguete's contribution to the visitors who come here like pilgrims from various parts of the world. In our case, some of my students are from America, Australia, England, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Canada, Sweden, Hungary and other places. For us life is a tree and all the countries are branches. If there were no branches, if there were only the trunk, then nobody would call it a tree. There have to be branches as well as flowers and fruits.</p>
<p>When we visit a different country, we feel we are climbing up a different branch of the life-tree. Here in Dumaguete the branch is offering us such beautiful flowers and most delicious fruits — particularly the life's simplicity and the heart's purity. These two things are of paramount importance, and for that we are very, very grateful to the people of Dumaguete and very, very proud of their natural achievements.</p>
<p>So in one sentence I can say that the simple life, the pure heart and the inquisitive mind of Dumaguete are, for us, genuine blessingful gifts.</p>  </div>
