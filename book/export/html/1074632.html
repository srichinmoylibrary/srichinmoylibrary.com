<p>There was a time when I loved<br /> The fantastic fabrics of the mind.<br /> There was a time<br /> When I lived my life<br /> Based on culled fictions.<br /> There was a time<br /> When I was satisfied<br /> With a fragment of reality,<br /> Splintered, broken and smashed.<br /> But now a lucid illumination<br /> Steals into my heart.<br /> The eternal Presence<br /> Of Infinity's Light<br /> Feeds my Vision's Dawn.</p>
