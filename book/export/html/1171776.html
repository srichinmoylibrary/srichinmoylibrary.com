<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God created flies and insects to make Himself perfect. Otherwise, you will say that God is only good. No, God needs all qualities in His creation, both good and bad. Flies cause irritation. This irritation is not a good quality, true. But God had to create that quality too, to prove that He is both night and day, good and bad. God said, "I am in the fly, and I want to develop irritation-power so I can say I know I have that capacity. Then only can I be completely perfect."</p>  </div>
