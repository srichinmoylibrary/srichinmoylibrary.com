<p>She and her husband had a lucrative business in Florida. Once she brought the Master a set of china plus a twenty-dollar bill. When she gave him the twenty-dollar bill, she told him, “Unfortunately, I cannot afford to give you a larger amount because our business is not doing well. And after all, why do you need the money? For spiritual people money is not necessary.”</p>
<p>The Master smiled at her and said, “True, true, spiritual people do not need money. They live on air. They don’t need material food.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry,” she said, “I won’t be able to give you regularly twenty dollars.”</p>
<p>The Master said, “Who wants to have twenty dollars from you regularly? Perhaps this will be your first and last time.”</p>
<p>She said, “How do you know?”</p>
<p>The Master said, “I do not know anything; I only presume.”</p>
<p>The Master was right. All the Master got from this extremely rich woman who followed his path for six months was one twenty-dollar bill.</p>  </div>
