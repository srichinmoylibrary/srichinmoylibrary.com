<h2>Question: Will you please speak about mantras?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> <em>Mantra</em> is a Sanskrit word. In Indian philosophy, spirituality and the inner life, <em>mantras</em> play a considerable role. A <em>mantra</em> is a syllable divinely surcharged with power. This power can be utilised for a divine purpose or for an undivine purpose once it is attained through chanting.</p>
<p><em>Mantras</em> are of two types. One kind of <em>mantra</em> is called <em>dhvani-antak,</em> which means 'with sound'. This <em>mantra</em> comes into existence from sound. The other kind of <em>mantra</em> is called <em>varnantak</em>, which means 'lettered'. This <em>mantra</em> is called a soundless mantra. When two things are struck together we hear a sound. But we hear the sound of AUM, the <em>anahata nada</em>, in the inmost recesses of our hearts. <em>Ahata</em> means struck; <em>anahata</em> means unstruck. <em>Varnantak</em> and <em>anahata</em> are the same.</p>
<p>At times we will discover that we hear the word we have been repeating even after we stop. If we continue repeating 'God, God, God,' for some time, when we stop, we will hear the same name of God being repeated inside our heart. The mouth is not functioning, but the inner being has started repeating the <em>mantra</em> naturally and spontaneously.</p>  </div>
