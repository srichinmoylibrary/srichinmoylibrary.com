<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one limit: how much God wants to reveal Himself through each individual. The only limit is God’s Will. God waits and waits and waits. Then, if He sees that somebody is receptive or that somebody has worked very hard, He may do something through that individual.</p>  </div>
