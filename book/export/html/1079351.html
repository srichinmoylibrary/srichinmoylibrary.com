<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to get a vacant mind, a calm mind, you have to focus your concentrated power on a particular subject or object. We feel that the heart is the safest spot. So if you can concentrate on your heart, if you can focus all your concentrated power on your heart, then you will be able to enjoy the calmness, the quietude and the tranquility of the mind.</p>  </div>
