<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Eternity feels like a self-giving and God-fulfilling tree, a conscious, self-giving and constantly God-becoming and God-fulfilling tree.</p>
<p>A self-giving tree, a God-becoming flower and a God-fulfilling fruit, or a self-giving tree which has God-becoming flowers and God-fulfilling fruits: this is Eternity.</p>  </div>
