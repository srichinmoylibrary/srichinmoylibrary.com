<h2>Question: How can I best acquire the qualities of the heart?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you can feel that you are five years old or seven years old, then you will remain pure, sincere and dedicated. But if you think that you are twenty-three or twenty-eight, then you will have to struggle with your mind. Just feel that you are five years old and you are playing in a garden. Let others think that you are a silly person; no harm.</p>
<p>So our path is the path of acceptance. The child accepts everything that he sees around him. He tries to accept everything and grasp everything. If you can sincerely feel that you are a child, if you can have a childlike heart, then you are going to make the fastest progress. But this feeling has to be spontaneous.</p>  </div>
