  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Can Yoga change my life?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly Yoga can change your life. What is life? Life is an institute. Yoga is research. When we accept Yoga, we become a research institute. When we research something, we enter into it and discover its truth. When we discover the Truth in ourselves, we feel that we have abundant capacity to do whatever we want to do with our life. This is the only way to change one's life.</p>
<p>Yoga is one's conscious oneness with the Highest. The Highest is always the Mightiest. When we have become one with the Mightiest, when we have the Omnipotent to help and guide us in our day-to-day life, then our life is bound to be transformed. Impurity is transformed into purity, doubt into faith, fear into courage, imperfection into perfection and finally death into Immortality.</p>  </div>
