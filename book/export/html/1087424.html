<p>They had the capacity to teach me and they were ready to help me. But I have such knee pain. What can I do? You are willing to help me to become a good runner, let us say. But if I am lame and can't even get up, how can you help me? Their promise to help me was very, very sincere, and even now they are eager to help me. But they do not have the capacity to cure my knee injuries. So my present incapacity has destroyed everything. Otherwise, in two or three months you would have seen my tennis game become totally different.</p>  </div>
