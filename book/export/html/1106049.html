<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> My mind wants outer education.<br /> My heart wants inner education.<br /> My mind wants to see the Truth<br /> In its own way.<br /> My heart wants to feel the Truth<br /> The way the Truth wants to be known<br /> And felt.<br /> My Lord Supreme,<br /> You want my inner education<br /> To come first and foremost in my life.<br /> Make me strong, make me confident<br /> So that I can please You at every moment<br /> By having You as my only Teacher<br /> In my life's inner school.<br /> I know that when I study<br /> In my heart's school,<br /> You will not only teach me,<br /> But also make me feel<br /> That I will be able to claim<br /> Your infinite Wisdom-Light-Ocean<br /> As my own, very own.</p>
