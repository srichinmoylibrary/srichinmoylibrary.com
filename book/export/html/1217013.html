<p>After visiting the Sultan, we had to go to the airport to catch a plane. Unfortunately, our bus driver was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>The Sultan immediately began ordering his people, "Get their driver!"</p>
<p>Then the police went into the town and found the driver having a cup of coffee with his friends.</p>
