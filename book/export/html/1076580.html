<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is absolutely correct that the soul has neither beginning nor end. It is constantly progressing and moving towards its Goal. It has infinite potentialities because it is part of the Self. In our <em>Gita</em>, we have the most sublime description of the soul: “The soul is ancient, permanent, eternal, immutable and all-pervading. Weapons cannot cleave it. Fire cannot burn it. Water cannot drench it. The wind cannot dry it.” This is the description of the soul given by the Lord, Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>You can easily see the difference between a human body and the soul. The body lasts for seventy or eighty years and then it has to die. The soul, however, is imperishable.</p>
<p>Everybody can see the soul. Not only can you see it, but you can talk to it.</p>  </div>
