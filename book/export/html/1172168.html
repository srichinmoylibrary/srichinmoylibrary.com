<p>I gave my book of talks at the United Nations to one family. That family was very close to us. There are three sisters and one brother. When I left the Ashram in 1964, Nolini made this young boy his assistant to take care of his mail and so on. I studied with him and we did sports together. His older sisters were extremely nice to me from the very beginning. Their names are Priti, Tapati and Arati. Arati is a professor at the Ashram university. She is older than I am by two years, I think. Once when I was going to the nursing home, I saw her. She said, "Tomorrow I am going to take the book to show my students and tell them all about you."</p>  </div>
