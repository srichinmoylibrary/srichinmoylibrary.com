<p>This morning, when I was out running, I heard the siren of an ambulance. It was coming nearer and nearer. I decided to go up onto the footpath. An old Chinese man was nearby. I have seen him many times. He said to me, “I thought the ambulance was for you!”</p>
<p>“I am ready,” I told him.</p>
<p>He was joking about the way I was running. He used to see me running before I injured my leg. Now I go very slowly.</p>
