<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To some extent it is true. If you are more interested in the vital life, then naturally it will be more difficult for you to practise the spiritual life. But again, many sincere Masters also have come to America recently. So, on the one hand, you are doing something wrong; on the other hand, you are fortunate enough to get help from someone who can help you. In this way, you can strike a balance.</p>  </div>
