  <h1 class="book-heading">A new double-arm record</h1>
  
 
<p>Today I lifted 160 pounds with both arms simultaneously on my very first attempt. The very thought of 160 pounds on each arm really frightens me. For a week I shall do 160 and then I shall try 165.</p>
<p>It is very difficult when the hands are separate to keep the balance. If there is only one bar you get help. This way, with two separate dumbbells, it is so difficult to concentrate. Each arm demands special attention. You have to pay equal attention to both arms. Otherwise, once one arm goes up, it is very difficult to bring the other one high.</p>
