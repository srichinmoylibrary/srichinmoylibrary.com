<p>The very function of spiritual light is to illumine and transform our darkness. Spiritual light, inner light, illumines our agelong imperfections and bondage.</p>
<p>Outer light is knowledge; inner light is realisation. With our outer light we want to go toward God. With our inner light we see and feel that we don't have to go <em>toward</em> God because we already are <em>in</em> God and God is already in us; we see and feel that God is our highest and most illumined part. With our outer light we feel God is a Goal to be realised. With our inner light we feel that not only is God our own, but God is the essence and substance of our own reality.</p>
<p>Without light, nothing can be accomplished in the spiritual life. With light, everything can be accomplished. In light everything is already accomplished.</p>  </div>
