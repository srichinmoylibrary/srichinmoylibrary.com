<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Originally I didn’t have any outer teacher, but right now I do have a teacher. Bill Pearl, champion of champions, five times Mr. Universe, is kind enough to teach me. Mr. Pearl has given me a set of exercises. I am a bad student, but he forgives me. The other day I had a talk with him. I told him that I am unable to do all the exercises that he has given me; it is too much for me. But he is very kind. He said, do your own exercises first, and then try to adapt yourself to my schedule.” I am not totally fit for all the exercises that he has given me, but I will definitely start doing them very devotedly and faithfully. So Bill Pearl is now my Himalayan bodybuilding Guru, and my inner Guru is God the Supreme.</p>  </div>
