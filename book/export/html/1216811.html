<p>The people in Okinawa are very polite. I was taking exercise this morning in the hall. The Okinawa chambermaids were politely waiting for me to finish before passing by. In America the hotel people would have pushed by. Even the lowest bellboy in Japan thinks and acts as if it were his hotel, and you are his honoured guest.</p>
