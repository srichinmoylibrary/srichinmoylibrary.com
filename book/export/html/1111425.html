<p>Before the first mile was over, I was ahead of Nirvik, and I was so delighted. Then, after two miles, he went ahead of me. I said, "Oh, he was fooling me."</p>
<p>After three and a half miles, I was only looking for Nirvik, but I couldn't see in. For five miles it went on like this. But later I surrendered. By the time we reached seven miles, he was following me.</p>
