<p>When I was packing to leave Glasgow for London, the two zippers on my bag broke. The disciples put my things in a garbage bag, but not everything fit. So I took out some expensive, very nicely wrapped candies that I had bought as gifts. I had already eaten a few.</p>
<p>Shantishri drove me to the airport, and again we were in a terrible rush. It was a fifteen-minute or half-hour drive. Then I realised that I had left behind a wristwatch that I had bought for X. It had a football game on it. So I asked Shantishri to go back to the hotel to get the wristwatch.</p>
<p>When she reached the hotel, forty minutes after we had left, everything was still in my room. Not only did she find my wristwatch and the expensive candies but also many other gifts that I had bought for people. I knew that I had forgotten the wristwatch and the candies, but I had no idea about the other things. There was a football that I had bought for Tejiyan's group and some other items. I had left my door open, but nothing was taken.</p>
