  <h1 class="book-heading">You are always using the word &amp;quot;consciousness&amp;quot;. What exactly does it mean?</h1>
  
 
<p>I will give you a very simple definition. Consciousness is the spark of life which connects each one of us with the Universal Life. It is the thread that puts us in tune with the universe. If you want to fly into the Transcendental, you need the thread of consciousness.</p>
<p>Consciousness is a spark that lets us enter into the Light. It is our consciousness which connects us with God. It is the link between God and man, between Heaven and earth.</p>  </div>
