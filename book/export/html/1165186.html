<p>I have infinite opportunities to go to God. I have unthinkable possibilities to go to the King of Ignorance.</p>
<p>When I live in material realities, I am a natural human being. When I live in spiritual realities, I am a supernatural divine being.</p>
<p>I possess and I am possessed by a fast-moving world. Although I myself am a colossal problem, I can solve considerably the countless problems of the world. How? Just by becoming a faithful servant to God's Will and by surrendering my expectations to God's Guidance and Assurance.</p>
<p>My fear of God is a roadblock to my life's peace. My love for God is a foretaste of the joy of God's cosmic creation.</p>
<p>To achieve my Goal was difficult. I have done it. To maintain my Goal is more difficult. I do it. To become my Goal will be most difficult. I shall do it, and I shall do it with my heart's mounting cry, with my soul's searching light, with my mind's sublime silence, with the forceful dynamism of my vital and finally with my body's absolute surrender.</p>
<p>I pray to God to transform my life into one long effort, fearless and egoless, so that I can derive the most fulfilling achievements from the most unpromising situations.</p>
<p>Every second is an open door to unparalleled opportunities. Let me be long on Heavenly performance and short on earthly talk.</p>
<p>I not only have a soul. I am the soul. I am not the ego. Neither do I need one. He that is not with me in my soul's endeavour is against me. But I must know that my God is also his God. No compromise, no compromise with the world's threatening night and unaspiring day.</p>  </div>
