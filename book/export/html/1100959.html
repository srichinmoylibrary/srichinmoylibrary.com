<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why is your mind afraid of visiting Heaven? I am dying to visit Heaven and live there, and you are afraid of it! Now, when you use the mind to visit Heaven, immediately the mind reminds you how many bad things you have done â€” how many bad things, unaspiring things, undivine things. The moment you think of Heaven with your mind, your mind gets frightened because you think that Heaven will immediately ask you, tell you or show you all the things you have done wrong.</p>
<p>But if you use the heart, like a child, it is totally different. A child is not at all afraid of coming to the mother or to the father. The child feels he is an open book to his parents. It is the responsibility of the parents to clean him, to ask him to tell the truth and to be a good person in every way. A child is not afraid. A child comes running even to a flame, a fire. He does not know that fire will burn him. He is always getting joy by coming to a new place. Heaven for a child is a new place.</p>
<p>If you use the heart, you will never be afraid of Heaven. But if you use the mind, immediately all the things you have done wrong will come to your mind, and then you will get frightened. If a student has not studied, if he has not done his homework, he will be afraid of coming to school because the teacher will scold him. But if the student knows he has worked very hard, he has done his homework, then he will not be afraid of the teacher, because he knows that he will pass the examination.</p>  </div>
