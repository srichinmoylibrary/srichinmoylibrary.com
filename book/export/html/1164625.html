<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know that the mind is a circle. Within that circle you can do many things, you can go many places. But you cannot go outside that circle, beyond the boundaries. These boundaries always remain the same. It is the same circle when you are four years old as it is when you are ninety. The heart is also a circle, but in the case of the heart the circle is constantly expanding and growing until it is infinite. In the heart there are no boundaries.</p>  </div>
