<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We cannot say that all Indian food is spicy. There are many people in India who avoid using spices or eating any hot preparations. In our own family, I like <em>rajasic</em> food but my brother Mantu will never go near chilli or anything hot. It depends on the individual. Some people like spicy foods; others don't. Especially in South India, people generally care for hot, spicy food more than in other parts of India. But there are many people in India who do not like hot food at all.</p>  </div>
