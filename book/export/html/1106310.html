<p>This morning, as usual, I lifted 180 pounds with my left hand. While I was holding the weight up, the mynah bird who lives in my weightlifting room said, “Sri, Sri.”</p>
<p>And then, when I came into the meditation room and stood in front of Mother Kali’s picture, at that time it said, “Sri, Sri, Sri.” Almost all the time the bird says, “Sri, Sri, Sri” when I stand in front of Mother Kali’s picture.</p>
