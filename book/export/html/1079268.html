<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we have human power, earthly power, we try to lord it over others; we want to show our supremacy. But when we acquire power from our meditation we try to offer it to the world at large; we use it to fight the world's ignorance. And if we still have ignorance in ourselves, we use the power that we get from meditation to illumine our own imperfections and to perfect our own individual consciousness.</p>  </div>
