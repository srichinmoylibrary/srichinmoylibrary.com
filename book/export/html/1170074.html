<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on what you feel from within. If you have faith in that person, then definitely take her Kriya Yoga classes. Study any Yoga in which you have faith. On earth there are many teachers. If you have faith in a particular teacher, then that is the one you should follow. At that time you do not have to ask somebody else about your teacher. If you have faith in a teacher, then you should try to increase it. It is like your love of God. If you love God, then I will always say, “Go on, go on and increase your love.” If you have faith in anybody or anything, then you should increase your faith and dedicate your life to that person or that ideal.</p>
<p>What is a disciple? A disciple is one who has faith in a Master. If he has no faith in a Master, then he is not at a disciple. If you have faith in that particular lady, then follow her path. But if you do not have faith, then no matter what I say, your mind will immediately argue with me and doubt me. If I say, “She is extremely good,” then if something happens tomorrow and you lose faith, at that time you will find fault with me. Again, if I say, “No, she is not good,” then you will say, “Oh, he is just jealous of her.” The human mind is so tricky. If I say “good,” in a few days you will be assailed by doubt and you will think that I am totally wrong. And if I say “bad,” you will argue inwardly, and you will try to prove in so many ways that she is good, she is divine, she is perfect.</p>
<p>Trying to assess this teacher or to judge me is simply a waste of your own precious time. Only ask your heart: “Do I have faith, implicit faith in her?” If your heart says, “Yes,” then forget about me, forget about the rest of the world. But if your heart says, “No, I don’t have implicit faith,” then she is not the right person for you. Your faith is the answer. What more can I say? Your faith, your inner faith, will always guide you.</p>  </div>
