<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, all children can and must be reached spiritually. Needless to say, it is infinitely easier to reach children spiritually than to reach them any other way. For children are nothing but fresh and beautiful flowers ready to be placed on the altar of God the Truth, God the Light and God the Delight.</p>  </div>
