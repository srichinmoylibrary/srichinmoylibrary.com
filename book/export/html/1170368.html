<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Enlightenment is a matter of inner study. As you go to school to acquire mental knowledge, even so, when you study within yourself, you acquire inner knowledge; you get Peace, Light and Bliss. Inner study is called inner discipline. When we know how to discipline our lives, when we can establish a free access to the inner planes, we get Peace, Light, Bliss and other divine qualities in abundant measure. But we have to study. When we aspire for a better, higher and more illumining life, automatically we get it.</p>  </div>
