<p>In India, no matter which hour of the day you go into a store, you are always the first customer. If you go at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock or even in the afternoon, the owner will say you are the first customer, and that is why he is lowering the price for you.</p>
<p>When I passed by one store, from a distance I could see that there were customers inside. The store was selling T-shirts. I thought that perhaps people were buying because they were quite cheap, so fifteen minutes later I went into the store. The salesman immediately told me that he would give me a very good price, since I was his first customer.</p>
