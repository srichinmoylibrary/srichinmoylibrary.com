<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we have a dream from the lower worlds, we do not want to identify ourselves with it, for we are badly frightened by it. The dream comes to us as a threat. But a dream that comes from the higher worlds comes as an invitation. We get inner joy and inner satisfaction and immediately feel our identity there. Then we have to enter into it and grow into it.</p>  </div>
