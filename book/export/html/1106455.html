<p>I have started a new lift. I did it many years ago, at the very beginning of my weightlifting career. The proper name is clean and press. Perhaps it is called ‘clean’ because you are sweeping the ground!</p>
<p>With both arms I was able to lift up 40 pounds and with my right arm I lifted 70 pounds. I feel I could have gone to 80 pounds. This is one lift that I have never shown on the stage.</p>
