<p>In the afternoon also there was a car following me. Around my 700-metre mark a middle-aged man saw me. He said, "Sir, I do not know your name, but you are a very nice person. I have seen your picture in the train."</p>
<p>So I looked at him and thanked him.</p>
<p>Then I made a turn at 800 metres. Lavanya was running by. She thought it was the same story as in the morning — that the man was harassing me — so she came quite fast to my rescue. But the man was so nice — so happy to see me in the street.</p>
<p>Altogether, today I walked 13 miles.</p>
