<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes you get tremendous joy, which you cannot account for or explain. There is no outer reason, but you are just feeling spontaneous joy. It is because your soul has come to the fore at that particular time. If you see that your joy is going away while talking to someone, then immediately try to shorten your conversation with that person. If you are doing something that is taking away your joy, then immediately stop doing that thing. When you get joy from within and it is still very fresh, do not do anything that diminishes it until that joy is strengthened inside you. No matter how long it takes to assimilate this joy — whether it is a half hour or an hour or even two hours — just give yourself the time. Once it is assimilated into your system, then it is safe. Before you are secure in your joy, even one word from someone can take it away totally. So always be extremely careful when your soul comes to the fore and gives you spontaneous joy. Immediately you should try to go deep within and assimilate it.</p>
