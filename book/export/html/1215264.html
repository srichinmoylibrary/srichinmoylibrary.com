<p>My Lord,<br /> I have so many complaints against You!<br /> Are You kind enough,<br /> Are You brave enough<br /> To listen to my complaints?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> I am neither kind nor brave,<br /> But I am wise."</p>
<p>My Lord,<br /> What do You mean?</p>
<p>"I shall tell you what I mean later on.<br /> In the meantime,<br /> Let me hear all your complaints<br /> Against Me."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215266" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Why have You given me<br /> A mind thick with darkness-nights?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215267" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved,<br /> Why do You allow<br /> The unfortunate memories<br /> Of my past<br /> To invade and torture me<br /> So ruthlessly?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215268" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> Can You not see<br /> That my days and nights<br /> Are made of insufferable afflictions?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215269" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> This world of Yours does not want me.<br /> It does not even need me.<br /> Yet not a single day passes by<br /> When You do not ask me<br /> To love and serve this world.<br /> My Lord, tell me,<br /> Why do You do this to me?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215270" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved,<br /> Over the years I have been telling You<br /> That this world is a bed of thorns.<br /> But You go on telling me<br /> That this world is a bed of roses.<br /> I am the sufferer!<br /> To me, You are nothing but a Lecturer!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215271" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> Do You think that Your Ears<br /> Are too precious to listen<br /> To the prayers of my innocent heart?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215272" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> What can I expect from You,<br /> Since You literally do not want to feel<br /> The agonies of my heart?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215273" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved,<br /> Why do I have to convince my mind<br /> Unnecessarily and foolishly<br /> That without You,<br /> My life will be compelled<br /> To flicker feebly?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215274" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> Because I pray to You the whole night<br /> To please You,<br /> Sleep is displeased with me<br /> And it is jealous of You.<br /> Sleep has deserted me for good.<br /> You have also deserted me.<br /> Alas, where do I stand?<br /> Alone, helpless, worthless and useless!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215275" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Alas, my mind has taught me<br /> Only two mantras:<br /> "What shall I do?<br /> Where shall I go?"<br /> I am sure You have taught<br /> These two mantras<br /> To my mind!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215276" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved,<br /> You have nothing better to do<br /> Than subject me to the pain<br /> Of Your Absence.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215277" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> Are You blind<br /> That I have to give You sight to see<br /> That I am standing in front of You<br /> In streaming tears?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215278" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I sing Your Victory-Songs<br /> At the top of my voice.<br /> I can clearly see<br /> That You have kept<br /> Your Ears completely sealed.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215279" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved,<br /> There was a time<br /> When I thought<br /> You belonged to me<br /> And I belonged to You.<br /> Now I am fully convinced<br /> That You and I<br /> Are two perfect strangers,<br /> And we belong to two totally<br /> Different worlds.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215280" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> Every day early in the morning<br /> You send someone to lecture me.<br /> How is it that that person<br /> Does not tell You<br /> That my aspiring limbs<br /> Are all shattered<br /> And that I do not have even an iota<br /> Of love for You?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215281" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Can You not see<br /> That my life is doomed<br /> To watching and waiting?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215282" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved,<br /> It seems that Your inner plane<br /> And outer ear<br /> Will never start functioning.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215283" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> Sometimes I burst into roaring laughter<br /> When I call You<br /> "My Lord of unconditional Compassion."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215284" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You have made me mad<br /> With the desire to see You.<br /> I am doing my duty extremely well.<br /> But do You believe in fulfilling Your Duty?<br /> How is it that, even for a fleeting second,<br /> You do not come and stand before me?<br /> How long will You enjoy<br /> Your Compassion-famine-Life?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215285" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">21.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved,<br /> I have seen the world.<br /> I have also seen its ways —<br /> Deception from the beginning<br /> To the end.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215286" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">22.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> Why do You have to hide<br /> Your illumination<br /> From this world?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215287" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I cry for Your Compassion.<br /> You enjoy watching<br /> Your Compassion snoring.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215288" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved,<br /> I cry for Your Protection.<br /> You prove to me<br /> That Your Heart-Dictionary<br /> Does not house the word<br /> 'Protection’.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215289" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> I cry to You<br /> To save my reputation.<br /> You, as usual,<br /> Turn Your deaf Ear<br /> To me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215290" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">26.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved,<br /> My prayers and meditations<br /> Are so disappointed in You<br /> That they tell me<br /> They are at a perfect loss.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215291" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">27.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Every day I send my pure heart<br /> In search of You.<br /> With such eagerness<br /> My heart runs here and there<br /> To catch a glimpse of You<br /> And prostrate before You<br /> With such humble petition.<br /> Alas,<br /> Every day it comes back to me<br /> With utterly fruitless failure-pangs.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215292" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">28.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> I wanted to be the slave<br /> Of Your Heart.<br /> Perhaps it was presumptuous<br /> On my part.<br /> I changed my mind.<br /> I wanted to be the slave<br /> Of Your Eye.<br /> Perhaps that too was presumptuous<br /> On my part.<br /> I wanted to be the slave<br /> Of Your Feet.<br /> Alas, Your lack of response<br /> Clearly showed me<br /> That it was nothing but audacity<br /> On my part.<br /> Now I want to be the slave<br /> Of the dust of Your Feet.<br /> Even the dust of Your Feet<br /> Does not care for the pangs<br /> Of my heart!<br /> My life is dancing inside<br /> My humiliation-pride-room.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215293" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">29.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> If it is too difficult to save my life<br /> In my own way,<br /> At least save me and my life<br /> In Your own Way,<br /> Instead of not saving me at all!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215294" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">30.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved,<br /> Just because I call You my own,<br /> Nobody wants me to be their own.<br /> No! Not even my mind is willing<br /> To accept me as its own.<br /> They have all forsaken me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215295" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">31.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> The fire of my ceaseless longing for You<br /> Has done only one thing:<br /> Instead of illumining my heart,<br /> It has burned my heart to ashes!<br /> Alas,<br /> Who can ever be a greater fool<br /> Than I am?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215296" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">32.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> My mind is permanently in a rage<br /> That I spend all my time<br /> Foolishly on You.<br /> I could have spent my time,<br /> According to my mind,<br /> More wisely and fruitfully.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215297" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">33.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved,<br /> I thought You gave me the path<br /> Of sweet, illumining<br /> And fulfilling devotion.<br /> But now I see<br /> That the path You have given me<br /> Is the path of birthless<br /> And deathless frustration.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1215298" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">34.</h1>
  
 

<p>"My child,<br /> Are you not tired<br /> Of your marathon-complaints?"<br /> My Lord, why?<br /> Why should I be?<br /> If You can enjoy<br /> Your infinite Peace and Bliss<br /> All by Yourself<br /> While torturing me,<br /> My heart,<br /> And even my breath,<br /> Why should I remain silent?<br /> But, my Lord, if You are tired,<br /> Then I can show You<br /> My unsolicited compassion.<br /> And to-morrow,<br /> At our mutual leisure time,<br /> I can drive my complaint-train<br /> And give You<br /> A longer than the longest ride!</p>
