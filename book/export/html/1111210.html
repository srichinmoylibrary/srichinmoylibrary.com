<p>Every day, at about four in the morning, I run down Ashford Avenue, but it is so dark that I can never really see it. Then, during the day when I ride in the car down Ashford Avenue, it looks so different. I can't believe that I have run that far. I can only marvel and say to the disciples with me, "Look how far I have run!"</p>
