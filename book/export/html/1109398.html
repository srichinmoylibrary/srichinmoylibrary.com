<p>Saint Augustine has blessed us with a profound message: "Love, and then do what thou wilt."</p>
<p>Our mind thinks that this is absolutely true. Our heart feels that this is undeniably true. But unfortunately, in our day-to-day life, we are not able to practise it. That is to say, we do not know what love is. We do not know why we love something or someone. Finally, we do not know how to love.</p>  </div>
