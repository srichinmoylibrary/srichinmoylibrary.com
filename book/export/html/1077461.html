<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good question. Not only does Saturn have a connection with us; other planets also have a connection. Somebody can be more influenced by one planet than another, but each individual has some connection with the planets. Some souls are very powerful, or very receptive, or very fortunate, and the Supreme is extremely affectionate to those particular souls. So the planets also become more friendly with those souls. It is like pleasing the manager of a factory. If the boss likes someone, then the subordinates all try to be kind and nice to that person. So if the Supreme Boss is pleased with a particular soul, all the planets make it a point to be kind and affectionate and to offer their good qualities to that soul.</p>
<p>Ordinary people will be afraid of Saturn because Saturn represents renunciation. Ordinary householders invoke Saturn so that he will not come to them. They pray to Saturn: “Please do us a favour. Don’t come near us.” But when a spiritual person invokes Saturn, he says, “Please come and give me the message of renunciation. I don’t want to wallow in the pleasures of ignorance any longer. I want only God. I am wearing millions of ignorance garments. Please take them away.” That is the traditional Indian way. We renounce the things that are not essential to our spiritual life, the things that are of no use to us in realising God. We invoke Saturn to take away the things that give us no help, such as earthly desires. At that time, Saturn is a great help to the sincere seeker. But people who want to fulfil their earthly desires ask Saturn not to come to them.</p>
<p>Each soul is connected with some planet, and each planet has some influence on the soul. But it cannot be the same for each person. Sometimes it is very little, sometimes very much. When the seeker becomes spiritually advanced, on the verge of God-realisation, he or she can easily enter into the planet worlds. Some seekers are fortunate because the Absolute Supreme is fond of them. So the planets give them everything in order to make the Absolute Supreme happy. Again, when a seeker is sincerely aspiring and making very good progress, at that time all the planets may come to help him.</p>  </div>
