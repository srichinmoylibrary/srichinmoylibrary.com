<p>This morning when I ran two miles and walked two miles, Databir followed me in the car. Then I saw Niriha. I thought that her intuition was working and she would go home and bring her video camera to take pictures. But Niriha never came back. My second mile timing was 8:30 in spite of one long hill. As soon as I go over five miles, my left leg suffers so much!</p>
