<p><em>Madal:</em></p>
<p>Chinmoy, in the past some Indian spiritual Masters were almost <em>bestial</em>. I simply cannot imagine how they could behave in that way towards their spiritual children. Please tell me why they were like that.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>Madal, unfortunately even now there are many Eastern and Western spiritual Masters who are extremely <em>cruel and violent</em> to their children. It is, as you said, incredible. However, the reason is very simple. These spiritual Masters do not care for the transformation of their own nature at all. A Yogi without the transformation of his outer nature will be able to manifest only very little of his inner divinity on earth.</p>  </div>
