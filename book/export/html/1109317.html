<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Feel that you have a dedicated heart and an illumined soul, and allow the dedicated heart and the illumined soul to work in the mind. Or become one with the dedicated heart and the illumined soul, and then enter into the mind and try to transform the doubting mind into the searching mind. Then enter into the vital, the aggressive vital, with your searching mind, dedicated heart and illumining soul. Immediately the aggressive vital will become the dynamic vital. Then bring the dynamic vital, searching mind, dedicated heart and illumining soul into the lethargic body. The body will try to respond to the light of the vital, mind, heart and soul. At that time, your body will no longer sleep. It will cry for more light and keep its eyes wide open to receive more light from above.</p>  </div>
