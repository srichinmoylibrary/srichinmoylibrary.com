<p>A Hindu and a Muslim were in a bookstore on Fifth Avenue. Both of them were browsing through religious books in the religious section. All of a sudden, the Muslim said to the Hindu: “Krishna Salaam!” Then he placed his hand on his forehead and actually showed the salaam. So with folded hands the Hindu immediately said, “Allah Namaste!”</p>  </div>
