<p>Today Pulak took me to US Air to walk. Agraha accompanied us. Outside the terminal, the security men did not allow Pulak to park, so he had to circle round. Then he parked at one place and told the security, "Please let me wait here. It is a matter of two minutes."</p>
<p>The man was very, very nice to him and allowed him to wait at that place. Pulak waited for two minutes. Then the goddess of sleep descended on him. Meanwhile, I had finished my walk and Agraha and I were waiting outside the terminal for Pulak to come. Agraha was watching the time. So many minutes passed. We could not believe that he would take such a long time. Where could Pulak have gone?</p>
<p>Finally, after twenty-one minutes, Pulak appeared. As usual, Pulak said, "It cannot be twenty-one minutes! It is impossible. I just fell asleep for a minute or two."</p>
<p>We were wondering and wondering where he was. Even the security guard could not believe he was taking so long. How could he take such a long time? Pulak was 'meditating'.</p>
