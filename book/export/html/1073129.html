<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The American Indians are always looked down upon as inferior. Therefore, they have some inner resistance to throwing themselves heart and soul into pleasing, satisfying and fulfilling other Americans. But in this Bicentennial period, they should forget their sad dispute in the one-family reality. The weaker one should come to the fore and offer his present capacity to the stronger one, for the stronger one badly needs the capacity of the weaker one. It is like a tug-of-war. The stronger one needs the help of the weaker, since the combined strength of the stronger and the weaker naturally surpasses the strength that the stronger one would have if he were alone. So the American Indians should celebrate the American Bicentennial. If they do so, the American heart quality, which is nothing short of oneness, will grant them material wealth as well as spiritual help. The American Indians would be wise if they cared for quick progress in the inner life and success in the outer life by becoming one with the other Americans.</p>  </div>
