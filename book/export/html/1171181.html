SCA 706-710. Excerpts from an interview with the newspaper <em>Novy Cas</em>, which took place in Bratislava, Slovakia, on 11 November 1993.</p>
<h2>Question: Could you tell us what you were talking about during your interview with our President?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> President Kováč was extremely kind and compassionate to me. He was appreciating what I am doing in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, and I appreciated and admired him for his many, many good qualities. I often use the term ‘interdependence’. Your President has such a good heart. He tries to bring forward the good qualities of all human beings and also all nations — the neighbouring nations and nations quite far from here.</p>  </div>
