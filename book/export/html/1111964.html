<p>Today I saw Premik and I couldn't believe how loudly he was breathing. From a hundred metres away I could hear, "Hee! Hee!" I thought something serious was taking place while he was approaching me.</p>
<p>When he came near me, he stopped making those noises, but then after ten metres he started again. Such a loud noise! Other runners also make noise when they run, but Premik was really something!</p>
<p>Once I was running a marathon and I was breathing very loudly. A man running by me said, "Did you check with your doctor?"</p>
