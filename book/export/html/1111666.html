<p>The other day, when I was in the car on my way to do hill work, I saw four girls at the one-mile mark — Tina, Christine, Diane and Irene. Instead of running, they were standing around in a circle.</p>
<p>Later, I heard that they have a club. They run together every morning. After one mile they meditate before going back.</p>
