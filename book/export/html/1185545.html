<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Whomever I select definitely is meant for our path. People do not come to us all of a sudden. They come because they have a connection here. Sometimes they have a dream about me or they read my books and get intense joy. People I take are definitely meant for me, but then they go away. It is not because they chose the wrong path. They go away not because they made a mistake. Their mistake was to leave the Centre.</p>  </div>
