<p>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had said: "I believe in God. I also believe in prayer." He also said that for him, spirituality consisted in two kinds of practices.</p>
<p>The first of these was the practice of self-assertion. He told himself that he had overcome the human frailties such as lust, anger, temptation and fear. "This practice gives me a lot of strength and through it I have overcome many weaknesses," he said.</p>
<p>The other practice was self-surrender. In his words: "I am but an instrument in the hands of the Divine.... I try to repeat in my mind 'Thy Will be done' in a spirit of self-surrender."</p>
<p>Is it not wonderful that India's only warrior-statesman was also a deeply spiritual person? On the occasion of his hundredth birth anniversary let us remember what he once said: "Let us dream of an India for which it would be worthwhile to give all that we have...." We must dedicate ourselves to this ideal once again.</p>
