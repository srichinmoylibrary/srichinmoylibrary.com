<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know what kind of request it is. Divine love does not mean blind love. It does not mean that whenever somebody comes to me, immediately I have to give him something. No! Divine love has to be properly guided by divine wisdom. If someone comes and asks me for money, since I am a spiritual person and my heart is full of love, I may give him a dollar. Then suppose he goes to a bar to drink. My love has played its role. I gave him what he asked for, and now my job is ended. But who is responsible for my stupid love? In the inner world I am responsible. I helped that person unconsciously in his wrong action. I have to know when to say 'no'; otherwise, I will become the loser. Love is wonderful, but if we don't know how to utilise love it can create problems.</p>  </div>
