<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We cannot make any comparison between philosophy and poetry. They are two different fields. I can only say that philosophy is like a very large ship, whereas poetry is like a very small and cute boat. The philosophy-ship carries many, many more passengers than the poetry-boat.</p>  </div>
