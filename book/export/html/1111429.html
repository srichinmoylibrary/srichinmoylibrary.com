<p>I was running this afternoon near the tennis court where Malati teaches. I went there while having my sauna in Vinaya's car. Vinaya takes me here, there and everywhere with the heat turned up to about a hundred and twenty degrees, and it is so hot! We happened to be near Malati's court when I got out of Vinaya's sauna-car and started running. I didn't see Malati, though.</p>
