<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, by practising one's own religion one can realise God. But one has to feel that there is something else higher and deeper than religion and that is the constant inner cry. Religion as such will tell us there is a God. It will tell us that we have to be good, we have to be kind, we have to be simple, sincere and pure. This much religion will offer us. This is general religion. But there is also a spiritual religion which is higher and deeper. It will say that it is not enough just to know that God exists. We also have to see Him, we have to feel Him, we have to grow into Him. And this we do through prayer and meditation.</p>  </div>
