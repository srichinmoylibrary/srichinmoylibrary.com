<p>Before I lifted the elephant in Connecticut this morning, I garlanded it. I was telling the elephant, “We have to become very good friends.”</p>
<p>We were very good friends when I was lifting it up and also when I was offering it my gratitude. But, at the last minute, the elephant frightened me and I had to run away.</p>
<p>The elephant’s name was Karen, the same as Mahiyan’s sister.</p>
