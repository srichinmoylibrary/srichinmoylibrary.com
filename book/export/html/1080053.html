<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each religion not only <em>claims</em> to teach the truth but actually teaches the truth. But merely teaching or preaching the truth is not enough. If the religion can live the truth — that is to say, if it can bring to the fore the living breath, the reality-light of truth — then that religion is the most true. The religion that lives the truth in all its aspects — in its height and depth, in its universality and transcendence — that particular religion is the most true. The religion that embodies and lives the ultimate truth of love and oneness is by far the most significant, the most important and indispensable religion.</p>  </div>
