<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How do you overcome ignorance? With your aspiration. Always try to cry inwardly to overcome ignorance-sleep. When you sleep you don’t cry; but when you cry you can’t sleep. When a child is really sleeping, he cannot cry; he has to awaken first. And when he is pinched with hunger and crying for nourishment, then he can’t sleep. The outer cry is for name and fame; the inner cry is for Peace, Light and Bliss. If you can cry for Peace, Light and Bliss, then ignorance-sleep will automatically leave you.</p>  </div>
