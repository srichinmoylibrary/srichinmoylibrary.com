<p>MY DAUGHTER</p>
<p>My daughter,<br /> Of late I have been thinking and thinking<br /> Of granting you a Transcendental Boon.<br /> Just tell Me what you want.<br /> "Father, my Eternally Beloved Father,<br /> This is the Boon I would like<br /> To have from You:<br /> Please never, never dream<br /> Of making me equal to You.<br /> You know, Father,<br /> There is only one thing on earth<br /> That gives me infinite joy,<br /> And that is to sit at Your Feet<br /> And drink the Nectar-Delight<br /> Of Your Eyes.<br /> Your Feet are my only<br /> Heaven and Haven.<br /> If I equal You<br /> My life of devotion will die,<br /> My life of surrender will die.<br /> To me, my devotion is everything;<br /> To me, my surrender is everything.<br /> Father, I pray and pray to You<br /> To live above me at least a trillion miles<br /> Forever<br /> So that I can, through eternity,<br /> Live at Your Feet<br /> And<br /> Treasure Your Feet."</p>
