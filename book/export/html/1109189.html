  <h1 class="book-heading">The common good of mankind</h1>
  
 
<p>Division is cast aside, suspicion is buried in oblivion, faith in all human beings is restored when all nations scrupulously, devotedly and untiringly work together. Then only can they proudly invoke and reveal the peace-sun of eternal love and universal oneness. In the words of the universal statesman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nowadays, the State's morality has to be in keeping with the morality of mankind, and all political decisions are the outcome of a compromise between purely national interests and the interests of the international community. It is on this world ethic that peace, the supreme universal good, is based. To build peace is in fact to abolish frontiers, to transcend private interests and pursue the common good of all mankind."</p>
