 <p>
JSBH 9-11. Sri Chinmoy first met Akishige Matsumoto, Honorary Doctor of Laws and Chairman of the Executive Office of the Japan Republic Association, in 1986. During Sri Chinmoy's 1987 trip to Japan, he met with Mr. Matsumoto several times. These are excerpts from their reunion on 27 September 1987 in Kyoto.</p>
<h2><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The moment I see you, I see a sea of peace, a sea of joy. I see your heart of purity.</h2>

<p><em>Mr. Matsumoto:</em> Your words are too precious for me. I am very grateful, very grateful for your words. As a Japanese saying goes, "From this one meeting will come myriad opportunities." With this spirit I have been waiting for your arrival in Japan.</p>  </div>
