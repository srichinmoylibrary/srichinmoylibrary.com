    <title>Question: You have been able to predict many events, such as Carl Lewis’ victory at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. How do you obtain these premonitions or visions of the future? Do you search for them? Do you always feel the need to communicate your findings?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Before the finals for the 200 metres of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, I met with Carl Lewis and we meditated together for about 15 minutes. At that time I predicted not only Carl Lewis’ victory but also the second, third and fourth place finishers as well. Our conversation, including my prediction, was videotaped. I do not search for these revelations; I merely open myself to them. I was able to make this particular prediction because I heard an inner voice. Also, I clearly saw with my third eye what was going to happen in the race.</p>
<p>Similarly, I predicted what was going to happen with East and West Germany when I was standing in front of the Berlin Wall four years ago. I said that within several years East Germany and West Germany would be united. To my greatest joy, my prophesy has come true. But although I am frequently blessed with the vision to see what is going to happen in the near or distant future, I usually do not communicate this knowledge, since it is not generally helpful for people to know what the future holds in store.</p>
<p>I do not give much importance to predictions. I give all importance to God’s Grace. It is God’s Grace that helps humanity most, by giving us inspiration and encouragement, and by intensifying our aspiration and dedication. But if I want to know the future, my Beloved Supreme, out of His infinite Bounty, has given me the capacity to see it. On the eve of each New Year, for example, I offer an inspirational message about the coming year, and this message bears fruit in the course of the year.</p>  </div>
