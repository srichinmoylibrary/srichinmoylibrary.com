SCA 114-124. On 2 April 1989 Sri Chinmoy was invited to meditate with the nuns and Mother Superior of the Benedictine Monastery Heiligenkreuz in Cham, near Zug, Switzerland. Afterwards, he answered their questions. This is a transcript of that question-and-answer session.</p>
<h2>After the meditation at Heiligenkreuz Monastery</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the depths of my heart I wish to offer my most soulful gratitude to the Mother Superior and to the Sisters of this convent for having given me this blessingful opportunity to pray and meditate at their most beautiful and soulful chapel.</p>
<p><em>Mother Superior:</em> This reminds me of my visit to South Korea, where we also have Sisters. We had contacts with Buddhist monks and we tried to be one in meditation together.</p>  </div>
