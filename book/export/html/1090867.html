    <title>Question: Sometimes when I look at the sunshine and I close my eyes, I see a round disc in front of my eyes with the blossom-colour that is described by some writers as the colour of the vital body. Is that my own vital body?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At times you see the reflection of your own vital body and at times you see the reflection of the object you are looking at. Each object has a subtle part. Even a wall has a subtle part. Although you are seeing the form of the wall, behind the wall or within the wall, there is a subtle form. You see the subtle form coming forward.</p>  </div>
