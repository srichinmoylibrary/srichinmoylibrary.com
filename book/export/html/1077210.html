<p>Clearly, pointedly and illuminingly Einstein told the world what the actual role of the United Nations is: <em>“The United Nations now and world government eventually must serve one single goal — the guarantee of the security, the tranquility and the welfare of all mankind.”</em> Here the scientist proved that he was something more than a scientist, more than a philosopher, more than an intellectual — indeed, a true possessor of wisdom-tower. The hopes and dreams he had for the United Nations will most assuredly turn into realities some day.</p>
<p>His seeker-heart declared: <em>“We are convinced that the United Nations will be able to develop into a world government only when the Assembly is no longer composed of delegates appointed by governments, but, instead, of representatives elected directly by the people. Only in this way will the delegates serve the interests of supranational order and security according to their own best judgement.”</em></p>
<p>Again: <em>“The extension of the United Nations, to encompass possibly all countries, will create a better basis for disarmament negotiations; hence efforts to increase membership should precede any attempt to solve the problem of disarmament.”</em></p>
<p>Sooner than at once he appreciated the goodness and wisdom in others. In his journey towards the supreme goal of oneness, he appreciated and admired all his fellow travellers who dreamt of one world, one home and one heart. To Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Einstein wrote: <em>“You are one of the very few who, in the midst of the bewilderment and confusion of our time, has succeeded in keeping his vision clear, and whose urge to be of constructive help remains undeterred by obstacles and narrow allegiances.... I am one of the many whose thoughts accompany you with gratitude and hope.”</em></p>
<p>In Einstein the world saw a man of spontaneity, a man of sincerity who cared for world-progress more than anything else. It was not who did something, but that the thing was done that he considered of paramount importance. Again, when he saw the doer, he admired him unreservedly for his unparalleled achievement. After hearing a talk by United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold, Einstein wrote: <em>“I cannot refrain from expressing my sincere admiration for your address on the occasion of the Columbia University Bicentennial Celebration. In the wake of so much mendacity and hypocrisy, your lucid and honest remarks were a welcome relief. I consider it fortunate that a man such as yourself has been entrusted with the most important and difficult position which you now occupy.”</em></p>
<p>Dag Hammarskjold replied, “It was my intention to present a vigorous and unequivocal declaration on behalf of those ideals and principles that constitute the only possible background and the only possible atmosphere for the work of a man who, like you, is one of the pioneers of mankind…. It is a truly deep satisfaction for me to know that you not only understand what I tried to communicate to the large audience… but that you also approve of what I said. Such understanding, especially coming from you, is meaningful to me beyond words.”</p>
<p>These two immortals sailed in the same boat Their admiration was not mere admiration, but the manifestation of oneness-life from their oneness-soul.</p>  </div>
