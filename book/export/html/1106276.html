<p>I wanted to find my picture in the magazine “Physical Fitness and Muscular Development.” When I was in Hawaii recently, I saw the clipping and so I knew it was in the November issue. When I went to buy the magazine, I saw that the cover was unbearable. Then I opened up the magazine and my picture was there.</p>
