<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are absolutely right. Good will is love in action and it has to be fostered in mankind. But in order to foster good will, we have to know where it comes from. Does it come from the physical mind? No! Does it come from the dynamic vital? No! Does it come from the alert body? No! Good will comes only from the aspiring heart, the heart that cries to see its Beloved Supreme in itself and in all other hearts. This good will, which comes from the aspiring heart, is undoubtedly love in action. And without fail it has to be fostered in order to accelerate humanity's progress.</p>
