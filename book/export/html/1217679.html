<h2>I. Humility</h2>


<p>A blade of grass am I.<br /> Ere long my breath shall die.<br /> Wilt Thou not show thy Face<br /> And feed my hope with Grace?</p>

<p>God has yet to fix the value of humility. Humans do not yet know its profound worth.</p>
<p>The seed of humility is exceptionally fertile. It may not germinate plants of power and force, but it does yield flowers of Sweetness, Grace, Modesty and Light.</p>
<p>Love for the Divine is in its essence a spontaneous spiritual humility.</p>
<p>Humility has no need to sit on the King's throne. But the King cannot help bringing the throne to humility. And now who is the King? God's Compassion.</p>
<p>A prayer, in its simplest and most effective definition, is humility, climbing the sky of an all-fulfilling Delight.</p>
<p>Only the true sense of humility can raise us from our knees as high as we aspire.</p>
<p>Humility is as rare as a man without self-pity.</p>
<p>We must realise that there is only one way of acquiring infinite future possibilities. That way lies in the great power: Humility.</p>  </div>
