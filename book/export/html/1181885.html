<p>You say your present-day problems<br /> Are killing you.<br /> But do you not remember<br /> That once upon a time<br /> Peace, Light and Bliss<br /> Were absolute realities for you?<br /> Those were not your fantasy-days!<br /> They were as real as today.<br /> If you want to have them back,<br /> Nothing on earth can prevent you.</p>
