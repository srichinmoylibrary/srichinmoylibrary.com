<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible. Your inner being can easily identify itself with one of my inner beings. Since my inner beings know what I am doing — the way I smile, and so on — your inner being can easily see it or learn of it from my inner beings. It is quite possible. It is not your mental hallucination.</p>  </div>
