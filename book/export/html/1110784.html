<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know what Yoga means. Yoga is a Sanskrit word that means union with God. If we want to realise God, aspiration, self-discipline, self-control, prayer, concentration, meditation and contemplation are all of paramount importance. Yoga comprises all of these divine qualities. Again, aspiration is nobody's monopoly; it is not limited or confined to anybody. Everybody can aspire if he wants to.</p>  </div>
