<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual aspirant can attain and maintain silence only by diving deep within. He has to feel that every moment is a golden opportunity to transcend himself. He has to feel God as his very own. If he can do this, then without fail he will get silence and he will be able to maintain silence.</p>  </div>
