<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are working very hard at your business, but you are thinking that that is the only work you have to do. You are giving one hundred per cent of your attention to your business and not even one per cent to your body. You have to feel that the body is also something necessary. So when you are here taking exercise or practising sports, you have to think that this is the only thing in your life. Otherwise, while you are practising sports you will still be thinking of your business. Each time you practise sports, feel that this is the most important thing, more important even than selfless service or meditation. If you give importance to this, you will get extra energy from it for your work.</p>  </div>
