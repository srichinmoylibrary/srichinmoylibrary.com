<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not so easily. Sometimes yes and sometimes no. People come to us and say that they are victims. They themselves practise black magic, but they donâ€™t have enough strength to fight the wrong forces. One woman used to come and cry that her husband had asked a witch to create an undivine force around her. Then later she admitted that she herself used to practise witchcraft.</p>  </div>
