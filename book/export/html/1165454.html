<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, no! I will feel younger only when I can start running again. Although I do some stretching exercises along with weightlifting, I don't feel younger in any way. But when God blesses me again with running capacity, at that time I will feel a little younger.</p>  </div>
