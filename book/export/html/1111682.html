<p>This morning I covered fourteen miles. After I had run eleven miles, I was running slowly while crossing the street at a green light. A very old, fat cab driver wanted to go against the red light. He said, "Mister, can you run a bit faster?" I showed him that I had the green light. He said again, "What, you can't run faster?"</p>
<p>He was so fat and old! I don't think he could have run eleven miles.</p>
