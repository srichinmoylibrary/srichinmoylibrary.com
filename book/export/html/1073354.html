<h2>Question: How is it possible for one human being to really love another human being?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite easy for one human being to love another human being if he sees the Divine in the other person. It is always advisable to go to the root, which is God. If we want to love someone, the best thing is for us to love the One who is all Love. If we know how to love Him in Himself then it becomes extremely easy for us to love Him in a human being.</p>
<p>Let us take the human being as the mind-room and God as the heart-room. The heart-room has love, real love, whereas the mind-room has very limited love and light right now. The mind-room is human love and the heart-room is divine love, let us say. If we enter into the mind-room, which is dark, and from there go to the illumined room, then the dark room will always remain as it was. But if we go from the heart-room, which is flooded with light, into the mind-room, then the mind-room can be illumined by the light from the heart-room. We have to go first into the room that has light and then bring that light into the room which is not illumined.</p>
<p>If first we love God, who is the heart-room, then it is possible for us to really love and illumine human beings. If we go to God first and get Love from Him, with that Love we will easily be able to love a human being. Ordinary human love will eventually lead to frustration, whereas divine love will lead to satisfaction and illumination.</p>  </div>
