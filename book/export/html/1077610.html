<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This bird is your soul and the music is coming from your soul. When you are asleep your consciousness has a free access to your soul. But when you wake up you come back to your ordinary life and cannot retain this free access because your physical consciousness is not in touch with your soul. But if you have a very powerful meditation before you go to bed, then you <em>will</em> be able to retain the soulâ€™s consciousness the following morning. During your meditation try to feel that you are not the body but the soul and, at the same time, that you exist for the soul. Then you will easily be able to remember the music that you hear.</p>  </div>
