  <h1 class="book-heading">Divine Grace</h1>
  
 
<p>God is Omniscient, Omnipotent and Omnipresent. He has various kinds of power, but His greatest adamantine Power is His Grace. The moment God uses His Grace for an individual, He offers His very Life-Breath to the seeker, for God and God’s Grace can never be separated. Whenever we think of God, if we feel that it is through His Grace that we are approaching Him, then we can be most successful in receiving Him.</p>
<p>The Divine Grace is constantly descending upon us. Those who are sincerely aspiring are conscious of this Divine Grace, but those who are not aspiring are keeping their heart’s door permanently closed. If we feel that God is Grace, then we shall see that His infinite qualities, Peace, Light and Bliss, are already in the process of entering into us, ceaselessly flowing in and through us and becoming part and parcel of our inner and outer life. We have only to allow the flow of Grace to carry us into the Source, which is God.</p>  </div>
