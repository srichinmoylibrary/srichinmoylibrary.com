  <h1 class="book-heading">Spirituality</h1>
  
 
<p>A man with no spirituality is a pitiful victim of circumstances. A man with spirituality is God's Smile of victory.</p>
<p>A true seeker is not ridden by anxiety. His future abides in the present. His moments are wedded to constant opportunity. His dictionary does not house the word "postponement." His opportunity transforms itself into reality. His reality transforms itself into practicability.</p>
<p>As a plant cannot live without the sun and air, even so a seeker cannot live without spirituality. Spirituality is his inner urge to achieve absolute Peace, Light and Bliss. Each seeker has a particular temperament of his own, hence his way of spiritual discipline must have its own uniqueness. Confusion and conflict run riot when I invite others to enter into my path or when I myself enter into others' paths.</p>
<p>There are people who cherish the idea that spirituality is no longer alive. A genuine seeker cannot see eye to eye with them. Spirituality has not died, and it can never die, for God has made spirituality as the sole necessity of humanity to enter into His Eternity, Infinity and Immortality. And the same spirituality is also God's necessity to enter into humanity, its stark bondage and wild ignorance.</p>  </div>
