<p>Today, while I was doing twenty repetitions with 145 pounds, I tried something new. Instead of holding onto the side of the apparatus, I released my free arm. You can see that it is hanging by my side. This will be more dramatic because I am not holding onto anything. It is much more difficult. Tonight I will try to do it 100 times. Why did it not occur to us in those early days to release that free arm? This style is much more impressive because I am not taking any support. Also in those days I used to waste time changing the arm after each lift.</p>
