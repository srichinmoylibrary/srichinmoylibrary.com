<p>The servant said to the master: “Sir, I am leaving. I am leaving my job.”</p>
<p>The master said: “Why are you leaving your job? Why are you quitting?”</p>
<p>“You order me about all the time as though I were your wife. I can’t bear it. What have I to do with your wife? I am not going to be your wife.”</p>
<p>The servant leaves.</p>  </div>
