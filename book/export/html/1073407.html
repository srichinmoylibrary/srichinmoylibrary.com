<h2>Question: I have read your aphorism that says. “When the power of love replaces the love of power, man will have a new name: God.” Could you please elaborate on this?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The love of vital power is destroying the entire world, but the divine love, which is power itself, can only transform us — transform the human in us into the divine. The love of power is the love of supremacy. If I can have a little more power than you, then I will try to lord it over you. An individual or a nation feels that by exercising power it is possible to conquer the heart of humanity. But this is impossible! We are crying to see the Face of God, not because He is all Power, but because He is all Love. It is only the power of love that can really conquer the heart and change the face of humanity.</p>
<p>This is not only my discovery; it is the discovery of all sincere seekers. If we feel that the world is full of hate, we will constantly have a bitter feeling toward life. Then immediately we will try to conquer the world with our vital power, the power that wants to dominate. But when we pray and meditate early in the morning, if we cherish good thoughts, divine thoughts, loving thoughts that come from the depths of our heart, immediately we feel that the world is our friend. We feel that there is no enemy for us or that there are very few enemies. At that time we are experiencing the positive power, the power of oneness, which comes from love.</p>
<p>When I say that ‘God’ will be man’s new name, God means universality. He is one and He is many. He was one, but He wanted to express Himself or enjoy Himself through multiplicity. In this sense, God means universality. Here individuality disappears and universality appears. When we use the power of love, the human individuality immediately disappears and is replaced by the divine universality.</p>  </div>
