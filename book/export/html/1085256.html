<p>After he crossed the barrier of fifty, Bankim Chandra Chatterji did not remain well. He wanted to write quite a few books but, alas, his health was failing rapidly. The members of his family became alarmed that he was not taking the medicine that his doctor had prescribed for him.</p>
<p>One day, the doctor came to him and said, “What can I do? You don’t take the medicine I give you. Do you not want to live? So many people will cry and miss you if you die. You are such a great man, the hero-leader of Bengal. Now, if you don’t take medicine, how will they fare? How will they live on earth? You are the father of the nation, and if you leave, many will feel fatherless. Granted, you have a frail constitution, but in that frail constitution India has seen a reservoir of stupendous possibility materialised.”</p>
<p>Bankim Chandra said, “Who said I don’t take medicine?”</p>
<p>“Where is your medicine? Please show me,” said the doctor.</p>
<p>Bankim Chandra picked up a copy of the <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em> from the table and showed it to the doctor. “This is my medicine, this is my only medicine. Your medicine may cure my body, but this will cure my body, vital, mind, heart and soul. This medicine has the message of Immortality. This medicine will make me immortal and there is no other medicine that can do that. So I must take only this medicine.”</p>
<p>The doctor remained silent.</p>
