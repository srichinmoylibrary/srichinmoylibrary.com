<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In your case, you have impurity in your entire being, in your entire life. But if you can overcome fear, doubt and jealousy, then you wonâ€™t have to go to purity; purity will come and touch your feet. You may see that others are pulling the light and that the light is pulling others, so you may become jealous of their achievements. But if you want the light to fulfil you, then you must overcome your jealousy, doubt and fear. My constant blessing is there. However, if you cherish these undivine forces unconsciously, not to speak of consciously, then realisation will remain a far cry. If you really want to realise the highest Absolute, you have to know that you and everybody else are part and parcel of the same Truth. So how can you be jealous of anybody? God is omnipotent and He is in you, with you and for you. So how can you be afraid of anybody? And God is omnipresent; He is all-pervading, within you and around you. So how can you cherish doubt, even unconsciously?</p>  </div>
