<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, I think in India you were an <em>assiduous</em> reader, but here in America you are anything but that.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, you are absolutely right. In India I was a <em>constant and persistent</em> book-reader. Needless to say, my kindhearted God made me that. Now the same kindhearted God has made me, here in the West, a constant and persistent mind-reader. The book-reader in me has made total and unconditional surrender to the mind-reader in me.</p>  </div>
