<p>The other day we were riding in Databir's car after I had checked out a running route. I had five or six candies next to me that I was planning to give to the four or five people in the car. But Databir started falling asleep, so he ate all the candy to keep awake. Then, when I started looking for the candy to give to everyone, he said, "Oh, Guru, I finished it!" So the others didn't get any.</p>
