<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us take God as the vast ocean. You know that the ocean is composed of tiny drops. Millions and billions and trillions of drops make up the ocean. If we know how to identify ourselves both with the vast ocean and with the tiniest drop, then we can see God inside the finite and also in the infinite. It is on the strength of our oneness with the tiniest drop in the ocean that we can see and feel God. If we can establish our oneness with the finite, then we can see what the infinite looks like.</p>
<p>If we want to see God in His vast creation, as the creation itself, we can do it. But in the beginning it may be easier to separate Him from His creation and identify ourselves with only a small portion of the entire creation. Even in the small part of God's creation which is right now visible to us, we see infinite variety. What will we do with God's entire creation at this time? Our mind will not be able to grasp it at all. To our limited human minds even the finite earth-reality is infinite. If we can begin to understand this tiny corner of God's vast creation, we can say that we have made considerable inner progress.</p>  </div>
