<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Look at a bird; look at the vast, blue sky; look at a green field or look at the beautiful moon. You can have more inspiration by looking at these things. You can look at the rising sun or anything else that gives you immediate joy. Always find something that inspires you. With your eyes you will look at it, and then you can increase your inspiration. Anything that is beautiful, look at that very thing for inspiration.</p>  </div>
