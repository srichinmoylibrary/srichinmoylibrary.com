<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to face the world's problems with divine courage. If you are scared to death when a problem arises, then you cannot be a chosen instrument of the Supreme. Life, according to my philosophy, has to be accepted. This acceptance does not mean enjoyment. Acceptance has a particular spiritual significance. Our meditation is not a meditation that denies the reality of the world. The world is the fertile field for God-manifestation. Reality is not yet manifested fully on earth, but it is our meditation, our inner life, our aspiration, that can hasten the process of divine manifestation on earth. You should always try to have the attitude of a divine hero, who is ready to fight for the divine manifestation here on earth, who will act only for the sake of the Supreme. This world embodies divinity. What we have to do is not only to realise the ultimate Truth in this world of ours, but also to reveal and manifest that ultimate Truth with our dynamic meditation and conscious aspiration.</p>  </div>
