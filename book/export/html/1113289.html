<p>X came and fell at Nolini-da's feet crying and sobbing like a little child. His pride had been smashed mercilessly by the Mother. He said to Nolini-da: "Now that the Mother will not see me anymore or give me any special attention, I have come to you for your forgiveness."</p>
<p>Nolini-da was surprised and said: "Only the Mother can forgive you; nobody else on earth can. Why have you become the embodiment of falsehood?"</p>
<p>He said: "I do not know. But I am praying to the Mother to give me an iota of sincerity. As you know, my life and sincerity are two perfect strangers; therefore I am an object of ridicule."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said to him: "The Mother has definitely forgiven you. But try to make Her happy by being constantly sincere to Her and to yourself. When you try to deceive Her, which you can never do, you deliberately go millions of miles away from Her Compassion. Afterwards, it is you who suffer, and it is you who make the Mother suffer for your unthinkable insincerity. I tell you, as you have made yourself the embodiment of falsehood, the Mother will be able to make you the embodiment of truth, if you only give Her a chance."</p>  </div>
