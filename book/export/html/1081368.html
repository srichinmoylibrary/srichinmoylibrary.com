<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The lesser beauty will always try to bind and limit us. The higher beauty will always try to illumine and liberate us. The moment the higher beauty dawns in us, we will feel others as our very own and we will try to liberate them. And while having that kind of feeling, we will see that we are already received and claimed by others as their very own. When the higher beauty dawns in us, we see that what we do for others, they have already done for us. When we have the higher beauty, it means that the finite in us has gone and we are trying to make the infinite our own. The moment we try to bring down the infinite as our own, to our wide surprise we will feel that it has already claimed us as its very own.</p>  </div>
