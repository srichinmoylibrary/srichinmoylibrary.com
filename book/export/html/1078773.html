  <h1 class="book-heading">Yoga and oneness</h1>
  
 
<p>Yoga is conscious oneness.</p>
<p>Yoga is my conscious oneness with what I have and what I am. What I have is God-realisation. What I am is God-Delight.</p>
<p>Yoga is conscious oneness with God's eternal Duty. Yoga is conscious oneness with God's infinite Beauty.</p>
<p>Yoga is conscious oneness with earth's insufficiency-cry. Yoga is conscious oneness with Heaven's sufficiency-smile.</p>
<p>Yoga is conscious oneness with man's surrender-perfection. Yoga is conscious oneness with God's Acceptance-Satisfaction.</p>
<p>Yoga is conscious oneness with God's Vision-Boat. Yoga is conscious oneness with God's Reality-Shore.</p>
