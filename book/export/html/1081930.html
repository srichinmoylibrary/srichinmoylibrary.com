<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Either God sanctions and approves it, or God tolerates it. We don't know the past, we don't know what good or bad deeds the infant committed in his previous life, so we can't say why the infant has died. But either God's tolerance or God's sanction has to be there. And only God's Will knows whether it was an act of sanction and approval, or an act of tolerance.</p>  </div>
