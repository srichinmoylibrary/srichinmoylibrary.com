<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to feel your soul’s inseparable oneness with me is to feel that you are a rose and I am touching you petal by petal with my heart’s infinite concern, compassion, tenderness, sweetness and fondness. Every day your heart is blossoming like a rose-soul in your heart-garden, and I am playing the role of the God-sent divine gardener for you.</p>  </div>
