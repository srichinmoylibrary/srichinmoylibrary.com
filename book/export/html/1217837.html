    <title>Question: If the body is the newcomer and the soul is the real landlord, or lord, then how is it that the newcomer or personality, with its seeking satisfaction, can so suffocate the soul that its inspirations cannot be heard?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Katha Upanishad says that the body is the chariot, the soul is the master of the chariot, the Intellect is the charioteer and the mind the reins.</p>
<p>I am happy to answer this particular question. You are the landlady of the building in which we have our Centre. You own this building. We are your tenants. We are all newcomers. You try your best to satisfy our requirements. Nevertheless, some of the tenants, not all, make your life a hell. Their demands are at times outrageous and absurd. Further, they cherish an uncompromising attitude. What do you do then? I believe you become quite helpless, if not hopeless. In spite of the fact that it is you who own this building. It is not easy to drive away the disturbing, demanding, uncompromising tenants at once. Similar is the fate of the soul which is attacked by the pleasure-seeking, demanding and unaspiring newcomer, the personality.</p>  </div>
