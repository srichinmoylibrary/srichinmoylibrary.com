<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Anger comes from frustration. Sometimes you feel that these people are unjust. The airport authorities can perhaps be very undivine. But you have to know that if they say you are doing something wrong, then you must not try at all to justify what you are doing. You have to be very, very humble. Let them scold you and insult you. If you remain silent, afterwards compassion will loom large in them. But if you feel that they are wrong and you are right, then showing your volcanic anger will not accomplish anything. You will only weaken your nerves, specially the inner nerves that draw in peace, light and bliss from Above. If somebody does something wrong and if you become furious, then you are exercising your stupidity.</p>
<p>Do not be stupid; be wise! One day the other person will meet with retribution. His punishment will come in the form of justice-light. But in your case, you are getting your punishment here and now. So, you have to be careful. If you suffer from anger, uncontrollable anger, you have to pray to the Supreme to bring down immediately peace, which is infinitely stronger than your anger.</p>  </div>
