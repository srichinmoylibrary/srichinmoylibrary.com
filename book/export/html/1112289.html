    <title>&lt;em&gt;Mike Spino:&lt;/em&gt; I have experimented with moving visualisations in an attempt to transfer &#039;sitting awareness&#039; to running consciousness. What suggestions can you make for this transfer, and is sitting a necessary prerequisite for the development of elated running consciousness?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Always think that you are standing in front of the sea. The surface of the sea is very dynamic; it is all waves and surges. But the bottom of the sea is all calmness and peace. You can identify yourself with the surface of the sea and also with its depths. Similarly, you can identify with both the outer world and the inner world. While looking at the outer life, you see dynamism and speed. But even while you are looking at the outer life you can dive into the inner life, where it is all peace and inner poise. If you dive within and become inseparably one with inner peace, then easily you can bring inner peace to the fore so that it inundates your outer life.</p>
<p>'Sitting awareness' is stillness, calmness, quietness, while the running consciousness is all dynamism. Again, the runner's outer speed has a special kind of poise or stillness at its very heart. A plane travels very fast, yet inside the plane we feel no movement at all. It is all tranquillity, all peace, and this inner tranquillity we can bring to our outer life. The outer life, the outer movement, can be successful only when it comes from inner poise. If there is no poise, then there can be no successful outer movement. Poise is an unseen power, and this unseen power is always ready to come to the aid of the outer runner.</p>  </div>
