<h2>Question: If we are constantly going through different moods, how can we conquer depression?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In your case, it is not all depression. You may be thirty percent depressed, thirty percent angry and also have fear, doubt, jealousy and other things. But the strength of the soul's will is far greater than the strength of these undivine forces. If you can bring forward even one percent of your soul's willpower, with that you will be able to conquer your depression. Although you suffer for half an hour with depression, with the power of the soul's will, you can easily nullify your depression. If you can bring your willpower forward, your depression will be over in one second.</p>  </div>
