<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Religion as such cannot overcome this narrow outlook. Only when religion takes help from spirituality, its elder brother, does it become possible for it to expand its vision. Religion lets the seeker see God, but spirituality shows the seeker how to become God. Religion can go as far as believing in the light or even seeing the light. But spirituality goes much higher and deeper. It helps the seeker or the votary of religion consciously grow into the light itself and become one with God-Consciousness and God-Light. So if religion takes help from spirituality, then it is quite possible to overcome all narrow outlooks found in religion.</p>  </div>
