<p>When I went out running I saw a short, thin, old man with a hat and cane sitting on the edge of a wall, waiting for the bus. I didn't pay any attention to him, but when I came back from my seven-mile run, the same old man was still waiting there. He said to me, "How I wish I could get back my youth."</p>
<p>I said, "I too miss my youth."</p>
<p>"How old are you?" asked the man.</p>
<p>"Forty-eight," I answered.</p>
<p>"I am seventy-three," said the man.</p>
<p>I stayed there with him for two or three minutes and then I finished my run.</p>
