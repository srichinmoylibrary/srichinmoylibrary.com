<p>Sri Ramachandra was walking past the palace of the ancient sage and philosopher, Gautama, when he heard a cry from the earth beneath his feet. Looking down he saw the frail frame of a woman in the dust. As he helped her up her body became alive and she cried, burying her tears in his feet. "O Rama!"</p>
<p>Rama said, "What have I done? Please tell me what I can do for you. Forgive me!"</p>
<p>The woman said, "I am Ahalya. I was the wife of Gautama, the sage. My body has lain here for hundreds of years because of the curse Gautama put on me. I was unfaithful to him when Indra tempted me. I was left here to feast on the wind, and all my beauty was taken from me."</p>
<p>Rama said, "What can I do for you?"</p>
<p>"You have already done it, my Lord. You have touched me. Now I am pure. Now I am pure. You have saved my life. Now please tell me what I can do for you?"</p>
<p>Rama said, "What you will do for me? You are free from your sin. That is what gives me most joy. So from now on, remain in your beauty. Never be unfaithful. Lead a life of purity, as you lived before you were married. Please go back and regain your purity, regain your spirituality, regain everything that you had.</p>
<p>"Physical beauty should be an expression of inner beauty. Physical beauty must not attract others. On the contrary, physical beauty should only inspire others to become friends with their own inner beauty, which is all light. Physical beauty must not be a hindrance. Physical beauty must not lord itself over others. Physical beauty should be an added thing to the inner beauty. It should be a true expression of the inner beauty, which reflects the Divinity and Immortality within us. Inner beauty and outer beauty must go together, fulfilling each other. Inner beauty is self-giving. Outer beauty is Light-spreading."</p>
<p>Ahalya fell down at Rama's feet and offered her heart of gratitude to him. Rama blessed her and said, "I accept your gratitude-heart. Take my blessingful joy and pride."</p>
