<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, no, no. It is like passing through a garden on your way to a temple. When you see the flowers in the garden, they can inspire you. When you are inspired, you may be able to run very fast towards your destination. But if the destination is still far away, you may say, "Let me stay here indefinitely and enjoy the beauty and fragrance of these flowers."</p>
<p>Similarly, if angels come to you on your way to the destination, like the flowers, they may inspire you to go faster. Again, they may charm you to such an extent that you may say, "They are so beautiful. Let me stop here for some time and chat with them." Some runners can easily run faster, but they enjoy chatting with the slower runners.</p>
<p>The beauty and fragrance of a garden can inspire you to go faster. Again, they can charm you to such an extent that you say, "All right, the destination is there. I will reach it sooner or later. In the meantime, the best thing is to enjoy this garden. Who knows, when I reach the temple, perhaps I will not see such beautiful flowers there."</p>  </div>
