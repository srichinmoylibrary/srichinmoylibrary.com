  <h1 class="book-heading">4739 Aspiration And Dedication</h1>
  
 

<p>Aspiration has a beautiful heart<br /> And aspiration is a climbing tree.</p>
<p>Dedication has a fruitful life<br /> And dedication is a flowing river.</p>
<p>The goal of the climbing tree<br /> Is to reach the highest height<br /> And become one with Eternity's Beauty.</p>
<p>The goal of the running river<br /> Is to enter into the vast sea<br /> And become one with Infinity's Reality.</p>
