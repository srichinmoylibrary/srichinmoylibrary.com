<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The real reason is weakness. You have to know where the anger comes from, whether from the vital or from the mind or from the gross physical. If it is real anger, uncontrollable anger, then you have to know that at that time ignorance has attacked you most powerfully. Now, how can ignorance attack you this way? It can attack you most powerfully only when you have not fed your soul in the morning and during the day. You have not done the first thing first. If you had meditated well, then anger may have assailed you, but its attack would not have been so powerful. So try to have peace of mind on the strength of your prayer and meditation. If you pray and meditate, anger can be conquered.</p>
<p>We use time either for a negative purpose or for a positive purpose, either to express our anger or to reveal our love for others. Time itself is always the same. We are bound to use it for a negative purpose if we do not pray or meditate. Now you may say, "There are many people who do not pray, who do not meditate, but they don't get angry like the so-called spiritual people." But I wish to say that our way of observing others on the outer plane is very superficial. If a spiritual person gets angry, then his meditation is not real meditation. He may sit with eyes closed or look at a picture, but God knows how his mind is roaming, in which wild forest or barren desert. This is not meditation. But if they work devotedly and selflessly every day, this is a form of real meditation. From their disinterested work and selfless service they are acquiring the power of meditation. And if they get the power of meditation, then naturally they will not be victims of wild anger.</p>  </div>
