<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to have dreams from the higher worlds and not from the lower worlds, then before you go to sleep meditate for at least five minutes on your navel centre and the centres below the navel. This you will do in order to lock the doors to these centres. Then meditate for another five minutes on your heart centre and on the centres above the heart. This you will do in order to unlock the doors to these centres. While locking the navel centre and the lower centres, try to feel the dynamic and volcanic energy of the hero-warrior. While unlocking the heart centre and the higher centres, try to feel the cheerfulness and delight of a child. If you can do this, without fail you are bound to have dreams from the higher worlds.</p>  </div>
