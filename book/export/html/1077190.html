<p>The scientist-seeker knew that imagination is a reality. This reality is a world of its own. Slowly and steadily this reality enters into the human life to inspire the world with a new creation. Imagination is indeed the harbinger of a new creation. In Einstein’s words, <em>“Man’s conquest over his own ignorance must rest on intuition. It is imagination that makes man able to talk to the stars.”</em></p>
<p>We marvel at the transformation as the scientist-sage became the seeker-seer and offered the esoteric and Supreme truth in a visible and tangible manner. <em>“I claim credit for nothing. Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for the insect as well as for the star. Human beings, vegetables or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible player.”</em></p>  </div>
