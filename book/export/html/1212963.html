<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, I have heard that many young people in America speak of the established order with great <em>contumely</em>. Is it true?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, I do not really know. But even if they speak of everyone and everything with <em>contempt and scorn</em>, and even if they have other undivine qualities, Godâ€™s boundless Compassion will forgive them and lead them to the right path eventually.</p>  </div>
