<p>This morning I was seeing real tears in Sona’s eyes. I was on the couch, and Sona was standing on his hind legs with his front feet up in the air. Absolutely there were tears in Sona’s left eye because Sona wanted to be with me on the couch. But I had to go to the United Nations.</p>
<p>When I came back, I stood in front of Kanu and Sona for at least five minutes. Both of them were showing off — showing how high they could jump. So with both hands I had to bless both of them.</p>
