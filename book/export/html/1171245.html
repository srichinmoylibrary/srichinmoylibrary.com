SCA 768-777. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 30 January 1999 during his brief visit to Nepal to attend a ceremony dedicating Nepal as a Sri Chinmoy Peace-Blossom-Nation.</p>
<h2>Seeker: Thank you for coming to Nepal to bless us.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one Person to bless us — you, me and everybody — and that Person is God. I use the term 'Supreme'. God and the Supreme are the same Person, but when I use the term 'Supreme', I get much more joy. When a little child calls his father 'Daddy', he gets more joy than when he says 'Father'. Similarly, in my case, I prefer to use the term 'Supreme' and all my students also use the term, but it is the same Person: God.</p>  </div>
