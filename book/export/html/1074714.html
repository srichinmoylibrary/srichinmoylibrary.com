<p>        He died<br /> In his life-car<br />   When his mind was in high,<br />   His body in neutral.        He died<br /> In his life-car<br />   When his vision-race was in high,<br />   His reality-face in neutral.        He died<br /> In his life-car<br />   When his elephant-confidence was in high,<br />   His rabbit-capacity in neutral.</p>
