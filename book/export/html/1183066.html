<p>“My nose cancer could have been cured if the person who I thought was the modern Christ had actually been a real Master. It was my mistake to consider anybody as Master except the Christ. He who does not have the miracle-power can never be a true spiritual Master. So let me go and only cry for the Christ, who was all miracle-power plus the eternal life-saving miracle.” This is what she felt, so she left the path.</p>  </div>
