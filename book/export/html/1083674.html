<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has never picked black raspberries because God Himself is a raspberry. God wants His children, especially you, who have a great fondness for raspberries, to pick and enjoy. He is like a mother. The mother not only has the food; the mother becomes the food for her children. The mother not only has the compassion-food, the compassion-concern food, but the mother is compassion-food and concern-food for her children to eat to their heart's content.</p>  </div>
