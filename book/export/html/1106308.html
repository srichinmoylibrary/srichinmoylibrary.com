<p>I cannot imagine why, but I have never measured my calf muscles. Yesterday I was measuring them. Now I see that the upper part of my calf is smaller than my arms! Alas, only Americans have very good, pronounced calf muscles. Indians, it seems, do not have. Or else my calves are smaller than those of other Indians.</p>
