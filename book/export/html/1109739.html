<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The world is God's creation. If we do not fulfil our worldly responsibilities, then how are we going to please God? There are some responsibilities which we must fulfil, starting almost from the moment we see the light of day. If we neglect these responsibilities, then they will only delay us and make us swerve from the path of Truth. Again, we have to know that it is through our attachment to the world that we will increase the number of our worldly responsibilities like anything.</p>
<p>God's creation flows from the Transcendental Consciousness; it is the direct expression of God. If we do not feel concern for the creation, then how can God be pleased with us? We have to fulfil our earthly responsibilities. But we shall fulfil only the responsibilities that our Inner Pilot has allotted to us. We shall not take on any additional responsibilities at our sweet will. In fulfilling our God-given responsibilities, we shall act in accordance with our spiritual needs.</p>  </div>
