<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If God is not pleased with you, then He may fulfil all your desires so that you can dig your own grave sooner than the soonest. It has happened countless times. When God sees that your case is hopeless, He will fulfil you materially and spiritually give you a larger than the largest zero.</p>
<p>God is like a farmer. He is digging, digging. In one place, He has dug a number of times, but He has not achieved any result. So He goes and ploughs somewhere else. There He is fully satisfied. God gives one person the chance, but that person does not use it properly. He is satisfied to remain in the same situation. How long can God wait for that person? So God says, “Fine. You be happy where you are. I shall plough somewhere else.”</p>  </div>
