<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If it is a good thought, keep it; if it is a bad thought, discard it. If you have a good thought, feel that you are an express train racing on and on, or a bird flying up. If you have a divine idea, just run with it to your destination. But if wrong, false, undivine thoughts come, do not stay with them. Please discard them immediately.</p>  </div>
