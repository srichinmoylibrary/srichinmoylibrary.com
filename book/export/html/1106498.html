<p>Today Subarata’s soul came to watch my weightlifting. Her soul left the body at 6:33 p.m. on Wednesday, March 15th, while I was in the plane on my way home from Bulgaria. That is when her soul came to me to say its final farewell. Her physical body passed away at 1:00 p.m. the following day.</p>
<p>Since she left the body, she has been all the time with me, in my house, watching me play my musical instruments. Today, as I was about to lift, her soul came to the doorway and said, “May I come in?”</p>
<p>I told her, “Now you are in the soul’s world. You can go anywhere you want to.”</p>
<p>She was so happy and excited. Usually I say that someone is like a seven-year-old child. But, in her case, she was like a five-year-old child.</p>
<p>She said to me, “I am so happy to be alone with you, Guru. I have never been alone with you before.”</p>
