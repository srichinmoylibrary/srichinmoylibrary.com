<p>Ambition, my friend unparalleled,<br /> You are helping my body<br /> To come out of lethargy-night.</p>
<p>Ambition, my friend unparalleled,<br /> You are helping my vital<br /> To smash asunder<br /> The heavy and binding shackles<br /> Of frustration-slavery.</p>
<p>Ambition, my friend unparalleled,<br /> You are helping my mind<br /> To free its luminous vision<br /> From the prison of teeming doubts.</p>
<p>Ambition, my friend unparalleled,<br /> You are helping my heart<br /> To free its marvellous peace<br /> From the cave of torturing insecurity</p>
<p>Ambition, my friend unparalleled,<br /> You are helping my soul<br /> To dream in and through me<br /> Clearly, swiftly, powerfully<br /> And triumphantly.</p>
<p>Ambition, my friend unparalleled,<br /> You are serving my Beloved Supreme<br /> To make me a perfect instrument of His,<br /> Cheerfully, sleeplessly<br /> And unreservedly.</p>
<p>Ambition, my friend unparalleled,<br /> When I use you divinely,<br /> I create not only a satisfaction-world<br /> Within me,<br /> But also a promise-world outside me;<br /> I create a new dawn for myself<br /> And a challenging and fulfilling reality<br /> For the whole world.</p>
<p>Ambition, my friend unparalleled,<br /> When I use you undivinely,<br /> I destroy my inner world<br /> That wants to grow and glow,<br /> And I also destroy my outer world<br /> That wants to ascend and transcend.</p>
<p>Ambition, my friend unparalleled,<br /> I shall always use you in a divine way<br /> So that at every moment<br /> You can be proud of<br /> My sincerity,<br /> My dedication<br />     And<br /> My transformation.</p>
