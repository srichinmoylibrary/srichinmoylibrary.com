<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is only the Avatars who donâ€™t take so many incarnations. But there are some exceptions, even among spiritual Masters. Look at the Buddha. He went through so many incarnations in the animal life and the human life. But other spiritual Masters did not go through so many; they did not want to enjoy this world so many times.</p>  </div>
