    <title>Question: In the song &lt;em&gt;Bhulite diyona&lt;/em&gt; there are four aspects of the Supreme mentioned: His Feet, His Eyes, His Message and His Dream. What should we imagine or visualise while we are singing each of those words, and what do we receive from them?</title>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: In the song &lt;em&gt;Bhulite diyona&lt;/em&gt; there are four aspects of the Supreme mentioned: His Feet, His Eyes, His Message and His Dream.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that time you have to imagine the personal aspect of the Supreme. The Supreme is both personal and impersonal. Try to imagine a beautiful golden Being right in front of you. When we see Mother Kali's picture, she seems very dark. But Mother Kali in Her highest reality is golden. Our Supreme also we have to take as the most beautiful golden Being.</p>
<p>Exercise your imagination-power. If you use your imagination-power, you will be able to visualise His Feet, His Eyes, His Message and His Dream — the Dream that He has in you, in each individual — His own Dream that He wants to manifest in and through you. For each individual he has sown a new Dream. You have to pray to Him to manifest His Dream in you. When you sing the second part, with utmost humility you have to feel that your body, vital, mind, heart and soul have made their prostration. Imagine that your soul is bowing to the Supreme, followed by your heart, mind, vital and physical. Everything that you have and everything that you are is absolutely at the Feet of the Supreme.</p>
<p>I use the term bowing, but bowing is not the right word. Bowing can be just a nod of the head. You have to feel that you are bowing in the traditional Indian way of lying down prostrate in front of a statue in the temple. This does not mean to make a display, far from it! If you lie down at the feet of a statue while you are only thinking of tomorrow's breakfast, that will not do any good. You have to absolutely make yourself feel that you are as humble as a speck of dust or a grain of sand. When Swami Vivekananda's humility came to the fore, he used to say that Sri Ramakrishna could make thousands and millions of Vivekanandas just from specks of dust and grains of sand. That is sincere humility. That is the kind of bowing down that you need to imagine in this song — where you become the embodiment of purest humility. You have to feel that you are nothing but a speck of dust, and you are placing this worthless thing at the Feet of the Supreme.</p>  </div>
