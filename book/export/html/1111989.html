<p>At the 70-mile race, George Vallasi shook hands with me. He is so nice to us.</p>
<p>Then he said to me, "I will be right back," and he started running with his friend, whom he was helping. I thought that he meant he would run 100 or 200 metres, but he went on and on.</p>
<p>During the race I saw Nathan. I said, "Run! Run!" He didn't hear me. He just kept running.</p>
