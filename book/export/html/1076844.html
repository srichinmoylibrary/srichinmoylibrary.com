<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Maybe. I am not qualified to judge them. I do not hate them, I love them. But what I say is that I do not have the capacity to teach them. Other teachers can guide them but I cannot advance them by my method. They are looking for happiness, but it is a different kind of happiness from the one I can give them.</p>  </div>
