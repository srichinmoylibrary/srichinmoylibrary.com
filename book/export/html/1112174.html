<p>Yesterday I walked four miles. After I had covered two miles, I felt thirsty. I am supposed to drink every two miles; otherwise, I get cramps. In my pocket I was carrying a small water container. It says, "Press and then turn to open." So I pressed and turned once, then twice. Two or three times I tried to open it, but I could not do so. I was in a very high consciousness. After trying to open it three times, I threw it away.</p>
<p>Then I said, "O God, what am I going to do?"</p>
<p>When I go out walking, I usually take a small amount of money with me. Before I left the house, I had said, "Since I am carrying water, what is the use of bringing any money?" But I took a twenty dollar bill anyway.</p>
<p>I found a small store selling donuts and pretzels. I said, "This place should have something for me." I asked for a Snapple and gave the man my twenty dollar bill. He asked me, "Do you have anything smaller'"</p>
<p>I looked at him pitifully. Then he put his hand inside his pocket and brought out a bundle of one, five and ten dollar bills. So we exchanged smiles.</p>
