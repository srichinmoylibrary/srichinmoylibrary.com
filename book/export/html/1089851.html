<p>To make oneself every day an object of total dedication and surrender is the highest form of bliss. Bliss comes when 'I and mine' and 'thou and thine' leave us for good. Only when we can say that God is ours and we are God's can bliss come. Then, when we feel that God is manifesting in and through us, we get greater bliss. And finally, when we feel that we exist to please God and God alone, when we feel that we came into the world only to please God, then the greatest bliss dawns in our devoted and surrendered heart.</p>  </div>
