<p>Next Sri Ramakrishna asked Nag Mahashay whether he was married. Nag Mahashay replied, "Master, not once, but twice!"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna asked, "Why? Why?"</p>
<p>The disciple explained, "The first time, it was to a young girl of eleven, and then she died in a year or two. I was so happy and relieved. It was all against my will to be married. To please my father I did it. Then I was so happy that God took her. My father wanted me to marry a second time. Again, it was dead against my will. I fought and fought to be allowed to remain free from worldly bondage. Day and night we argued. I pleaded with my father. I said, 'I want to be spiritual. I want to give my life to God. Already you brought bondage into my life once. Now God, out of His boundless Compassion, has removed this bondage. Why must I suffer again?'</p>
<p>"But my father would not listen. He wanted grandchildren. He felt that if I did not continue his lineage, then Heaven's door would be closed to him; God would not be pleased with him. He said to me, 'Do you want to prove that I am a liar? I have already selected a bride for you and I have given her family my word that you will marry her. I have promised them.'</p>
<p>"When I did not respond, my father became very angry. He said, 'I am cursing you. You will never be successful in any sphere of life.' But I would not give in. I said to him, 'No harm, I am ready. I accept your curse. I am not going to get married again.'</p>
<p>"Then one day it happened that I came home from work and I found my father in his room weeping bitterly. I asked him the reason for his sorrow. He only said, 'You have to know why I am crying.'</p>
<p>"I knew that I could not prolong my father's misery any longer. I said to him, 'I do know why you are crying. I wish to tell you that I am giving up my religion; I am giving up my spirituality; I am giving up God to please you, since that is what will make you happy. It is up to God whether He forgives me or not. I cannot bear to see you weeping. You have shown me infinite affection since my very birth. How can I displease you? I will get married.'</p>
<p>"My father was extremely surprised and delighted and he made arrangements for my second marriage. My wife is now living in my native village. She is taking care of my father."</p>  </div>
