<p><em>(The Brahmin is on his way home the following day filled with utmost inner and outer joy. He sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Amar bhuban tomar charan lagi</em><br /><em>Amar jiban tomar swapan lagi</em></p>


<p>My world is for Your Feet.<br /> My life is for Your Dream.</p>

<p><em>(Suddenly, a heaviness attacks him.)</em></p>
<p>BRAHMIN: I am spiritual; that is why I am in a position to cry for divine things. But my wife does not care for spiritual things; she needs earthly things. Perhaps I made a mistake. I ought to have asked Krishna to give her something. She likes candy. I should have asked him to give me some candy for her. I feel sorry, but now it is too late. I don't want to go back to my friend, but I know she will be angry with me. What can I do?</p>  </div>
