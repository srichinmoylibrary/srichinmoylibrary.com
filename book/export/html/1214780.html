<p>There is a time when we see eye to eye with one another in solving the world problems. Again, there is a time when we totally disagree. There is a time when we have individual goals. Again, there is a time when we have a common goal.</p>
<p>U Thant speaks on behalf of the soul of the United Nations with regard to the common goal: <em>“Here in the United Nations we also have a basic aim in common, which is to preserve the peace and to enhance human happiness and dignity throughout the world in accordance with our Charter.”</em></p>
<p>At the United Nations, many nations with different opinions are working together. Although outwardly they seem to have divergent goals, they are running towards an inner goal which is nothing short of a common goal.</p>  </div>
