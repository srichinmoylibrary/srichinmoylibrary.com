<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the true spiritual life the Christian way and the Indian way are the same. All ways to God-realisation are basically the same. If we have a pure heart and cry to feel the presence of God, that is the way. When we establish a pure heart, everything comes to us. How do we make ourselves pure? Through prayer or meditation â€” either by invoking Peace, Light and Bliss from above or by entering into the world of purity, beauty and luminosity. A pure heart can constantly feel the presence of God. Just because we do not have a pure heart, we do not feel the presence of God all the time. Once we feel the presence of God constantly, all our problems will be solved.</p>  </div>
