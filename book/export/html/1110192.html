<p>Unconditional self-giving does exist on earth. Indeed, here is a radiant example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Because of His Excellency the President, Ranasinghe Premadasa, I was reborn the 11th of July, 1983, after surviving three massive heart attacks. Entirely at his own expense, he sent me to California for a multiple bypass operation, and paid all my medical expenses. He also sent my wife along with me and paid all her expenses so that I would not be alone at such a difficult and dangerous time. So I am very grateful to him. His Excellency Premadasa was both my father and mother. I will never forget this, and I hope and pray my children and even my children's children will never forget His Excellency Ranasinghe Premadasa."</p>
<p>Honourable Arthur J. Ranasinghe</p>
<p>Minister of State for Information</p>
