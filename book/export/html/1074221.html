<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the occult power goes, it is just like a bullet. But the spiritual power is like a large wave. I am telling you this only to give you a rough idea; it is not actually like that. Spiritual power is like a well-trained army. It will cover the enemy’s territory in all directions. But occult power won’t do that. Occult power will see where the person is and just go and strike. But if the person is not there, if by chance the person has moved away, then occult power won’t work; it is all gone. Occult power is like an arrow. If you can’t pierce the person, it is finished. But spiritual power goes this way, that way; it captures the enemy like a very well-trained army.</p>  </div>
