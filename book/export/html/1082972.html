<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Having faith in God and having faith in oneself is the perfect answer to all questions. But our faith has to be something inner and deep within. It is not mere outer vital confidence in oneself. This faith is the river that is flowing into the sea of ever-growing, ever-illumining reality. If we have that kind of faith in ourselves and in God, it is the perfect answer to all questions.</p>  </div>
