<p>This morning an old lady with a dog said to me, "You are tired?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, I am tired."</p>
<p>"How many miles?" she asked.</p>
<p>I answered, "Six and a half."</p>
<p>She said, "Kidding? Don't have to kill yourself. Don't be a fool, honey."</p>
<p>This was the first time I had ever seen her.</p>
