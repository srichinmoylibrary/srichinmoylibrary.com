<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is in the heart. According to medical science, the heart is slightly to the left of the center of the chest. According to Ramana Maharshi, the great sage of Arunachala, it is slightly to the right of the center. Some spiritual figures say that the heart is in the middle of the chest. Again, according to another spiritual figure, the heart is placed between the eyebrows! Of course, he also has his reasons.</p>
<p>The true spiritual heart, four finger-breadths in width, is located twelve finger-breadths directly above the navel and six finger-breadths directly below the center of the neck. It is here that one feels the "quickening" of the soul.</p>  </div>
