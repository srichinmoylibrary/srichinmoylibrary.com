<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just see what happens when you fulfil your own will. It is all frustration. When you fulfil God's Will, you get only joy. All of you have experienced this a few times, so you have enough proof. When you have fulfilled your own desires or achieved something in your own way, have you really got satisfaction? Immediately the answer will be no. But God's Way will definitely give you satisfaction.</p>  </div>
