<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the divine Will comes and guides us, it is infinitely easier than if we try to enter into it. But again, it is better to enter into the divine Will than to maintain a separate will. If we can enter into the divine Will, then the divine Will can take care of our own will. At that time, our own will becomes more fruitful and perfect. For a child to go and grab the father's hand is one thing. But for the father to come and catch hold of the child is different. If the child is holding the father's hand, then if he sees a kite, he may get excited and let go. Then he will fall and hurt himself. But if the father is holding the child, then no matter how excited the child becomes, still he is safe.</p>  </div>
