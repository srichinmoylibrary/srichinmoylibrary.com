<p>The first anniversary of Pramila's boarding house. All together there were eight students. They came to Nolini-da, who greeted them with a broad smile. "So, it is your first anniversary!" he said.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is," said Pramila.</p>
<p>"Then you are all one-year-old babies. And I tell you, if you eternally remain babies before the Mother, you will make the fastest progress."</p>
<p>In silence they all offered their deepest gratitude to Nolini-da for his blessingful advice.</p>  </div>
