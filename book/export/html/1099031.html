<h2>The birthday of Dilip-da</h2>


<p>I place my head at the Feet<br /> Of the Absolute Lord Supreme.<br /> I am now weaving a poem-garland<br /> To offer to someone who is<br /> A divinely and supremely high<br /> Seeker, singer and poet.<br /> Although I do now know<br /> How to adore him,<br /> I do know that his heart is all affection.<br /> I wish to steal his heart<br /> And I wish to hear his message divine.<br /> Many great men and women<br /> Of teeming virtues come to see him,<br /> As in a pilgrimage.<br /> I do not know how to offer my love,<br /> Admiration and adoration to him.<br /> The language of my silence-heart<br /> How can I express in words?<br /> I am only standing outside his heart-door<br /> To salute him.<br /> This poem, flooded with my admiration<br /> And adoration, I offer for his birthday.<br /> My heart is all eager<br /> To conquer his affection.</p>
