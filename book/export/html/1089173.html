<p><em>Seko:</em> Genius has a limited world, but for those who make the effort, there is an unlimited world. That is the most important thing. If you try very hard to make the effort, for you the infinite is there.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is true. A genius comes into the world with a special capacity from his past incarnation, or all of a sudden he achieves this kind of capacity. Then he may be satisfied with his capacity. He may not want to go beyond, whereas somebody who started with limited capacity may want to continue going beyond and beyond because he knows there is hope for him to do better. A genius may be a finished product, while somebody else who has aspiration and an inner cry will go on doing more and more.</p>  </div>
