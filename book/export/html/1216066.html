<p>   To darkness<br /> He has sold his light.   To bondage<br /> He has sold his freedom.   To ignorance<br /> He has sold his wisdom.   To deception<br /> He has sold his conscience.   Alas, when God came<br /> To buy something from him,<br />   Nothing was left.<br /> Poor God went home empty-handed.</p>
