<p>You are not only a musician of lofty heights, but a human being who could brook ruthless showers of criticism, unlike most other human beings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have been told that Wagner's music is better than it sounds."</p>
<p><em> — Mark Twain</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Is Wagner a human being at all? Is he not rather a disease? He contaminates everything he touches — he has made music sick....Wagner's art is diseased."</p>
<p><em> — Friedrich Nietzsche</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Happily for Wagner, he is endowed with a temper so insolent that criticism cannot touch his heart-even admitting that he has heart, which I doubt."</p>
<p><em> — Georges Bizet</em></p>
