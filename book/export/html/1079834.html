<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we know how to look at a problem, half the strength of the problem goes away. But usually we try to avoid the problem; we try to run away from it. A problem is not an indication of any fault or crime of ours, so why should we be afraid to face it? Our difficulty is that when something unfortunate happens in our life, we immediately feel that we are at fault, that we have done something wrong. We must know that there are also wrong forces, undivine forces, hostile forces around us. We believe in the law of karma â€” that if we do something wrong, we suffer later. But even if we do not do anything wrong, the ignorance of the world may come and torture us. Think of Christ. He was a great spiritual Master. He did not have any bad karma. He did not do anything wrong. But the ignorance of the world crucified him. Of course, we cannot compare ourselves with Christ, but at our own level we have to feel that we are not necessarily at fault.</p>
<p>By blaming ourselves and then trying to hide, we do not solve the problem. We have to face the problem and see whether we really are to blame. If our own ignorance has made the problem then it may be difficult to deal with. But if somebody else is creating the problem then we have to stand like a solid wall and not allow the problem to enter into us. If it is my house, my wall, I will not allow anybody to break through. But if I am the problem itself then how am I going to prevent it from entering? This problem is infinitely more difficult to solve than the problem coming from without. In order to solve the problem of myself, I have to feel that I am not the problem maker but the problem solver. Then I have to practise the spiritual life and develop inner strength, aspiration and inner detachment. Slowly, gradually, I will become inwardly strong, and then I will be able to solve the problems caused by myself, by my own inner weaknesses.</p>  </div>
