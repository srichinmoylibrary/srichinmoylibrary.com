<p>Before the marathon in Flushing Meadow Park, I ran about 14 miles on Union Turnpike. I was running in the outside lane and Pahar was running in the middle lane, next to me. My road crew was following me in the car. A policeman came and said, "Run on the sidewalk!" So I ran a little bit on the sidewalk, but the sidewalk is much harder than the street and it hurt my legs. Finally I said, "Let the police come again," and we went back to the street. Then an old man and woman saw us running. The old man was barking, "Can't you see you are running in the street?" The old lady told her husband not to bother us.</p>
