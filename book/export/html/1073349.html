<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The method is aspiration. If we dig into the earth, when we reach a certain depth we find water. In the spiritual life when we aspire, we are digging within. When we go deep enough, we finally come face to face with the inner sun. If we are in a room where all the doors are locked and the windows are closed and covered, then we do not see the sun. But when we leave the room and go outside, we do see the sun. Similarly, when we come out of the body-consciousness, the consciousness of ‘I’, ‘my’ and ‘mine’, then we see the inner sun.</p>  </div>
