<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In spite of knowing perfectly well that he and God are inseparable — eternally, constantly and inseparably one — the spiritual Guide constantly tells mankind who God is or shows mankind where God is. Consciously he leads mankind to God the Source, and he himself remains as the guide or the messenger boy. In spite of knowing that he and God are inseparable, eternally inseparable, he makes earth feel that he is the messenger of God and that he is leading the earth-consciousness somewhere else, where God is. He does not say that he himself is with God or in God. But when the seeker reaches the Goal, at that time he sees God and the Guide together as one.</p>  </div>
