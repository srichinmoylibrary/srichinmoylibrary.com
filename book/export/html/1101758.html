  <h1 class="book-heading">1.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Did You think of me<br /> When I was swimming<br /> In ignorance-sea?<br /> "My child,<br /> Definitely My Mind<br /> Was thinking of you<br /> And My Heart<br /> Was missing you."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101760" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I have come to realise<br /> That my mind-palace<br /> Has no peace.<br /> Could You suggest<br /> Another place?<br /> "My child,<br /> Yes, I can:<br /> Your heart-cottage."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101761" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> What is more important-<br /> For You to tell the world<br /> That I belong to You,<br /> Or for me to tell the world<br /> That You belong to me?<br /> "My child,<br /> Let us broadcast<br /> Simultaneously."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101762" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Can You enjoy Your Beauty<br /> The way we enjoy Your Beauty?<br /> "My child,<br /> You do your duty<br /> And I do My Duty:<br /> I enjoy at every moment<br /> Your heart-beauty."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101763" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Please bless me<br /> With that kind of love for You<br /> That will pass the examination<br /> Of Time.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101764" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Please tell me frankly<br /> If I am ready for a divine life.<br /> "My child,<br /> Right now if I answer<br /> The question,<br /> I shall say without a shadow<br /> Of doubt<br /> That you are ready.<br /> But if I have to answer<br /> The question<br /> At another time,<br /> Then I may have<br /> A different opinion."<br /> Why, my Lord?<br /> "My child,<br /> The time that elapses<br /> May drag you down<br /> And you may not then be ready<br /> For the spiritual life."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101765" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I see a criminal in me,<br /> I really do.<br /> Please tell me<br /> What You see in me.<br /> "My child,<br /> I see in you<br /> My highest Divinity's<br /> Sweetest dove."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101766" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I most sincerely<br /> Want to manifest You,<br /> But I do not know how.<br /> Please tell me how I can.<br /> "My child,<br /> Instead of wasting your time<br /> By manifesting Me,<br /> Pray to Me to manifest Myself<br /> More and better<br /> In and through you."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101767" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You do not sleep.<br /> You meditate and meditate;<br /> You work and work.<br /> I am Your child.<br /> Will I ever be<br /> As great and as good<br /> As You are?<br /> "My child,<br /> I never thought that you could be<br /> Such a fool!<br /> How can there be any difference<br /> Between Father and child?<br /> Is the child not the creation<br /> Of the Father?<br /> I am conscious of what I have<br /> And what I am.<br /> Unfortunately, you are not.<br /> This is the difference<br /> That forces you to swim<br /> In the seas of inequality<br /> And unworthiness."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101768" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Everything has a meaning.<br /> May I know the meaning<br /> Of Your Compassion-Breath?<br /> "My child,<br /> My Compassion-Breath means<br /> Your ignorance-death!"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101769" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> If I have two new eyes,<br /> Will I not be able<br /> To appreciate You<br /> And admire You more?<br /> "No, My child,<br /> You will be able<br /> To appreciate and admire<br /> Me more<br /> Only if you feed<br /> Your God-hunger more."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101770" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Every year my earthly years<br /> Advance,<br /> And I lose something precious<br /> From my childlike heart.<br /> Is it because of the advancement<br /> Of the years that I am losing<br /> My divine qualities?<br /> "No, My child,<br /> It is not exactly so.<br /> Your passing years have nothing<br /> To do with it.<br /> But every year, unfortunately,<br /> You are over-feeding your mind.<br /> Therefore, the tragedy continues."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101771" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Every word You say<br /> Melts my aspiration-heart.<br /> "My child,<br /> Every promise you make<br /> Enlarges My Cosmic Vision."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101772" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> When You smile at me,<br /> I see inside Your Smile<br /> The Beauty of Your Divinity.<br /> "My child,<br /> When you smile at Me,<br /> I see in you<br /> A completely new world<br /> Blossoming<br /> In all its promises."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101773" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I want You<br /> To saddle me.<br /> Why do You<br /> Cradle me?<br /> "My child,<br /> The hour is fast approaching<br /> For Me to please you<br /> In your own way."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101774" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I have started making<br /> My gratitude-list.<br /> But it never ends.<br /> "My child,<br /> So much the better<br /> For both of us."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101775" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Please tell me one thing:<br /> Do You want me to realise You,<br /> Or do You want me to please You?<br /> "My child,<br /> Where is the difference?"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101776" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I want to end my earth-journey.<br /> "My child,<br /> I have given you freedom<br /> In many aspects of your life,<br /> But not here."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101777" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> How I wish You would live<br /> In the tears of my heart<br /> Bravely.<br /> "My child,<br /> How I wish you would live<br /> In the Smiles of My Eye<br /> Happily."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101778" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I was born to be<br /> A choice instrument of Yours.<br /> "My child,<br /> Unlike you, I never forget."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101779" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">21.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Is there any special reason<br /> Why You have come to me<br /> So late at night?<br /> "My child,<br /> It is the only time<br /> I can catch your mind<br /> And try to tame it."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101780" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">22.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I am giving up everything<br /> Until I find You.<br /> "My child,<br /> Instead of giving up everything,<br /> Try to find Me in everything.<br /> That is the real way,<br /> The only way<br /> That will make Me happy<br /> And will make you happy as well."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101781" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> If I give You<br /> My unconditional surrender,<br /> I am afraid You will misuse it.<br /> "My child,<br /> Just give Me<br /> Your unconditional surrender first.<br /> If I misuse it,<br /> You are at perfect liberty<br /> To withdraw it."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101782" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I am begging You<br /> To keep me with You all the time<br /> And not to allow me to go away.<br /> "My child,<br /> I have the same prayer."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101783" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> My heart breaks into millions<br /> Of pieces<br /> When I do not feel You<br /> Inside my heart.<br /> "My child,<br /> You are not alone in your boat.<br /> How is it that you do not see Me<br /> Beside you?"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101784" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">26.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> May I dare to become<br /> One of Your favourite children?<br /> "My child,<br /> I think you already are one."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101785" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">27.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> When I was young,<br /> You told me that I was too young<br /> To accept the spiritual life.<br /> And now that I am old, too old,<br /> You are telling me<br /> That I am not meant<br /> For the spiritual life.<br /> Why did You not tell me this<br /> When I was still an adult<br /> With my whole life ahead of me?<br /> "My child,<br /> Allow Me to explain.<br /> You were meant<br /> For the spiritual life,<br /> But you were not ready,<br /> You are not ready<br /> And you will never be ready<br /> For the spiritual life<br /> Until you feel that the spiritual life<br /> Is the only life,<br /> And there is no other life for you."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101786" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">28.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Will my life ever be<br /> Your sole possession?<br /> "My child,<br /> The moment you hand it over<br /> To Me."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101787" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">29.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Is there anything I can do<br /> To make You happy?<br /> "My child,<br /> Claim Me immediately<br /> As your own, very own."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101788" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">30.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Why does my body sleep so much?<br /> And is that why I cannot meditate?<br /> "My child,<br /> I am also victim to the same thing,<br /> But I force Myself to meditate.<br /> Look how happy I am<br /> And how proud I am!<br /> I want you to do likewise:<br /> Force your body."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101789" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">31.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Is there any secret way<br /> For me to free myself<br /> From my sufferings?<br /> "My child,<br /> There is one.<br /> Just identify yourself<br /> With My universal Suffering.<br /> Lo, your suffering is gone,<br /> Completely gone."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101790" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">32.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Why are You not making my life<br /> A bit easier?<br /> "My child,<br /> I am asking you<br /> The same question."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101791" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">33.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> In the battlefield of life<br /> When I am repeatedly defeated,<br /> Do You feel sorry for me?<br /> "My child,<br /> My defeats are infinitely<br /> More deplorable."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101792" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">34.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Are You not proud of me<br /> That I have accepted You<br /> As my Teacher<br /> And discarded my old teacher:<br /> Ignorance?<br /> "My child,<br /> Proud is an understatement!<br /> Only I am sad<br /> That you did not think of Me<br /> Long ago."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101793" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">35.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Do You not feel sorry that<br /> Instead of our being<br /> At Your Mercy,<br /> You are at our mercy?<br /> "No, My child.<br /> When I am at your mercy,<br /> I try to add more Compassion<br /> To My infinite Compassion<br /> And more Forgiveness<br /> To My infinite Forgiveness.<br /> Unconsciously,<br /> You are giving Me an opportunity<br /> To sing the song<br /> Of My ever-transcending Beyond."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101794" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">36.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> What are You doing<br /> Inside my mind?<br /> Do You not know that my mind<br /> Does not care for You?<br /> "My child,<br /> I know, I know.<br /> I am just paying a visit,<br /> In case your mind<br /> Wants to change its mind."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101795" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">37.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Have You any idea<br /> How much my heart is suffering<br /> From Your absence?<br /> "My child,<br /> I truly have no idea.<br /> But I am immediately sending<br /> My Compassion-Eye<br /> To make serious inquiries."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101796" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">38.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You do not come to me.<br /> Is it because<br /> My heart is too insignificant,<br /> My mind is too impure,<br /> My life is too imperfect?<br /> "No, My child,<br /> Not for that, no.<br /> I do not come to you<br /> Because your love for Me<br /> Is still too shallow."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101797" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">39.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I am extremely tired.<br /> Please tell me a story<br /> So that I can immediately<br /> Fall asleep.<br /> "My child,<br /> I am the wrong person.<br /> I am infinitely more tired<br /> Than you are.<br /> Therefore, sleep has already<br /> Captured My Eye."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101798" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">40.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I am fully awake.<br /> Cheerfully and self-givingly<br /> I am at Your Command.<br /> "My child,<br /> Are you sure?<br /> I plead with you,<br /> This time do not<br /> Eat your promise<br /> Like previous times."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101799" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">41.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Each time I come near You,<br /> You just run away.<br /> Why, why, my Lord?<br /> "My child,<br /> Just to increase your heart-hunger<br /> In measureless measure."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101800" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">42.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Every day I write heart-letters<br /> To You.<br /> Do You get a chance to read them?<br /> Be honest.<br /> Do You really like them?<br /> "My child,<br /> My Heart hungers<br /> For your heart-letters."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101801" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">43.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Will there be a day<br /> When I will be able to come to You,<br /> Fulfilling all Your expectations,<br /> And show You my delight-flooded<br /> Victory-face?<br /> "My child,<br /> What you need is a little more Grace.<br /> Your red-letter day<br /> Is fast approaching you."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101802" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">44.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I do not know how I dare<br /> To show my face to You,<br /> Since I displease You<br /> In so many ways.<br /> "My child,<br /> How do I show My Face to you<br /> Without fulfilling<br /> So many desires of yours?<br /> Even if we do not please<br /> Each other,<br /> Let us continue showing our faces."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101803" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">45.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I speak ill of You<br /> In season and out of season.<br /> How is it that You never<br /> Speak ill of me?<br /> "My child,<br /> My Mind and My Heart<br /> Are always fully occupied<br /> With things<br /> Infinitely more important<br /> Than being your worthy rival."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101804" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">46.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I know world-criticism is bad.<br /> How can self-criticism also be bad?<br /> "My child,<br /> Both are unmistakably<br /> And equally bad.<br /> Your world-criticism<br /> Lengthens the pride<br /> Of your stupidity-flooded mind.<br /> Your self-criticism<br /> Indefinitely delays<br /> My divine manifestation<br /> In and through you."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101805" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">47.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Do You really know everything<br /> That I say and do?<br /> "My child,<br /> Although I have the capacity<br /> To know<br /> Everything that you do and say,<br /> I prefer to do something else:<br /> I am desperately trying<br /> To turn you into another God<br /> So that I can entrust you<br /> With some of My Responsibilities."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101806" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">48.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Do You mind<br /> When I do not please You<br /> Every day?<br /> "My child,<br /> I am afraid<br /> That I will never be able<br /> To answer your question<br /> Adequately."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101807" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">49.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I need to know<br /> When I shall realise You.<br /> "My child,<br /> I need to know first of all<br /> When you will give Me your all<br /> And when you will claim Me<br /> To be your own."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101808" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">50.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I love Your Eye so much.<br /> Do You love anything of mine?<br /> "My child,<br /> I love the blooming-blossoming Smiles of your eyes<br /> More than you can ever love<br /> My Eye."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101809" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">51.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Will my life's service-tree<br /> Be able to inspire<br /> One hundred seekers?<br /> "My child,<br /> Only one hundred?<br /> What a shock!<br /> What an insult to your soul<br /> And to Me!"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101810" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">52.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Do You think I shall ever be able<br /> To realise You in this lifetime?<br /> "Yes, My child, yes.<br /> No, My child, no."<br /> What do You mean, my Lord,<br /> 'Yes and No'?<br /> Please be explicit.<br /> "Yes, when you are faith-nectar.<br /> No, when you are doubt-poison."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101811" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">53.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Is it such a difficult thing<br /> For You to make a solemn promise<br /> To me<br /> That You will always remain<br /> With me,<br /> Whether I speak highly of You<br /> Or speak ill of You?<br /> "My child,<br /> I shall always remain with you,<br /> And I have<br /> A special piece of advice for you:<br /> Speak ill of Me if you have to,<br /> For this is the only way<br /> You can empty yourself<br /> Of your doubt-poison.<br /> But speak highly of Me if you can,<br /> So that I can immediately<br /> Start singing and dancing<br /> Inside your heart-garden."</p>
