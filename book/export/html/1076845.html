<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I were a doctor and you asked me a question about medicine I could answer you easily but not one about politics. I cannot help the hippies because the kind of happiness that they want I don't have. Other teachers say that they do have that kind of happiness and the hippies are satisfied with those teachers.</p>  </div>
