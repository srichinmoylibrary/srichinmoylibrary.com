 <p></p>
<h2>1.</h2>


<p>This morning<br /> During my meditation<br /> My soul blessingfully spoke to me.<br /> My human eyes and human ears<br /> Were the soulful<br /> And prayerful witnesses.</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> You need love<br /> More, infinitely more,<br /> To succeed.</p>
<p>"You need devotion<br /> More, infinitely more,<br /> To proceed.</p>
<p>"You need surrender<br /> More, infinitely more,<br /> To make yourself happy<br /> And<br /> To make Me happy.<br /> There is no other way,<br /> And there can be no other way."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092443" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 

<p>My problem is this:<br /> I cannot think<br /> Of God<br /> Even for seven minutes a day.<br /> God's problem is this:<br /> He cannot stop thinking<br /> Of me<br /> Even for seven seconds a day.</p>
<p>My problem is this:<br /> I do not want to know<br /> How great God is,<br /> As long as He is kind to me.</p>
<p>God's problem is this:<br /> He does not want to know<br /> How undivine I am,<br /> As long as I call Him my Father.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092444" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Is it possible to have happiness<br /> In this world?</p>
<p>"Definitely, My child.<br /> I would not have created this world<br /> If I could not create happiness<br /> In this world.</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> There are two kinds of happiness:<br /> Happiness real<br /> And happiness unreal.</p>
<p>"When the real in you<br /> Pleases Me in My own Way,<br /> That happiness is real.</p>
<p>"When the unreal in you<br /> Pleases you in your own way,<br /> That happiness is unreal.</p>
<p>"Do you want to know how<br /> You can know the real happiness<br /> From the unreal happiness?</p>
<p>"When you are really happy,<br /> You are satisfied within,<br /> Divinely and supremely.</p>
<p>"When you are unreally happy,<br /> You get no sense of satisfaction<br /> Either in your inner life<br /> Or in your outer life."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092445" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Supreme Lord,<br /> When You make me happy<br /> In my own way,<br /> I feel that I have achieved<br /> Something great.</p>
<p>My Supreme Lord,<br /> When I make You happy<br /> In Your own Way<br /> What happens to You?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> I feel that I have made<br /> Tremendous progress,<br /> And I also feel that the Hour<br /> Has struck for Me<br /> To dream of a better, higher<br /> And deeper creation<br /> In and through you."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092446" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Do give me the sweet hope<br /> To feel that I can<br /> Fulfil You and please You<br /> In Your own Way.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Do give me the brave courage<br /> To feel that I will<br /> Fulfil You and please You<br /> In Your own Way.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Do give me the surrendered life<br /> To feel that I am<br /> Fulfilling You and pleasing You<br /> In Your own Way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092447" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 

<p>I do not pray<br /> To an unknown God.</p>
<p>I do not meditate<br /> On an unknowable God.</p>
<p>I pray to the God<br /> Whose Transcendental Eye<br /> Is extremely familiar.</p>
<p>I meditate on the God<br /> Whose universal Heart<br /> Is extremely popular.</p>
<p>His Transcendental Eye<br /> Tells me to make Him happy<br /> Only in His own Way.</p>
<p>His Universal Heart<br /> Tells me to become perfect<br /> Only in His own Way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092448" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Part II — Poems on war</h1>
  
 <p></p>
<h2>1.</h2>


<p>My Lord,<br /> Please forgive me.<br /> I have not brought anything<br /> For You this time.</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> Next time you come to visit Me<br /> Here in Heaven,<br /> Will you bring Me<br /> What I desperately need?"</p>
<p>Definitely, my Lord.<br /> Please tell me what it is<br /> That You desperately need.</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> Then bring Me<br /> All the nuclear weapons<br /> That the countries of the world,<br /> Especially the superpowers,<br /> Have produced."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092449" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> What is the difference<br /> Between suicide and war?</p>
<p>"My child, Suicide you commit<br /> When you are an impossible fool.</p>
<p>"War you declare<br /> When you are absolutely<br /> The worst sinner."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092450" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Everybody knows what war is<br /> And what peace is.<br /> May I learn from You<br /> The difference?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> War is the mind's<br /> World-devouring problem.<br /> Peace is the heart's<br /> World-illumining solution."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092451" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> How can humanity<br /> Stop declaring war?</p>
<p>"My child, easily.<br /> Just by not thinking of war,<br /> Exactly the way humanity<br /> Does not think of Me."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092452" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> After You created the world,<br /> Did You ever think of war?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> I have infinitely better things<br /> To think of:<br /> Love, oneness and peace."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092453" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> When the war-mongers die,<br /> Where do they go?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> I send them to a place<br /> Where I have never been<br /> And I shall never go,<br /> Never!"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092454" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Will there be<br /> A Third World War?</p>
<p>"No, My child,<br /> Because<br /> Every night I make it a point<br /> To threaten and frighten<br /> The war-mongers in their sleep."</p>
<p>My Lord,<br /> Are they conscious of it?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> I do not care<br /> If they are conscious of it,<br /> As long as I do not allow them<br /> To do what they want to do."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092455" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord, Rama and Krishna fought<br /> Against their enemies.<br /> I am sure that they did<br /> The right thing.</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> Rama, Krishna and I<br /> Are inseparably one.<br /> Therefore, how could they<br /> Do anything wrong?</p>
<p>"At that time,<br /> The divine forces fought<br /> Against the undivine forces.</p>
<p>"But now,<br /> To manifest the Light of the Divine,<br /> The inner insecurity-forces<br /> Fight against<br /> The outer security-forces<br /> To fool the outer world."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092456" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Will there be a day<br /> When there will be no war<br /> And this world of ours<br /> Will be flooded with peace?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> Do not think of war.<br /> Do not think of peace.<br /> Just become peace.<br /> Lo and behold, war is nowhere."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092457" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> As You know, thousands of people<br /> Have been killed<br /> By nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> I am sure that you know that<br /> Billions and trillions of people<br /> Have been saved<br /> By My Compassion-Eye."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092458" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> The superpowers are decreasing<br /> Their nuclear weapons.<br /> I am sure that You are pleased<br /> With them.</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> I am indeed pleased with them,<br /> But not proud of them."</p>
<p>What do You mean,<br /> My Lord?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> I shall be proud of them only when<br /> They place at My Forgiveness-Feet<br /> All their nuclear weapons."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1092459" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> If I dislike someone vehemently,<br /> What is the best way to deal with<br /> That person?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> There is not just one,<br /> But there are many ways<br /> To deal with that person:</p>
<p>"First,<br /> Do not express<br /> Your volcanic anger.</p>
<p>"Second,<br /> Think and feel<br /> That you have the capacity<br /> To mould and shape that person<br /> Into a perfectly lovely human losing.</p>
<p>"Third,<br /> Discard all your preconceived ideas<br /> And judgements about the person,<br /> For if you cherish hostile attitudes<br /> Towards any person,<br /> Then your own hostility<br /> Will devour you.</p>
<p>"Next,<br /> Just imagine that right now<br /> Your so-called enemy is having<br /> Nice thoughts about you.<br /> Not only that,<br /> To your wide surprise, your enemy<br /> Is speaking highly of you<br /> To others.</p>
<p>"Finally,<br /> Ask your mind to be a peace-maker.<br /> Ask your heart to be a peace-lover.<br /> Ask yourself to be a peace-observer<br /> Here and everywhere<br /> In the Eternal Now."</p>
