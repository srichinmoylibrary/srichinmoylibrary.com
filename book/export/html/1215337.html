<p>This year I became a totally different person at our Masters Games. Previously, for various reasons, I did not go and shake hands with my old running friends or with the prominent athletes. This time I went up to so many and asked our photographers to take photos. As usual, my photographers were off duty.</p>
<p>During the day, I walked five laps on the track. While I was walking, a tall black man came up to me and said, "You are a celebrity. How can you mix with us?"</p>
<p>I said, "We are all brothers."</p>
<p>Then he looked at me with such joy and affection. I became very, very friendly to all the athletes.</p>
<p>I hope that at our Sports Day in August I can do a little running. Today what a struggle it was to do five laps walking!</p>
<p>It was a day of tremendous joy, success and achievement for all the athletes. They were so friendly and kind.</p>
