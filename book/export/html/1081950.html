<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No! No, no, no! He has nothing to do with that. The Supreme does not want us to be depressed. Only we say to the Supreme that if He wants us to be depressed for a special reason, then we are ready. That is our surrender. But if we pray to the Supreme to keep us sad and miserable so that we will always think of Him, that is wrong. He is all Joy, all Love; so let us take His Joy and Love. He does not want us to have depression, but we cherish it. Again, what we call depression at a particular moment, in His Eye may not be depression at all. Only we take it as such.</p>  </div>
