  <h1 class="book-heading">Joy in surrender</h1>
  
 
<p>When an aspirant is totally surrendered to God’s Will, he will get abundant joy. He will feel all joy in his heart and he will live in constant joy. He will not be able to account for it or give any meaning to it. Early in the morning when he first gets up, he will get a very sweet feeling or sensation. If he touches a wall, he will get joy; if he touches a mirror, he will also get joy. His own joy enters into everything he sees. At times he may see that a solid wall is full of joy: a tree will be full of joy. If a taxi-cab goes by, he will see intense joy in the driver, even in the car itself. His inner joy will enter into each person, each object; and it will pervade everything.</p>
<p>If there is total surrender, then there can be no failure. Surrender means the greatest joy, deepest joy, most soulful joy, even in so-called failure. Success also brings the same joy. When we are successful in something, immediately we derive joy from our success. Similarly, if our inner and outer life is surcharged with surrendering Light, then at every moment we derive pure unalloyed Joy from the highest Source. If we have this kind of spontaneous inner joy, then we can feel that it comes only from our total surrender to the Inner Pilot, the Master, the Guru, God.</p>
<p>Sometimes the aspirant makes a complete and total surrender but the outer being is not receptive enough to feel the Truth. Or again it may happen that an aspirant feels miserable and sorry because he is crying for something and still has desires. At this time, in spite of making full surrender, he does not know whether or not he has made the surrender. Until his entire being is aware of his surrender, his mind will not be convinced. If he has a spiritual Master, he can learn from his Master whether or not he has totally surrendered. The Master will be able to feel the truth even though the outer being of the disciple may be saying everything to the contrary. The Master can never tell a lie. If the Master says, “You have totally surrendered,” then even if we don’t feel constant inner joy, we can rest assured that we have made surrender in the fullest measure.</p>  </div>
