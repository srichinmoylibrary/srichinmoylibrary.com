<p>Be not afraid of him.<br /> Although his is a huge body<br /> It will not harm you.</p>
<p>Be not afraid of him.<br /> Although his is a powerful vital<br /> It will not dominate you.</p>
<p>Be not afraid of him.<br /> Although his is a vast mind<br /> It will not ridicule you.</p>
<p>Be not afraid of him.<br /> Although his is a pure heart<br /> It will never, never ignore you.</p>
