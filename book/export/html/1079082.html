<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you write stories, your physical mind feels reverential awe. You feel, “Guru is so great, so vast; how am I going to write about him? No matter what I write, it will not be adequate.” But this is all in the physical mind. When you become one with me on the strength of your heart’s aspiration and love, on the strength of your devotion and surrender, at that time you feel an inner thrill, inner joy, inner ecstasy when you are writing about me. So if you offer love, devotion and surrender the moment you start writing, it is inner ecstasy that you enjoy. But when inner ecstasy inundates your entire being, sometimes it is beyond the capacity of the physical frame to assimilate it. You can’t store it; therefore you shake with this inner ecstasy. That is a very good experience.</p>
<p>When you are not in a higher consciousness while you are writing, at that time your mind will know my height and my depth; so a sort of reverential awe comes about. But what you experience when you are in a soulful consciousness is divine ecstasy, and that expresses itself in the physical and makes the entire body shake.</p>  </div>
