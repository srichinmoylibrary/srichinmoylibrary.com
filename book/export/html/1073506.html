<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> In the set position, you leave your head where it is â€” right where the shoulders are and let it come down as the shoulders come up. The idea in starting is to keep the shoulders up, because you want to come out low and come up fast. Most people think you have to run low, but you will come out straight up. The right knee in the set position should not be straight but with a slight bend. The position of the front leg is most important. There can be a slight V. The back leg should be a little straighter than the front leg.</p>  </div>
