<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can feel the necessity for gratitude if you feel that gratitude is your living breath. Feel that if your gratitude-breath is extinguished, then you are dead. Each time you offer gratitude for a fleeting second, feel it is a living breath.</p>
<p>On earth there is nothing so important or significant as gratitude. In God's case, the most significant thing He has is Compassion. God is Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent, but His Compassion-Power makes us close to Him. If He did not have Compassion-Power, we would not care for Him. If we can show God an iota of gratitude, God feels that within us He can exist. Our gratitude is God's Existence, God's House, God's Abode. God has to live in the street unless He can live inside our gratitude-heart.</p>  </div>
