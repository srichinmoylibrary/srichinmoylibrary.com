<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have come to Puerto Rico to inspire the seekers of Truth. There are persons who have an inner aspiration to realise God and I have come to help the Divine within them. This is our Centre and here I teach the correct way to practice meditation. I give talks and they ask me questions about the inner life and about some problems of day-to-day living. I try to bring down Light so that the person can face his particular problems and solve them.</p>  </div>
