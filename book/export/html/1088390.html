<p>A few months after the queen had offered her temple to Bama, the Master one day got inspiration to pass water and sprinkle it all over the temple.</p>
<p>The priest and the guard were horrified, but Bama just said to them, "She is my Mother, I am her little child. What else do you expect me to do if I don't pass water on Her? I have a right to do these kinds of things. What does the little child do with the mother? The child passes water."</p>
<p>The priest and the guard thought that if they made complaints to the queen, the queen would be really angry with Bama for his bad behaviour. They were already jealous of him because the queen always showed him tremendous concern and love. So they went to the queen and told her what had happened, expressing tremendous anxiety, worry and fear.</p>
<p>The queen scolded them mercilessly. "You fools!" she said. "This is a matter entirely related to the Mother and the son. Bama's Mother is the goddess Tara; he is his Mother's dearest son â€” her darling little child. Mother and son are one. This is none of our business; we should stay totally out of it. Let the problem be solved by the Mother and the son. They are dearer than the dearest to each other, so mind your own business. Don't make any complaints against Bama. He is far above our human standards."</p>  </div>
