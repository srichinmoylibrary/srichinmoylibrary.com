<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Take these things as a thorn that has entered into you. You feel that you are very bad, undivine, ugly, stupid; all the bad qualities of the world are inside you. Take this self-criticism as a thorn. One thorn has entered you, but it has many names: Insecurity, doubt and so on. When these thorns enter into you, take help of another thorn. That thorn is, "I am God's daughter, chosen daughter, and I am going to be a perfect instrument. There is nothing on earth which can prevent me from becoming His chosen instrument." So use this thorn to take out the other thorn that is causing you trouble. Self-criticism can be conquered only through proper self-appreciation. So just claim Him as your own. God is your Source. If you can feel that you are God's daughter, then you won't be bothered by these things.</p>  </div>
