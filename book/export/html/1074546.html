<p>If we cannot continue to aspire with the same love, the same devotion, the same surrender, then we will come down to the first rung of the spiritual ladder. We won’t go below the first rung if we have climbed up far enough, but we may go down to our starting point. At the starting rung we had inspiration. Then with aspiration we climbed up four or five rungs of the ladder out of the fifteen rungs that we have to climb. But if we don’t continue to climb, then naturally, like the law of gravity, the force of ignorance will pull us down. We cannot remain in one plane of consciousness for more than a second; either we go up or we come down. Through aspiration we go up or through lack of aspiration we come down; we cannot remain in the air motionless.</p>  </div>
