<p>After the London Peace Concert, a certain spiritual teacher came up to me backstage. He was bowing down and saying, "Please bless me, please bless me!"</p>
<p>Was I going to place my hand on his head? No! I only bless my own disciples. But I gave him a flower. This particular teacher used to be a doctor before he became a spiritual Master. Now he has quite a few disciples. He has asked his disciples always to participate in our activities because he has such love and admiration for me. His disciples keep my picture on their shrine, along with the pictures of other spiritual Masters.</p>
<p>Last week his disciples in San Francisco invited our disciples to come and play my music for them in their Centre.</p>
