  <h1 class="book-heading">Love devotion surrender</h1>
  
 
<p>Love is action. Devotion is practice. Surrender is experience.</p>
<p>Love is realisation. Devotion is revelation. Surrender is manifestation.</p>
<p>Love is the meaning of life. Devotion is the secret of life. Surrender is the Goal of life.</p>
<p>In my love, I see God the Mother. In my devotion, I see God the Father. In my surrender, I see God the Mother and God the Father together in one body.</p>
<p>Love without devotion is absurdity. Devotion without surrender is futility.</p>
<p>Love with devotion was my journey's start. Devotion with surrender is my journey's close.</p>
<p>I love the Supreme because I came from Him. I devote myself to the Supreme because I wish to go back to Him. I surrender myself to the Supreme because He lives in me and I in Him.</p>  </div>
