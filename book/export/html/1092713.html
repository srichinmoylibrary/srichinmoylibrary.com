<p>"What Bengal thinks today,<br /> Tomorrow the entire nation thinks."<br /> This statement was not even<br /> An inch far from the truth.<br /> Indeed, to become acquainted with Subhas<br /> Is to recognise<br /> The authenticity of this statement<br /> In no time.<br /> There was a time when Netaji's Bengal,<br /> Without the least possible hesitation,<br /> Became the builder of tomorrow's India.</p>
