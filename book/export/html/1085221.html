<p>Once the Mogul Emperor Humayun was fighting a terrible battle against his enemy. The enemy's army was extremely powerful and outnumbered Humayun's army. What was worse, Humayun's treacherous brothers, Carmen and Hindal, had turned traitors to the Emperor. In their greed to capture his kingdom and dethrone him, they had joined forces with the enemy. As Humayun's army was falling back, the Emperor's horse slipped and fell into a nearby river. The horse drowned and Humayun, badly hurt, was being tossed around helplessly in the rough current.</p>
<p>A water carrier named Nizam, who was a humble man of low caste, saw the Emperor's plight and cried out, "I fear for the Emperor's life! His subjects admire him and adore him as such a just and great Emperor. If the Emperor drowns, we will lose our only hope for a better and more illumining life. I can see that he is wounded and will not be able to save himself."</p>
<p>The water carrier dove bravely into the river and held out his leather bag so the Emperor could float across the river to safety. Both men held the bag, and the water carrier protected the wounded Emperor until they reached the other shore. The Emperor was so moved. He said, "You have come and saved me. Now I am helpless, but I promise you that when I go back to Agrah and am once more seated on my throne, I shall give you my throne for one day. Believe me, this is my solemn promise. You are not a mere water carrier. You are the saviour of the Mogul Emperor Humayun."</p>
<p>The water carrier Nizam was overwhelmed. He fell at the Emperor's feet: "Please, I did not expect any reward. My reward is your safety."</p>
<p>But Humayun insisted, "You, a water carrier of low caste, have shown such loyalty and love for your Emperor, whereas my own brothers have become traitors. I will always be kind to them and forgive them, for this is the promise that I made to my father Babar when he was on his deathbed. But of all of my subjects, you are the one who deserves my throne for one day. You deserve not only my throne, but my eternal gratitude. All my subjects should show you admiration and adoration for your heroic bravery."</p>
<p>The Emperor kept his promise, and Nizam did sit on his throne for one day.</p>
