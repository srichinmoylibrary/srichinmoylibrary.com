<p>The other day in Hawaii I was in a shop. A girl said, "Please tell me your name."</p>
<p>When I told her, she said, "O Guru, O Guru, you don't recognise me? I am Sambhava's sister-in-law-Lynn's sister. Thirteen years ago I came to New York and saw you. Then two years ago I came for your birthday. I can't believe you are here. You have made my day!"</p>
