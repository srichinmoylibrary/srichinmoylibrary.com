<p><em>(Agni's summary)</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two ways for Guru's disciples to meditate. They can either try to open themselves to Guru and allow him to enter into them, or they can try to enter into Guru. Both are effective, but Guru feels that the latter method is somewhat better. When the disciple tries to allow Guru to enter into him, fear may develop and prevent the disciple from receiving Guru. He may think that, "I told a lie this morning or did some undivine thing", and so he may feel that Guru will be like an inspector coming into a dirty or impure room. But when the disciple enters into Guru, He is all compassion. Guru keeps his room clean and pure, so the disciple can always enter and be cleansed, purified and elevated.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when the disciple sees Guru standing in front of him, he may be frightened or awed by His vastness. However, he needn't worry about being impure, since when he stands in front of an ocean, even if he is covered with sand and dirt, he can just dive in and he will be cleansed. So the disciple should feel that Guru is a Sea of compassion and he has but to dive in and become part of the Sea. The drop will not lose its individual self-awareness inside the vast Sea, but the drop will expand its individuality until the wideness of the Sea and the drop are one and the same. The drop becomes a conscious portion of the whole ocean without actually losing consciousness of itself. Rather, the drop receives the consciousness of the whole ocean: Peace, Power, Wideness, Depth and Unfathomable Divinity.</p>  </div>
