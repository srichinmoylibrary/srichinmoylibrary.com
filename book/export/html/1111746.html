<p>At the three-mile point of the half-marathon, Vince was supposed to give me ERG, but he didn't see me run by. I saw him, but I didn't know that he was helping my road crew. Then Lavanya saw him and told him that I was about a hundred metres ahead of her. Vince had to run to catch me. Then, once he caught up with me, he had to run another 100 metres because I still didn't know he was the person meeting me and I kept on going. I thought that he was running to inform somebody else that I was coming.</p>
