<p>After the inauguration, we were in the march past. You laugh, at times, at our marching on Sports Day. But if you laugh at our marching, then you would have perhaps jumped and danced if you had seen them marching. The musicians in the band were really good, but nobody paid attention to the drum. Everybody had his or her own inner drum.</p>  </div>
