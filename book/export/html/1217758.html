<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Instead of hindering, it helps. But the thing is that you have to give more importance to the particular path that inspires your being most.</p>
<p>For example: the attitude of service, the attitude of devotion and the attitude of quest for knowledge, taken all together, will help you make a balanced progress. But at some point in your life, you have to find the one that inspires you most. Each soul has its own way of moving. Here on earth, we are inspired to progress according to our soul's propensity. If you accept all the paths, it is a great help; at the same time, you have to choose your own soul's way, the way that gives you the greatest fulfilment according to your deepest aspiration.</p>  </div>
