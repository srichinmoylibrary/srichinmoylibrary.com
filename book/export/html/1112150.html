<p>Another day I saw Namrata running. I said, "O God, Namrata is running so slowly." But after two minutes she was even farther away from me.</p>
<p>Then I saw somebody in front of Namrata. I said, "Somebody is running much faster than Namrata." The person looked like Lavanya, but I said, "She usually does not run at this hour. How can it be Lavanya?" She was far ahead of me, and she turned down a side street, so I did not see who it was.</p>
<p>Then, when I was coming back, I saw that it was Lavanya. I smiled ather and talked to her for a minute. At that hour for Lavanya to run!</p>
