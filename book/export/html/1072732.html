<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, opportunity can be self-made and opportunity can be predestined, but self-made opportunity does not have abiding life in it, whereas when we get opportunity from the Grace of God, this opportunity has an everlasting life and an ever-illumining capacity.</p>
<p>Yes, it is quite possible to increase oneâ€™s opportunity through surrender-power.</p>  </div>
