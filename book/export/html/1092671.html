<p>Netaji, I bow to your indomitable soul.<br /> Netaji, I bow to your indefatigable life.<br /> Netaji, I bow to your sleepless and breathless<br /> India-independence-dream.</p>
<p>Netaji, I am now here in Tokyo, Japan.<br /> I am here at your blessingful Renko-ji Temple.<br /> It is here that I am hearing your oneness-heart-bell<br /> Constantly ringing.</p>
<p>Netaji, I am here at your peaceful shrine.<br /> It is here that India's independence-dreamers,<br /> India's independence-lovers,<br /> And India's independence-fighters<br /> Proudly, voraciously and regularly dine.</p>
<p>Netaji, it is here at your fruitful Long Home<br /> That India's division-foolishness,<br /> Division-blindness<br /> And division-madness<br /> Unmistakably fail to roam.</p>
<p>Netaji, beauty of the Bengali heart you were.<br /> Netaji, responsibility of the Indian life you were.<br /> Netaji, capacity of the sub-continent-unity you were.</p>
<p>Japan, O beauty's land,<br /> Lovingly, affectionately, devotedly and self-givingly<br /> You treasure our beloved Netaji.</p>
<p>My Bengali aspiration-heart,<br /> My Indian dedication-life<br /> And my world-peace-manifestation-dream<br /> Love you.</p>

<p>Renko-ji Temple, Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p>26 December 1996</p>  </div>
