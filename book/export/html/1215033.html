<p>I had decided to give thirteen talks on the Upanishads. Today I will be giving my thirteenth talk on the Upanishads. That means that today we are at the end of the race, the divine race. We are nearing the goal. When we reach the goal we shall offer our most devoted gratitude to the Inner Pilot. Also, I offer my blessingful gratitude to all my disciples who have made arrangements for me to talk at various distinguished universities. It is they who are helping me in offering the little Light I have to the world at large.</p>  </div>
