<p>When you are in command of truth,<br /> The world does not trust you.<br /> When you are in command of peace,<br /> The world does not trust you.<br /> When you are in command of satisfaction,<br /> The world does not trust you.<br /> What can you do?<br /> Just try to be in command<br /> Of your heart of gratitude to your Pilot Supreme<br /> For what He has given to you<br /> And what He is to you.<br /> Lo and behold,<br /> The world will start trusting you.<br /> Not only that, it will unreservedly love you.</p>
