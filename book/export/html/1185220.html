<p>Rembrandt had a special way of painting. At times he would take an oath that he would not allow anyone to watch him paint. He wanted to work all by himself, in pin-drop silence. If anybody came near him, he would become furious.</p>
<p>He said to his friends and colleagues, "You think it is just because you are my friends, colleagues and students that I am behaving this way. But I tell you, it is not true. I will not give an audience even to the first monarch of the world when I do not want to see anybody.</p>
<p>"Rest assured, this is not my whim. This is my oath! When I do not want to do something, I will not do it. When I want something to be done, I will get it done by any means. Here I am telling you, even the greatest monarch of the world will not be able to see me while I am painting if I do not want to see him. In what way am I indebted to anybody on earth? Since I am not indebted, I am under no obligation to see the greatest monarch of the world. When I want to be all by myself, I am at perfect liberty to keep myself free."</p>  </div>
