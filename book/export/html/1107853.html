<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unless you fight with them, how can you keep them outside yourself? If you throw your wrong thoughts out of the kitchen, then they will go and hide in another room, and you will relax. But they will not go outside the house, and after a few days they will come and strike you again. It is a wrong theory that they will die. The thoughts will only remain calm and quiet for a while, until their strength increases. The problem is that when a thought remains inside the body, no matter how small it is, it is infinitely stronger than the ones that are outside the body. Forces that come from outside cannot immediately attack you, but when forces come from around the navel, they can create tremendous problems! First you allow them to come inside you. Then they increase their power.</p>  </div>
