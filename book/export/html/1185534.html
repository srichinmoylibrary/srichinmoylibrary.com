<p>Two friends following two different spiritual paths met in the subway. One of them put his hand into the other’s pocket. His friend said: “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“What? Do you want me to disbelieve my Master’s message?”</p>
<p>“What is your Master’s message?”</p>
<p>“My Master’s message is that we are all one, inseparably and eternally one. Therefore, when I put my hand into your pocket, I clearly felt that I was putting my hand into my own pocket.”</p>
<p>“You rogue! Do you want to hear my Master’s message?”</p>
<p>“What is your Master’s message?”</p>
<p>“My Master’s message is the message of perfection. You need perfection, and a smart slap from me will grant you that perfection.”</p>  </div>
