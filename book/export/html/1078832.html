<p>Without man can I do anything? Yes, I can. Without man I can do many, many, many things, if not each and every thing. If I pray to God to grant me the capacity to do everything without man’s help, humanity’s help, I am sure He will grant me the boon.</p>
<p>Without man I do so many things precisely because my Almighty Father, My Beloved Supreme, has given me the capacity. I look at my powerful brother, the sun, without man. I look at my beautiful sister, the moon, without man. I look at my sweet children, the stars, without man. I look and look at my Father, God, without man. I look at my Mother, God, without man.</p>
<p>But can I do anything without God? No, impossible! Why? I cannot do anything without God because I cannot live without God. How is it that I cannot live without God? Is it because He is all Kindness, all Love? No, no! Is it because He is all Concern, all Compassion? No, no! Is it because He is all-where? No, no! Is it because He is my essence and my substance? No, no!</p>
<p>Then why is it that I cannot live without God? I cannot live without God precisely because I cannot live without that which I have and that which I am. Can you live without what you have and what you are? Impossible! If you have light, you live in light and you are that light Itself. And if you have God within you, then you not only possess God but you are that very God. It is like a deer that has fragrance, musk. When the deer develops musk, the deer and the musk are inseparable. When the flower has fragrance, the flower and the fragrance are inseparable. Similarly, God the Beauty that is within me and God the possessor of the Beauty are inseparable. Therefore, I cannot live without God, for He is what I am and what I have. You too cannot live without what you have and what you are. What you have and what you are will always be the same Reality-Existence: God. Therefore, you and I cannot live without God, not to speak of doing anything without God.</p>
