<p>Who is to determine my progress? You? No. He? No. Myself? No. Earth? No. Heaven? No. Then who is to determine my progress? My progress has to be determined by the sole Doer in me, my Inner Pilot. Only he who does the task has the right to determine the progress. The Doer in me is the Inner Pilot. He Himself has to determine the progress that He makes in and through me.</p>  </div>
