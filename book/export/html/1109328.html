<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is all a matter of our sincerity. When sincerity knocks at our door, nothing is far; but as long as we remain insincere, everything is very far. When we sincerely study, we pass our examination. But when we don't study sincerely, it takes us many years to pass our examination. If we have a sincere inner cry, God-realisation does not remain a far cry. But if our inner cry is not sincere, God-realisation always remains a far cry. Sincerity travels along the straight path, the sunlit path, the short path, whereas the path of insincerity is dark, full of thorns, and without beginning or end.</p>  </div>
