<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the soul's world it was all pre-recorded that these people would die together on a particular day and at a particular hour. It is like a game. Either you are playing individually or you are playing collectively. At home, for example, you may be doing juggling all by yourself or you may be playing some other game together with a few people. Here it is exactly the same. These particular souls may not be at all connected with one another; only they are destined to have the same death hour. So these souls are put in the plane together.</p>  </div>
