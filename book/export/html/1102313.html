<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The heart centre need not be an individual or even a single organisation. The Security Council, the Secretary-General and the Economic and Social Council are all realities, but you do not have to regard them as separate entities. The essence or highest qualities of each of these realities can be unified. At that time there will be a feeling of oneness, and this feeling of oneness itself is nothing short of the heart centre.</p>  </div>
