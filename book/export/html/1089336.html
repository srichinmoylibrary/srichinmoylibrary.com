<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In general, it is good and important to obey all the laws of the country in which we live, including traffic laws. If we do not obey traffic laws, then eventually either we will send someone to God or someone will send us to God. At that time, the poor medical world will not be able to show us its medicine-power.</p>
<p>Sometimes we do not know which law is important and which is not important. Such being the case, it is good to consider all the laws important unless some laws are obviously ridiculous and stupid.</p>  </div>
