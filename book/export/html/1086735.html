<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dearest Nicole, I have not only seen God personally but I shall make you see God when God wants me to show Him to you. There is something called God's Hour. I can show you God only when God's Hour strikes in your life. But in the meantime you can hasten God's Hour by praying and meditating every day most devotedly and soulfully. Try! You will certainly see God as I see God. Needless to say, I shall always help you with my heart's deepest concern and blessingful love.</p>  </div>
