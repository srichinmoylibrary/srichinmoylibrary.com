<p>When I was warming up before the three-mile race in Seattle, somebody came up to me and stood right in front of me. He looked at me and said, "Can't you recognise me?"</p>
<p>Do I know these runners? Then I remembered him. He had lost much weight. I said, "Frank."</p>
<p>He said, "Yes, yes, it is Frank Bozanich."</p>
<p>I said, "I saw you when you came to our place with Don Ritchie."</p>
<p>He was talking and talking about the different runners. He spoke about so many runners, but what do I know about runners? He was telling me that today he was going to run in our three mile race, the next day he was going to run forty miles and the next day one hundred miles. I thought he would win a prize in our race, but he didn't get any place.</p>
<p>At the end of the race, Frank was waiting for me, and again he started talking. I went and sat in my chair. He followed me. Our conversation never ended.Then, when I was about to give the prizes, whom do I see? Somebody has to come and shake hands with me. That was the final time. He said he had to leave.</p>
