<p>After we went through security and immigration, there was a long line of passengers boarding the plane. I said, "Let me just relax and be the last person."</p>
<p>After everybody else had entered the plane, I was about to give my boarding pass to the lady when, O God, I see that fat man running towards me. He was the one who tells them when to close the gate after everybody has boarded the plane.</p>
<p>When he saw me, he said, "Can you give me a picture?" Luckily, I had a picture of my lifting the man who weighed 317 pounds, so I gave it to him.</p>
<p>I was the last person to enter the plane, but he was delaying me. He said, "Now tell me, are you a vegetarian? I have been a vegetarian for five years."</p>
<p>I said, "I have been a vegetarian for 45 years."</p>
<p>Then the lady collecting the boarding passes said to me, "Can you lift him?"</p>
<p>The fat man told her, "Easily, easily. I am not 317 pounds."</p>
<p>Then she asked the fat man if he could lift me.</p>
<p>He said, "Not yet! I have to be a vegetarian for another 40 years. Then easily I will be able to lift him."</p>
