<p>As you know, I came to America in April 1964. Around September or October of that year, a very good friend of mine, an excellent well-wisher, was extremely anxious to help me. His name was John Kelly. His way of helping me was to get me a degree from the New School. He said to me, “Nobody will appreciate you, nobody will acknowledge you unless you get a degree from the New School. In the New School you can specialise in any subject, even giving lectures. I shall meet with the expenses for your course, so that you can get a degree.”</p>
<p>For a few days I could not comply with his request, then finally I agreed. He took me to the New School on the day of registration. A middle-aged woman was sitting at the desk and there was a long queue. There were 40 people ahead of me. I stood there in the queue for about 10 or 15 minutes. Then I lost all my patience. I said, “God has given me His degree. I do not need any earthly degree. It is too much, too much!”</p>
<p>My friend John Kelly felt sincerely sorry for me. I said, “I am not going to get a degree. I do not need it.” This friend of mine used to work in the fire department. His heart was very big, vaster than the vastest. Afterwards he went to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and spent five or six years. Now he has passed away.</p>  </div>
