<p>Netaji's oneness with the hardships his soldiers endured, in addition to his countless other responsibilities, served to permanently emblazon the cause of Mother India's freedom upon their lives. One of his soldiers later recounted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The I.N.A. soldiers travelled and marched mainly on foot. They traversed the whole distance of 1100 miles separating Singapore from the Imphal front on foot only. Subhas Babu himself walked for miles on end. Such was the Supreme Commander of the I.N.A."</p>
