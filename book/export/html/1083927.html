<p>On the strength of my inseparable oneness with the souls of my students all the world over, I ventured to write this book for their fastest spiritual progress.</p>
<p>If anybody takes these heart-rending and soul-stirring messages seriously and devotedly, and works on them cheerfully, bravely and unreservedly, they definitely will before long become supremely chosen hero-warrior-children of our Lord Absolute Beloved Supreme to fight against the age-old ignorance-night and establish His full manifestation on earth.</p>
