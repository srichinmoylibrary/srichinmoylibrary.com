<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can spread your love to people provided you can see all the time your Beloved inside them. Your Beloved is the Supreme. If you see the Supreme inside them, then you will do everything for them. If you see beauty inside something, then you will touch it. If you don’t see beauty, if you see darkness and ugliness, you won’t touch it. So if you see God’s Presence inside humanity, then only will you love humanity. You have to see something divine: then only will you love. If you can see the Beloved Supreme inside each and every human being, then automatically you will have love and respect for humanity.</p>
<p>It is like a flower. You care for a flower because the flower has fragrance and beauty. But if there is no beauty, no fragrance, then you don’t like the flower. Similarly, God is there inside human beings. God is the fragrance and beauty. So if you like the fragrance and beauty, then naturally you will like the flower, humanity.</p>
<p>God the Love is inside everything that we see. If we love God, and we do love Him because He is all Love, then whatever He has created, we also love. He is bound to be in His creation just because He is everywhere, just because He is omnipresent. So if you can love God the Love, then automatically you increase your love for everything. God the Love embraces everything and is inside everything. So if you care for the Source, the Creator, then automatically you care for the creation.</p>  </div>
