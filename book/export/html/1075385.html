<p>Lord, is there anything forbidden<br /> In Your creation?<br /> "Yes, My son,<br /> Forgiveness is forbidden."</p>
<p>Lord, how strange.<br /> Why is forgiveness forbidden?<br /> "Because forgiveness is not valued."<br /> Lord, why is it not valued?<br /> "Because the world is ignorant."<br /> Lord, why is the world ignorant?<br /> "Because the world wanted ignorance."<br /> Lord, why did the world want ignorance?<br /> "Because Satan wanted to sell it<br /> And was successful in selling it."<br /> Lord, who is Satan?<br /> "Ah, Satan!<br /> Son, don't you know<br /> Who Satan is?<br /> He is just a clever fool,<br /> An impossible friend of Mine."</p>
