<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can instil a spiritual feeling in the work that you do if you keep in mind that you are always working for one body and one soul. You are not working just to please your boss. You must please your boss without fail, but the ultimate goal is to please the soul of the United Nations. For that, every day you should try to increase your own aspiration; and your own aspiration will automatically convey its strength to the people you work for.</p>  </div>
