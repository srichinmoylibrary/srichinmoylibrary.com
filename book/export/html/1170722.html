<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I give the soul what it needs and wants from me. Sometimes a soul will come to me for consolation because the body, vital, mind and heart are not listening to it. Sometimes it will come for peace because in the body, vital and mind there is no peace. Each soul comes for its own reason. There are many, many souls that come to me from people who are not my students. In some way these souls have established an access to my soul, and in the inner world these souls know who I am.</p>  </div>
