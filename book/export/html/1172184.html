<p>I had ten or twelve books. I was reading them, but since they were so thick, I said, "Let me tear out the pages that I want."</p>
<p>Any place that was important, I ticked off, and then I tore out the pages that I had marked. The man who was sitting beside me asked, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>I said, "I have to go to America, so I do not wish to carry all these books. They are so heavy."</p>
<p>These were Chinese proverbs, a book of wisdom, a book of friendship and others. From each book I got perhaps four or five pages.</p>
<p>The man sitting next to me asked, "Can I take these books that you have discarded?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, by all means take them."</p>
<p>So the man took the books, while I kept only a few pages from each one.</p>  </div>
