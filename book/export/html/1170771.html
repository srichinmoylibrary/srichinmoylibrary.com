<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are really singing soulfully, at that time you are in tune with your own deeper reality. When you are in tune with your own highest reality, nothing can affect you because you are divinely enamoured of your own voice; you are enjoying its fragrance and beauty. At that time, even if the person right beside you is singing incorrectly, it will not affect you.</p>
<p>But if you are in a normal consciousness, you will definitely be affected if somebody is off key. So just make your consciousness and aspiration infinitely higher and deeper. Then you will not suffer from others' incapacity or incompetence. That is the secret and sacred way to rise above the poor capacities of the other deplorable singers.</p>  </div>
