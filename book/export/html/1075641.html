<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each time we come back into the field of manifestation and enter into the world, it is like going into a battle. Here the spiritual seeker, the divine soldier, must fight against fear, doubt, anxiety, worry, limitation, bondage and his worst enemy, death. He is constantly fighting against ignorance, and death is the child of ignorance. He fights and then he either loses the battle and dies, or he conquers all these imperfections and negative forces and goes back to God victorious.</p>  </div>
