<p>The next day before I went running, I left a fifty-pence coin and two ten-pence coins in my room to see if the chambermaid was honest. I did this deliberately to test her. When I came back from running, I saw that the fifty-pence coin was gone, but the two ten-pence coins were left. So deliberately I did it and deliberately I got a slap.</p>
