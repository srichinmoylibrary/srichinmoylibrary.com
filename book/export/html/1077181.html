<p>Death precedes birth, birth precedes death. Death is an undeniable fact. Death is also a mystery. The more we try to understand it with our human capacities, the more this mystery baffles us. To the weary souls who have fought sleeplessly against death, when finally it arrives it comes as a supreme relief. Once, in an interview with Albert Einstein, I. B. Cohen commented that “Death is both a fact and a mystery,” to which Einstein added, <em>“and a relief.”</em></p>  </div>
