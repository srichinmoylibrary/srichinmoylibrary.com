<p><em>On the Master’s first visit to Puerto Rico on July 20, 1966, he answered, at great length and in considerable detail, a number of questions on karma, reincarnation, occultism, the Guru-disciple relationship, illness, death, etc. About 50 pages of this material, in manuscript form, were removed and used in a group of booklets published around 1974, including “Death and Reincarnation,” “The Inner Worlds”, etc.</em></p>
<p><em>In compiling this book, we found that in several cases, we were left with the original question itself, plus a few disconnected, disjointed and unmarked paragraphs of unused material. As we have been unsuccessful in tracing the published material, i.e. the specific answers which originally belonged to these questions, we have had to use whatever material we have, as it is. The asterisks indicate large portions of the answers cut out.</em></p>
<p><em>On a higher level, though, everything that is said by the Master has a universal Truth and Beauty, quite apart from the context in which it is placed. So in whatever publication his teachings appear, and whether his answers appear as originally spoken, or not, his Light and Power as such, fulfil an eternal need in the searching life of the eternally aspiring seeker.</em></p>
<p><em>Week of July 20, 1966 Remainder of material referred to.</em></p>  </div>
