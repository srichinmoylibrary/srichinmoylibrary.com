<p>Our Beloved Lord Supreme has a special message for you today. He will grant you and your mind, peace. From today you will have peace of mind.</p>
<p>Our Beloved Supreme has a special message for him. Today, our Beloved Supreme will grant him and his heart love. His heart will be inundated with love.</p>
<p>Our Beloved Supreme has a special message for me. He will grant me and my life a continuous flow of assurance: that I am of Him and I am for Him.</p>
<p>Do you have any special message for our Beloved Supreme? Does he have any special message for our Beloved Supreme? Do I have any special message for our Beloved Supreme?</p>
<p>Do you have any special message for the Supreme? Your silence tells me that you do not have any special message for the Supreme, but I wish to tell you that you do have a special message. You means your soul; your soul is now speaking through me. The message that your soul, the real in you, has for the Supreme is this: “From now on, you will sail in His Boat cheerfully and unreservedly.”</p>
<p>Does he have a special message for the Supreme today? His silence indicates that he has no special message for the Supreme today, but I wish to tell him that he does have a special message although he is not aware of it. His soul, which is the real in him, has a special message for the Supreme, and this message of his soul I am executing through his outer mind. The special message that he and his soul have for the Supreme is this: “From now on he will become consciously, soulfully and unconditionally a pure and sure instrument of the Beloved Supreme.” This is his promise to our Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Do I have a special message for the Supreme? I do have a special message for the Supreme; I am fully aware of my own special message: “I want to live only for Him. When death is necessary, I want to die only for Him. But I know in the inmost recesses of my heart that my Lord is Infinity’s Life, Immortality’s Life, Eternity’s Life. If I fulfil Him in His own way, then I will enter into the infinite, eternal, immortal Life. Then there can be no death for me, no death in my sight.” This is the special message that I want to offer to my Beloved Supreme: that I live only for Him and I shall die only for Him.</p>
<p>Each special message is the harbinger of the new dawn, a new revelation, a new fulfilment. Each special message is nothing short of a soulful and fruitful message. Each message begins a new life of self-recovery from the ignorance-world. Each new message is a self-discovery in the world of self-awareness. Each new message is a process of self-offering which eventually excels and transcends our highest imagination; each new message is our transformation into God’s very image.</p>
<p>We are pleased with God when God offers us a special message. In God’s case, He is not only pleased with us when we offer Him a special message, but also He is proud of us for He feels that our message is not only a message but also a promise. It is not only a promise but also the harbinger of a new dawn. It is not only the harbinger of a new dawn but also an all-fulfilling satisfaction.</p>
