<p>The Muslim leader, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, spoke about Gandhi-ji in his own characteristic way. To quote him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To see the Hindu leader, Gandhi, is a difficult task. To understand him is an infinitely more difficult task. Whenever he is unable to answer our queries satisfactorily, he advises us to dive within and get the message from our inner existence. When there are very awkward questions to be answered, he often takes refuge in a pencilled message, saying, 'This is my day of silence.' I say, to hell with his inner light! Why can't he be honest and admit he has made a mistake or that he does not know the answer?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, Mr. Jinnah's heart was made of steel and not of marshmallow!</p>
<p>On the other hand, Subhas Chandra was able to come to an agreement with Jinnah in 1939 which allowed Hindus and Muslims to live and work together. It was known as the Bose-League Pact.</p>  </div>
