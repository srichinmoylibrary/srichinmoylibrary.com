<p>Then I bought something for A. The old lady in the store was very greedy! She quoted a price and wrote it down. Then I wrote down what I wanted to pay, and she agreed to it. I opened my wallet in front of her, and she started pointing to a large bill that she wanted me to give her. Something within me said not to give her so much, so I gave her some smaller bills. She was grumbling. When she wanted me to give her more, I said, "No, no, no!" Finally she agreed to take what I offered.</p>
<p>Chidananda was watching, and he was quite amused. He saw his Guru's bargaining capacity with the old lady.</p>
