<p>Smriti's birthday. She made an artwork tapestry for the Mother which she showed to Nolini-da and Amrita-da. Both Nolini-da and Amrita-da deeply appreciated it, but she told them: "It has not come out well. There are mistakes. You two know nothing about embroidery, but Mother knows. She will easily find the mistakes."</p>
<p>Amrita-da said: "True, we do not know anything about embroidery, but we know everything about you. We judge your embroidery according to our affection for you."</p>
<p>Nolini-da gave Smriti a broad smile.</p>  </div>
