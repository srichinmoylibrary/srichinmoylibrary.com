<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible. Everything is divinely or undivinely contagious. Not only does the sadness or depression of others affect us, but their happiness also can easily enter into us. It is not only possible; it is inevitable. If you stay with a bad person, his badness is contagious. If you stay with a good person, his goodness is also contagious. Why do birds of a feather flock together? Because consciously they help each other. Your husband does not follow the spiritual life, but your very presence will give him joy in a very small measure. If you are happy, then eventually he also can become happy. But if he tries and cries, then he will have happiness sooner.</p>
<p>Sometimes, some of you come here feeling very unhappy. But after you mix with your spiritual brothers and sisters and meditate with me in your spiritual home, then you become happy. We try to create a spiritual atmosphere, and from that atmosphere you get happiness. You didn't have happiness, but some individuals had it. By mixing with them, you have caught their happiness, like a contagious disease.</p>  </div>
