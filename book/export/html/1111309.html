<p>When I was running early in the morning, a little after five o'clock, I saw a fat, black Con Edison man working near C.'s house. I heard someone call out, "Guru?" absolutely the same way the disciples call my name. Then I saw it was the Con Edison worker.</p>
<p>What is a Con Edison man doing calling me like that?</p>
<p>Who is my disciple in Con Edison?</p>
