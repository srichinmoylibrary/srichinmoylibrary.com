<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. When one dreams, if at that time the consciousness is low and unaspiring, then it affects the seeker in us. This kind of dream is detrimental to our inner life. If we have this kind of dream, the best thing is to meditate more sincerely, more devotedly, more soulfully on the following day. In this way we can prevent these undivine dreams from entering into us, and stop their attack. Low types of dreams especially do affect our inner sky. They cloud our mental sky and ruin our aspiration or dynamic vital, and even try to destroy our physical health.</p>  </div>
