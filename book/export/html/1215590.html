<p>God came to me for something,<br /> But I was totally unprepared.<br /> Look at the fool in me!<br /> Man came to me.<br /> I asked him what he wanted.<br /> Needless to say,<br /> I was ready to give him everything<br /> for the asking.<br /> But he said he did not know<br /> Why he came to me.<br /> Look at the fool in man!</p>
