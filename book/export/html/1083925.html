<p>Who is it who is reading this book?<br /> Is it these hands which turn the pages?<br /> Is it these eyes that follow the printed words?<br /> Is it this mind that tries to understand their meaning?<br /> Is it even this heart which feels joy and inspiration?<br /> No, the one who is really reading this book is God.</p>
