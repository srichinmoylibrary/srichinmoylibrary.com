    <title>&lt;em&gt;Mr. Jim Knight:&lt;/em&gt; One question has interested me. Everybody in all religions tries to relate himself to God and I wonder, Sri Chinmoy, if you could give us a short explanation of what Yoga says of God. What is God and what is the relationship between God and man?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God and man â€¦, this is the eternal question and the eternal answer. God is the living Breath and that living Breath is in man. Man has a goal and the name of that goal is God. In God is man's satisfaction, achievement and fulfilment. Through man is God's Satisfaction, Achievement and Fulfilment. Man needs God to realise his true Self. God needs man to manifest Himself on earth.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Jim Knight:</em> Are you saying that God and man are one and the same?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. God and man are one and the same. God is man yet to be fulfilled in His Infinity and man is God but he has yet to realise it.</p>
<p>I have to grow and God has to flow. I grow as a human being into His highest Consciousness and God flows into me and through me with His Infinite Compassion.</p>  </div>
