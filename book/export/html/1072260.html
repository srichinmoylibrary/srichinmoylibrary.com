<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It takes me practically 50 minutes — sometimes even an hour — just to warm up by doing general stretching exercises. I was an athlete, so I know quite a few stretching exercises. Then, after the stretching, I do 200 push-ups. Then I use some of my exercise machines. All these things I do almost every day. It takes me 3 ½ hours altogether. But I practise for 2 hours, and then I take a few minutes’ rest before continuing.</p>
<p>Once every ten days I don’t do everything. I do four or five items fewer. Otherwise, almost every day I do all the exercises regularly, without fail. So this is my schedule. And at our tennis court I also have three or four exercise machines that I use.</p>  </div>
