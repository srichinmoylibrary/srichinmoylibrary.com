<p>I went into an Indian store to buy a few things for the children of the London Centre. The lady quoted prices in American dollars. I was buying scarves, saris and all kinds of things.</p>
<p>O God, when I gave her the money, the lady reduced the exchange rate because she was so eager to get American dollars. When she saw American money, she gave everything to me much cheaper.</p>  </div>
