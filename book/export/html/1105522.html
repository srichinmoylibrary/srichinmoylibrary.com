<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can lose your existence in me in total surrender only by feeling that I am your most illumined part. I am part and parcel of you â€” you and I are one. Now you have to know that one part of you is illumined, most illumined, and you are trying to grow into that part. You are still unillumined. One part of us is transformed and the other part is not transformed. So the part that is not transformed has to feel its oneness with the illumined part and then it will be transformed by this oneness.</p>  </div>
