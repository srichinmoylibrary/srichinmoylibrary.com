<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the individual. Some people may try to establish peace on the strength of their prayer and meditation, while others will try to establish peace on the strength of their dedicated selfless service, by working to make the world a better place. A third person may combine both â€” a life of prayer and a life of service.</p>  </div>
