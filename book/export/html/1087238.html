<p>In Korea, I bought a beautiful swan pin for Tanima. As I was paying, right behind me I saw an Indian man and woman. The man was dressed in Indian dress and the lady was wearing a sari.</p>
<p>They were speaking in Bengali, so I asked if they were Bengali, and we started talking in Bengali.</p>
<p>The man asked me, "Do you live here?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, I come from America."</p>
<p>He told me that he had been living in Korea for six years. He said he was a famous engineer.</p>
<p>Then he asked me what part of Bangladesh I came from.</p>
<p>I said, "I come from Chittagong."</p>
<p>He said, "I come from a place you do not know."</p>
<p>When he told me the name, I said, "It is a very famous place. So many great Bengali writers were born there."</p>
<p>The man did not know the names of the writers that I mentioned.</p>
<p>Then his wife said, "Please come to our house to give us the dust of your feet."</p>
<p>That is the Bengali way of saying, "Just come and eat."</p>
<p>I said, "I am here with so many people. I will not be able to come."</p>
<p>She said, "Just come for a few minutes. You are such a wise man." But the husband did not want me to come and got very mad. He and his wife started fighting. The man said, "He will come on my deathbed!"</p>
<p>I said, "I don't want you to die." Then I disappeared.</p>
