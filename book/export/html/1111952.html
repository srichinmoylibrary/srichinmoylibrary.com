<p>I feel such joy and such sorrow when I see the disciples running early in the morning on 150th Street, trying to lose weight.</p>
<p>The other day, first I saw Anupadi. I said, "Good!" Then I saw X. As soon as she saw me, she increased her speed. I said, "O God, she can run so fast!"</p>
<p>All are dying to lose weight!</p>
