<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do expect it. If we can't produce enlightened disciples, then how can we succeed? But this is not <em>my</em> mission; this is not <em>my</em> vision. I am merely an instrument of my Beloved Lord Supreme. It is His Mission and His Vision. Similarly, He will make instruments of those who are right now my students. He will grant them illumination, liberation and realisation, which He has already given to me out of His infinite Bounty. I prayed, I cried; so He granted me this boon. Similarly, if my students are sincerely trying, then at God's choice Hour, He will grant them the same boon.</p>  </div>
