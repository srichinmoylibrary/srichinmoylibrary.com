<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While travelling, you can meditate regularly if you want to. Spirituality, meditation, is as important as your life-breath. You know that if you do not breathe in, you will die. Similarly, in the spiritual world, in the soul’s world, if you don’t meditate, then you become a dead soul.</p>
<p>You can’t live on earth with yesterday’s food. Just because you ate yesterday, you can’t say that you won’t need to eat today. No. Yesterday you ate, so you are nourished; and today you have to eat again. Regularity is of paramount importance. If you are regular in everything, if you consciously meditate every day, then you will be able to make fast progress. But if there is no conscious effort, then you cannot make fast progress. So, while you are travelling, you have to make it a point to meditate regularly. Without regularity, you cannot achieve anything abiding. Before you enter into the plane, easily you can meditate for five minutes. If you have to go to the airport at a particular time, then before you leave, meditate at home for half an hour. Or if you go to the airport earlier, meditate there. Or when you enter the plane, before the other passengers come you can meditate. Where there is a will, there is a way. This is absolutely true. So please do it.</p>  </div>
