<p>My Section Head, Mr. Anil Mukherjee, used to talk to me with such affection. He always used to tell me, “Ghose, you do not belong here. Why are you here? This kind of work is not meant for you. You start preaching. I shall join you.”</p>
<p>“But I have no followers,” I said.</p>
<p>Then he was so happy when I finally left the Indian Consulate.</p>  </div>
