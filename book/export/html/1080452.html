<p>Right now the soul is a stranger to me, and the body is my friend. But when I realise the Truth, the soul becomes a real friend of mine like the body. At that time, the body does not become a stranger. The body becomes my capacity's willing slave. The body desires to please me in my own way. Before my realisation, the body is a friend, but a fairweather friend. When it satisfies its own need, it tries to help me; but when I actually need help from the body, the body does not help me. But when I realise the soul as my best friend, my only friend, then the body tries to help me in my own way.</p>  </div>
