<p>There was a very brilliant young man whose name was Saul. He was at home in the Hebrew religion. He hated the Christ and his followers. He did not believe in the divinity of Christ in the least. As a matter of fact, it was Saul who used to torture mercilessly the followers of Christ and it was also he who stoned to death the first martyr, St. Stephen.</p>
<p>One day Saul was riding a horse in the city of Damascus. He saw a very bright light all around him. He fell down from his horse. Then he heard a voice, "Saul, Saul, why do you want to persecute Me? What have I done to you?"</p>
<p>Saul asked, "Who are you?"</p>
<p>The voice replied, "I am Jesus. Do you not realise that it will be hard for you to kick against the good?"</p>
<p>Saul was deeply moved and he began trembling. He begged the Christ, "Forgive me, Lord, forgive me. Forgive all my sins. You tell me what I should do."</p>
<p>The Lord said, "Accept Me, spread My Light all over."</p>
<p>"Lord, I promise You I shall do that," said Saul.</p>
<p>From that time onwards, Saul travelled all over the world spreading the message of Christ. Very hard he worked. Very much he suffered. But nothing could stop him from bringing souls to the Christ. He was always soulfully adamant in that. He was more than ready to suffer for the Christ and to bring lost souls to the Christ.</p>
<p>When Saul was very old, he was sentenced to prison. After many years in prison, he was beheaded.</p>
<p>During his life, Saul wrote fourteen most soulful, most powerful letters to the Christians. These letters now adorn the Holy Bible. They are called Epistles. They are read every morning at early mass.</p>
<p>This is the transformation of Saul into our Saint Paul.</p>
<p><em>Spiritual commentary:</em></p>
<p>The undivine not only surrenders ultimately to the Divine, but also listens to the Divine completely and unconditionally.</p>  </div>
