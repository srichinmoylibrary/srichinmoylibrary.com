<p>I always get a great lesson<br /> From my musical capacity.<br /> It takes all my pride out of me.</p>
<p>I always get a great lesson<br /> From my ceaseless barking.<br /> It takes all my pride out of me.            But<br /> My ever-compassionate Lord,<br /> Out of His infinite Bounty,<br /> Consoles me:<br /> "My son, in your past incarnation<br /> You were a musician of the highest magnitude.<br /> Your soul does not want to eat the same fruit again.<br /> My son, this is not your last incarnation.<br /> I assure you, in your<br /> Next incarnation, without fail,<br /> You will turn over a new leaf."</p>
