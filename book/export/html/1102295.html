<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme created the soul of the United Nations the day the vision dawned in the heart of Woodrow Wilson. But the vision did not manifest itself for many years, and when it did manifest, it did not manifest properly. In one sense, you can call it a failure. But it was not actually a failure; only the vision was taken over by others. It was the flow of the same river; it was the same flow and the same force of universal peace. The soul of the United Nations became vivid to us the day President Wilson's dream manifested itself in the form of the League of Nations. The same soul is operating in and through the United Nations, but infinitely more powerfully and infinitely more convincingly.</p>
