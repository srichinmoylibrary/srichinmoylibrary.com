<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God shaves every day because He gives all importance to His cleanliness. He believes in mutual appreciation. If He appreciates His creation because the creation remains clean and pure, then He is also expected to do the same. That is to say, He has to keep Himself clean and pure. God tells us that appreciation is nothing short of our inner and outer self-expansion.</p>  </div>
