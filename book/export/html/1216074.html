<p>Lord, I tell You,<br /> If I had time enough<br /> I would definitely<br /> Help You in Your manifestation.</p>
<p>Lord, I tell you,<br /> If I had time enough<br /> I would unmistakably prove to be<br /> Your most perfect instrument.</p>
<p>Alas, time is my worst enemy.<br /> How hard I try to make friends with time<br /> So that I can use her<br /> At my sweet will.</p>
<p>Lord, just give me the time.<br /> A little more, I tell You,<br /> And I shall love You,<br /> Please You and fulfil You,<br /> Even in Your own way.<br /> Is it not an astonishing bargain?</p>
