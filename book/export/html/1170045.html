<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly God did. Not only did He go to kindergarten, but He wants to eternally remain in the kindergarten. Kindergarten is the place where at every moment God's earth-beauty and Heaven-beauty are constantly dancing before Him. Earth-beauty is dancing before Him in an ever-transcending manner. Heaven-beauty is dancing before Him in an ever-illumining manner. Therefore, God always wants to remain in His Vision's Child-Consciousness and not in mind-fossilised sound-reality.</p>  </div>
