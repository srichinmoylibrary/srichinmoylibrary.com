<p>A spiritual Master was once asked by another spiritual Master a very simple question: “Tell me, who are your good disciples?”</p>
<p>The second spiritual Master said: “My good disciples are those who are very jealous.”</p>
<p>“Your jealous disciples are your good disciples? Then who are your best disciples?”</p>
<p>“My best disciples are those persons who are most jealous.”</p>
<p>The first spiritual Master said: “I don’t understand you. How can your most devoted, your best disciples be those who have the most jealousy?”</p>
<p>The Master replied: “Look, the disciples who are the most jealous are helping me kick the bucket, helping me to withdraw from the earth scene as soon as possible in utter disgust.”</p>  </div>
