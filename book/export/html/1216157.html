<p>I died for beauty,<br /> But beauty came not.</p>
<p>I died for joy,<br /> But joy came not.</p>
<p>I died for peace,<br /> But peace came not.</p>
<p>I died for Light,<br /> Light came,<br /> Love followed,<br /> Oneness blossomed.<br /> Divinity's Reality<br /> And Reality's Divinity<br /> Are in everlasting embrace.</p>
