<p>No one walks along this road.<br /> God once tried, but He failed<br /> Because<br /> This road is<br /> Man's frustration-road: destruction.<br /> Man once walked along this road,<br /> But failed<br /> Because<br /> This road is<br /> God's perfection-road: satisfaction.<br /> Someday, perhaps man and God<br /> Will together walk along this road<br /> When<br /> Man offers to god his surrendered cry<br /> And<br /> God offers to man His unmanifested Smile.</p>

<p>When the day of my life-play dawned<br /> I blamed God,<br /> For my day was empty<br /> Of infinite Light.<br /> When the evening of my life-play ended<br /> I blamed myself,<br /> For I had not tried to ascend<br /> achievement's height<br /> and I had not transcended my reality's Goal.</p>

<p>Lord, why am I suffering so much?<br /> "You are suffering<br /> Because you are a sleeping body."<br /> Lord, why am I suffering so much?<br /> "You are suffering<br /> Because you are a demanding vital."<br /> Lord, why am I suffering so much?<br /> "You are suffering<br /> Because you are a doubting mind."<br /> Lord, why am I suffering so much?<br /> "You are suffering<br /> Because you are an unaspiring heart."<br /> Lord, why am I suffering so much?<br /> "You are suffering<br /> Because you are an unillumining soul."<br /> Lord, is there any way I can be happy?<br /> "Yes, you can.<br /> Just tell your body<br /> That its boss is your dynamic vital.<br /> Just tell your vital<br /> That its boss is your searching mind.<br /> Just tell your mind<br /> That its boss is your surrendering heart.<br /> Just tell your heart<br /> That its boss is your fulfilling soul.<br /> Just tell your soul<br /> That its boss is your<br /> Dream-transforming<br /> And<br /> Reality-immortalising God."</p>
