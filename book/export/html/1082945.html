<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible for the reasoning mind to develop sincerity. The reasoning mind need not be the deceptive or self-deluding mind. The reasoning mind can easily feel the necessity of light when it looks into the heart and sees that the heart is happy because it always receives light from the soul for its illumination, perfection and satisfaction. The reasoning mind can also be inspired to do the same. Everybody wants satisfaction; everything wants satisfaction. There is no other way to have satisfaction than by one's own constant and conscious submission to the illumining and fulfilling operation of the soul's light. If the reasoning mind can do this, then it will definitely have sincerity.</p>  </div>
