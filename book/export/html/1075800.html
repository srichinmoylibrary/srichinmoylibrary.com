<p><em>(Motilal Roy's residence. Aurobindo is in meditation in a small ill-lit room. Time: early in the morning. Suddenly there appears before him his familiar Figure of Vasudeva.)</em></p>
<p>VASUDEVA: I am glad that you have come over here as I wished. It is high time you plunged deeper into Yoga. You will feel more and more that it is I who am doing Yoga within you. Now I want that nothing may stand in your way. Hence, my chosen place for you is Pondicherry, South India. There your concentrated Tapasya will hasten the descent of a force which will facilitate the descent of a far higher Force to consummate your work.</p>
<p><em>(The Figure disappears. Enter Motilal Roy.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Pondicherry, Pondicherry.</p>
<p>MOTILAL: What do you mean?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: I am to start for Pondicherry. The sooner, the better.</p>
<p>MOTILAL: <em>(Token aback)</em> But why? Anything wrong?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Nothing at all. I have just got an <em>adesh</em> â€” a higher command to move straight to Pondicherry.</p>
<p>MOTILAL: <em>Adesh!</em> Then let me make the necessary arrangements.</p>  </div>
