<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme wants not one but two supreme qualities in order to be satisfied at every moment. These two qualities are an obedience-life and a gratitude-heart: cheerful obedience and soulful gratitude. If you are obedient, then you will realise that there is something momentous that you have to perform on earth for the Supreme; and if you are grateful, then you will feel not only that you have the capacity to please the Supreme in His own way but also that you are doing it.</p>  </div>
