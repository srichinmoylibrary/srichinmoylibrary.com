<p><em>(Sunda and Upasunda, two most beautiful Asura brothers, are at their palace.)</em></p>
<p>SUNDA: Upasunda, today, I don’t know why or how, I am in a most powerful mood to sing.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Strangely enough, Sunda, I too am deeply inspired to sing.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Wonderful, then let us both sing.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: You sing first, and then I shall sing.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Thank you, Brother.</p>
<p><em>(Sunda sings.)</em></p>

<p>What can I do?<br /> Heaven is afraid of me.<br /> What can I do?<br /> I fly beyond its glee<br /> Piercing the Blue.</p>

<p>UPASUNDA <em>(cannot resist the temptation to interrupt Sunda)</em>: Marvellous!</p>
<p><em>(Upasunda sings.)</em></p>

<p>What can I do?<br /> Earth is afraid of me.<br /> What can I do?<br /> I fell its ignorance-tree<br /> To plant the True.</p>

<p>SUNDA: Marvellous! Let me continue, Brother.</p>
<p><em>(Sunda sings.)</em></p>

<p>What can I do?<br /> Hell is afraid of me.<br /> What can I do?<br /> My compassion frees its pangs<br /> From the racking screw.</p>

<p>UPASUNDA: Marvellous! Let me complete the song.</p>
<p><em>(Upasunda sings.)</em></p>

<p>What can I do?<br /> My soul is afraid of me.<br /> What can I do?<br /> Body’s eternity<br /> I know is due.</p>

<p>SUNDA: Marvellous, marvellous! No matter who composed the song, it was undoubtedly composed for us to sing. Brother, our love for each other is invincible; our beauty, unfathomable; and our power, immeasurable.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: In us the world can see the supreme incarnations of authority and power. All we need now is the Life of immortality. We have to be immortal like Indra. That’s all.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indra! Don’t use that filthy name! He is our worst enemy. We must dethrone him. We must destroy him. We must prove to the world that he is but a speck of dust, doomed to nothingness.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Alas, he is a cosmic god. Hence he is immortal.</p>
<p>SUNDA: God, god? What kind of god is he? He has no sense of morality. His wild vital does not have even an iota of purity. He is a shameless creature. His life can never love the breath of Truth. It can only love the physical beauty of women.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: You are not an inch from the truth. But we <em>have</em> to become immortal like Indra.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indeed! Indeed!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: We must start worshipping one of the principal gods in order to get a boon which will grant us Immortality.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indeed! Indeed!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: I personally don’t care for Shiva.</p>
<p>SUNDAY Neither do I.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: I don’t care for Vishnu, either.</p>
<p>SUNDA: I also don’t care for Vishnu.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: But I love Brahma.</p>
<p>SUNDA: I, too.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Let us then pray to Brahma day in and day out. Let us practise austerities. Brahma’s transcendental Blessing will grant us Immortality.</p>
<p>SUNDA: I am sure it will.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Let us leave our palace tomorrow and go to the forest to pray to and meditate on Brahma. Let us sacrifice everything for an immortal life.</p>
<p>SUNDA: A splendid idea, indeed!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: From tomorrow on we must lead the life of true ascetics in the thick of the forest.</p>
<p>SUNDA: We must, without fail, we must.</p>  </div>
