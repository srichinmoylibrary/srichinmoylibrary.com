  <h1 class="book-heading">Our human life and our divine life</h1>
  
 
<p>Our human life is not a bitter complaint. Our human life is not a serious problem. Our human life is not a heavy burden. Our human life is not a deplorable failure.</p>
<p>Our human life is a God-inspired aspiration-journey. Our human life is a God-intoxicated dedication-road. Our human life is a God-fulfilling manifestation-song. Our human life is a God-satisfying perfection-mission.</p>
<p>Our divine life is not a mental hallucination. Our divine life is not an escape from the hard realities of the world. Our divine life is not the total negation or destruction of our earthly life.</p>
<p>Our divine life is the only true reality. Our divine life sings the song of the Infinite inside the very life-breath of the finite.</p>
<p>Our human life is Time’s possibility-seed. Our divine life is Eternity’s inevitability-tree.</p>
<p>Our human life is the flowering of our love, devotion and surrender. Our divine life is God’s supreme Victory in and through us.</p>
<p>In our human life we see man the evolving God. In our divine life we see God the manifested man. </p>
