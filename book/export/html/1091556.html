<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we touch water, what happens? We feel the consciousness of water. When we touch fire, we feel the consciousness of fire and burn ourselves. Something pure or divine can also give us its own consciousness. We know that the soul is absolutely pure, absolutely divine, but we feel that it is a tremendous task to find and enter into the soul. But we have to know that we also have a heart. Next to the soul in purity and divinity is the heart. The heart is infinitely purer than the mind or the vital or the body. So let us try to identify ourselves with that particular part of our being that will offer us purity. When we pray, when we meditate, we must try to identify with the heart, which is crying for truth, for light, for beauty. Let us identify with the heart; let us not identify with the body, vital and the mind, as we are doing now.</p>
<p>Before you do something, no matter what it is, please try to identify yourself with the heart, which has purity, which has love, which has the feeling of divine oneness. The heart will give you its own vibration, its own consciousness. If you can touch the heart with your prayer and meditation, you are bound to be freed from the body-consciousness, You will feel only the consciousness of something infinite, something eternal, something immortal, something divine.</p>  </div>
