<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You do not have to worry about the government. Let the government take care of itself and you take care of yourself. It is like this: the country is your mother, and the government is your brother. If your brother does not love your mother, that does not mean that you cannot love her. If your brother has the upper hand, he may be misusing your mother's good will, love, compassion, concern. Everything good your brother is misusing. He is misrepresenting your mother and doing everything wrong in regard to your mother. But that doesn't prevent you from loving your mother. Even if you feel that your brother is doing everything wrong with regard to your mother, that does not prevent you from doing the right thing and trying to please your mother.</p>  </div>
