<p>I went shopping with Databir today at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan. When I used to work at the Indian Consulate, every day I would go to a small post office in Bloomingdale's to mail passports for the Consulate. There was a black man who worked there, and each time he saw me he used to beg me to come to his church and listen to the sermon of his minister. He was very nice to me, but unfortunately I never went to his church.</p>
