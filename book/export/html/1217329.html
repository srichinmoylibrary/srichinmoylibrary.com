    <title>When I try to meditate, I get a feeling of oceans and water before my mind&#039;s eye. This creates fear in me, and I cannot meditate very well. How can I meditate without getting this feeling of oceans and water?</title>

<p>Please try to see the ocean as something of your own, something in your inner being. Instead of seeing the ocean with its surges and waves, please think of it as your own largest consciousness, and throw yourself into that largest and deepest consciousness. Unfortunately, your attitude towards the ocean has been wrong. There are so many seekers who try to imagine the ocean during their meditation so that they can make their consciousness as vast as the ocean. When you see this consciousness, you should feel happy and fortunate.</p>
<p>Do not focus your attention on the surface of the ocean, but please go, silently and consciously, deep into the ocean, where you will find your true reality, which is all tranquillity. Try to throw your own consciousness into the vastness of the ocean, and you will be able to meditate most powerfully and most successfully. You will be able to contact, deep within yourself, that which is nearest and dearest to your soul.</p>  </div>
