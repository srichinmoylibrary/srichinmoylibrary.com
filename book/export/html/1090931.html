<h2>Question: Sometimes when I meditate it is so beautiful, but at other times I forget how beautiful meditation is, or how good it is for me. How can I inspire myself to meditate again? It is like a road that goes into a fairyland, but sometimes I just don't find that road.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two ways. Suppose you have started to meditate but nothing is coming. Then try to think of a particular day when you had the highest meditation, and consciously go deep into that meditation. Think of the essence of that meditation — how you were thrilled, how you were jumping with delight. That is why I always tell my disciples to keep a diary. First it will be imagination, for you are not actually having that meditation. But just enter into the world of imagination and stay there for ten or fifteen minutes. While you are there, power will automatically enter into your meditation; and this power is not imagination. The work of scientists is all based on imagination. First they have inspiration, and the next step is imagination. They dwell in their imagination for months or years, and then some power or energy enters into the imagination and it bears fruit. So this is one way. The other way is to remember how many times your Master has shown you real love and unconditional concern. Immediately gratitude will flow. When tears of gratitude flow, it is like a springboard. If you shed a few tears of gratitude, immediately the springboard within you pushes you up and you dive into the most wonderful meditation. With one of these ways you are bound to succeed.</p>  </div>
