<p>When we were in the Holiday Inn in St. Louis, I wanted to call Queens but I couldn't remember if the area code was 718 or 708.</p>
<p>The operator said, "You live there and you can't remember your area code?"</p>
<p>I said, "Is it a crime if you can't remember your number?"</p>
<p>She asked me where I wanted to call and I said, "Queens". She couldn't understand my pronunciation, so I said, "It is the feminine of king."</p>
<p>So I was teaching her vocabulary and she was teaching me pronunciation.</p>
