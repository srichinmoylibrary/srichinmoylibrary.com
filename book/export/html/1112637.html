<p>As you know, I am always fond of entering into bookstores, especially if they are Christian bookstores. I am just the right person. So I went into a bookstore run by an old couple and asked the lady if she had a daily prayer book. She could not understand my pronunciation. She said, "What, what?"</p>
<p>Then I said, "Everyday prayers."</p>
<p>"Oh," she said, "You are saying 'daily prayers'. My son, you don't need a daily prayer. What you need is daily church. You must go to church every morning. Daily you must go to pray. You don't need a prayer book."</p>
<p>She looked like she was in her seventies. She wanted me to go to church and pray.</p>  </div>
