<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, God has a sound and it is called the Soundless Sound. This Soundless Sound constantly reverberates in the inmost recesses of every human heart. This Soundless Sound is precisely what God has and what He is. You don't and can't understand this Sound. Today you hear this Sound and tomorrow you see that you simply can't escape growing into its omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent Reality.</p>  </div>
