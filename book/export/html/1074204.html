<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes they will bless you or they will talk to you. They do it out of good will. When they visit you, you may not get the result until a few days later, but you will get something. When I visit you people in your dreams, you never see. Only X has given me a full description.</p>  </div>
