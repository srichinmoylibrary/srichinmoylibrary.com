<p>This morning I left my house at quarter to six in the morning to run to Flushing Meadow Park. At an intersection I was standing on the sidewalk waiting for a car to pass. But when the car came up to me, it just stopped.</p>
<p>A young man and a few girls were in the car. The young man said to me, "Good morning, Sri Chinmoy. You should always go first!"</p>
<p>Then he signalled for me to cross in front of him. I smiled at him and he smiled at me. Then I crossed the street.</p>
