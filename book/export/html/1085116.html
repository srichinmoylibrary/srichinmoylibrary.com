<p>[This part was preceded by a photograph with the following caption]</p>
<p>The magnanimity of President Gorbachev's heart shines not only in the world of aspiration, but also in the world of manifestation. The supreme Pilot of the Soviet Union not only says the right thing, but also does the right thing at the opportune time. To Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, he is a heart of consolation-assurance.</p>
<p>To quote Chancellor Kohl, "Mr. Gorbachev assured me unmistakably that the Soviet Union would respect the right of the German people to decide to live in one state."</p>  </div>
