<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the beginning, unless one is very spiritually advanced, it is really impossible for one not to have thoughts. But if you continue to meditate for a few months or a few years, then you will see that it is quite possible to enter into thoughtless meditation. For the time being you should do <em>japa.</em> You should repeat the name of your spiritual Master, if you have one, or of whomever you worship, or of God, let us say. Just repeat, "Supreme, Supreme, Supreme..." continuously. It is true that your mind, your brain, is operating when you do this repetition. But if you continue it for ten minutes most soulfully, then you will see that you are no longer the doer. This word has become spontaneous in your life. It becomes like a passing train, and you are simply riding on that train. This word that is repeating in you is not a thought at that time. It is a reality. Thought binds you, but this reality does not bind. This reality only takes you to your destined goal.</p>
<p>Start with a thought, with an idea, with a concept of Truth, with God. After fifteen minutes or half an hour the thought has played its role. Then you spontaneously go beyond thought and identify yourself with some reality. At that time the mental formation of any thought or idea ceases. Only Reality — God the Reality or whomever you have chosen as the object of your adoration — remains. And this Reality takes you, carries you to your Goal.</p>  </div>
