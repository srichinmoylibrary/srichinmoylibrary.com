<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Early in the morning, get up and look through the window. Although every day you get up and look through the same window, you will be able to find something absolutely new. You will look at the same tree in front of your house, or any object that you see every day. That very thing you will not see in the same way if you look at it early in the morning, because at night, during your sleep, many good beings come to you. Bad beings also come and attack us, but most of the time good beings visit us â€” many, many good beings. We can call them angels or anything else. In silence they visit us. We do not see them. If you are a spiritual Master, you know that they come and give us something, they inject some good qualities into us.</p>
<p>So, even when we look at the same tree or the same plant or the same house, we will have a new feeling. This new feeling is not actually coming from the object, but we have to look at something in particular. It is easier when we look at an object, but actually the feeling of newness is coming from within, because the good beings, the divine visitants, have come and helped us. You will look at the same thing you have been seeing daily, but you will get a newness-feeling from some beings that came at night to visit you and bless you.</p>  </div>
