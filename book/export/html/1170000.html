<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The quickest way to learn the language of a different country is to love the soul of that particular country. Then you have to love the heart of that country and finally you have to love the consciousness of that country. When the consciousness, heart and soul of the country are loved, immediately the outer vehicle of the country — which is language — tries to befriend the student who wants to learn it.</p>  </div>
