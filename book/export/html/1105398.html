<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible. It is a kind of exercise that we have to practise. We have taken one kind of exercise for centuries; therefore, we are now getting the result of that exercise. But if we want to take another kind of exercise, we can do that too. When we take exercise to develop our arm muscles, we do develop them. Then, if we take exercise to develop our leg muscles, we will do that too. With our will-power, our human will-power, we can create millions and millions of illumining and fulfilling thoughts. Again, with the same will-power we can stop thoughts. It is like a knife. With a knife we can stab someone or we can cut a fruit and distribute it to our friends.</p>
