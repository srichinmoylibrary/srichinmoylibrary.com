MSUN 12-17. These six questions were answered by Sri Chinmoy on 16 and 26 November 1976.</p>
<h2>Question: How can the delegates at the United Nations best convey the ideal of the United Nations to the people in their country?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The delegates can best convey the ideal of the United Nations to the people of their country by making them feel that their own country is a solid branch of the United Nations reality-tree which is destined to bear all-nourishing, all-energising fruits.</p>  </div>
