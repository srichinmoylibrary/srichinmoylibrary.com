<h2>Question: How can I become your disciple?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please come to this Centre regularly. Please feel this is your spiritual home. You have an earthly home and this is your spiritual home. Here you will get love, concern and the feeling of divine oneness. Only my request to you is to come here regularly and throw your heart and soul into our path. The Supreme in me will do the needful. I accept you wholeheartedly. You kindly come and pay your fee, which is aspiration and regularity. If you come regularly and devotedly and offer your aspiration to the Supreme, you are giving me my salary and fee.</p>  </div>
