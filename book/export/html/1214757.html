<p>New York’s untiringly dedicated Mayor Abraham Beame remarks on the former Secretary General’s adeptness in piloting the world-boat: “In stormy times, he was an island of calm in a sea of controversy. His meditative ways helped him to maintain the neutrality so necessary to sustaining the confidence of differing nations.</p>
<p>“The people of our own nation always respected his ability to mediate differences among the nations, and we always admired his desire to attain justice for all.</p>
<p>“The City, which is proud to be the home of the United Nations, will always revere the memory of the Burma-born schoolteacher who guided the world through a particularly turbulent decade in its history.”</p>  </div>
