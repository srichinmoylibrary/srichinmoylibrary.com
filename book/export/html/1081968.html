<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He makes me talk. Then He says that the disciples at least should feel that I take their suffering. Even if I have taken the suffering of some disciples and <em>told</em> them, still they don't believe. I will say, "I have taken away your headache or your stomachache or your ulcer or your cancer or your heart attack," and they say, "Thank you, thank you." But then they go home and say, "He suffers every day from headaches and colds and all that. He cannot cure himself, and he says he is taking away my serious, serious disease. He does not have the capacity even to stop sneezing and coughing, and he says he has the capacity to take our disease."</p>
<p>The Supreme says we are all one, and then he says, "Prove it." When Sri Ramakrishna could not eat because of cancer in his throat, his consort and others begged him to ask Kali to cure him. He did not do it. Finally, he said to Kali, "I am suffering from cancer, and my disciples are telling me that I have to cure it. I say, 'How can I ask You?' But they insist." Kali said, "They are all your children. Tell them that you don't have to eat. While they are eating, it is you who are eating in and through them. Through hundreds of mouths you are eating, so you don't have to eat your own food." Sometimes I really suffer. I suffer because I love you people. But if I become indifferent, then I can get rid of anything.</p>  </div>
