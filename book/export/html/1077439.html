<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Many, many people have had this experience from my transcendental picture. It is my subtle body that she is seeing. If my inner beings want to bring my subtle body forward, then this subtle body appears absolutely tangible. When I become one with the transcendental Consciousness, you have to know that that Consciousness can take the smallest form and, at the same time, a form larger than the largest.</p>  </div>
