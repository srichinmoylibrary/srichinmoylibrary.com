<p>I wonder if some people are clever like me. When they see I am coming, they go fast. That's what I do when I see some people. I don't want them to see that I am running so slowly, so when I come near them — about thirty metres away — I increase my speed. I keep this speed for about twenty metres after I pass them. Then, when I think they are out of sight, I slow down.</p>
