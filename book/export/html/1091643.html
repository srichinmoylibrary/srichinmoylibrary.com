<p>A spiritual man arrived at his destination and started to come out of a taxi. He already had given his money to the driver while he was inside. As he was getting out of the taxi, one of his shoes somehow got stuck in the door of the taxi. Then what happened? The taxi driver drove away taking the man's shoe with him. At this, the man calmly took off his other shoe and left it on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>His friend said, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>The spiritual man answered, "What am I doing? You fool, do you not know that in this world there are so many poor people. If a poor person finds only the shoe that was stuck in the taxi, how will he be able to use it? But if he finds both my shoes, he will be so happy. The person will thank God that he now has a pair of shoes. In my case, I will be able to buy new shoes.</p>
<p>"When you want to help people, never hold back. Always be a wholehearted giver."</p>  </div>
