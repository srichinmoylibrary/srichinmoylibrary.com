<p>She used to come to the Master and, at the same time, she used to go regularly to church. There she always had to make confession to the priest that she had spoken to this Indian teacher. Instead of showing compassion, the priest used to scold her and tell her that this was the worst possible sin.</p>
<p>She had lost her husband many years ago, and the Indian teacher used to bring messages to her from her deceased husband. Sometimes the messages were so accurate that she was astonished. Some of her relatives, who were also priests in another part of the world, wanted her to offer her house to the priests. She asked the Indian teacher whether her husband wished her to give it to the priests or to sell it. The Indian teacher said that the husband’s wish was for her to sell it. She said to the teacher, “If it is my husband’s wish to sell it, then you will have to be responsible. You have to tell when it will be sold.”</p>
<p>The teacher said, “In three months’ time it will be sold, provided you sell at a particular price.”</p>
<p>She said, “Oh no, that price is too low. I can’t sell it.”</p>
<p>The teacher said, “This is the price that I got from your husband. Your husband told me to quote this price.”</p>
<p>She said, “Impossible! You are telling a lie.” Then the teacher said, “All right, I am telling a lie. In that case, you should give away the house to the priests.”</p>
<p>She said, “Oh no, that I can’t do. I need money. ”</p>
<p>“You need money. Who does not need money? But your husband wants you to have the amount that I told you.”</p>
<p>Finally she agreed. Then the teacher said, “If you personally go to your house in two weeks’ time, then you will be able to sell it in three months’ time.”</p>
<p>She said, “If I will sell the place in three months’ time, why do I have to go in two weeks’ time?”</p>
<p>The teacher said, “It will be necessary.”</p>
<p>But she didn’t listen to the teacher. She began showing her house to customers only three weeks before the end of the three-month period. She did not sell the house. Then she insulted the teacher because her house was not sold. Finally she left him.</p>  </div>
