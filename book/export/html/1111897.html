  <h1 class="book-heading">Singing my songs</h1>
  
 
<p>During my solo marathon in Flushing Meadow Park, each hundred metres I would hear a different one of my songs.</p>
<p>At one point X was singing, "I am a member of the New York Road Runners Club." Fred Lebow's name was there in the song.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Canadians were singing my songs in French. At one point they were singing "O Good Canada's Oneness-Heart." Then my America songs I heard. One group was singing songs from "Transcendence-Perfection." One group only sang "Phule phule." It went on and on. Their repertoire was very limited.</p>
<p>Some groups had songbooks and were singing the old songs that we never sing nowadays. O God, some songs I knew were mine, but they were so unfamiliar to me. Some of them were songs I had composed eight or ten years ago for the first group of non-singers, "Eternity's Patience-Pride." I wrote those songs for the absolute beginners. The people singing them as I ran had not even been my disciples at that time. They were singing songs like "Milbena bhai milbena." When I heard that song, I couldn't believe that someone was singing it after so many years.</p>
