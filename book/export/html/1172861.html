<p>One or two years ago we received from Scotland a rose called the Sri Chinmoy rose. Now from Holland we have got a tulip called the Sri Chinmoy tulip.</p>
<p>I have very, very, very special love, affection and fondness for tulips. The very word “tulip” gives me such joy! Immediate joy I get, immediate joy, when I hear the word. And I have seen where they grow tulips by the millions.</p>
<p>Unmukta gave me a variety of tulips to choose from, and I selected this particular one to have my name.</p>
