<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spiritual power will go like a lion or an elephant, but it will never break anything. But when occult power goes, before it repairs something it may break that thing. Occult power will see something which is wrong and will go to repair it, but it may break it while repairing it. But spiritual power will take its time; it will not break anything at all. It will always be successful. Occult power sometimes may be successful, but sometimes it may not be successful.</p>  </div>
