  <h1 class="book-heading">Kennedy - Nehru</h1>
  
 

<p>Nehru's entrance into the world:<br /> November 14, 1889<br /> Kennedy's departure from the world:<br /> November 22, 1963</p>
<p>Slowly, steadily, unerringly, Nehru fought.<br /> He won the fight.<br /> Youthfully, speedily, dynamically, Kennedy ran.<br /> He won the race.</p>
<p>Kennedy-Nehru, Nehru-Kennedy:<br /> Two are the hearts<br /> That ached to fling wide<br /> The windows of slumbering faith<br /> In the house of humanity.</p>
<p>God's Fragrance of Peace,<br /> God's Bliss of Freedom,<br /> In measureless measure<br /> They knew how to inhale,<br /> They knew.</p>
<p>Never were they parched<br /> In the deserts of false hopes.<br /> Desires they had for the world;<br /> God slaked their thirst<br /> In His own mystic way.</p>
<p>Nehru-Kennedy, Kennedy-Nehru:<br /> They are one, indivisible.<br /> They are one, invincible.<br /> They are one, a tornado<br /> Of God's stupendous Smile<br /> Toppling the towers of sorrow,<br /> Fear and defeat.</p>
