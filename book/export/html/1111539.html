<p>In the five-mile race today I couldn't imagine what happened to Adrian from Australia. He started walking after one mile. Then after running for 150 metres, again he started walking. As I was watching him, I said to myself, "He has got my job." He is such an excellent runner, but he was walking after only one mile.</p>
