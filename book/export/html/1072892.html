<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Buddha did not use the term “soul,” but he did say that there is an inner being, an inner existence. He said that it is our inner existence which is eventually freed from the fetters of ignorance. We are all in ignorance, but there is an inner subtle existence which he never called “the soul.” He used the term “inner being,” or “inner existence,” which cannot be affected by disease, decay or death. This was his term.</p>  </div>
