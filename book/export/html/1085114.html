<p>[This part was preceded by a photograph with the following caption]</p>
<p>Prime Minister Thatcher of Great Britain describes President Gorbachev as the first Soviet leader to speak openly and freely about almost any subject. In a gesture of confidence rarely seen in the political world, she says, "If he told me he was going to do something, I would implicitly accept his word."</p>
<p>When Prime Minister Thatcher returned to Great Britain from her trip to Russia in the Spring of 1987, she stated, "This has been the most fascinating and invigorating visit I have ever made abroad as Prime Minister." She called President Gorbachev "a man of destiny."</p>  </div>
