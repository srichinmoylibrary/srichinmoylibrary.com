<p>We have to be faithful both in the inner world and in the outer world. When we are faithful to our inner cause, to our inner life, to our life of aspiration, or even when we are faithful to our outer activities, we feel that our divinity is blossoming petal by petal. When we go deep within we see that there is only one person who is constantly and eternally faithful to us, and that is God. From time immemorial He has been faithful to us, faithful to His creation. Unfortunately, His creation is not faithful to Him.</p>
<p>If we follow the spiritual life, naturally we will want to go to the Source, which is God. We will want to be as divine and great as the Source. If our ultimate aim is to become divine or to become God Himself, then we have to be faithful to the world that we are living in. How do we have to be faithful? We have to be faithful to attend at every moment to what we say and what we think. When a thought comes to us early in the morning, if it is a divine thought, then we have to feel that it is a blessing that has entered into us. This blessing we will have to offer to the world around us. If we can faithfully and silently carry this divine thought to the outer world, and offer it to the outer world, then we are fulfilling the God inside us.</p>
<p>If we are following the path of spirituality, we also have to be absolutely faithful to our own inner life. We have to have a path of our own and be one hundred percent faithful to our path. If we have a spiritual Master, we have to be one hundred percent faithful to him. We have to be faithful to our inner life, to the path and to the Master we follow. But a day will come when we will realise that we can be faithful to the inner discipline, the path and the Master, only when we are faithful to ourselves.</p>
<p>When we perform any action, we have to feel in this action the life of God, the hands of God. When we are eating we have to feel that the food is God. If we can see and feel God in everything and feel our constant oneness with God, then automatically we will be faithful to ourselves; and when we are faithful to ourselves, at that time we are bound to get what we are aspiring for.</p>  </div>
