<p>My Lord,<br /> When I was young,<br /> You told me that I was too young<br /> To accept the spiritual life.<br /> And now that I am old, too old,<br /> You are telling me<br /> That I am not meant<br /> For the spiritual life.<br /> Why did You not tell me this<br /> When I was still an adult<br /> With my whole life ahead of me?<br /> "My child,<br /> Allow Me to explain.<br /> You were meant<br /> For the spiritual life,<br /> But you were not ready,<br /> You are not ready<br /> And you will never be ready<br /> For the spiritual life<br /> Until you feel that the spiritual life<br /> Is the only life,<br /> And there is no other life for you."</p>
