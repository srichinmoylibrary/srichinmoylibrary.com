<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That glow is the Consciousness of the Divine Mother, the Universal Mother. White signifies purity and also the conscious Light of the Universal Mother. The Universal Mother is operating in and through me. What you see is the Consciousness-Light of the Universal Mother, who is inside me and who is leading and guiding our spiritual movement. So, out of His infinite Bounty, the Lord showed you what you can achieve. It was just an insignificant, tiny, infinitesimal amount of Light which He showed you. It came to you from the third eye in the form of Power. Others have also seen this Light. Quite a few disciples here have seen it. Please do not feel that this Light is temptation. No, far from it. The Lord doesn't tempt us. He only encourages us. I assure you, when you are fully prepared, He will give Light to you in infinite measure.</p>  </div>
