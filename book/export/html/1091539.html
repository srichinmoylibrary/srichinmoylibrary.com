  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: How do you bring light into the subconscious?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You should aspire for the light that will transform your nature. When you bring down light, it will automatically enter into the subconscious. Only by bringing light into your entire system can you illumine your inner darkness. By stirring up the mud and saying that you are this and you did that, you are only making yourself dirtier. No matter how many hours I dwell in a dark room, the dark room will not be changed into an illumined room. But if, just for a second, I can enter into an illumined room, then I may be able to bring light into the dark room and illumine it. When you meditate, you drink the light which permeates the atmosphere. This light will be able to illumine and purify the dark and impure things that you have inside you.</p>  </div>
