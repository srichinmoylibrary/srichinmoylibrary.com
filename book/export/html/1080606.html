<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please feel my most sincere gratitude. It is most kind of you.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> How can you think that? It has to be the other way. You are the boundless energy and stillness all at the same time. How can you say that? I am the drop.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, you are the ocean and I am the drop. Would it be possible for my students to have one or two pictures with you?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Of course!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Or is it forbidden by the secretary? They say that you do not want any photographers to come and take pictures.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Oh, of course you can! Am I allowed to drink alcohol? Am I?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can do anything you like.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I did not expect that.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My oneness with you will never permit me to interfere with you in this way.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> But maybe it will be a bad influence on your students.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That may be, but nothing will bother me.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I am ashamed when I have to have a drink. I love your face.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I love your soul and I love your entire existence on earth and in Heaven. You love my face. I love your soul, heart, mind, vital and body. I love your oneness with Mother-Earth and your oneness with Father-Heaven.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> The flowers you brought me must be put in water. They are so beautiful. How I wish my wife were here! She would have been so moved. She died a few months ago. She was the most beautiful woman in the world, unique.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How old was she?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Forty-one. But she looked much younger and she was much younger inside. She was really a creature of God. I have this. I want to give it to you. It is an scarf I bought in India. I like it very much. I want you to have it. It is blue. <em>(First Sri Chinmoy tied the scarf around his neck in what he later described as a "funny, crazy way." Leonard Bernstein did not say anything, but untied and rearranged the scarf, and then embraced Sri Chinmoy.)</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Blue is spirituality. This colour blue represents spirituality and Infinity.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Would you wear this?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly!</p>  </div>
