  <h1 class="book-heading">A good thought</h1>
  
 
<p>A good thought is a lightning inspiration. A good thought is a deepening aspiration. A good thought is an increasing satisfaction. A good thought is another name for a new creation.</p>
<p>A good thought of mine is God's perfect Satisfaction.</p>
<p>A good thought encourages God to have more faith in me, convinces mankind to have more faith in me, and strengthens me to have more faith in myself.</p>
<p>A good thought is the sunlit path to God-realisation.</p>  </div>
