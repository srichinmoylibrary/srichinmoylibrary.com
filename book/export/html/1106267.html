<p>Sri Chinmoy is a very spiritual man. I feel the reason Sri Chinmoy lifted this weight is because of his love of God and belief that through God all things are possible. This man has done the impossible because of faith, wisdom and love of God. Through God we can do anything and He allows us to reach beyond human endeavours. We may feel we can’t go on, but because we find inner faith, we do. The body says “stop,” but the spirit cries “never.” In the warrior’s code there is no stopping.</p>
<p>Give Sri Chinmoy my love. May God continue to shower him with wisdom and faith. I feel God has given Sri Chinmoy strength so many people can realise that God is working through him. God bless him!</p>
