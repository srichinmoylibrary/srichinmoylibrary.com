<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to have a free access to the higher worlds, you have to cry inwardly. Your mind has to be focused twenty-four hours a day on the Supreme. You should cherish the feeling that the Supreme is all for you and He is all for everyone. Always feel that you can keep Him as your very own. Don't try to take anybody else; only catch the person who is eager to be caught, and that is the Supreme.</p>  </div>
