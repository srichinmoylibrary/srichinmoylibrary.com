<p>I have loved humanity. Humanity says, "No longer are you a stranger to me."</p>
<p>I have loved Infinity, Infinity says, "No longer are you caught by space."</p>
<p>I have loved Eternity. Eternity says, "No longer will you be caught by time."</p>
<p>I have loved Immortality. Immortality says, "No longer will death be able to bind you."</p>
<p>At long last I have loved God. God says, "My child, from now on, you have bound Me in your divine embrace. You have bound Immortality, Infinity, Eternity and Humanity."</p>  </div>
