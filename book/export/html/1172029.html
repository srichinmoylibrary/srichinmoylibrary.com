    <title>Question: Sometimes I&#039;m very happy and joyous, like at circus practice when I&#039;m having fun with my brothers and sisters, but I don&#039;t feel that I&#039;m soulfully happy because I&#039;m not consciously thinking of you.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are happy but you are not thinking of me, that doesn't mean your happiness is not soulful. Not at all! You don't have to think of your Guru or of God for twenty-four hours a day. If you get spontaneous joy from within, feel that your soul has come to the fore and that the joy is coming from your soul. At that time you do not need to think of the Supreme in His personal aspect. If you don't think of me while you are getting joy, that does not mean that this joy is coming from the lower vital or emotional vital. No, your joy can be very sweet, very pure and very divine provided that your soul is giving you the joy. While you are walking along the street or while you are singing, at that time you may not even think of the Supreme. But if you are singing soulfully, where do you think this soulful song comes from? It comes from the soul. Wherever the soul is, rest assured that your divine existence is there also. So you don't have to bring forward the form in order to convince your mind that you are thinking of me or God. It is not necessary at all. If you feel a kind of joy in which there is no demand, a joy that is not going to grab or possess anything, a joy that gives you a sense of self-offering, then that is divine joy, which is very good.</p>  </div>
