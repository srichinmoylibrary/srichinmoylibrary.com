<p>You repeated God's Name<br /> With the clever tongue<br /> Of your mind.<br /> God was afraid of your dangerous deception;<br /> Therefore<br /> He did not dare to near you,<br /> Let alone bless you.<br /> But now<br /> You repeat God's Name<br /> With the loving adoration<br /> Of your heart.<br /> Look, God is not only embracing you,<br /> But also claiming you,<br /> You alone, as His very own.</p>
