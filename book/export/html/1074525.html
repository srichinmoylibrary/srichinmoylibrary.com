<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can use your power most powerfully and most dynamically for the divine purpose only by listening constantly secretly, soulfully and unerringly to the message that you are constantly getting from deep within your heart. If you do not listen to the inner voice, then you are bound to misuse and abuse power. But if you constantly listen to the inner voice, then you will never misuse power. On the contrary, you will see that each time you use power, you will use it most effectively for the fulfilment of the Divine within humanity.</p>  </div>
