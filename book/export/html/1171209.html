    <title>Question: When we have problems that are in our subconscious, is it because we have a strong attachment to the problem and are not really ready to let go, or is it something more than that?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Attachment is nothing other than darkness. Darkness is absence of light. To illumine attachment and transform it into divine strength and fulfilment, at every moment we have to offer to our Lord Beloved Supreme the beauty of gratitude, the purity of gratitude and the divinity of gratitude from our heart-flower.</p>  </div>
