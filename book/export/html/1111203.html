<p>During the thirteen-mile run on Father's Day, I tried running at the pace of a few different disciples. There was one particular disciple, very fat, whom I was so proud of. I wanted to honour her and run with her, just because she was going to complete thirteen miles.</p>
<p>But then I discovered something new. It is infinitely more painful to run slowly. I tried to keep to her pace, but I couldn't. It was unbearable!</p>
