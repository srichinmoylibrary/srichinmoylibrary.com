<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why do you have to detach yourself from something that is good? If you touch a flower that is beautiful and fragrant, it gives you so much joy. Why do you have to be detached from that feeling? If you look at the sun or the moon and feel inspired, why do you have to detach yourself from that feeling? It is not good to be like a rock. If you develop the consciousness of hard stone, then you will not have any sympathy for other people's suffering.</p>
<p>So you do not have to be detached from the things that are encouraging you and inspiring you. Only be detached from the things inside you that are not aspiring, from the things that are binding you. But do not try to detach yourself from things that are sweet, affectionate, loving and illumining.</p>  </div>
