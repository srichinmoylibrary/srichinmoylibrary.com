<p>There was once a brilliant student named B.M. On examination day, he and his colleagues were taking their English exam. The teacher was moving to and fro watching them. At one point, the teacher saw B.M.'s pen drop to the floor. The teacher immediately picked it up and gave it to B.M. The student again started writing.</p>
<p>The teacher said, "How is it that you have not thanked me?"</p>
<p>The student said, "Why should I?"</p>
<p>The teacher could not believe his eyes and ears, for this particular student had always been excellent in his behaviour and conduct. He asked the student, "How is it that today you are behaving so undivinely? Before today, I have only seen your divine nature."</p>
<p>The student said, "Sir, you have always taught us to help others immediately whenever they are in need and never to expect any reward, not even a 'thank you'. Then only, you said, would we be blessed most powerfully by the Heavenly Father."</p>
<p>The teacher immediately shed tears of delight and said to the student, "I am so grateful to you and proud of you for helping me to practise what I preach."</p>  </div>
