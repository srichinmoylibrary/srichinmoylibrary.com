<p>Alas, the passage of time can devour even the most faithful loyalty. There came a time, after India's independence, when Nehru, Patel and others were quite reluctant to obey Mahatma in various ways.</p>
<p>Mahatma was cut to the quick. Then this same Mahatma had to tell the world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If Subhas had been here today, I would not have needed you. He would have listened to me. I need Subhas badly. I do not need you at all."</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
