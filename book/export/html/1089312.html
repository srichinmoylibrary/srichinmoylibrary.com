<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In most cases there will be a right side and a wrong side. Or you can say that one party embodies an iota more truth or more light than the other party. But in some cases, both sides are equally wrong or equally right. So, at that time, the judge has to be extremely careful. If the judge can be absolutely impartial, then God's Message will act in and through him.</p>  </div>
