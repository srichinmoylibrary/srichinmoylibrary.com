<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, each individual should have a path of his own. All roads lead to Rome, but you have to follow one road, one path. Gandhi said, “All religions are leading to the same goal.” Now all religions may have some degree of error, but if you want to go home you have to follow a path. You have to continue walking in spite of any thorns that make it difficult for you to walk. In spite of the imperfections of the path, you have to walk on it if you want to reach your destination.</p>  </div>
