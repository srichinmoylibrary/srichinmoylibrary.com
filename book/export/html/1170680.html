<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the beginning, consciously or unconsciously, we actually cherish our weaknesses. Usually they come in the form of temptation. When we become wise, we separate ourselves from our weaknesses. We feel how stupid we were to have been insecure or jealous or impure, and we want to conquer our weaknesses. If we sincerely want to conquer them, we cannot be at all relaxed; we have to be fully determined. Where does this determination that we need come from? It has only one Source, and that Source is God's Compassion. Ultimately, we have to go to the Source to conquer our defects because the determination that we need has to come from God's Grace.</p>  </div>
