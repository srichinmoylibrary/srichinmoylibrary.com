<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Gold has two meanings. In the highest plane it means manifestation of the Highest. But when the gold touches the earth-consciousness, the colour changes; it does not remain pure gold. Then we call it half-manifestation. In the transcendental Height it is pure manifestation of the spirit, but when it touches the earth, it is half-manifestation. Usually I do not see that colour gold here. When I ask the disciples to bring me gold to paint with here in America, it is not real gold. Your gold colour is different from the gold colour I see in India or in the inner world. If it is real gold colour, it is divine manifestation.</p>  </div>
