<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One need not be a realised soul in order to enter into <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi. If someone is a great aspirant and if he has been meditating for many years, he can have <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi. It is not that difficult. <em>Savikalpa</em> samadhi can last for several hours. When Sri Ramakrishna used to touch seekers and give them a kind of trance and samadhi, it was for a few hours. In <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi one does not stay more than a day or two, because it is not necessary and not advisable. Only <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi goes on for seven, eight, nine, ten days, because <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi is more important in terms of our inner life.</p>
<p>For a spiritually realised person there is no definite boundary to his <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi. At his will he can come and go. At any moment he can enter, and he can stay a few hours or days. Certainly it is not an easy thing for an aspirant to do, but it is not the most difficult thing for a Yogi. If someone is a realised soul, if he is a real Yogi or spiritual Master or Avatar, for him <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi is just like playing with toys. In his case it is very simple, but for an ordinary aspirant, certainly it is difficult.</p>  </div>
