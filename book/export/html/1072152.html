<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you concentrate on the throat chakra, you will be able to become a very good artist, musician, writer, dancer or singer. This does not mean that the other centres do not have the capacity to help you in this way, but the throat centre has the utmost capacity. It is like the refrigerator in a house. The food consciousness or the vibration of the food is in the house, but if I go to the refrigerator in the kitchen, then immediately I get the food.</p>  </div>
