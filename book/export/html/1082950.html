<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many keys to open the door of purity, but there is one key which is the most effective, and that key is the absence of thought-waves in the physical mind. When the physical mind is calm and quiet, purity automatically dawns in the entire being of the seeker.</p>  </div>
