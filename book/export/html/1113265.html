<p>In the afternoon at four o'clock, Nolini-da said to Amrita-da: "Amrita, today in the playground I am supposed to read out your reminiscences and my version of the 24th of November, 1926. Since morning it has been raining heavily. Now it seems the sky is clearing, so if I want to read it out, I can. But my throat is bothering me today. What do you suggest?"</p>
<p>"You are freed from the rain but not from your cough. One attack is over. Let this attack also end. It seems that rain is more compassionate to you than your cough. Such being the case, you may cancel your talk."</p>  </div>
