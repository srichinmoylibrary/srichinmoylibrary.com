<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Individually as well as collectively, humanity is often unwilling to accept help from others. People suspect others' help no matter in what form it is offered. Since outer efforts to help humanity become receptive to peace need not and may not bear any fruit, it is necessary to offer inner help â€” that is to say, to pray and meditate for peace, joy, love and oneness.</p>
<p>We have to work on the inner level in order to reach the heart of humanity. Outer efforts, outer help, will be of little avail. It is the inner effort to bring about peace inside the heart and mind of each individual that can help humanity in a very tangible form. This inner effort can make those who are unreceptive, receptive, and those who are already receptive, abundantly more receptive.</p>  </div>
