<p>In Kyoto I bargained with the shopkeepers. In one place I wanted to buy a particular game. As soon as I went there, they lowered the price. Even when you agree to pay the quoted price, they lower it.</p>
<p>It is the same in Okinawa. Today I bought a watch. As I was buying it, the man brought the price down five thousand yen. I am shameless. I said, "You have lowered it, but can you not lower it another two thousand?"</p>
<p>So altogether he lowered it seven thousand yen. He was such a nice man.</p>
