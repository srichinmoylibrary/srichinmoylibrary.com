<p>Amrita-da said to me: "Chinmoy, come into my room. Tomorrow is my birthday, but I have started observing my birthday today. I want to give you some special food since you are a special person."</p>
<p>"Amrita-da, tomorrow I shall have something special for you," I said.</p>
<p>His immediate reply: "Since it is not easy to become a special person, I have to be satisfied in getting something special from you."</p>
<p>"Who says that you are not a special person?"</p>
<p>"Well, he who is a special person knows it and feels it."</p>
<p>"Amrita-da, who can outdo you in an argument?"</p>
<p>"Ah, I see. In that case I withdraw my point. I am indeed a special person when it is a matter of argumentation!"</p>  </div>
