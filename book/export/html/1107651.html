<p>Where is peace? Peace is not in the old and dead world of the mind—the world that abounds in doubt, insecurity, jealousy and meanness. Peace is in the ever-new world of the heart, which is flooded with love, joy and oneness.</p>
<p>Peace is a unique power. This power is a stranger to money-power, possession-power and supremacy-power. Peace-power has established its inseparable oneness only with heart-power.</p>
<p>Peace-power and the heart’s oneness-power will forever and forever remain inseparable, supremely enjoying their unparalleled divine friendship.</p>
<p>A purity-mind has peace. A oneness-heart is peace. A satisfaction-life distributes peace here, there and all-where.</p>
<p>I can have peace only when I feel that my heart has everything and that my life needs nothing. Let us all dive deep into our heart-sea. Then we are bound to see and hear our Inner Pilot singing His own Victory-Song in and through us— His divinely chosen children and supreme hero-warriors.</p>
<p>At every moment I must be practical and wise. I shall not desire to own the world or disown the world. I shall only desire to love the world-heart and to serve the world-body. I must accept the world as it is, and try to improve the world with my inner and outer capacities without any expectation-hopes. This is the only way I can have peace of mind as a constant, sleepless companion in my world of aspiration and in my world of dedication.</p>
<p>On a practical level, if I want peace and need peace, then I must also pray soulfully and meditate silently. I must recite the name of my Beloved Supreme day and night. At every moment in my dedication-life I must remember His unconditional Compassion-Power while loving and serving His world-family, my brothers and sisters in humanity.</p>
<p>Peace brilliantly shines on a Truth-seeker’s and God-lover’s silence-life-path. I must, as a seeker, walk along the path of silence. My Lord Supreme every day will both follow me and lead me. His Forgiveness-Heart will follow me and His Compassion-Eye will lead me along Eternity’s Road. Thus, my Lord Supreme and my own aspiration-heart, with its eternal God-hunger, will be two pilgrims walking together forever along Eternity’s Road towards ever-fulfilling peace and ever-increasing satisfaction. </p>
