  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Is the Supreme pleased with the progress of the United Nations?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, the Supreme is pleased with the sincere aspiration and dedication that the United Nations has offered Him. Again, the Supreme believes in continuous progress. Whatever the United Nations has already achieved has pleased Him, but He expects something more. That something more has to be achieved by the sincere efforts of the people who work at the United Nations, the people who love the United Nations and the people who are one with the ideals and the goals of the United Nations. We can achieve what the Supreme wants by virtue of our joint efforts in the field of aspiration and dedication â€” by making a special effort to aspire more and dedicate ourselves more to the cause of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Satisfaction is not a finished product. If we remain at a certain standard, then our progress becomes like a stagnant pool and satisfaction goes away. Only in continuous progress do we find satisfaction. First we come up to a certain standard, which we originally wanted. Then we look around and see that somebody else has achieved something higher or deeper, and we also try to do the same. It is not out of jealousy or a feeling of competition, no; only it is an inner urge that makes us want to try to surpass ourselves.</p>
