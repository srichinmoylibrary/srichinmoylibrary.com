<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are in the subway, when you are dealing with wrong forces, undivine forces, you can do two things. The occult process is to imagine the sound of the subway and then to think of all the bad people on the subway put together. Then try to imagine a sound from those people and also the sound of the subway. After you do this, with your creative imagination you will try to create another sound which is infinitely more powerful than the sound of the subway and all the bad people on it. Your sound can easily drown or destroy the first sound. The sound of the subway and the vibration of the bad people have created a negative power all around. So you create a positive power which will either engulf, destroy or illumine that power. This is the occult process. The occult life means always to be a warrior, always to fight.</p>
<p>The spiritual way is different. Before you enter into the subway, meditate on the Supreme for Protection and for Compassion. As soon as you leave your house, pray to Him. If the Protection and Compassion of the Supreme work together inside you, then naturally they will be infinitely more powerful than all the dangerous and undivine forces in the subway.</p>  </div>
