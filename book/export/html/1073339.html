<h2>Question: How should I love God and how can I love Him more?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you know why you want to love God more, then it will be extremely easy for you to love Him in the right way. You want to love God for satisfaction. When you love God for your own satisfaction, you will definitely get some satisfaction, but it will be only a small amount. But if you want to love God for His satisfaction, then you yourself will get the highest satisfaction. Your satisfaction will be complete because you will try to please God in His own way.</p>
<p>How can you love God more? By feeling that He loves you infinitely more than you love yourself. This is absolutely true. If you can feel even once a day that God loves you infinitely more than you love yourself, then automatically you will love God more. How many times do you hate yourself? Every time you expect something from yourself and you donâ€™t get it, you hate yourself; if you do something wrong, you just curse yourself. But God within you, the Inner Pilot within you, never, never hates you and never curses you. He loves you all the time in His divine, supreme way. He who loves you constantly in spite of your repeated mistakes deserves to be loved by you all the time. You find it difficult to love yourself all the time, but God does not find it difficult. He loves you constantly. If you realise this, it will be very easy for you to love God more than you do now.</p>  </div>
