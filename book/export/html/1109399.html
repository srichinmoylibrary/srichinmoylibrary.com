<blockquote>
<p>"The man who does not know what the universe is, does not know where he lives."</p>
<p>â€” Marcus Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The universe.<br /> The universe is God's creation<br /> And man's realisation.<br /> The universe is God's Compassion<br /> And man's emancipation.<br /> The universe is God's Concentration<br /> And man's transformation.<br /> The universe is God's Meditation<br /> And man's revelation.<br /> The universe is God's Contemplation<br /> And man's manifestation.</p>
<p>The poet in me tells me that the universe<br /> Is beautiful.<br /> The singer in me tells me that the universe<br /> Is enchanting.<br /> The philosopher in me tells me that the universe<br /> Is meaningful.<br /> The yogi in me tells me that the universe<br /> Is soulful.<br /> The God-lover in me tells me that the universe<br /> Is fruitful.</p>
<p>My poet sees the truth.<br /> My singer feels the truth.<br /> My philosopher achieves the truth.<br /> My yogi realises the truth.<br /> My God-lover becomes the truth.</p>
