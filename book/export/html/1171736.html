SCA 1244-1248. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in Xiamen, China, on 20 December 2004.</p>
<h2>Question: I love everything in nature. It inspires me and makes me happy. But I do not like the wind and I am wondering what is the quality of wind?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good question! The wind has many, many spiritual meanings. Let us say you are in a park or an open space and you are doing something serious. Then the wind comes. From the human point of view, it ruins everything. But then again, it depends on how we take it. In my case, the wind gives me tremendous joy. On the one hand, we can say that the wind embodies restlessness. On the other hand, we can say that the wind makes us feel that the entire world is very small. It starts blowing in one place and then it goes to another place. So far and so fast it goes! So, unless it is very, very cold, I really like wind. In Chittagong and Pondicherry, it used to give me tremendous joy.</p>
<p>The wind shows us that nothing is permanent at any one place. We feel that one particular place is permanent. We have kept some important papers there and we are sure that the papers will remain in a fixed position. Then the wind starts blowing. Alas, everything flies away.</p>
<p>In my case, when there is wind, I get nourishment in my entire being. Even if the lower portion of my body is covered and only my face and upper portion are exposed a little, when the wind comes I feel that it goes inside my body, like the blood it is flowing.</p>
<p>The wind has many, many good qualities, but the main thing is that it shows us life is not permanent. It breaks our way of living. We have a fixed way of staying peaceful and so forth. But the wind comes and gives us the message, "No, no, no! Do not take life so seriously! This life is not permanent. It will go away. So why do you have to take life so seriously?"</p>
<p>In so many ways, the wind helps us. But if you do not like the wind because of your personal feelings, there is nothing wrong with that. It depends on how you take it. Sometimes, while children are playing, the wind is blowing and they get additional joy and energy. Look at the difference! Here you are disliking the wind, but these children take it as great fun. The wind is blowing and when they kick the ball, it does not score, it goes in a completely different direction. But they get more joy, even when they are not scoring, because it is great fun for both sides. Like that, in hundreds of ways the wind gives me joy.</p>
<p>There is one particular poem of Sri Aurobindo's, <em>Invitation</em>, where the wind is blowing and he is inviting everyone to join him:</p>

<p>With wind and the weather beating round me<br /> Up to the hill and the moorland I go.<br /> Who will come with me? Who will climb with me?<br /> Wade through the brook and tramp through the snow?</p>
<p>Not in the petty circle of cities<br /> Cramped by your doors and your walls I dwell;<br /> Over me God is blue in the welkin,<br /> Against me the wind and the storm rebel.</p>
<p>I sport with solitude here in my regions,<br /> Of misadventure have made me a friend.<br /> Who would live largely? Who would live freely?<br /> Here to the wind-swept uplands ascend.</p>
<p>I am the lord of tempest and mountain,<br /> I am the Spirit of freedom and pride.<br /> Stark must he be and a kinsman to danger<br /> Who shares my kingdom and walks at my side.</p>

<p>Here the wind is blowing and the invitation is coming from Sri Aurobindo to join him.</p>
<p>There are many who may not like the wind. In my case, I like it very much, very much.</p>  </div>
