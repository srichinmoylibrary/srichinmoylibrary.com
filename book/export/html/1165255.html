<h2>Question: Guru, what is the difference between the psychic being and the soul?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything has a soul, but the psychic being is only in human beings. It is not in animals or inanimate objects. The psychic being is like a flame that is kindled in a human being. But this does not happen in the first or second or third human incarnation. In some cases, it takes quite a few incarnations before the psychic being comes into existence. There are many seekers, even here with us, who still unfortunately do not have a psychic being, became they have not had many incarnations. Again, someone can have many incarnations, but if he does not aspire, in him the psychic flame will not be kindled. There is no hard and fast rule as to when the psychic being will come into existence. But we can safely say that in the human incarnation one day the psychic being will come into existence. It depends on the sincerity and intensity of the seeker’s inner cry. When the psychic being comes, first we feel it, then we see it and finally we grow into it.</p>  </div>
