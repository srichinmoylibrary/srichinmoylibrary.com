<p>When Sri Aurobindo was in the vortex of politics, Tagore was very, very well-known. Even though Sri Aurobindo was junior to Tagore by eleven years, Tagore had such admiration for Sri Aurobindo. Tagore had the vision of who Sri Aurobindo was. The first time they met, Tagore wrote a poem. In the very first line, he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“/Aurobindo Rabindrer laho namaskar/” O Aurobindo, accept my salutations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tagore was older than Sri Aurobindo by many years, but Tagore bowed down to Sri Aurobindo. Others he blessed and blessed, and he mentioned them in his writings. But to Sri Aurobindo he bowed down. The following lines from this poem are even more powerful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You are the embodied, revealed message of Mother India. And for you there is no name, no fame; you are far beyond.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The end of the poem is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Truth has come, truth is there. O fools, O cowards, wake up, wake up! Aurobindo is the embodiment of the highest Truth.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have recited that particular poem more than a thousand times.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
