<p>This morning I went running in shorts and a T-shirt. When the old German lady who lives on my street saw me, she said in broken English, "You don't feel cold?"</p>
<p>I said, "No!"</p>
<p>Then she said, "You want me to feel that I am an old lady!" She was wearing a brown coat.</p>
<p>I told her, "No, you are quite young."</p>
<p>She said, "You have made my day!"</p>
<p>She is the lady who has a dog. She always says something funny to me.</p>
