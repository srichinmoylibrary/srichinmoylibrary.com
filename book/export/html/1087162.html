<p>In a department store in Fukuyama, they were playing music on the ground floor. I did not like the music they were playing, so I said, "Let me go to another floor."</p>
<p>I kept going from floor to floor thinking that that particular floor wouldn't have music. But there was music on each floor. I am such a fool!</p>
