<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the practical level, do not expect anything from others on the physical plane. Just give and give and give, like a mother who gives everything to her child thinking that the child is not in a position to give her anything in return. Do not expect anything from the world; only love the world and offer your capacity, your inner wealth, your joy. Everything that you have, give to the world unconditionally. If we expect anything from the world, then we will feel miserable because the world does not understand us, the world does not care for us. So if we can do anything unconditionally, then we will have peace of mind. This is one way.</p>
<p>The other way is to meditate on the heart, where there is constant joy, constant love. At that time we will not cry for appreciation from others. We will all the time depend on our inner Source, where there is infinite Joy, infinite Love, infinite Peace. The best thing is to meditate on the heart. This is the second way, which is most effective.</p>  </div>
