<p>Alas! My soul has been stolen away. Desire, the thief, is in collusion with my mind. In vain I thrashed them soundly, but the more I beat them the louder became their laughter.</p>
<p>O Lord and God, my power is ignorance; Yours is Knowledge. I have fought with You many a time and every time I have come off second best. This time I am sure that I shall bear away the palm of victory. My immaculate gratitude will compel Your Grace to fight with Your iron Law. I know the stronger of the two is Your Grace. All problems will be solved when I have Your Grace as my Guide.</p>  </div>
