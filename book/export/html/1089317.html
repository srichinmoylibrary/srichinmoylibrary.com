<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's Laws are very simple in Heaven. God says to the souls, "Use as much as possible of My Light. Drink in as much as possible of My Peace. If you want to take part in My Cosmic Game, then you will promise to enter into the world for My Manifestation. And if you don't want to enter into the Cosmic Game, then remain in Heaven in perfect peace and from there help the brave soldiers who want to fight for My Manifestation on earth." These are God's requests, which you can call Laws.</p>  </div>
