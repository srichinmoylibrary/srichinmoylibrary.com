<p>Sattva is the chief of the qualities of nature. It embodies harmony. Let us know the existence of harmony in relation to the universe. To quote Dryden:</p>

<p>From harmony, from heavenly harmony<br /> This universal Frame began:<br /> From harmony to harmony<br /> Through all the compass of the notes it ran,<br /> The diapason closing full in Man.</p>

<p>The possessor of the Sattvic quality has undoubtedly a heart of gold. He knows that his life has a significance of its own. His breath is pure. His patience is luminous. Unparalleled is his fortitude. Infallible is his certainty.</p>  </div>
