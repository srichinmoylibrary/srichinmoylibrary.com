<p>While I was running about four or five days ago, I passed a man who was giving a parking ticket to a car — God knows what he is called. I was very tired, and when he saw me he said, "Young friend, you have run enough. Now take rest."</p>
<p>After writing out the ticket, he himself sat down at the foot of a tree. He was a very old man, a very nice soul. I asked him, "Do you get joy by giving tickets to cars?"</p>
<p>"No, never!" he replied. "But will you give me my bread and butter? Daily I have to give at least ten or twelve tickets in the morning. If I do not, then my boss will fire me. He will not give me my bread and butter."</p>
<p>So we sat down and both rested for about five minutes — this is how I run — and then we went our own ways.</p>
