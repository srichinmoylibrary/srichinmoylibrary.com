<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some spiritual Masters are of the opinion that our spiritual heart is in the centre of our chest where the <em>anahata</em> chakra is located. That is the place of utmost joy and safety. I happen to be one of those who subscribe to this belief. Other spiritual Masters will say that it is not in the centre of our chest but in our third eye, the <em>ajna</em> chakra or centre of vision, because the heart has the vision to see God, feel God and be blessed by God. Still others say it is on the left side of the physical heart organ.</p>
<p>Whichever place in our body has the capacity to see God, pray to God and meditate on God we call the heart. As soon as we utter the word 'heart', we get a feeling of something very deep, profound and sweet. The heart is the dearest part of our being, the dearest reality or divinity inside us. So if you get joy by meditating on your <em>anahata</em> chakra, then you can meditate there. If you get joy by meditating on your <em>ajna</em> chakra or any other centre, then you can meditate on that place. You do not have to worry about the philosophy behind these spiritual chakras. The best thing is for you to choose which place gives you the most joy. The place that gives you the utmost joy while you are praying and meditating is the best place for you to meditate.</p>
<p>Every day you are working in the hustle and bustle of life. Then, when you come home, you get tremendous joy. You enter into your room and there you pray, you meditate or do whatever you want to do. As soon as we say the word 'home', we are filled with such sweet feelings. It is exactly the same for the heart. The heart is the place where we are safe. There we feel that our prayers are being answered. There our meditation becomes very deep, illumining and fulfilling. It is the place that gives us utmost joy. Let our medical friends say, "No, how can this place be your heart? You are a fool! The heart has to be here, in this precise place." We are not dealing with medical science. We are dealing only with spiritual realities. According to the spiritual reality, the place that gives you the utmost joy when you pray and meditate is your heart.</p>  </div>
