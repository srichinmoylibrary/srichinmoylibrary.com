<p>My body wants to sleep.<br /> My vital wants to run.<br /> My mind wants to know.<br /> My heart wants to grow.<br /> My soul wants to glow.<br /> My Lord Supreme wants to flow.<br /> My body cries.<br /> My vital sighs.<br /> My mind fears.<br /> My heart hesitates.<br /> My soul wanders.<br /> My Lord Supreme wonders.<br /> My body likes to sleep.<br /> My vital likes to conquer.<br /> My mind likes to prosper.<br /> My heart likes to surrender.<br /> My soul likes to discover.<br /> My Lord Supreme likes to remember.<br /> My body will see.<br /> My vital will feel.<br /> My mind will believe.<br /> My heart will realise.<br /> My soul will smile.<br /> My Lord Supreme will rest.</p>
