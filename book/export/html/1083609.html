<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, God is lonely when people consciously and deliberately do not want to participate in His cosmic Game. He is lonely when nobody sails in His Dream-boat to reach His Golden Shore. He is lonely when He sees that nobody attempts to be His eternal friend. He is lonely when He sees that earthly beings do not want to become as divine and supreme as He is.</p>  </div>
