<p>Now we have come back to Cancún for the second time. This place is so beautiful. I am happy we came back.</p>
<p>The other day I was in the elevator together with a stout, elderly man.</p>
<p>He asked, "Do you speak Spanish?"</p>
<p>I said, "No."</p>
<p>He went on, "Where do you come from?" I replied, "India." He asked, "May I ask you where?"</p>
<p>I told him, "I come from Chittagong." Then I asked him where he came from.</p>
<p>He said, "I come from Chicago."</p>
<p>He began joking with me that he did not know where Chittagong is.</p>
<p>I said, "It is not in Ill."</p>
<p>He said, "What do you mean — ill?"</p>
<p>I said, "It is not in Illinois. The abbreviation I am telling you."</p>
<p>When I used to work at the Indian Consulate, how many times I used to write Chicago and then "Ill." I would put the passport inside the brown envelope and then write down the name of the Indians in Chicago, Ill.</p>
<p>What is the great similarity between Chicago and my disciples? Unpredictable weather! Chicago's outer weather is unpredictable, and the disciples' inner weather is also unpredictable.</p>
