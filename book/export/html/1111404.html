<p>Monday, when I was visiting my students' offices in UNICEF, I had a soulful conversation with Chandika's boss. Then, this morning, before I went out running for the second time — around six o'clock — I meditated on him. For nice people, quite often I do something special in the inner world, even if they are not my disciples. Yesterday her boss showed gratitude and today, also, his soul came to me.</p>
<p>After meditating on him, while running I was getting a very good response from his soul; it was all gratitude. His soul is a combination of dynamism and softness. Usually, dynamic people do not have any soft qualities; but his main attributes are his dynamism and softness. He is a very luminous soul.</p>
