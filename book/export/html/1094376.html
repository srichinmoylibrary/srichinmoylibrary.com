<p>My body loves to walk<br /> Towards the goal.<br /> My vital loves to march<br /> Towards the goal.<br /> My mind loves to jog<br /> Towards the goal.<br /> My heart loves to sprint<br /> Towards the goal.<br /> My soul loves to fly<br /> Towards the goal.</p>
<p>My Lord tells me<br /> That I do not have to walk,<br /> I do not have to march,<br /> I do not have to jog,<br /> I do not have to sprint<br /> And I do not have to fly<br /> Towards the goal.<br /> The goal will come to me<br /> If I can become<br /> A sea of silence-peace.</p>
