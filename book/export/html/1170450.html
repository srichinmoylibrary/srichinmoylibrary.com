<h2>Chandelier</h2>

<p>Sri Aurobindo is the Father of a beginningless beginning and the Son of an endless end.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The Mother always gives. We too always give. Hers is the Blessing. Ours is the unworthiness.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Sri Aurobindo's Truth is the Seed. His Law is the Plant. His Forgiveness is the Tree. His Holocaust is the Fruit — the Supermind for the world's transformation.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The Mother is ceaseless forgiveness. It is man's bulwark against perdition.</p>
