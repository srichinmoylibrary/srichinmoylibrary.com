<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The face is smiling because you are meditating well, according to your own standard. Or it may be smiling for another reason: to ask you not to be disturbed by the ignorance and the dark forces that you still have. It is smiling to encourage you and strengthen you so that you can conquer them. These are the two reasons. One is that according to your standard you are pleased and the smiling face is pleased with you; the other is that it is asking you not to be frightened by the wrong forces that are still inside you.</p>  </div>
