<p>In 1984 I gave a Peace Concert in Toronto. There I met with Krishan Chandra, who succeeded Mr. Mukherjee as our Section Officer at the Consulate. Before that he was the assistant boss in our section. As I came off the stage, somebody came from behind me and fell at my feet, saying, “I recognise you!”</p>
<p>I said, “I, too, recognise you! What are you doing? You are my boss!”</p>
<p>Then Chandra said, “Inwardly I am not your boss. Ghose, we knew it, we knew it while you were working with us. We knew you were not just a clerk. Your very name is a phenomenon. You carry two worlds inside you — Eastern and Western. It is such a rare thing. Your music has transported my wife and me almost into a trance. Please let us know when you are coming again so we can be with you and be blessed by you.”</p>
<p>I thanked him and said, “I am so grateful to you. Your very presence is a blessing to me and to us all.”</p>
<p>This particular man was much older than me and he used to be my boss. Even then, he had to touch my feet in front of hundreds of people.</p>
<p>When the British girls performed my play about Lord Krishna in Toronto in 1995, he came to see it.</p>
<p>How people can be so nice to me! At the Indian Consulate, the people who worked with me were so kind to me.</p>  </div>
