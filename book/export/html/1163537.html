<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the Will of God and also on your own dedication to the spiritual life. They go together. In the beginning you have to participate in the game. You have to get up early in the morning, at six o'clock or seven o'clock, and you have to meditate. But then there comes a time when you see that it is only His Will that is acting in and through you. In the beginning, you may feel that it is fifty percent your will and fifty percent God's Will working in and through you. But when you go deep within, you see that it is ninety-nine percent God's Will. And later, you will realise that it is one hundred percent God's Will. But in the beginning you have to act like a good student. You have to get up early and do your inner study. At that time you feel that aspiration depends on your will.</p>  </div>
