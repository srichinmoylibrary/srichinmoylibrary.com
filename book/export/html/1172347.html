<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The experience of the Beyond is calm, but it is not static. In it, dynamism and tranquillity exist together. In one of the Upanishads we find this definition of the Beyond: “That moves and that moves not. That is far and that is near.” How can something move yet move not? It seems impossible. But when you are in the Beyond, you will see the universe in movement and, at the same time, tranquil. There is also another description of the Beyond: the experience of the Infinite. “Infinity is that. Infinity is this. From Infinity, Infinity has come into existence. From Infinity, when Infinity is taken away, Infinity remains.”</p>  </div>
