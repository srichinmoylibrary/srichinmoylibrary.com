<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The first time I met with Pope Paul VI . . .</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> You met him?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Three times! I have met with the present Pope, John Paul II, three times and his predecessor also I met three times. When I met Pope Paul VI, he was blessingfully appreciating my activities at the United Nations and elsewhere. He said to me, "Your Hindu philosophy and my Christian philosophy are absolutely the same." Then he said to me, "When you and I leave this body, we shall be together."</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> What a beautiful prediction!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, he made that prediction. Both the present Pope and his predecessor have been extremely, extremely kind to me.</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> We had a meeting in Japan and the one who represented the Hindu religion was the nephew of Mahatma Gandhi. And there was someone from the Muslim faith â€” the Executive General Secretary, who is living in Sri Lanka. The Dalai Lama was also there. We were talking about peace. In our talks there were no differences.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All roads lead to God's House. That is our destination. Although we may live in different houses, because we were born into different religions, our destination is the same.</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> I said, "We are all saying the same thing. Only your terminology is different." They said, "Yes, there is nothing different. We will all go to Heaven because we are all seeking peace."</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Peace-dreamers, peace-lovers and peace-promoters are all in the same boat. So we are all in the same boat.</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> "Blessed are the peace-makers because they will see the Face of God." It is one of the Beatitudes. May God bless you and please bless me!</p>  </div>
