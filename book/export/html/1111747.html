<p>I would like to have T-shirts with zippers in the front. Then I could change in the middle of a race very quickly. This time, after five miles when I took off my nylon running suit, I felt so cold because my shirt was wet, but I didn't stop to change it. If I could have changed, I would have felt fresher and run faster.</p>
