  <h1 class="book-heading">Meeting with the Pope</h1>
  
 
<p>After the speech, it was time for the private interviews. Three or four black priests were ahead of me. The Pope came up to them and they all knelt down and kissed his ring.</p>
<p>As soon as the Pope came near me, I stood up and one of the Cardinals said, "He is Sri Chinmoy from the United Nations."</p>
<p>I gave the Pope Sanatan's plaque, which was so beautiful, and the pamphlet with the song about him. As I was giving him the plaque and the pamphlet, the Pope said, "You are from the United Nations."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, Father, I am."</p>
<p>Then he asked me, "Are you an Indian?"</p>
<p>Again I said, "Yes, I am."</p>
<p>Then he said, "India, India, India!" with such joy and enthusiasm in his face.He was absolutely beaming with joy.</p>
<p>He very powerfully grabbed my elbow with such affection, and looked at me as if I were an old forgotten friend or grandson. He was holding me firmly and talking to me, and he patted my shoulder seven or eight times.</p>
<p>Then he said to me, "Special greetings to your members. Special blessings to you. We shall continue together."</p>
<p>The words we exchanged were few, but he spent time looking at the plaque and appreciating it. I also showed him the picture of me with the previous Pope that was in the U.N. booklet, "Our First Ten Years." He looked at the picture and also at the pamphlet with the song about him.</p>  </div>
