<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I do not train like this, mentally I become weak. If I skip certain things, I face a kind of mental barrier the following day, as if I am starting from the very beginning. When I go out of town — during Christmas and other times — and I do not have all the facilities, there are quite a few things I cannot do. Then, when I come back and start practising again, I do not suffer. But when I am here in New York, if I do not practice regularly and do all my exercises, then I feel sad the following day.</p>  </div>
