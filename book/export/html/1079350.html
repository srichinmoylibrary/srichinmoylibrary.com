<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we are in a state of oneness with God, we cannot say that this is evil and that is good. When we become one with God, everything is a manifestation of the divine Will. But when we are not one with God, then one second we are with God, in God, and for the next hour we are in ourselves-in our own vital, in our own physical consciousness. Then there will always be both undivine and divine forces within and around us. But when we have the deepest type of meditation-the highest, most sublime meditation-at that time we do not see the polarities of good and evil. For then we are one with the transcendental Reality, and this transcends all human notions of good, evil, divine and undivine.</p>  </div>
