<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Occult power comes from mind-power and psychic or spiritual power comes from heart-power. One who wants occult power prays and cries for it. For spiritual power, one does not have to ask. Spiritual power comes spontaneously if one cries to the Supreme devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally to please Him in His own Way. Spiritual power comes from sincere aspiration and inner cry. We use spiritual power to guide ourselves so that we do not make mistakes but become perfect instruments of the Supreme. If we achieve occult power, we can do miracles; but miracles are short-lived. Anything that comes from the mind is short-lived, whereas anything that comes from the heart is long-lasting.</p>  </div>
