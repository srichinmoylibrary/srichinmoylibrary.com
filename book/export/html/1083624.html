<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's favourite musical instrument is the one that you like best. You represent God, so the instrument that you like best is God's favourite instrument. God in you is ready to play the instrument that you like best. Because he is an eternal musician and you have come to represent Him, the musical instrument that you like best, he has to like best. What is your instrument? Trumpet? Then God definitely likes the trumpet most. You blow His victory. The trumpet signifies victory.</p>  </div>
