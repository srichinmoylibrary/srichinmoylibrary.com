<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you go deep within, then you will see that it is God who is suffering, that it is God who is going through each experience. Now you feel separated from God. That is why you say, "I am suffering, my friends are suffering, my relatives are suffering." But when you have the capacity for universal oneness, you will feel that it is only God who is having this experience in and through you and everybody else. He Himself is the disease, He Himself is the remedy. You call it suffering, but in God's Eye it is an experience that He Himself is going through in the process of His own evolution.</p>  </div>
