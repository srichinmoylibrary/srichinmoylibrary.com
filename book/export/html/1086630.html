<p>April 14th, 1982</p>
<p>My dear Father,</p>
<p>On the occasion of your most auspicious centenary, I am offering you my five hundredth rose, "I am Ready," from my crying and smiling heart-garden.</p>
<p>May you remain in heavenly Peace, Light and Delight until I come and join you.</p>
<p>Yours in the Eternal Father Supreme,</p>
<p>Madal</p>  </div>

<p>My Lord, break me,<br /> My vital is ready.</p>
<p>My Lord, melt me,<br /> My heart is ready.</p>
<p>My Lord, mould me,<br /> My mind is ready.</p>
<p>My Lord, make me,<br /> I am fully ready.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086633" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2</h1>
  
 

<p>God's Compassion-Heart melts me,<br /> My aspiration-heart.<br /> God's Concern-Eye moulds me,<br /> My dedication-life.<br /> God's Love Arms make me,<br /> My surrender-breath.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086634" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3</h1>
  
 

<p>Even the most adequate answer<br /> To the question "Who am I?"<br /> Does not satisfy my heart</p>
<p>Only the accurate answer<br /> To the question "Whose am I?"<br /> Satisfies me completely.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086635" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4</h1>
  
 

<p>Self-examination quickly precedes<br /> Self-realisation.</p>
<p>Self-realisation devotedly precedes<br /> God-manifestation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086636" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5</h1>
  
 

<p>Purity is self-evident;<br /> My aspiration-heart knows it.</p>
<p>Satisfaction is God-Fulfilment;<br /> My dedication-life knows it.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086637" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6</h1>
  
 

<p>A pure mind blossoms in peace.<br /> A pure heart blossoms in bliss.<br /> A pure life blossoms in oneness,<br /> God-Oneness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086638" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7</h1>
  
 

<p>What I wanted<br /> Was a flicker of hope.<br /> But my Lord came<br /> And stood before me<br /> To give me<br /> His Infinity's All.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086639" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8</h1>
  
 

<p>A spiritual Master is<br /> An eternal student.<br /> He soulfully learns<br /> Wisdom from God;<br /> He ungrudgingly and compassionately<br /> Learns ignorance from his disciples.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086640" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord, kick me, kick me.<br /> That is the only way<br /> I can move forward.</p>
<p>My Lord, bless me, bless me.<br /> That is the only way<br /> I can rise upward.</p>
<p>My Lord, love me, love me.<br /> That is the only way<br /> I can dive inward.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086641" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10</h1>
  
 

<p>I shall love the world<br /> More soulfully today.<br /> Do you know why?<br /> Because<br /> God has given me<br /> One of His richest Treasures:<br /> He has sown His<br /> Confidence-Seed<br /> In me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086642" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11</h1>
  
 

<p>Because<br /> Of your restless mind,<br /> You have lost.<br /> Because<br /> Of your faithless heart,<br /> You have lost.<br /> Because<br /> Of your cheerless life,<br /> You have lost.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086643" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12</h1>
  
 

<p>Three things I daily do:<br /> I dream<br /> With my cheerful eyes,<br /> I cry<br /> With my tearful heart,<br /> I fly<br /> With my powerful soul.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086644" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13</h1>
  
 

<p>My mind<br /> Was born to grow divinely.<br /> My heart<br /> Was born to glow supremely.<br /> My life<br /> Was born to flow perpetually.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086645" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14</h1>
  
 

<p>Soulfulness has given me<br /> What it embodies: God's Heart.<br /> Selflessness has given me<br /> What it embodies: God's Life.<br /> Finally,<br /> God has given me<br /> What He has and what He is:<br /> Satisfaction-Smile.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086646" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15</h1>
  
 

<p>My desire-life, are you blind?<br /> Can you not see<br /> That I am running fast,<br /> Very fast,<br /> Away from you?</p>
<p>My aspiration-life, look!<br /> At long last<br /> I have the soul-urge<br /> To run towards you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086647" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16</h1>
  
 

<p>An enquiring mind must oscillate<br /> Between<br /> Victory-satisfaction<br /> And<br /> Defeat-frustration.</p>
<p>A self-giving heart will never oscillate.<br /> It lives in God<br /> And<br /> Lives for God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086648" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17</h1>
  
 

<p>The heart feels that it can never be<br /> Too early to realise God.</p>
<p>The soul knows that it can never be<br /> Too late to manifest God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086649" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18</h1>
  
 

<p>I love, I love, I love.<br /> I love the silver process of seeing.<br /> I love the golden progress of the seen.<br /> I love the diamond fulness of the Seer.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086650" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19</h1>
  
 

<p>I shall not add anything<br /> To my heart's hunger for God.<br /> I shall not remove anything<br /> From my soul's feast with God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086651" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20</h1>
  
 

<p>Be not alone,<br /> Man's ignorance-tiger<br /> Will come and devour you.<br /> Be not alone,<br /> Go and learn the secret of sacrifice-delight<br /> From God's Sacrifice-Horse.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086652" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">21</h1>
  
 

<p>Steadily<br /> Each and every thought<br /> Sculptures its own life.<br /> Ultimately<br /> Each and every life<br /> Sculptures its own God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086653" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">22</h1>
  
 

<p>Be not enamoured<br /> Of what you see outwardly.</p>
<p>Be not indifferent<br /> To what you feel inwardly.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086654" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23</h1>
  
 

<p>Your mind's selfishness<br /> Is your all-exclusive individuality.</p>
<p>Your heart's selflessness<br /> Is your all-inclusive universality.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086655" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24</h1>
  
 

<p>My sweet Lord Supreme,<br /> Even if I happen to be<br /> The most unaspiring<br /> Seeker-child of Yours,<br /> Do you not agree with me<br /> That I have no protection-shelter<br /> Other than You?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086656" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25</h1>
  
 

<p>As a human being can<br /> Easily and effectively discard<br /> His discouraging and disheartening dreams,<br /> Even so he can renounce<br /> Cheerfully and permanently<br /> His unaspiring animal life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086657" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">26</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord, if I have<br /> Your Forgiveness-Sun,<br /> Then who can hurt me?<br /> And if I do not have<br /> Your Forgiveness-Sun,<br /> The who can console me?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086658" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">27</h1>
  
 

<p>The seeker-watcher sees<br /> The God-Day.<br /> The lover-smiler knows<br /> Not only the God-Hour<br /> But also the God-Moment.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086659" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">28</h1>
  
 

<p>O my truth-searching mind,<br /> God is more than greatness.<br /> O my God-loving heart,<br /> God is more that goodness.<br /> God is His Eternity's own Perfection-cry.<br /> God is His Immortality's own Satisfaction-Smile.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086660" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">29</h1>
  
 

<p>O my Pilot Supreme,<br /> Your outer Name is Concern-Sky,<br /> Your inner Name is Forgiveness-Sun.<br /> You cry every day at my heart's door<br /> To gain a new entry<br /> So that cheerfully and proudly<br /> You can steer my life-boat.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086661" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">30</h1>
  
 

<p>God through man<br /> Reveals His Eternity's<br /> Beauty-cry.<br /> God for man<br /> Reveals His Immortality's<br /> Prosperity-Smile.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086662" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">31</h1>
  
 

<p>One great consoling message<br /> From you Master<br /> Can totally stop the withering<br /> Of your God-realising realities<br /> And God-manifesting inevitabilities.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086663" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">32</h1>
  
 

<p>Happy are my eyes to see You<br /> My Lord!<br /> Happy is my heart to feel You<br /> My Lord!<br /> Happy is my life to claim You<br /> My Lord,<br /> As my own, very own!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086664" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">33</h1>
  
 

<p>If you want to enjoy the death-cry<br /> Of your poverty-stricken ego,<br /> Then you must at once<br /> Check the escalating growth<br /> Of your desire-night.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086665" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">34</h1>
  
 

<p>I see the growth<br /> Of my happy consciousness<br /> Only inside my full obedience<br /> To my soul's wisdom-height.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086666" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">35</h1>
  
 

<p>Yesterday<br /> I lived inside<br /> My mind's disastrous uncertainty-sea.<br /> Today<br /> I am living inside<br /> My heart's rapturous divinity-ocean.<br /> This is what my Lord's<br /> Unconditional Grace<br /> Has done for me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086667" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">36</h1>
  
 

<p>Celestial intimacies<br /> Are bound to suffocate<br /> In the narrow grasp<br /> Of petty alternatives:<br /> Possession-greed<br /> And<br /> Rejection-seed.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086668" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">37</h1>
  
 

<p>Every flower-heart<br /> Has a soul<br /> Every flower-soul<br /> Has a special<br /> God-ordained role.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086669" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">38</h1>
  
 

<p>Since my Lord's infinite Smile<br /> Has not changed,<br /> I must not change my heart's<br /> Eternal cry.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086670" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">39</h1>
  
 

<p>If my outer smile is mighty,<br /> Then my inner cry is almighty.</p>
<p>If my self-giving is strong,<br /> Then my God's Satisfaction<br /> Is stronger<br /> Than the strongest.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086671" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">40</h1>
  
 

<p>Do not<br /> Expect anything from this world.<br /> You will be sadly disappointed<br /> And<br /> Badly frustrated.</p>
<p>Do not<br /> Surrender to this world.<br /> Yours will be the unmistakable<br /> And<br /> Ultimate victory.</p>
