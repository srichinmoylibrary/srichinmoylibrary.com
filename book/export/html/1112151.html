<p>Two days ago, when I was coming back from my run, I turned my head only to see Kokila sitting on a car, looking at her feet. She would not have seen me at all, but I took the trouble of saying, "Kokila!" Then she jumped up.</p>
<p>As soon as I call her, she turns her head away, like my dogs Sona and Kanu.</p>
