<div><h3>Translation:</h3>


<p>Every day I carry countless messages.<br /> Some are sad, sorrowful, unhappy;<br /> Some are happy.<br /> I fly in all directions<br /> And the beggar and the King alike look for me.<br /> Some cry the moment they get me,<br /> While others smile.<br /> Some throw me, cast me aside;<br /> Some place me inside the very depth of their heart.<br /> I bring to the child his mother's affection-letter.<br /> Again, I bring the message of the King.<br /> I bring letters of the sister's love and affection<br /> for the little brother.<br /> And although he does not know how to read,<br /> He casts his glance on the paper<br /> And his joy knows no bounds<br /> That he has received a letter.<br /> He places the concentrative power on it<br /> And offers her tears of gratitude.<br /> Finally he takes shelter in the elder brother's affection<br /> When his elder brother writes his sister on his behalf.<br /> Or the father sends an affectionate letter to the son<br /> And the son's joy knows no bounds.<br /> While observing me,<br /> You have made me into a small existence-reality.<br /> You call me only an envelope, but you should know<br /> That it is I who roam from one place to another,<br /> From one country to another.<br /> Always I have the capacity to fly in the plane.<br /> Darkness I see not,<br /> Fear I see not,<br /> Sorrow I do not have for my own existence.<br /> But I identify myself with all and sundry.<br /> In their happiness, in their joy<br /> I am one.<br /> How will it ever be possible for you<br /> To pay your debt to me, O foolish humanity?</p>
