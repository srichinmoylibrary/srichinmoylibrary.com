<p>The higher worlds are within us and not without. When we concentrate, when we meditate, when we contemplate, we enter into these higher worlds. When we concentrate dynamically, we near the door of these higher worlds. When we meditate soulfully, we enter into the room divine. When we contemplate unreservedly and unconditionally, we reach God's Throne.</p>
<p>Since we aspire to enter into the higher worlds, we pray to the cosmic gods. We feel that the cosmic gods will come to our aid and help us enter the higher worlds.</p>
<p>Here at this point I would like to invoke the soul of Marcus Aurelius:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Either the gods have the power to assist us or they have not. If they have not, what does praying to them signify? If they have, why do you not pray that they would remove your desires rather than satisfy them, set you above fear rather than keep away the thing you are afraid of?"</p>
