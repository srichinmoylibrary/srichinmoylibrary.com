<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If he is sincere, the older one Will be very humble because he knows how great his Father is in comparison to him. A spiritual Master is like a mother. The mother has more wisdom than the child, but she does not feel superior. She merely feels it is her bounden duty to offer her light to her son. The inner bond, the bond of oneness, is so strong that the mother never feels superior. Similarly, if the older brother is spiritual, if he is sincerely devoted to God, he will feel that it is his duty to teach others what someone else has taught him.</p>
<p>The feeling of superiority comes only when we are not spiritual. Then ego comes to the fore. But if we are spiritual, the first thing we try to do is surrender our individuality and become universal. When we become universal, the question of ego or superiority does not arise at all. I know something; so I am sharing it with you. If I have a fruit, I will get the greatest joy if I can share it with the members of my family. If I eat it all by myself, I will only be acting like a greedy fellow and I will not get the deepest satisfaction.</p>  </div>
