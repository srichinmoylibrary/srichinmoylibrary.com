<p>God, do You really care for me?<br /> If not, this very day let us part for good.<br /> “Son, I really care for you.’<br /> Then, Father, let us peacefully stay together.<br /> Father, do You really need me?<br /> If not, this very day, let us part for good.<br /> “Son, I really need you.’<br /> Then, Father, let us happily stay together.</p>
