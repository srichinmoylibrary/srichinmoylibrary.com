<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Shall I have to change it into a silver boat just for you, because you are a doubter? Absolutely there is a golden boat. It is not symbolic; it is real. It is golden not only in consciousness but also in colour. Each Master has a colour. In my case I have blue and gold. Blue is the colour of Infinity. Sri Krishnaâ€™s light was blue. Mine is blue and gold. The golden colour is necessary. The golden colour is for manifestation. When it touches the physical plane it becomes reddish. But my boat is actually golden. It is not just a word I am using. It is the reality of the boat itself. The colour of the boat is golden, and that boat really exists. You are bound to see it some day.</p>  </div>
