<blockquote>
<p>Indian hospitality has always been gracious. It is perhaps an extension of the embracing nature of Indian philosophy.</p>
<p><em>Society Based on Human Values</em><br /><em>by Ranasinghe Premadasa</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indian philosophy calls for the acceptance of life and the oneness of human beings. God is the life-tree, and each country is like a branch of the tree. In His Self-Transcendence God is One, and in His Self-Manifestation God is many. Therefore, God is at once the host and the guest.</p>  </div>
