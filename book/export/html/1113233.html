<p>Playground. Nolini-da said: "Last time I took you from Manik Tola garden to the jail. Today I will tell you about the life we led there for a year. A certain court officer said to Sri Aurobindo: 'Aurobindo, so at last you are caught; you are caught. Sri Aurobindo said to him immediately: 'And yet I will escape; I will escape!'"</p>
<p>Nolini-da's account of this significant incident produced a most thrilling and illumining effect in my heart.</p>
<p>"To continue, I have divided my jail life into two parts. This time I shall tell you about our stay in the cell. I hope next time I shall be able to tell you about our court life.</p>  </div>
