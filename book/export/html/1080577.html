<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Impossible! Absence of doubt is one thing, but faith, real faith, is something else. You may not doubt someone, but that does not mean that you are indulging in blind faith. There are many people who do not doubt the capacity of a spiritual teacher or Master, but they do not have so-called blind faith in that spiritual Master. They do not doubt his spiritual height. But that does not mean that they are going to have infinite faith in what he advises them to do in their business life or their mental life. These are two different things altogether. One may not have doubt, but one may have a neutral feeling. Real faith in a true spiritual Master is nothing but wisdom-light. My sympathetic feeling towards a spiritual Master does not mean that I will go and touch his feet.</p>  </div>
