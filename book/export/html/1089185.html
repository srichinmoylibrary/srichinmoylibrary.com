<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am going to Hiroshima to offer my dedicated service. This service will be in the form of my prayerful peace offering to the people of Hiroshima and all of Japan.</p>
<p>Destruction can never bring about peace. Many years ago Hiroshima and Nagasaki suffered destruction, and the peace that the world felt was no peace at all. It was only an experience of destruction. It is only when we pray and meditate and try to feel our oneness with all human beings that we get peace. So I wish to offer my prayer and meditation for the peace that I am talking about.</p>  </div>
