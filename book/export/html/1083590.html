<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we fail, God tells us, "My sweet children, your case is not hopeless. Your disease is not incurable. And you are not past correction." God further tells us, "My sweet children, you are My only hope. In you is the fulfilment-seed of My ultimate Promise. For you is My Infinity's and Eternity's All."</p>  </div>
