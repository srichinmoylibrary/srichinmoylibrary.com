<p>In America, the Absolute Supreme chose Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to be the unparalleled student of Mahatma Gandhi and his message of non-violence.</p>
<p>Dr. King introduced the principle of non-violence to his brothers and sisters who were struggling for equal rights in all spheres of life. His momentous words were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He who himself hurts the creatures, or gets them hurt by others, augments the world's hostility towards himself.</p>
<p>â€” Lord Mahavira</p>
