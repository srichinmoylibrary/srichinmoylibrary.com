<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Actually, my elder brother Chitta gave me this name. In India, it is not always the parents who give names to their children. Sometimes other members of the family may give the names. My brother Chitta is quite a bit older than I am. Before I was born, he had a few dreams in which he clearly saw that a spiritual figure would be born into his family, and it was he who chose this name.</p>  </div>
