<p>I am inviting all the disciples to submit peculiar, funny, and charming ideas for things I can do on November 17th which is my 14th weightlifting anniversary. Once again we shall be doing these things for the public.</p>
<p>All my daily lifts I will do up to the maximum so that the guests can see my progress, plus I want to show some new things. In the old days, I lifted pumpkins and all that. If you can come up with new ideas, I will be very happy.</p>
