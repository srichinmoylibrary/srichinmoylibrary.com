<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What the Christ said is extremely important. People who only believe what they see with their naked eyes are only eating half the fruit. If you want to scrutinise the Truth to see whether it has a tail or a nose, then you will lose it. Truth is a matter of identification. This is the Christ’s pronouncement about faith and doubt. Blessed are those who have faith without demanding proof at every moment.</p>  </div>
