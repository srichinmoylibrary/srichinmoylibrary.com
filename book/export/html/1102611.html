<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best approach is to see and feel that you are the very thing that you are seeking. You eternally are this reality, but right now you are not aware of it. Therefore, you have to cry for that which you already are. But it has to be a psychic cry. If you really want God's Beauty, then just cry and cry. But first you have to ask yourself if you really want God's Beauty. Is it just mental curiosity that is driving you to this reality or do you desperately need it? If you feel that you desperately need this reality, if you feel that you want God's Beauty not because it will give you something but because without God's Beauty you cannot exist, then it becomes the only reality in your life. There can be nothing else for you. At that time, naturally you will be living in God's Beauty.</p>
