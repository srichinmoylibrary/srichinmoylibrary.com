<h2>Question: I sometimes feel that negative forces are occupying me. They're not part of me, but they seem to be located on the left side of my body.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They are already stationed inside your body. On the left side of the body is our earth-consciousness and on the right side is our Heaven-consciousness. So, the left side has more darkness than the right side. When you feel the pressure of the negative forces, that is where the earth-consciousness lies.</p>  </div>
