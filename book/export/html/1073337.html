<p>True Masters of all ages have respected one another's teachings and admired one another's spiritual achievements. Each subsequent Master offers a new impetus to earth-awakening, earth-transformation and earth-perfection, being constantly conscious of his source of Light and Life: the Absolute Supreme. Far from being inner rivals, they are loving and devoted brothers. In this small volume Sri Chinmoy reveals his intimate inner connection with his brother the Christ through poems, aphorisms and dramatic dialogues.</p>  </div>
