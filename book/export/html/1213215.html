<p><em>Madal:</em></p>
<p>Chinmoy, sometimes your answers to spiritual questions are <em>laconic</em> and sometimes they are not. Why is it so?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>Madal, usually when the audience is very receptive, my answers are not <em>brief</em> at all. It depends on the magnetic pull of the questioner â€” that is to say, the sincere necessity of the questioner. If the questioner is sincere and the audience is receptive, my answer can never be brief, for God has kindly given me a few most delicious fruits to share with them. These fruits are peace, light and bliss.</p>  </div>
