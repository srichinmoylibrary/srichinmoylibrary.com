<p><em>Seko:</em> In the Tokyo Marathon â€” 2:08:36.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> But didn't something happen during that marathon and you could have done better?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> Once towards the end of the Fukuoka Marathon I was ready to do a 100-metre dash to pass Ikangaa.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In one marathon you took off your hat.</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> When I threw off my hat during the Los Angeles Olympic marathon, at that time the temperature had gone down and I felt cooler. That is why I took it off.</p>  </div>
