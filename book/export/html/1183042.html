<p>“I have stayed with him for seven long years. He says that he is all compassion for me, no matter what kind of life I lead. He told us that his compassion is the strongest power. So how is it that the strongest power cannot save me from my indulgent life? If he really had compassion, he would have cured me totally, for he knows how I suffer. His compassion has no power. If it had power, I would not keep going back again and again to the lower life of sense-gratification. If he does not have power, what good is it to keep him as my Master? And if he has power but does not use it to transform my nature, what is the use of having him?</p>
<p>“He told me, ‘Do anything you like, but stay.’ But if he really has compassion, why do I do this kind of thing? To realise God I came here. Why am I not realising God? If he had really realised God, he would have given me realisation. The best thing is to have realisation in my own way and not the Master’s way.”</p>
<p>So this disciple left the path.</p>  </div>
