<p>My dear Lord,<br /> We are Your children.<br /> How is it<br /> That You have not made us<br /> As happy as You are?<br /> "My child,<br /> Your way of happiness<br /> And My Way of happiness<br /> Are two totally different things."<br /> My dear Lord,<br /> When I say happiness,<br /> What I mean is<br /> My supremacy-declaration.<br /> "My child,<br /> When I say happiness,<br /> What I mean is<br /> My Oneness-Satisfaction.<br /> "You cannot and do not claim Me<br /> As your own, very own.<br /> Therefore you are unhappy.<br /> But I can and do claim you<br /> As My own, very own.<br /> Therefore I am happy."</p>
