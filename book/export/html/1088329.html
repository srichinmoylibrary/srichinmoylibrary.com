<p>A highly respected man had been suffering from a kidney problem for a long time, and the doctors were not able to cure him. He was a disciple of Bhaskarananda, so he went to his Master and cried and cried to him for help.</p>
<p>The Master concentrated on his disciple and then said, "Well, I don't have to do anything for you, and the doctors do not have to do anything either. Just wait for thirty-nine days. After thirty-nine days your kidney problem will be totally cured."</p>
<p>At the end of thirty-nine days, the man was totally cured.</p>
<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>True, time cures everything, but we have to know that inside time is God's Will. If God's Will does not operate in and through time, then time is like a lifeless bud that has no soul, no eternal life.</p>  </div>
