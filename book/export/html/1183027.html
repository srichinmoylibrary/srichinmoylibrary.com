<p>One day a woman disciple said to the Master, “Master, why do you criticise the astrologers so mercilessly?”</p>
<p>The Master said, “I just make fun of astrologers from time to time. I never intend to hurt them.”</p>
<p>“Master, I am an astrologer. People on this island believe in astrology. They have tremendous faith in it. Therefore, they have all admiration for me. I told them that this whole land would sink into the ocean by such and such a day. You told the radio station and television station that nothing was going to happen and, unfortunately, nothing <em>did</em> happen. I and my astrologer-friends were absolutely sure that this island of ours was going to be washed away. Now that our prophecy has not come true, everybody is laughing at us. We all know that you are the culprit. It was you who used your occult power to negate our prophecy. Otherwise, our prophecy would have undoubtedly come true.”</p>
<p>The Master said to her smilingly, “I have nothing else to do with myself but use occult power to prove that you or your colleagues are wrong.”</p>
<p>She said to the Master, “You are not only an occultist of the first order, but also a liar of the first order. You have deceived the whole of our island. Therefore, I hate you and I am leaving your path immediately.”</p>  </div>
