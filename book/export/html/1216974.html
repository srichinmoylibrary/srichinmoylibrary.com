<p>Today we went to a smaller than the smallest restaurant. I asked for mango lassi, but instead the girl brought me a mango juice.</p>
<p>I said that it couldn't be a lassi, but she said it was. After ten minutes another girl came. She smiled and said that they had made a mistake.</p>
<p>Then they brought me a mango lassi. So I got two drinks. Because they made a mistake, they didn't want to charge me for both. But I became generous and said, "No, no! I will pay."</p>
