<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I say somebody has a beautiful soul, it does not mean he has a certain coloured aura. It means that the person has received Light, Peace and Delight from above to a considerable extent, and that these divine qualities have come to the fore in him and are being manifested in the earth-consciousness. It may be, however, that the possessor of these qualities is not aware of them. But when a Master discloses the fact, the seeker gets the immediate opportunity to recognise them, increase them and utilise them for a divine cause in his own life and in the life of aspiring humanity.</p>  </div>
