<p>The Consul General had three secretaries. The main one, an elderly man named Ganesh, joined our path and became my disciple. But one day when he came to the Centre to meditate, an elderly lady screamed like anything and fainted, creating a scene during the meditation. It was all pretense, to draw attention. Anyway, the Consul Generalâ€™s secretary got frightened. Afterwards he saw me another two or three times on the street and offered me his most respectful pranams, although he stopped coming.</p>  </div>
