<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You know how many desires you had before you launched into the spiritual life. And you can also count how many desires you now have. Previously perhaps you had twenty desires at a time, but now there are days when you donâ€™t have even one desire. This is significant. When your desires diminish, you have to know that you are making real progress and running toward your goal.</p>  </div>
