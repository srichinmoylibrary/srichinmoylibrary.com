<p>I went into a video store and said, "I would like to buy a nice, spiritual Hindi movie."</p>
<p>The shopkeeper said, "For you, it will be free."</p>
<p>I said, "I don't take anything free."</p>
<p>He said, "We sell it for $12. For you, $10."</p>
<p>I said, "Fine."</p>
<p>There was one movie named "Trishul." I said, "I have a student named Trishul, so I will take this one."</p>
<p>The man said, "Oh no, Swamiji. That is not for you!"</p>
<p>See how nice the shopkeeper was. He knew that it was a romantic movie. He was sincere.</p>
