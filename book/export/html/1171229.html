<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not just us, but everybody who practises prayer and meditation! Heart-power means prayer and meditation; heart-power comes from spirituality. When I pray, I feel that Somebody is listening to me. When I meditate, I feel that Somebody is advising me or telling me to do the right thing and be the right person. Prayer and meditation must go together. When I pray, I am asking Someone: “Give me light, give me joy, give me peace and bliss.” When I meditate, Somebody is saying: “This is the way you can have peace. If you do this, you can have peace. If you do that, you can have light and bliss.” So prayer and meditation have to go together.</p>  </div>
