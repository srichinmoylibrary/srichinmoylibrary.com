SCA 940-944. Excerpts from an interview with <em>Pravda</em> which took place at Aspiration-Ground on 10 June 1990. Dr. Felix Kuznetsov and his wife were also present on that occasion.</p>
<h2><em>Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart</em></h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy first lifts the reporter overhead as part of his</em> Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart <em>programme. Before the lift, the singers sing the song</em> Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart.</p>
<p><em>Reporter [while standing on the lifting platform]:</em> This is like going to paradise, with the angels singing.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy [after lifting the reporter once]:</em> I would like to lift you once more. You are our sister-friend from the Soviet Union, whereas I am from India. India and the Soviet Union are extremely, extremely good friends. Therefore, I would like to lift you a second time. The first time I lifted you, I offered my love and gratitude to the Soviet Union. Now when I lift you, I shall be offering my love and gratitude to the soul of India. May the soul of the Soviet Union and the soul of India forever and forever enjoy their unique friendship and eternal oneness.</p>
<p><em>Reporter [after descending from the lifting platform]:</em> Thank you! It was great!</p>  </div>
