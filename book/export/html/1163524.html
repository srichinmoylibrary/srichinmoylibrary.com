<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you say that you have to become totally pure before you can aspire, then I say that that day will never dawn. If you have to become one hundred per cent pure and chaste, then you will have to wait for Eternity. It is true that one has to be purified to some extent; otherwise when the Divine Power enters into us then everything is spoiled. It creates more confusion than joy. There can be no Creation, divine Creation. But aspiration and purification must go together. If you aspire, then you will have purification in your own nature; and if you have purification in your own nature, then your aspiration will be more intense, it will reach the peak. So, nobody is perfect. Nobody can dare to say that after his nature's perfection he will start meditating. What is the use of meditation and concentration if he is already perfect? Chastity and purity come only from inner aspiration; they have to go side by side. One complements the other; one fulfils the other.</p>  </div>
