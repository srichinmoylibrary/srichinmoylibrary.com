<p>Peace: God's Dream-Reality's Oneness-Boat, Fulness-Shore.</p>
<p>Peace is the aspiration-cry of man's heart in God's Compassion-Eye. Peace is the Satisfaction-Smile of God's Heart in man's perfection-life. Peace is in man's renunciation of his desire-life. This peace is superb. Peace is in man's acceptance and transcendence of his present-day reality-life. This peace is divine. Peace is in man's sleeplessly unconditional surrender to God's Will. This peace is supreme.</p>
<p>If I want peace, if I need peace in this world and from this world, then I must demand peace from my own heart, my own mind, my own vital and my own body.</p>
<p>Peace is at once God's transcendental and universal Language. Each seeker, during his Heaven-ascending prayers and earth-transforming meditations, must learn this language from God Himself. This peace-language only the Inner Pilot can teach a truth-seeker and God-lover. Here we are at Tokyo University. I am offering my heart's loving and soulful gratitude to the aspiring students and illumining teachers of this university. I am offering them my heart's divine love-songs and I am requesting them to spread their hearts' flower-fragrance all over the world.</p>
<p><em>(Sri Chinmoy sings a song he composed for Tokyo.)</em></p>
<p>My aspiring life sees, feels and knows that Japan is beauty's flower-garden. A flower immediately gives me joy, and inside this joy I immediately feel peace in my outer life. A good thought also gives me immediate joy, and inside this joy I immediately feel peace in my inner life. My outer peaceful joy is illumining. My inner peaceful joy is fulfilling. I pray to God for the inseparable oneness of my outer peaceful joy and my inner peaceful joy.</p>
<p>From the inmost recesses of my heart I am praying to the Liberator, Lord Buddha, to inundate the aspiring consciousness of Japan, his Immortality's choice abode, with his Infinity's Peace.</p>
<p>It is here in Japan that Hiroshima and Nagasaki became the untold destruction-sufferers. May Hiroshima and Nagasaki become the two harbinger-peace-givers for the entire peace-longing world.</p>
<p>Peace: God's Dream-Reality's Oneness-Boat, Fulness-Shore. Peace. Peace. Peace.</p>
