<p>While I was watching the videotape of my run in North Carolina, I couldn't believe my eyes. I know that I am not a strong runner, but the videotape showed that I looked very strong — like another Bholanath. In the chest, back and thighs, there appeared to be so much strength!</p>
<p>At the same time, I was seeing the speed of a dead elephant and I was feeling and identifying with the dead elephant-runner in myself. I said, "If I really have that much strength, why am I going so slowly?"</p>
