<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely not. But if you just keep your eyes open and look at me, then naturally you are not sleeping. When you see something, you get inspiration. From inspiration you go to aspiration and from aspiration you go to realisation. Only when your eyes are closed are you enjoying sleep.</p>  </div>
