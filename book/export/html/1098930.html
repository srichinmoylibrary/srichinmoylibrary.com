<p>Ida had been married several times. On my second day in Minneapolis, her third husband came to see me. He was a great scientist. We argued and argued and, as usual, I was condemning his science. Meanwhile, he was also saying very nasty things about spirituality. We had become good friends and we were enjoying our debate. At one point, I was looking at him and then he said to me, “I do not believe in God, but I believe in Light, and when you meditate I see Light inside you.”</p>
<p>That is how our argument ended. His philosophy was like that of the Buddhists. They do not believe in God, but they do believe in Light.</p>  </div>
