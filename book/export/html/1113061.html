<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My path is very simple. At least it seems so to me. Here we have a spiritual ladder and this ladder has only three rungs: love, devotion and surrender. And then, when we are very advanced, we have three more rungs in our ladder: realisation, revelation and manifestation. First love, devotion and surrender; and then, when realisation takes place, one step upward we go to revelation and then one step to manifestation.</p>
<p>Human love we all know. After five or ten years, it is all frustration. Why? Because with human love we try to bind others and then, to our sorrow, we see that others have already bound us. We want to possess and be possessed, and the result is frustration. This is human love. But in divine love there is constant expansion. We expand on the strength of our identification with somebody else or with the whole world. Divine love does not bind anybody; it just helps us to expand our consciousness. At the same time, we see others expanding their consciousness through divine love. In divine love we don't bind; we only expand and enlarge our consciousness together.</p>  </div>
