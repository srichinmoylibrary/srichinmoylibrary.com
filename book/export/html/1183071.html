<p>“My first husband left me because I was an idiot, unreliable. The present one left the path and left me because he felt that his daughters from a previous marriage were more affectionate to him than I. Since the Master does not or cannot please me by keeping my husband faithful only to me, it is better to look for another path.”</p>
<p>So this woman left the Master.</p>  </div>
