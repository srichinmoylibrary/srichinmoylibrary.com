  <h1 class="book-heading">Here</h1>
  
 
<p><em>H</em> — represents humility. Without humility my spirituality is curiosity, my spirituality is futility.</p>
<p><em>E</em> — represents eternity. With faith my spirituality is eternity's wealth, my spirituality is eternity's delight.</p>
<p><em>R</em> — represents revelation. Without devotion to God's self-revelation in me, my life is a breathless hush, my life is the song of death.</p>
<p><em>E</em> — represents evolution. With my surrender's light I am God's ever-blooming and expanding evolution. I become the selfless link between His Infinity and His Immortality, I become His Vision's Reality and His Reality's Vision.</p>  </div>
