<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have time and space to measure our capacity: what we were, what we are and what we shall become. We do not want to remain forever at the same level. If we stay all the time in one particular consciousness, then we are acting like a stagnant pool. We have to be like a running river. A river has to flow towards the sea. A pool does not flow. We can decorate it, we can make it beautiful, but since there is no movement, no constant progress, it will not give us the ever-transcending joy. When we enter into the world of progress, we get the greatest joy because we are all the time transcending. Time and space inspire us to transcend ourselves.</p>  </div>
