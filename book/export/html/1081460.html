<h2>The giver and the receiver</h2>

<p>My Lord Supreme, You accept front me my hungry desires as though these things are tremendously valuable.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, You accept from me my teeming worries and anxieties as though these things are extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, You accept from me my poisonous doubts as though these things are remarkably meaningful.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, You accept from me my untiring insecurity and my unending impurity as though these things are going to adorn Your Heart.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, You accept from me my ocean-vast ingratitude as though it is something that is going to richly satisfy You.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, when You give me Your Peace, Your Love, Your Joy, Your Compassion and Your divine Blessings in boundless measure, I get joy, true. But Your Joy, while giving, far surpasses my joy in spite of the fact that I am the receiver and You are the giver.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, when I give You my undivine qualities unreservedly, You get much more joy and satisfaction in receiving than I get in giving.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, You are always great. You are always good. Will there ever be a time when I shall be able to defeat You in anything?</p>
<p>"My child, you have already defeated Me."</p>
<p>I have defeated You? Impossible, my Lord, impossible! How can I ever defeat You? Tell me, how?</p>
<p>"My child, I need you infinitely more than you need Me. My need for you far surpasses your need for Me. Does this not prove that you have defeated Me badly?</p>
<p>"Now let Me explain to you this secret and sacred philosophy of Mine. You do not know who you are, but I know who you are. You think that you are ignorance incarnate, but I see you as an experience of Mine. I see you as My own evolving Life. I see you as My own dream-manifesting Reality.</p>
<p>"It is not you; it is I. It is not yours; it is Mine. It is I who am always in the process of unveiling and becoming, and becoming and unveiling. Thus it is I who sing in and through you My Eternity's Song: Oneness. It is I who dance in and through you My Infinity's Dance: Perfection. It is I who cry and smile, and smile and cry, in and through you My Immortality's Silence-Sound: Satisfaction."</p>
