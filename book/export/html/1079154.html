<p>My Lord, my Lord, my Lord, this moment I think that You are mine, absolutely mine. The next moment I feel that I am Yours, only Yours. Is there any difference between these two feelings, or are they the same thing? My Lord, do illumine me.</p>
<p>"My child, My child, there is a great difference.. When you think that I am yours, you are ready to climb up high, higher, highest to reach My transcendental Heights. When you feel that you are Mine, I am ready to descend into the abysmal abyss of your ignorance-life for your complete illumination and perfect perfection."</p>
