<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He has to be brave. He has to be indifferent if necessity demands. People will say that he is very bad, very callous, but he has to remain with his conviction. Each individual here has the capacity to be a divine warrior, but he or she does not exercise that power.</p>  </div>
