<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now the existence of God is only a belief for you. But you have to know that one day this belief will change to reality. When you have seen inside yourself the infinite Peace, infinite Joy, infinite Love, at that time reality will dawn in your belief and you will get total fulfilment.</p>  </div>
