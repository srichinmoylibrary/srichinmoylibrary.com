<h2>Editor's note</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy had answered a question in which he said, "You will grow with the one thought, 'God wants me and I need God.' There should be no other thought around you. Then you will see that slowly, steadily and gradually, God's divine thoughts are entering into you and permeating your whole inner and outer existence. Then you will have tranquillity in your body, in your vital, in your mind. Please try."</em></p>
<p><em>The following question referred to this answer.</em></p>  </div>
