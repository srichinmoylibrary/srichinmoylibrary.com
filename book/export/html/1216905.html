<p>While travelling from Canada to New York, our bus stopped at the Canadian border. As I was coming out of the washroom, two customs officers came up to me very suspiciously. One said, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>Just a few minutes before that they had caught a man trying to smuggle a lady in under his car seat. So now they thought they were catching me.</p>
<p>But the other officer said, "He was on the bus."</p>
<p>At that hour of the night they hadn't expected so many people. Our crowded bus was disturbing their sleep.</p>
