<p>Your mind wants to know<br /> Where I was born<br /> And what I do.<br /> Well, I was born in the bosom of night,<br /> And I sleep and sleep,<br /> I descend and descend.</p>
<p>Your heart wants to know<br /> Where I was born<br /> And what I do.<br /> Well, I was born in the heart of Light,<br /> And I long and long,<br /> I ascend and ascend.</p>
<p>Your soul wants to know<br /> Where I was born<br /> And what I do.<br /> Well, I was born on the lap of Delight,<br /> And I smile and smile,<br /> I transcend and transcend.</p>
