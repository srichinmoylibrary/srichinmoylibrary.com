<p>The Christ sees white in Judas’ heart. . .</p>
<p>The child of Mary came to preach Love and Surrender to God and establish on earth the Kingdom of Heaven. He brought our soul to the fore and declared: “I and my Father are one.”</p>
<p>The tenet of Christ — love thy neighbour as thyself — has been interpreted by Tagore with a new orientation. He opines that it is not an ordinary precept; here the emphasis is not on loving one’s own neighbour but on loving as one’s own self.</p>  </div>
