<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to have utmost inner wealth, the best thing is to go to the Highest, the Absolute. Instead of going to an angel for two hundred dollars, why not go to the One who has billions of dollars?</p>
<p>We have to be so wise. If our goal is only to have a small amount, then we shall go to the one who has only two hundred dollars. It depends on how much inner hunger we have. If I am extremely hungry, then I will try to go to a place where I will get a most delicious meal. If I am not hungry, then a cup of tea is enough for me. It depends on our inner hunger and how much inner wealth we want.</p>  </div>
