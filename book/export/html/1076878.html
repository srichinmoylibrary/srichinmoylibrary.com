<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is located at 659 Miramar Avenue, Santurce.</p>
<p><em>So that is not too far from here?</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not far.</p>
<p><em>And you have these meetings every evening?</em></p>
<p>Every evening and on Sundays in the morning at eleven o'clock.</p>
<p><em>You are not here yourself constantly, are you?</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am the spiritual director of the Centre but I live in New York. I have four Centres: one here in Puerto Rico, one in Miami, Florida, one in Jamaica, West Indies and the main one in New York City.</p>
<p><em>So you travel between the four of them? How long have you had your Centre in San Juan?</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It completed its second year on the twentieth of July.</p>  </div>
