<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Longing itself is meditation. You cannot separate inner longing from meditation. Outer longing or desire for name, fame, money and material possessions is simply foolish. Inner longing is the cry for oneness with the Source. That is a form of meditation. You are a secretary. While you are typing, if you type most soulfully in order to become one with the Supreme in your spiritual Master or with God, that is real meditation. On the other hand, if you want to show that you can type better or more speedily than someone else, then that is not divine longing. Your longing has to be in the highest plane of consciousness. This is the longing that will make you feel one with the Supreme and with your Master. The longing that separates you from God but gives you outer success in various ways is not meditation. The longing that will consciously make you totally one with God is real meditation.</p>  </div>
