SCA 1057-1065. Questions asked at the Hotel Pedro de Valdivia, Chile, on 6 January 1987.</p>
<h2>Question: How can I always be happy?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can always be happy by doing two things. First, do not expect anything from anybody, including your Guru and the Supreme. Only give and give and give. Scientists have invented quite a few things. Now feel that you are going to invent something good, something absolutely new which nobody else has invented. What you will invent is this: you will give and give and give to humanity, to your Guru and to God, but you will not ask for anything in return. This is one way to be always happy.</p>
<p>The second way is to think of what you were before you accepted the spiritual life and what you are now. Even in your worst moments, you are not as bad as you were when you were not a seeker and had millions of desires. If you think of how much progress you have made, then you will be happy.</p>  </div>
