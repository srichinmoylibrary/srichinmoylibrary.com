<p>I saw Kanan in the market. He was alone. I asked him, "What is Hashi doing?"</p>
<p>Then I found out that Hashi was sick. Here many people have stomach problems. The sufferers suffer for at least a day or two. Somehow God saved me this morning. I was playing on my Australian instrument and I was feeling nauseous and sick in every possible way. But eventually it went away. I escaped. I was one of the lucky ones.</p>
