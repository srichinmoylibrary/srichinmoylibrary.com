<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Master's soul will recognise a higher consciousness in the disciples. If the Master does not know who, else will know? If you are a teacher, then you will know from your own knowledge whether the student is doing well or not. If you are a teacher, that means that you have already acquired some knowledge. You will compare your student's knowledge with Your own knowledge, and if his knowledge is near yours, then you will know that he is doing extremely well. But if he is nowhere near you, then you will simply say that he is a beginning student.</p>  </div>
