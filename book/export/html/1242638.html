<p>Mr. Devashishu Torpy, Master of Ceremonies</p>
<p>We are extremely happy and extremely grateful to welcome you here today to the <em>Lifting Up the World With a Oneness-Heart</em> Award programme. Sri Chinmoy has travelled throughout the length and breadth of the globe to honour in his own unique way men and women of inspiration and dedication from all walks of life. In appreciation and gratitude for their world-serving contributions, he has presented this signal award to presidents, prime ministers, members of parliament, religious leaders from all faiths, Nobel laureates, outstanding artists, musicians, poets and athletes. Sri Chinmoy also wishes to honour citizens on the grass-roots level who are serving others in extraordinary ways. Through their lives of dedicated self-offering, all of our highly esteemed honorees, including each of you who has so kindly come here to Lady Margaret Hall today, have raised up the standard of humanity far beyond our imagination’s flight.</p>
<p>Just as a sports player here at the University of Oxford is lifted up out of joy and enthusiasm by his teammates, so too, Sri Chinmoy, in a spirit of sincere gratitude, lifts each recipient overhead with one arm from the honorary platform. The 2,000th person to receive the <em>Lifting Up the World With a Oneness-Heart</em> Award was President Nelson Mandela. The 6,000th honoree was the immortal boxing legend Muhammad Ali, just a few days ago.</p>
<p>Each one of our guests here today is offering something most significant through his or her own unique endeavours. Here at the University of Oxford, you are striving to develop our understanding not only of the world around us, but also of our own nature. With this Award, Sri Chinmoy seeks to emphasise that we can all go far beyond our previous limits and achieve the impossible if, as he says, “we can only dare to have faith in the power of our inner potential.”</p>
<p>In this light, Sri Chinmoy and all of us present offer you our most heartfelt welcome and congratulate you on soon receiving the <em>Lifting Up the World With a Oneness-Heart Award</em>.</p>
<p>We would like to invite our guests to come and be lifted by Sri Chinmoy.</p>
<p>In most cases, Sri Chinmoy will be lifting two professors simultaneously. Before we start the actual lifting, Sri Chinmoy would like to offer the Lifting Up the World With a Oneness-Heart Award to Professor Alison Brading.</p>  </div>
