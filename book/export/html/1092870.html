<p>Even after Subhas Chandra's heart was torn by the shameless resignation of most of the Congress Working Committee members; even after his power as President was seriously curtailed by the requirement to seek Gandhi-ji's approval for new members of the Working Committee-even then, Subhas desperately tried to compromise with Gandhi-ji, but Gandhi-ji was unyielding. Thus, Subhas had no other course but to tender his resignation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After mature deliberation, therefore, and in an entirely helpful spirit, I am placing my resignation in your hands."</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
