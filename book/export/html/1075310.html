<p>WORRY</p>
<p>Worry! Worry!<br /> Why do you worry?<br /> Just pray in the morning,<br /> Concentrate at noon,<br /> Meditate in the evening,<br /> Contemplate at night.<br /> That's all!<br /> Look, your worries are buried<br /> In oblivion-hush.</p>
<p>Worry! Worry!<br /> Why do you worry?<br /> Turn around:<br /> Look, God is looking at you.<br /> Enter into your mind:<br /> Look, God is devotedly thinking of you.<br /> Enter into your heart:<br /> Look, God is all for you.<br /> Enter into your soul:<br /> Look, God has already done<br /> Everything for you.</p>
