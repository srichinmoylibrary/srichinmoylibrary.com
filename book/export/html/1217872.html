 <p>
In this series of six anecdotes, Sri Chinmoy tells of his amusing (and sometimes frightening) experiences in the New York City subways during the years 1964-65.</p>
<h2>III. Indians cannot tell a lie</h2>

<p>I was going to the apartment of my sister-disciple Kailas-ben, whose affection can only be felt and never described. I went to the 14th Street Subway Station and bought a token. I dropped it into the slot, but the turnstile did not move. Completely confused, I was about to go to the station master to buy another token, but he had already seen my difficulty. He came over to me.</p>
<p>"Did you put a token in?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>
<p>"Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>"India," was my answer.</p>
<p>"India!" he exclaimed. "Indians cannot tell a lie. Had you been a youth from another country, I would not let you through. Those boys don't have a pennyworth of sincerity. But you Indians have yet to learn how to tell a lie." Thereupon he allowed me to go through the turnstile.</p>
<p>On entering the train, I shed tears and thanked the Divine in him, for he had seen the India of the hoary past and has yet to learn about the India of today.</p>  </div>
