<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, an artist can do it very beautifully. Very recently when I was in Iceland, I met an artist who was also a very successful medium, though in spirituality she still needed tremendous progress. I showed her and her group how to concentrate, meditate and contemplate. And while I was doing this, she actually saw my golden aura and my blue aura. She was sitting right in front of me, and while she was there, she drew a picture of my aura. Spiritually she is not very developed yet, but as an artist I must say she drew my aura very successfully.</p>  </div>
