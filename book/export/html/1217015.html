<p>For so many years I have not had any connection with the Emperor of Japan. Even when I was first lifting weights in Japan and praying for him, his soul did not come to me. But last night, at one-thirty in the morning, for the first time his soul came to me.</p>
<p>Now I see in the newspaper that the Emperor has died.</p>
