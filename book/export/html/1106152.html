<p>For a long time I was very particular in not allowing the disciples to listen to the prayers that I said each morning before attempting to lift 303 1/2 pounds. Even when replaying the video, I would deliberately turn down the volume and fast forward the tape at that point. When I eventually wanted a book to be printed containing all these prayers, many disciples expressed surprise that I was making them available after such a long time. Significantly, I decided to reveal my prayers after I had successfully lifted the 300-pound weight.</p>
