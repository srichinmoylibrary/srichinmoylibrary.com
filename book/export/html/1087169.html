<p>In Calcutta a young man about 20 years old was selling handkerchiefs on the street right behind our hotel. He said, "If you buy a dozen, I will give you one free."</p>
<p>I asked him, "If I buy five dozen, will you give me five free?" He said, "Of course." He was insulting me in Bengali as if I didn't know Bengali.</p>
<p>He counted out twelve and then started counting out the second dozen. I said, "I won't get one free?"</p>
<p>He said, "No, let me first count out five dozen."</p>
<p>After he had counted out the second dozen, he felt sorry for me and he added one extra to the pile.</p>
<p>I said, "Now you are supposed to give me two."</p>
<p>Again he said, "No, I will give them to you later."</p>
<p>After he had counted out five dozen, I said, "Now you have to give me four more."</p>
<p>He said, "No, I was just tempting you! I will give you only one extra."</p>
<p>I said, "Then I don't want any." He said, "No, you should feel sympathy for me because it took such a long time to count out five dozen."</p>
<p>So sympathy won over temptation, and I got only one extra.</p>
