<p>The other day I went out to run at a quarter to four in the morning. I could not believe so many shops were open at that hour here in Bangkok.</p>
<p>Everywhere life is the same. On 150th Street there is construction and here it is the same story. Wherever I tried to run, there was construction.</p>
