<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While we are sleeping the soul may reminisce about its past achievements and try to envision its future possibilities for God-manifestation. In deep inner sleep, the soul gets a kind of confidence that life's outer turmoils are not affecting the inner parts of the seeker's being.</p>  </div>
