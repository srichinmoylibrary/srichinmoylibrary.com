<p>Before the dawn of civilisation and after the dawn of civilisation, what the world saw and has always seen has been an endless series of fights, battles and wars. Humanity could have easily avoided the destructive experiences of the hoary past if it had longed for a higher vision and a deeper reality.</p>
<p>U Thant the reality-dreamer says to us: <em>“In the wake of the most catastrophic war in the history of mankind, humanity had a new vision: it saw the glimmer of dawn of a warless world.”</em></p>
<p>Humanity’s preparation depends on humanity’s willingness. Humanity’s willingness depends on humanity’s consecrated surrender to God’s Will. A oneness-world either in the near or in the distant future is not only possible and practicable, but inevitable. A oneness-world expedites God’s Hour, and it is only in God’s Hour that humanity’s agelong hunger drinks in Divinity’s Nectar-Delight.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the fruit of the Immortals is for mortals, too, for God the finite reality and God the Reality infinite are inseparable. Together they are heading towards one goal: satisfaction in perfection.</p>  </div>
