<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Today you have received a great honour from your Master. The deeper within you go, the clearer will be the significance of this honour.</p>
<p>You are divine soldiers, supremely divine warriors, both in the inner world and in the outer world. If you discharge your divine duties soulfully, divinely and unconditionally, your Master will consider you his real divine instruments.</p>
<p>Unlike other soldiers, you will show your strength in an unprecedented way. You will show your capacity through politeness, softness, courtesy, humility and patience. Haughtiness, arrogance, restlessness, autocracy and the feeling of supremacy will never be allowed.</p>
<p>Your Master protects you from the inner intruders — fear, doubt, jealousy and other undivine forces, and in the outer world you will try to protect your Master from the outer intruders.</p>
<p>Here you have the golden opportunity to be of service to me. The significance, the value, the honour of today's achievement you will realise as the years pass by.</p>
