<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We use the term â€˜transcendental Consciousness'; again, we speak of the ever-transcending transcendental Consciousness. The transcendental Consciousness, <em>Turiya</em>, is the highest, but this transcendental Consciousness is not static. It is also constantly transcending itself. God is infinite, eternal and immortal; but all spiritual Masters know that God is also ever-progressing. God Himself is in the process of evolution. He is making progress, constant progress, in and through everyone in order to establish perfect Perfection on earth.</p>  </div>
