<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are only two ways: prayer and meditation. In meditation there are three stages: concentration, meditation and contemplation. Aspiration houses both prayer and meditation. If you have aspiration, that is the most important thing you need. This aspiration can be manifested in two different ways â€” either through your most soulful prayer or through concentration, meditation and contemplation. If you follow either path, you can reach your goal.</p>  </div>
