<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We will no longer want or need philosophy when we really do not want to remain in the confines of the mind. Right now we cherish our little mind-cottage. When we see with our mind’s eye, we see only a limited portion of reality. The mind-created philosophy cannot see the entire reality at a glance. It is satisfied with seeing reality little by little.</p>
<p>Only when we cherish the freedom of the unlimited will we no longer need philosophy. For that, we must be prepared to go far beyond the domain of the mind and enter into the realm of the heart. When we are no longer satisfied by staying inside the mind-cottage and we have a great hunger to become the reality itself, we will be ready to enter into the heart. The heart not only sees the entire reality at a glance but, on the strength of its identification, it becomes one with the limitless reality itself. At that time, we do not need any mind-created philosophy.</p>
<p>When the call of spirituality comes and if the seeker answers or accepts the call with utmost sincerity and purity, then he can dive into the sea of spirituality. When you enter into the sea of spirituality, you can swim and swim to your heart’s content and finally say good-bye to philosophy once and for all.</p>  </div>
