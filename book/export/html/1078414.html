<p>BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU JOKE</p>
<p>Be careful!<br /> Don't joke at earth's gate.<br /> Earth will bind you and blind you.</p>
<p>Be careful!<br /> Don't joke at Heaven's gate.<br /> Heaven may not accept you,<br /> Heaven may not bless you.</p>
<p>Be careful!<br /> Don't joke at God's Gate.<br /> He may employ you to guard His Gate,<br /> He may burden you with all<br /> His endless responsibilities.</p>
