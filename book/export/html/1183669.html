<p>During my childhood, I was known by the affectionate Bengali nickname Madal, meaning kettledrum — perhaps because I was always making so much noise! Sometimes my grandmother would find my liveliness too much for her, and she would say, “This kettledrum will bring about the total destruction of the family!”</p>
<p>My mother would protest confidently, “Nonsense! On the contrary, Madal is sure to bring us abundant name and fame. He is destined to be played on by the gods and goddesses in the skies!”</p>  </div>
