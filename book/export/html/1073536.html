<p><em>That evening, Sudhahota attended a public Peace Concert Sri Chinmoy offered in the Los Angeles area. At the end of the concert, the Master invited Sudhahota onto the stage to meditate with him and said:</em></p>
<p>This evening we are soulfully happy, divinely honoured and supremely proud to have with us the unparalleled champion hero-athlete of the 1984 Olympic Games, Carl Lewis. His Himalayan achievements not only have inspired and enlightened the length and breadth of the United States of America but also have heightened the athletic capacities of the entire world. He is at once today’s unprecedented greatness and tomorrow’s fathomless goodness in the firmament of athletics.</p>
<p><em>(Sri Chinmoy’s students then sang a song congratulating Sudhahota.)</em></p>  </div>
