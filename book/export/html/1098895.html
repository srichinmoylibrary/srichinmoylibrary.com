<p>Dr. Mishra also worked at India House. Then he started working at the United Nations.</p>
<p>In those days, on very rare occasions, Mr. Mehrotra would ask me to go to him for some reason. Dr. Mishra’s legs would be up on the table, and he would be enjoying a cigar. He would say, “Ghose, what do you want?”</p>
<p>His greeting was very nice! But everything changes. Three or four times he came to our meeting at the UN. Once I saw that somebody was waiting for me by the revolving door with his hands folded over his heart. I could not believe it was Dr. Mishra. And at India House he would only say, “What do you want?”</p>  </div>
