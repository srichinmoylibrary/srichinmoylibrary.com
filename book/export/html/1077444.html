<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you feel joy when you feel this vibration, then it is a good vibration. If you are getting joy, then definitely it is good. Anything that gives you pure, innocent joy is good. When you get a vibration which encourages you and inspires you, that means it is a good thing that is happening inside you.</p>  </div>
