  <h1 class="book-heading">Truth</h1>
  
 
<p>Truth has no death; falsehood has. Man says: “Time is precious.” Time says: “Not I, not I. Truth only is precious.” Let us bring George Bernard Shaw on the scene.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My way of joking,” says he, “is to tell the truth. It is the funniest joke in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>”</p>
<p>To be sure, nothing is as great as truth. And this truth has many rungs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The highest truth,” according to Tagore, “is that which we can only realise by plunging into it. And when our consciousness is fully merged in it, then we know that it is no mere acquisition, but that we are one with it.”</p>
