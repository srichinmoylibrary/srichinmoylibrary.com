  <h1 class="book-heading">451. Tomorrow</h1>
  
 

<p>Tomorrow I shall get up<br /> Early in the morning,<br /> Since today I am dead-tired.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I shall meditate on God,<br /> Since today my impure vital, jealous mind<br /> And insecure heart<br /> Are bothering me far beyond my<br /> tolerance-might.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I shall definitely love God,<br /> Since today I feel a kind of inner obligation<br /> To please my body, vital, mind and heart.</p>
<p>After all, they comprise my own poor little life.<br /> But tomorrow without fail<br /> I shall love God.</p>

<p>You have to prove<br /> That you are sincere.<br /> You have to prove<br /> That you are pure.<br /> You have to prove<br /> That you are real.</p>
<p>How can you prove<br /> That you are sincere?<br /> Just see everything rightly,<br /> Feel everything timely,<br /> And say everything soulfully.</p>
<p>How can you prove<br /> That you are pure?<br /> Just feel that your inner purity's beauty<br /> And your soul's immortal duty<br /> Are inseparable friends.</p>
<p>How can you prove<br /> That you are real?<br /> Just tell yourself today, tomorrow and every day<br /> That you are of God alone<br /> And you are for God alone.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">453. My journey</h1>
  
 

<p>Alas,<br /> My Heavenward journey<br /> Is quite challenging.</p>
<p>My hellward journey<br /> Is quite frightening.</p>
<p>My journey toward the Perfection-shore<br /> Is quite discouraging.</p>
<p>But<br /> My journey toward my Inner Pilot<br /> Has always been encouraging,<br /> most encouraging<br /> And<br /> rewarding,<br /> most rewarding.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">454. Needless to repeat</h1>
  
 

<p>In my family<br /> There are only three members:<br /> My father, my mother and I.<br /> Father thinks and says<br /> He is great,<br /> Which he actually is.<br /> Mother feels and says<br /> She is good,<br /> Which she obviously is.<br /> And I just know and declare<br /> I am perfect,<br /> Absolutely perfect.<br /> Needless to repeat,<br /> Since everyone knows it.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">455. Four dinner invitations</h1>
  
 

<p>I have received dinner invitations<br /> From God and man,<br /> From Heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Earth will feed me<br /> With earth's food: doubt and fear.</p>
<p>Heaven will feed me<br /> With Heaven's food: faith and courage.</p>
<p>Man will feed me<br /> With man's food: depression and frustration.</p>
<p>God will feed me<br /> With God's Food: Light and Delight.</p>
<p>Doubt and fear will not be able to feed me regularly;<br /> Therefore I don't need them.</p>
<p>Faith and courage may be a bit slow in feeding me,<br /> But I shall gladly wait.</p>
<p>Depression and frustration will poison me<br /> With their food. No harm!<br /> I know perfectly well<br /> That I shall not remain always dead.<br /> For I clearly see that God's Food,<br /> Light and Delight,<br /> Is fast approaching my eternally real hunger.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">456. They are going back</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> You say that I have made<br /> Tremendous improvements<br /> In various areas of my life.</p>
<p>You say that I am losing<br /> Fast, very fast,<br /> My heart's insect-insecurity,<br /> My mind's elephant-doubt,<br /> My life's uncertainty-dream.</p>
<p>I know You are telling me the Truth,<br /> My Lord Supreme.<br /> But tell me, where are they going<br /> After they have left me?</p>
<p>"Ah, My child, they are going back<br /> Slowly and quietly<br /> To their source: Ignorance."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">457. When I wanted to marry God</h1>
  
 

<p>When I wanted to marry God<br /> For His occult power,<br /> He insulted me mercilessly<br /> For my stark stupidity.</p>
<p>When I wanted to marry God<br /> For His spiritual power,<br /> He scolded me privately<br /> For my absurd greed.</p>
<p>When I wanted to marry God<br /> To empty my ignorance-night,<br /> He said in public:<br /> "I am more than eager<br /> To marry you."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">458. A sea of smiles</h1>
  
 

<p>Divine Lord Supreme,<br /> How is it that You have given me<br /> Trouble after trouble,<br /> An endless series of troubles?</p>
<p>"Child, since you think and feel<br /> That I am the only and real culprit,<br /> Then the best thing is<br /> For you to offer them back to Me.<br /> I shall gladly accept them."</p>
<p>Divine Lord Supreme,<br /> How is it that I smile and smile<br /> And have become a sea of smiles?<br /> Who made me so?<br /> For God's sake, You have to tell me the truth!</p>
<p>"Child, for God's sake,<br /> I am telling you the absolute truth.<br /> Ah, don't you know that your divine smiles<br /> Are the great and unchallenged contributions<br /> Of your devoted heart and surrendered life?"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1216088" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">459. It is so easy</h1>
  
 

<p>Lord Supreme,<br /> You have given me<br /> A smart mind, a sweet heart and<br /> A kind-hearted soul.<br /> How can I best use them<br /> In my day-to-day life<br /> And become a perfect instrument of Yours?</p>
<p>"Ah, it is so easy, My son.<br /> Just ask your mind not to see<br /> Ignorance in mankind,<br /> Including yourself.<br /> Just ask your heart to feel<br /> That the hearts of others are unquestionably<br /> As sweet as yours.<br /> Just ask your kind-hearted soul<br /> To show you the real Face<br /> Of the real God."</p>

<div id="node-1216089" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">460. Three compliments</h1>
  
 

<p>God has offered you<br /> Not one, but two compliments.<br /> His first compliment is:<br /> You are His chosen child.<br /> His second compliment is:<br /> Your cry is of Him,<br /> Your smile is for Him.<br /> Man's first and only compliment<br /> To you is this:<br /> He can perfectly live his life without you.<br /> He is more than self-sufficient.</p>

<div id="node-1216090" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">461. Regain and rediscover</h1>
  
 

<p>You inherited Heaven's property:<br /> Conscious, constant and inseparable oneness<br /> With the Supreme.<br /> Alas, you have lost it.</p>
<p>You now inherit earth's property:<br /> Frustration in depression.<br /> No curse, soon you will lose it, too.</p>
<p>You shall in the process of your fast-evolving fate<br /> Inherit God's property:<br /> Perfection.</p>
<p>Once you achieve Perfection<br /> You will not only regain<br /> Your conscious oneness with the Supreme,<br /> But also you will rediscover and unearth<br /> Your long-buried constant and inseparable oneness<br /> With the Supreme.</p>

<div id="node-1216091" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">462. A great understatement</h1>
  
 

<p>God, I just thought of You.<br /> Let us resume our old friendship.<br /> Let us not quarrel,<br /> Let us not fight.<br /> After all, we are no longer kids.<br /> After all, once upon a time<br /> We were not only good, but best friends.<br /> And in the hoary past<br /> Not only did we love each other,<br /> But also we made tremendous sacrifices for each other.<br /> So, God, let us resume our old friendship,<br /> Since I cannot brook any further delay.<br /> I am sure Your sufferings, too,<br /> Are unbearable.<br /> "Daughter, I loved and still love<br /> And will always love you<br /> Infinitely more than you have ever loved Me.<br /> Therefore, for you to say my sufferings are unbearable<br /> Is a great understatement."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1216092" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">463. Lord I need you more</h1>
  
 

<p>Lord, I need You more than You need me.<br /> I love You more than You love me,<br /> At least on the physical plane,<br /> Or at least that is what my proud discovery is.<br /> So Lord, don't make a fool of Yourself<br /> By cherishing unhealthy thoughts<br /> That I do not care for You at all.<br /> I do care for You, hundreds of times,<br /> But what actually happens is this:<br /> Sometimes my old friends,<br /> Fear, doubt, insecurity and anxiety<br /> Make me feel that they need me<br /> More than I need You.<br /> Therefore, my ever-sympathetic heart<br /> Overflows to them with diamond-concern.<br /> Alas, at that time I forget You,<br /> I don't love You and I even ignore You.<br /> Lord, since I love You and need You<br /> More than You love and need me,<br /> I am bound to return to You<br /> And to You alone, without fail.</p>

<p>Sometimes I want to lead,<br /> Sometimes I want to follow.<br /> It entirely depends on<br /> Whose company I am in.<br /> If it is God, then I want to lead;<br /> If it is man, then I want to follow.<br /> Why? Why?<br /> While leading God,<br /> If I go astray,<br /> He will correct me and perfect me<br /> And guide me to my destination.<br /> While following man,<br /> If he makes a deplorable mistake,<br /> My pure and sympathetic heart<br /> Will want to share half the penalty,<br /> If not more.</p>
