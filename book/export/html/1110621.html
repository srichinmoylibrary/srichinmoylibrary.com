  <h1 class="book-heading">Love</h1>
  
 
<p>First of all, let us try to know what love is. If love means to possess someone or something, then that is not real love, not pure love. If loves means to give oneself, to become one with everything and everyone, then that is real love. Real love is total oneness with the object loved and with the Possessor of love. And who is the Possessor of love? God. Without love, we cannot become one with God. Love is the inner bond, the inner connection, the inner link between man and God, between the finite and the infinite.</p>
<p>Love is the secret key to open God's Door. We must always approach God through love. The first step is love; the second step is devotion; the third step is surrender. First we have to love God; then we have to devote ourselves to Him alone; and finally we have to be at His Feet and fulfil ourselves. So if we go through our life's journey with absolute love, we can never fail to reach God or fulfil Him in our own lives or in humanity. Where there is pure love, divine love, there is fulfilment. Where there is no divine love, it is all misery, frustration and, ultimately, spiritual death.</p>
<p>Your children need your love. Your wife needs your love. But you need God's Love. God is ready to give you His Love. But you are not ready. You are ready to give your love to your daughter and your wife. But they are not ready. When you are ready to receive Love from God, to your amazement you will see that your wife and children will also be ready to receive love from you. Not one second before!</p>
<p>As we cannot exist on earth without life, so also God does not and cannot exist without His all-embracing, all-nourishing and all-fulfilling Love.</p>  </div>
