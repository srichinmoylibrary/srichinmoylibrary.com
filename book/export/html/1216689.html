    <title>Question: Your spirituality does not require a hermit-like way of life, but instead favours a full participation in today’s society. This implies that society, even structured as it is, contains the seeds of spiritual growth. Through meditation and spiritual practice can one become spiritual, irrespective of his or her social role?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely society embodies spirituality in the purest sense of the term. Spirituality is not asceticism. Spirituality is not self-abnegation. True spirituality means the acceptance and transformation of life so that perfect perfection can dawn in the core of humanity. Through meditation and spiritual discipline, definitely one can become spiritual irrespective of one’s social role or religious beliefs.</p>  </div>
