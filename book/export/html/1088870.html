<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Outwardly I give them only very general guidelines, because each individual's way of meditation is personal and unique. But out of God's infinite Bounty I have the capacity to teach their souls inwardly how to meditate. Each disciple of mine learns his own best way of meditation from his own soul. Also, I have written considerably on meditation and different inner techniques, so they can read my writings.</p>  </div>
