<p>Yes, humanity's heart should be surcharged with aspiration, humanity's eyes with inspiration and humanity's arms with power. What for? Not for destruction, but for the correction of the mind, the perfection of the life and the satisfaction of the heart. It is the bounden duty of each world-citizen to be a soldier of peace. Beautifully, powerfully and convincingly the Secretary-General states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"These soldiers of peace are military forces interposed to prevent the use of force. They carry arms only to forestall shooting and conflict. In their composition, they reflect an aspiration for peace, stability and security that knows no frontiers."</p>
