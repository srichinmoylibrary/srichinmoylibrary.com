<p>This morning I went out walking. I crossed Main Street. A white car was coming towards me. I was quite safe because I was on the pavement. Then the car stopped and a man came out. He was extremely fat, at least three times as large as I am! He was holding a piece of paper and he said to me, "Do you know English?"</p>
<p>I said, "I do."</p>
<p>Then he gave me the piece of paper. He came from New Jersey and he was looking for a particular street, but I could not read the handwriting.</p>
<p>The man said, "I thought you knew English! All right, you are a wise guy!"</p>
