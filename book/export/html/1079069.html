<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just think of your food. Regularly you feed your physical body. Because you are fond of your physical body, you eat every day so that you will live on earth. You can be fond of your soul as well. If you are fond of your soul, then naturally you will feed your soul through your prayer and meditation. You want to stay on the physical plane: therefore, you eat regularly. If you want to stay also on the inner plane, the subtle plane, Godâ€™s real plane, then naturally you will pray and meditate. The physical you are pleasing, and the soul also you have to please.</p>  </div>
