<p>When Girish was in the evening of his life, he received a visit from Sister Nivedita, the dearest disciple of Swami Vivekananda. They talked for a long time about Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda. Although Girish was quite ill at that time with various ailments, he was engaged in writing a new drama called <em>Tapobal</em>.</p>
<p>Sister Nivedita was always full of appreciation for Girish's dramas and so she said to him, "I am now on my way to Darjeeling for a short rest. Please try to finish your play soon so that I can read it when I return. I am so eager to read it."</p>
<p>Girish promised to have it ready for her when she returned to Calcutta. Alas, while Nivedita was in Darjeeling, she fell seriously ill and passed away.</p>
<p>Girish finished his play and dedicated it to her. He wrote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pure Nivedita, Child,</p>
<p>You always rejoiced when my new dramas were staged. My new drama is being staged now, but where are you? When I was lying ill before you left for Darjeeling, you had tenderly said to me: "I hope to see you well again on my return." I am still living, child. Why do you not come to see me now? I hear that on your deathbed you remembered me. Engaged as you are in the Lord's work now, if you still remember me, accept this tearful gift of mine.</p>
<p>Girish Chandra Ghosh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the last drama that Girish wrote. A few months later, on February 8th, 1912, he, too, passed away.</p>
<p>When Sarada Devi received the news of his passing, she said, "A veritable Indra has fallen."</p>
<p>His last words were: "Master, you have come. Please destroy my worldly intoxication. Victory to Sri Ramakrishna! Let us go."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna has taken full possession of my heart and bound it with his love.</p>
<p>â€” Girish Chandra Ghosh</p>
