<p>There were once two princes. When their father died, the older one became king. This older brother was good, sincere and pious, but the younger one was undivine to the extreme. He wanted to dethrone his older brother, so he organised a big army and started fighting against him.</p>
<p>The commander of the king's army said to the king, "We will definitely win. Our army is more powerful, and I am sure it is Allah's wish that we win."</p>
<p>The older brother said, "I do not know what Allah's wish is, but I am praying to Allah that His Will be done. Whomever He chooses to win, I will be very happy. If He thinks that my brother will take better care of the kingdom than I do, then Allah should allow my brother to win and become the king. I want Allah's children — my subjects — to be well protected and well guided.</p>
<p>"Right now my brother may be very undivine. But who knows, if he becomes king, perhaps he will become very nice, kind and pious. I don't know the future. If Allah feels that my brother will far surpass me in good qualities and that under his rule the kingdom will prosper much more, then I feel that my brother should win and not me. I want only Allah's Will to be done so that his children can be really happy."</p>  </div>
