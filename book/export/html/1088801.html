<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are sincerely aspiring, you will never expect anything from God, even in your imagination. Your sincere aspiration will tell you that God loves you infinitely more than you can understand, and that God, out of His infinite Love and Compassion, has already provided you with everything. If you go deep within, you will see that God has already done everything for you.</p>  </div>
