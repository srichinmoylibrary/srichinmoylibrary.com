<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As individuals, we do not have peace of mind because we feel that we are the most important person on earth. We feel that if we do not do this or say that, then the world will collapse or everything immediately will go wrong. We can get peace of mind only if we can consciously feel that we are not indispensable. The moment we sincerely feel that we are not indispensable, we will not have to go anywhere to get peace, for peace will immediately come to us. If we feel that it is our duty to serve the world, that is good. But if we feel that it is our duty to illumine the world and that if we do not illumine the world, then the world will remain full of darkness, then we will never have peace of mind. I am not indispensable. You are not indispensable. Only God is indispensable.</p>
<p>Another easy way to have peace of mind is to feel that nothing is unduly important in our lives. If we have lost something, we must not feel that our life will be ruined. We should just try to feel that the thing we lost was unimportant. Everything and everyone on earth can desert us, as long as we do not desert God and God does not desert us. God will never desert us because He is all Compassion, and even if we try our hardest, we will not be able to desert God because He is omnipresent. So we need not worry or become upset about anything on earth. Except for God and our inner cry for Truth, nothing on earth is indispensable. If we have the inner cry, then we get God. And once we consciously get God as our very own, we have everything.</p>
