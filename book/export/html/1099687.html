<p>Soma wanted to teach me stretching exercises to help my back pain. She herself takes regular stretching exercises. A Canadian had written a book called, <em>Oh, My Back Pain!</em> or something like that. She had read that book, and she showed me some stretching exercises that it recommended. They were really difficult. I deeply appreciated and admired her flexibility.</p>
<p>There was one particular exercise that she tried to show me, but she was unable to do it properly. “I am also getting old,” she admitted.</p>
<p>My sister, Lily, happened to be with us. So Lily said to her, “Yes, I can see you are getting old.” Soma is 13 years younger than Lily. Anyway, Lily immediately did that particular exercise so easily and quickly. Lily put us to shame. I surrendered because I cannot bend that much.</p>
<p>Six or seven exercises Soma showed me. Alas, I could not do even one. She wanted me to learn those exercises so that I would have no more back pain.</p>  </div>
