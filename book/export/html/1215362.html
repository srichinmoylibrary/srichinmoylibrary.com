<p>I was walking along 150th Street. I crossed to the right side of the street and a short Indian-looking man called to me from the left side of the street, "Swamiji, Swamiji, wait, wait!"</p>
<p>He had a child's carriage with a four or five month-old child inside. I waited and he dragged the carriage across the street. Then he lifted the child up and said, "Swamiji, please bless my baby."</p>
<p>Very affectionately, I put my hand on the child's head and blessed the child. It was a little girl.</p>
<p>I said, "May I ask her name?"</p>
<p>"Her name is Lakshmi," he replied. He was so happy. Then I asked him where he came from and he told me that he comes from Trinidad.</p>
