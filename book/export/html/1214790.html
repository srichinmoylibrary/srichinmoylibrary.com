<p>U Thant was more than successful in veiling his minds stupendous brilliance with his heartâ€™s pole-star purity and humility.</p>
<p>The great seeker in him discovered the truth that the fastest way to become part and parcel of humanity is the way of the heart and not that of the mind.</p>
<p>He also discovered that it is the heart that has infinitely more capacity than the mind to establish an abiding oneness with the world community.</p>
<p>He further realised the supreme fact that the mind has to be illumined by the soul, for this is the only way to bring about a radical transformation of human nature and the world family.</p>  </div>
