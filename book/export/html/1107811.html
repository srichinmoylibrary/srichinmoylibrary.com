<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good. When you see blue light, it is very good. Blue represents Infinity and real spirituality. It is a very good thing; it means that you are getting special Grace and Blessings from God. Each colour has a special quality. Blue is Infinity; green is new life; red is divine Power. It is fine to see these colours or to see some divine beings or images or to feel some divine presence. But if you do not see those things, do not feel disappointed. Feel that God is preparing you to see Him and feel Him alone.</p>  </div>
