<p><em>A:</em> Sri Chinmoy says that there is only one Being, God. Life is a transcendental Blessing from God: we have come here to experience the earthly Form of God. We are all one. We are experiencing the finite and have not yet transcended to the Consciousness of the Beyond. But as a growing consciousness awakens in us, we will see that there is only One Existence. AUM.</p>  </div>
