<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To God His Compassion is His highest achievement. When He uses this achievement on earth, He maintains His sense of duality, His highest Height and the lowest depth. When He uses this highest achievement of His in Heaven, He maintains His unity of what He has and is.What He has is Infinity's Light; what He is is Eternity's Delight.</p>  </div>
