<p><em>(1893)</em></p>

<p>"My Auro! Auro! all world-pain in flood<br />   Within my finite breast.<br /> My pride, my country's pride, O earth's hope-noon,<br />   The all-transforming Crest!</p>
<p>Alas! to feed my longings high no more<br />   I shall see Auro, my son.<br /> The sombre night envelops my mortal sheath.<br />   To-day my heart is undone.</p>
<p>Now cruel fate has torn my vision's Rose.<br />   Auro, I shut my eyes<br /> To see your golden face, to be with you<br />   In the blue-white climbing skies."</p>

<hr /><ol><li id="fn1"><p>SAI 10. (1956). K D. Ghose had almost intuitive high hopes that his Auro was sure to brighten the face of the Mother country. The ship which was to carry Auro sank on the way. But Aurobindo boarded a second ship. On the assumption that his son must have perished with the lost ship, his father died of a broken heart.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
