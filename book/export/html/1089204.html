<p><em>Mr. Matsumoto:</em> I am most grateful and most honoured to be here on this occasion. When I first met Sri Chinmoy, I felt that God had sent such a saintly person to earth to help us find a way to inner peace. For many years I had been hoping to find a way.</p>
<p>I come from a poor family, one that has suffered a great deal. First, it was my father who passed away, then my mother. Following this, my son died as well. But I always had the hope that I would find inner peace, the ultimate peace. Now I have been given the golden opportunity to be in Sri Chinmoy's blessingful presence. He has given me this plaque and garland. Then the singers sang the song he wrote for me. I am so grateful that Sri Chinmoy has given me these precious gifts. I feel it is God who has sent such a saintly person into my life. I feel that when I ascend to the Heavenly skies, I will take with me this most soulful song you have composed for me, and I will be very happy with this song.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the depths of my heart I would like to offer to the soul of Kyoto a soulful poem which I composed today:</p>

<p>Kyoto</p>
<p>Kyoto, Kyoto, Kyoto, Kyoto,<br /> Japan's sweetness-fulness motto.<br /> Here life is energy's speedy flow.<br /> Here heart is ecstasy's<br /> splendid glow.<br /> Kyoto, Kyoto, you I salute.<br /> You play the world's<br /> oneness-peace-flute.</p>
