<p>This time Japan has responded most powerfully to the Supreme's Light. Throughout the length and breadth of Japan the Light of the Supreme has been really manifested. There have been over 40 articles about our activities in Japanese and English newspapers.</p>
<p>Kirit's soul has proved that it can be of true service to the manifestation of the Supreme. I am very, very proud of Kirit and very proud of Japan.</p>
<p>Kirit represents his country. He represents the life of humility. If you run up the steps two at a time, you might fall and break your leg. But if you go very humbly step by step, there is no chance for you to break your leg.</p>
