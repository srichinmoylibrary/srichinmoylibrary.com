<p>Dear Guru,</p>
<p>It was a very nice and interesting afternoon. A million thanks for everything.</p>
<p><em>(From comments to her daughter)</em></p>
<p>[...] I hope for the best. This is a revolutionary period indeed because of the new concepts altering the accepted church dogmas and practices. The upheaval will reshape our past religious thoughts, making them seem childlike. Maybe we are now on the threshold of deeper knowledge and conviction of a truly Universal Intelligence far more advanced than we have ever had before [...] And this period is one of pain, for it brings the birth pangs of a new religious reverence which can only come through soul-stirring challenges.</p>
