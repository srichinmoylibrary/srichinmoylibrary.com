<p>"My Lord, You tell me that You love me infinitely more than I love You. Is it true? Can You prove it?"</p>
<p>"Easily I can prove it! You always tell Me that you can live without Me. But, in My case, I don't think that even in My wildest imagination I would dare to live without you. My Love for you is such that My Immortality would immediately die the moment you left!"</p>  </div>
