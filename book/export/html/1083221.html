<p>A hermit lives in his cottage and thinks of God. And God lives in His Palace and thinks of the hermit. The hermit confines himself to see God. God extends and expands Himself to see the hermit. Who is the wiser of the two? My aspiration of the hoary past tells me that the hermit is the wiser. My present aspiration and realisation tell me that God is infinitely wiser.</p>  </div>
