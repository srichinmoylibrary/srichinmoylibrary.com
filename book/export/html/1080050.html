<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each religion has an ideal of its own. All religious ideals cannot be of the same type and the same standard. Also, the meditation cannot be of the same height and the same standard in every religion. The result will depend on the type of meditation and the ideal of the particular religion, the height of the ideal. If the ideal is high, and at the same time the meditation is very soulful, the result will be extraordinary.</p>  </div>
