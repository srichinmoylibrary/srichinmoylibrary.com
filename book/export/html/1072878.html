<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ultimately there is no difference. Christ realised God and offered God to mankind. In Yoga, also, the ultimate aim is to realise God and offer Him to humanity.</p>
<p>In Yoga we have four paths. The first three we call major; then there is one which is a branch, but it is also very powerful. The three major paths are the path of <em>Karma Yoga</em>, or selfless action; the path of <em>Bhakti Yoga</em>, or love, devotion and surrender; and the path of <em>Jnana Yoga</em>, or wisdom. In <em>Jnana Yoga</em> there is a significant branch which we call <em>Raja Yoga</em>, the Yoga of mysticism. These four paths all lead to the destined Goal.</p>
<p>Since the teaching of the Christ was founded upon love and compassion, it would fall under the category of <em>Bhakti Yoga</em>. But again, we have to know that love itself is wisdom. To say that love is one thing and that wisdom is something else, is wrong. He who loves God has the greatest wisdom. Love and wisdom cannot be separated. Again, love and service cannot be separated. If I love someone, then I serve him constantly. The very function of my life, the very purpose of my life, is to serve the person I love. So love is service and love is wisdom. But when we want to differentiate the paths, we say that this one is love, this one is wisdom, this one is service and so on.</p>
<p>So, to come back to your question, there is no ultimate difference in teachings. But even in the same subject, each teacher has a different way of interpreting or emphasising the truth. If there are two teachers teaching the same subject, they will interpret it in two different ways. But at the time of examination there will be only one examination. The ultimate teaching of Jesus Christ and the ultimate teaching of our Yoga is conscious oneness with God. The Christ said, “I and my Father are one.” We Indians say, “I am the Brahman.” The Brahman is the absolute Transcendental Reality and Truth. The Christ performed forty-four miracles and gave a most fruitful, soulful sermon. But he has become humanity’s heart, head and life-breath not because of his miracles, but because he said one thing: “Father, let Thy Will be done.” The world has accepted him and is cherishing, treasuring and worshipping him because of this divine utterance: “Father, let Thy Will be done.”</p>
<p>The spiritual Masters try to adapt themselves to the circumstances, to the awakening consciousness of each individual. Some individuals find it easier to follow the path of love, while others find it easier to follow the path of wisdom. Still others find it easier to follow the path of selfless action. But the Goal, the eternal Goal, remains the same. Those who follow the traditional Indian paths of Yoga, and those who follow Christianity, the path of Jesus Christ, will ultimately arrive at the same Goal. The Goal is always one, but the roads can be many.</p>  </div>
