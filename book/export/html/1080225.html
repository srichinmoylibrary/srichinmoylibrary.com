<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ultimately, everything is the Grace of the Supreme. Some people have receptivity for this Grace while others do not. The sun is for everyone. But if you leave all your doors and windows open, then naturally light will enter into your room more than into someone else's room who keeps all the doors and windows closed.</p>
<p>The ultimate Reality is Grace. Some are receptive to Light, so naturally Light can function in and through them much more than through others who are not open. Each talent is only an opening of either the heart or the mind or some other part of our existence to the Highest.</p>  </div>
