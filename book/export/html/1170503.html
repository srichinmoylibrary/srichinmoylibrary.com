  <h1 class="book-heading">Interviewer: Do you think of anything in particular while meditating?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While meditating we should not think of anything; only we should keep the mind calm and quiet. The mind is by nature restless, like the surface of the sea. But if we can go deep within, if we can dive to the bottom of the sea, we will find that it is all peace. We can find this peace either through prayer or meditation.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> What about thinking peaceful thoughts?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> After we make the mind calm, good thoughts, inspiring thoughts and pure thoughts will come. But if we start by trying to think good thoughts, they will not come.</p>  </div>
