<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If a child can speak, then the best way is to teach the child first and foremost to say “Supreme.” If that is done, then the child can start praying. The child will make the fastest progress from example. If the parents are praying and meditating together, the child should not be left in another room. The child should observe what the parents are doing. If the parents always do the right thing, the spiritual thing, then the child will imitate them. If the mother drinks milk, immediately the child will drink it. Whatever the child is taught by the parents, he learns. When parents make progress, automatically the child also makes progress.</p>  </div>
