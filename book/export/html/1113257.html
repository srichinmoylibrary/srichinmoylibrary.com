<p>Nolini-da read out at the playground "My Acceptance of <em>Sannyasa.</em>" Before he read it out, he said: "Today's episode is extremely amusing, almost hilarious, but I am afraid you will enjoy all this at my expense."</p>
<p>Afterwards, Rajen-da and I escorted him home. He said to Rajen-da: "Did you enjoy my talk?"</p>
<p>Rajen-da said: "Of course."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "Sometimes I am embarrassed to read out these kinds of things because they are too personal."</p>
<p>Rajen-da said: "Although they are personal, we learn much from them. It helps us a lot."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "Chinmoy also tells me the same." Then he said: "This coming Friday I shall read out <em>Siddhi Dibas</em>" (Sri Aurobindo's God-realisation day, 24 November 1926).</p>  </div>
