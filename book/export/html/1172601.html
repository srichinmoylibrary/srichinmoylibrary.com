<p>NARRATOR: Sanjna has long since given birth to two most beautiful sons, and one daughter: Yama, Vaivaswatha and Yamuna.</p>
<p><em>(The three children are together in the palace of their father.)</em></p>
<p>YAMA: We are so proud to have such parents. Our father is so great; our mother is so beautiful.</p>
<p>VAIVASWATHA: Indeed we are happy, proud and blessed.</p>
<p>YAMUNA: I am the happiest woman in Godâ€™s Creation. My father is the most powerful of all the gods. My mother is the most beautiful woman of all. We are the children of the most powerful and illumining, and of the most beautiful and charming parents. None can be prouder than we three.</p>  </div>
