<p>Last night Kanu’s soul came to me, and we were talking in Bengali. In Bengali he told me, “Your name is Sri Chinmoy, hut your nickname is Madal.”</p>
<p>Then he said, “Now keep it a secret. Do not tell anybody that I can speak Bengali!” His soul was full of adoration and affection.</p>

<p>SONA’S CLOSE CALL</p>
<p>About seven or eight years ago, Sona went for treatment at Mridul’s Animal Hospital in New Paltz. It was just a simple matter; Sona was not sick at all. All of a sudden, Mridul phoned me up. He said, “Guru, I can’t believe it! I can’t believe it!”</p>
<p>I asked, “What happened?”</p>
<p>He said, “I can’t believe it, I can’t believe it! In my hands, in my hands, Sona has gone!”</p>
<p>I said, “Mridul, wait for a minute.” Then I put all my concentration on Sona. After a few minutes, I heard Mridul say, “Oh, he has come back, he has come back!”</p>
<p>That was the happiest news!</p>
