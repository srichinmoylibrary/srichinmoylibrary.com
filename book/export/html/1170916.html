<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, in the inner world everybody without exception knows me extremely well. Not only do they know me, but also they value me infinitely, infinitely more than my first-class disciples value me. Here in the outer world I run after my children to please them. In the inner world they run after me to make me happy, to keep me happy, to please me in my own way, for they feel my happiness is their only satisfaction and fulfilment. The higher you go, the sooner you know and the easier it is for you to see the Divine in me, and finally to see me as the Divine Himself.</p>  </div>
