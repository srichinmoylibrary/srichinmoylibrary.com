<p>"How did you find my sports activity?"</p>
<p>"Excellent," I said.</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "I thought you young people wouldn't like old stories about an old man." Then he changed the subject. "I believe Nirmala's operation took place this morning at eight o'clock. Now it is nine-thirty. Do you feel like going to the hospital? Try to bring me an accurate account of her condition."</p>
<p>I went to the hospital and came back with the message that the operation had been quite successful.</p>
<p>Amrita-da happened to be with Nolini-da. Amrita-da said: "That is what the doctors always say. Did you see her? What is your opinion?"</p>
<p>"I saw her sleeping."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "I feel now that the operation was quite successful."</p>  </div>
