<p>Early this morning I had run a mile and a half and had started coming back. I was at the 1200-metre marker when suddenly the Christ started running with me. While we were running, he showed me my presence inside his heart.</p>
<p>I said, "You can show me my presence inside your heart, and I can show you your presence inside mine." Then I started repeating his name in Bengali: "Jishu." He began repeating the Bengali word "ashu," which means speed, fastest speed.</p>
<p>I said, "You are mocking my running speed. But you should take a human body and then die here running."</p>
<p>"I am not mocking you," he said. "I am saying 'ashu' because you do everything on earth with the fastest speed."</p>
<p>"But here it does not apply," I said. "I have already run a mile and a half and I am dying, but you are in the subtle body. You are enjoying it.</p>
<p>Then we had a spiritual conversation.</p>
