<p>In the spiritual life, acceptance of reality is of paramount importance â€” not rejection but acceptance. We have to accept the world, we have to accept our life, we have to accept all our weaknesses and shortcomings to transform them and illumine them so that we may become perfect instruments of God. If there is no acceptance, we cannot perfect ourselves and fulfil the divinity within us.</p>
