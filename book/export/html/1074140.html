<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I hope not! There are 86,000 subtle nerves and I do hope I have not destroyed even one. Weightlifting does not destroy anything. Subtle nerves exist in a different world. But only if you do too much heavy lifting, then your mental processes may become slow and, if they become slow, then there will be quite a few things that you cannot achieve in life.</p>  </div>
