<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am so moved, Father, that you have allowed me to come here to be blessed by you. Last year I met Cardinal Hume in London and was blessed by him.</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> It is good that you have come because this is the day of peace, and we are trying our best to unite the country. We are divided because of political reasons, but today we are asking the people all over the country to unite.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I read your New Year's Message and I was so deeply impressed.</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> Maybe some of the rebels will come to the Cathedral tonight, and this will further the peace process.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am so happy to learn that you offer your wisdom-light to politicians. Many people are afraid of dealing with politics and politicians. In your case, you are very kind to shed your light on the political field.</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> If spiritual people do not help them, they might go wrong. Many times politicians have come to my house and we have talked. We talk with them and tell them that this is wrong and this is right. If they listen, well and good; if they do not listen, what can we do? But at least we are able to proclaim the truth.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you tell them to do the right thing and they do not listen to you, what can you do?</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> Many times they do listen. I feel we are doing our duty in the world: we should be the salt of the earth; we should be the light of the world. Of course, one cannot force somebody to go to Heaven if he prefers to go to hell.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We cannot force anybody, but we can inspire people to do the right thing. We can bring the food right up to their mouth. But if they keep their mouth closed, how can we put it in?</p>
<p><em>Cardinal Sin:</em> That is what St. Augustine said: "God, Who created you without asking you, will not save you without consulting you." So our salvation and our cooperation go together. It is difficult to listen to God. We have to listen to Him in the silence and the stillness of peace. For me, prayer is not talking; prayer is listening to the Voice of God, who speaks to us.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is like a flame climbing up from the heart. The flame climbs up and the Grace descends in the form of a Message. God's Message descends and quenches the thirst of our aspiring heart.</p>
<p>It is so good to know your wisdom-light. You are so great, Father, to deal with politics. Usually spiritual people are afraid of dealing with politicians because they don't take spiritual people seriously. But in your case, you are not only spiritually but also psychically and mentally so powerful! That is why they are bound to listen to you.</p>  </div>
