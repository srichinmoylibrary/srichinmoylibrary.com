<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I know something physically, this convinces your mind: “Oh, Guru really cares for me, whereas he does not care for others who are not in his boat.” When one is convinced in the mind, then one gets more satisfaction. Otherwise, one may not be accepting what I have, or he may not feel that I have anything to do with it. If you remain in the soul’s world, you will say that Guru’s immediate concern has cured you; but if you remain in the mind, you will say, “Oh, it is just a fluke, a chance, that I was cured.”</p>  </div>
