<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our singing adds inspiration and aspiration to our meditation. And when we add inspiration and aspiration to our meditation, we feel that we are offering more of our dedicated, devoted and soulful service to the soul of the United Nations. Each time we sing, we invoke the soul of the United Nations to appear before us to make us more dynamic and more self-giving to the vision of a oneness-world-family, which we have envisioned and are in the process of manifesting.</p>
