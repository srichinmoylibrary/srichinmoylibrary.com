<p>I would like to take this opportunity to express the feelings I experienced at the luncheon in honor of the mothers.</p>
<p>From the moment I entered the Restaurant I was received very warmly. The sight of so many other mothers, and their expressions of pleasure in meeting each other, seemed to convey to me that they too felt happy being there.</p>
<p>On other occasions, I met many of the young men who were present with their mothers, and my feelings regarding their conduct and high calibre were reinforced at the luncheon.</p>
<p>I believe that my son, Charles, has benefited from his association with these dedicated disciples and his happiness rubs off on me too.</p>
<p>I wish to thank Guru for having extended this invitation to me. It was very pleasurable.</p>
