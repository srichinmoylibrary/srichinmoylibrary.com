<p>Yesterday, when I was finishing the 3.1-mile race, over the loudspeaker the man was screaming at me to run faster. He was saying, "Kick it in, Sri Chinmoy!" So I kicked and defeated a girl. But in the chute she went ahead of me.</p>
<p>Then while people were receiving prizes, they announced my name and said that I had run. When Dipali got a prize, they said that she was from the Sri Chinmoy team. Then they said, "Sri Chinmoy also ran."</p>
