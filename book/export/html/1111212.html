<p>Today I saw a dog that I have seen a few times before. But for the first time I also saw the owner. It was an elderly woman, and she was holding the dog on a leash.</p>
<p>As I ran by, the dog blocked my way, so I just stopped and stood there. The dog was not barking at all and the lady said to me, "Don't worry, don't worry! She is as kind as any human being can ever be. She can be your best friend as well, if you want her to be.</p>
<p>I said to the lady, "Thank you, thank you."</p>
<p>Her dog can be her best friend, so true. After running a few more metres I turned around, and the lady was still looking at me.</p>
