<p>Frank Zane won the Mr. Olympia title because of his power of concentration and meditation. As soon as the officials called him, immediately he would come onto the stage. Others would take time; they would feel doubt or hesitation. But he was always ready because of his inner poise and the strength that he received from his meditation. He was so calm and quiet. Others couldn’t fathom it because they didn’t have his power of concentration and meditation.</p>
