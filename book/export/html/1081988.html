<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In our spiritual life, say in meditation, we are pleasing God, but in our dedication, we are nowhere. Although we do not deserve help, with Grace the Master makes us perfect. Sometimes it happens that the individual cannot surpass a certain point. At that time the Master gives him the capacity.</p>
<p>Unconditional Grace makes the disciple perfect. Until he reaches his goal, along the way the disciple will time and again fail. Until he becomes perfect, he will delay the aspiring consciousness of humanity. But when he becomes perfect or realised, the disciple is bound to elevate the aspiring consciousness of humanity.</p>  </div>
