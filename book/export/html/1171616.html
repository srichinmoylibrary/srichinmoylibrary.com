<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Such a big heart you have, such a magnanimous heart! I deeply appreciate the fact that you are serving the homeless. At the same time, you also have to feel that you are homeless. Your home is your soul. So, from the spiritual point of view, people who do not have a free access to their souls are homeless. You are taking care of the homeless because they are helpless, but then your soul feels, "Oh, my child is homeless, homeless." Your soul thinks of your mind, your vital and your body as homeless. In the same way that you are taking care of the homeless people on the physical plane, your soul takes care of you on the inner plane, the spiritual plane.</p>  </div>
