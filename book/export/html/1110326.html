<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you feel that you are fighting against time, then I wish to say that you are making a deplorable mistake. This incarnation of yours is not the first and it is not the last. You have meditated, let us say, in your previous incarnations; and in this incarnation you have also meditated for a number of years. If you feel that each moment is leading you towards your destination, then this progress itself is a kind of partial goal. We cannot separate divine progress, real progress, from our goal. Rather than fighting against time, we should try our utmost to derive spiritual benefit, spiritual progress, from each second. Each time we make progress we have to feel that we have touched something of the goal itself, a tiny portion. In this way, we will feel that we are really advancing.</p>
<p>If we want to see or achieve the entire Goal, then we have to surrender to eternal Time, God's Time. What does this mean? Right now you feel that it is your responsibility to realise God tomorrow. At this very moment, in the twinkling of an eye, you want to realise God. This is your own sense of need. But if you feel that God needs your realisation infinitely more than you need it, then you see that your realisation becomes His responsibility. It becomes God's problem to give you realisation, either today or tomorrow or a few years later or whenever He wants to. God takes this responsibility on His shoulders most sincerely. After all, it is He who wants to manifest in and through us. And if we remain unrealised, then how can He fulfil Himself in and through us? So it is God's bounden Duty to make us realise Him. But we have to know that He has His own choice Time. We cannot pull this time. We cannot get it by hook or by crook. It is His Time; He has to offer it to us at His choice Hour. On our part we have only to be earnest, sincere, dedicated, devoted and surrendered to His Will. That is what He expects from us â€” sincere aspiration and surrender.</p>  </div>
