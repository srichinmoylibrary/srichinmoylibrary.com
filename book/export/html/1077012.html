<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can become conscious of spiritual experiences that you have had during sleep only if you feel that these experiences are of tremendous value. If you have that kind of feeling, then when you forget your experiences, you will feel a sense of tremendous loss, irreparable loss. Then the next time you dream, you will not forget your experiences.</p>
<p>Our problem is that we do not give due value to our experiences. First of all, when we have an experience during sleep, we feel that it is only our mental hallucination and nothing else. This is wrong. Secondly, we feel that these same experiences others also get, that they are nothing unusual. That is also wrong. Whether others have dreams or not is not our business. Our business is only to have experiences and, with the help of these experiences, to get a new life and run toward our destined Goal. If we do not give due value to our experiences, the experiences find that they are not needed, so they do not come and knock at our door.</p>
<p>The reason we do not become conscious of our experiences that we had during sleep is because we do not give due value to them. When we give proper value to someone or something, that person or thing remains with us, in us and for us.</p>  </div>
