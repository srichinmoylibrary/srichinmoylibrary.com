<p>Just before 8 o'clock that night, the man who had given me the massage phoned me and said, "A very important big shot is coming at 8 o'clock to get a massage, so I cannot come to you."</p>
<p>I said, "I didn't tell you what a big shot I am."</p>
<p>He said, "Since you are a big shot, I will come at 9 o'clock."</p>
<p>I asked him, "How much is the other big shot going to give you?"</p>
<p>He said, "The normal price — 120 rupees.</p>
<p>I said, "Then I will give you 200 rupees."</p>
<p>He said, "Oh, you are the real big shot!"</p>
<p>So he came at 8 o'clock and again gave me the Chinese, Russian and general massage. What a massage! Several times he pressed my knee until I screamed. Then, like Pradhan and others, if he heard something crack, he would say that everything was cured.</p>
<p>He weighed about 130 or 140 pounds. When he was on my back, I said, "You are killing me! I don't need this."</p>
<p>At one point during the massage, I said to him, "I want to lose 20 pounds from my stomach."</p>
<p>So he started pinching me and tapping my stomach. Then he said, "Twenty pounds? Impossible! You can lose a maximum of four pounds."</p>
<p>Even after he came to my hotel, I did not show him my <em>Galaxy of Luminaries.</em> You don't have to show these people anything so long as you give them enough money. In India I was ready to give the photographer 200 rupees to bring the pictures to my hotel, but he didn't come. At least this one kept his promise.</p>
<p>Before the man left, just to prove I was a real big shot, I gave him not 200 but 240 rupees.</p>
