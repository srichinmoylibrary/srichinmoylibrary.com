  <h1 class="book-heading">1. The Absolute</h1>
  
 

<p>No mind, no form, I only exist;<br />     Now ceased all will and thought;<br /> The final end of Nature's dance,<br />     I am it whom I have sought.</p>
<p>A realm of Bliss bare, ultimate;<br />     Beyond both knower and known;<br /> A rest immense I enjoy at last;<br />     I face the One alone.</p>
<p>I have crossed the secret ways of life,<br />     I have become the Goal.<br /> The Truth immutable is revealed;<br />     I am the way, the God-Soul.</p>
<p>My spirit aware of all the heights,<br />     I am mute in the core of the Sun.<br /> I barter nothing with time and deeds;<br />     My cosmic play is done.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099837" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2. Sweet, sweeter, sweetest</h1>
  
 

<p>     Sweet is my Lord.<br /> Him I have realised as the Eternal Truth.     Sweeter is my Lord.<br /> Him I have realised as the only Doer.     Sweetest is my Lord.<br /> Him I have realised as the Enjoyer Supreme.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">3. My name, my age, my home</h1>
  
 

<p>     At last I know my name.<br /> My name is God's eternal Game.<br />     At last I know my name.     At last I know my age.<br /> My age is Infinity's page.<br />     At last I know my age.     At last I know my home.<br /> My home is where my flame-worlds roam.<br />     At last I know my home.</p>

<p>O love me more and love me long.<br /> My boat is sinking, my hope is strong.</p>
<p>O love me more and love me long.<br /> My breath is bleeding, my dream is strong.</p>
<p>O love me more and love me long.<br /> My soul is leaving, my surrender strong.</p>
<p>O love me more and love me long.<br /> My Goal is crying, my promise strong.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">5. Another day</h1>
  
 

<p>Another day, another day,<br /> My Lord Supreme is far away.</p>
<p>Another day, my heart can be<br /> The all-giving breath of patience-tree.</p>
<p>Another day, my life can feed<br /> My soulful world with its crying need.</p>
<p>Another day, I own to hear<br /> God's Voice of Light and feel Him near.</p>
<p>Another day, another day,<br /> My tears shall win His blue-gold Ray.</p>
<p>Another day, another day,<br /> And then, no more my ignorance-clay.</p>
<p>Another day, I'll be God's Love<br /> Within, without, below, above.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">6. Apocalypse</h1>
  
 

<p>Within, without the cosmos wide am I;<br /> In joyful sweep I loose forth and draw back all.<br /> A birthless deathless Spirit that moves and is still<br /> Ever abides within to hear my call.</p>
<p>I who create on earth my joys and doles<br /> To fulfil my matchless quest in all my play,<br /> I veil my face of truth with golden hues<br /> And see the serpent-night and python-day.</p>
<p>A Consciousness-Bliss I feel in each breath;<br /> I am the self-amorous child of the Sun.<br /> At will I break and build my symbol sheath<br /> And freely enjoy the world's unshadowed fun.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099842" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7. I am a thief</h1>
  
 

<p>I am a thief; I steal every night.<br /> Each theft of mine kindles a thrill<br /> On the Supreme's all-fulfilling Eye.<br /> What do I steal? His Grace, my meal.</p>
<p>Why do I steal? He compels me so.<br /> Perhaps He finds no other way<br /> To feed my Spirit's hunger stark<br /> With the Nectar of His shadowless Ray.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099843" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8. I am a fool</h1>
  
 

<p>I am a fool, they say.<br /> Am I, am I a fool?<br /> I go to my inner School;<br /> God's Eye my eternal Day.</p>
<p>To help my Lord in His Play,<br /> To found His Smile on earth,<br /> My divinely human birth.<br /> Yet I am a fool, they say.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099844" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9. I am an idiot</h1>
  
 

<p>I know I am an idiot true.<br /> In the growing clouds my hopeful feet,<br /> Hands flung skywards for the blue stars.<br /> My throes no sun, no moon, shall greet.</p>
<p>I had a dream, a real dream:<br /> God would bury Himself to live<br /> In human ignorance hungry and black,<br /> To human death His Soul He'd give.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099845" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10. Immortality</h1>
  
 

<p>I feel in all my limbs His boundless Grace;<br /> Within my heart the Truth of life shines white.<br /> The secret heights of God my soul now climbs;<br /> No dole, no sombre pang, no death in my sight.</p>
<p>No mortal days and nights can shake my calm;<br /> A Light above sustains my secret soul.<br /> All doubts with grief are banished from my deeps,<br /> My eyes of light perceive my cherished Goal.</p>
<p>Though in the world, I am above its woe;<br /> I dwell in an ocean of supreme release.<br /> My mind, a core of the One's unmeasured thoughts;<br /> The star-vast welkin hugs my Spirit's peace.</p>
<p>My eternal days are found in speeding time;<br /> I play upon His Flute of rhapsody.<br /> Impossible deeds no more impossible seem;<br /> In birth-chains now shines Immortality.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099846" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11. A little</h1>
  
 

<p>A little joy have I of ceaseless joy,<br />     A little day of timeless day.<br /> Yet knows no bound this empty show of mine;<br />     I march along a goalless way.</p>
<p>O Love! A desert within me ever pines.<br />     Do turn it into a song of dawn.<br /> I know not in what hour of evil night<br />     Thou art, my Lord, from me withdrawn.</p>
<p>Life now must reach Thy Breath of Bliss supreme,<br />     Make Thee the one and only Guide.<br /> Thou art the Bridge between my death and birth;<br />     O let my longings in Thee abide.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099847" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12. Struggle&#039;s gloom</h1>
  
 

<p>With a blank sorrow, heavy I am now grown;<br /> Like things eternal, changeless stands my woe.<br /> In vain I try to overcome my foe.<br /> O Lord of Love! Make me more dead than stone.</p>
<p>Thy Grace of silent Smile I never feel;<br /> The forger of evil stamps my nights and days.<br /> His call my sleepless body ever obeys.<br /> My heart I annihilate and try to heal.</p>
<p>The dumb earth-waste now burns a hell to my soul.<br /> I fail to fight with its stupendous doom,<br /> My breath is a slave of that unending gloom.<br /> For Light I pine, but find a tenebrous goal.</p>
<p>Smoke-clouds cover my face of Spirit's fire;<br /> Naked I move in night's ignorance deep and dire.</p>

<p>Barren of events,<br /> Rich in pretensions<br /> My earthly life.</p>
<p>Obscurity<br /> My real name.</p>
<p>Wholly unto myself<br /> I exist.</p>
<p>I wrap no soul<br /> In my embrace.</p>
<p>No mentor worthy<br /> Of my calibre<br /> Have I.</p>

<p>If You but knew, Father,<br /> What I have done for You.<br /> I have become the world's lowest slave<br /> Your Breath to serve in man, the grave.</p>
