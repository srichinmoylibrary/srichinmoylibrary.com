<p>It was really a worthwhile afternoon. I really enjoyed it. It's too bad that he didn't do it earlier, about two years ago. It answered a lot of questions the mothers had; it put my mind at ease. All the mothers appreciated the time and thoughtfulness that was put into the day. It took a lot of work. One thing was that everyone participated in the activities and everyone was so kind and warm. This was a very warm and close experience.</p>
