<p>Twenty-five years ago, the first time I took my driving test, I was successful. This time, I failed on my first attempt, I failed on my second attempt and, finally, the third time I passed. Now I have decided to drive in each country we visit. In the Bahamas I drove and here also I have to drive.</p>
<p>Sevananda always tells one story about my driving. He makes me laugh and laugh when he tells it. He says that it took place in Puerto Rico. Once, Ananta, Sevananda and I were coming back from El Yunque. At that time, I did not know how to drive even. But Ananta fell sick, so I had to drive. Sevananda says that I was driving with my eyes closed, in deep meditation.</p>
<p>Here, with my eyes open, I failed twice, but Sevananda has to say that I drove in El Yunque with my eyes closed. And it was such a difficult road, zigzagging and serpentine. That is Sevananda's story. He boosts my ego very nicely!</p>
