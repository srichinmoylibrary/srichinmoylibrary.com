<h2>Question: What is the difference between human opinion and divine opinion?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Human opinion is the play of imagination. Divine opinion is the expression of realisation. Opinion is power. Human opinion can harm you in your outer life. Divine opinion can fulfil your inner life. Human opinion is meaningless obeisance to what others have spoken. Divine opinion is energising and fulfilling surrender to the Inner Voice.</p>
<p>Opinion very often we get from the mind; conviction we get from the heart and realisation we get from the soul. The value of mental opinion is very small. The conviction of the heart, psychic conviction, is meaningful, but at times it is based on pure imagination. But when conviction is flooded with divine realisation, there is abundant reality in it. Realisation, which comes from the soul, is one's conscious oneness with the Ultimate, with the Supreme. In realisation, opinion and conviction are transformed into divine reality.</p>  </div>
