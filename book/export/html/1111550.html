<p>Two weeks ago Sunanda was practising speed work. She was running so fast! This morning she was taking exercise, bringing her leg forward to her chest. This very exercise I was trying to do at five o'clock this morning. After one try I got such pain in my toes! And this very exercise she did twenty or thirty times. I wanted to do ten, but I did only one.</p>
