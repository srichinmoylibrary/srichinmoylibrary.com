<p>One evening, Shyama Charan Lahiri was roaming at the foot of the Himalayas while on a short visit to the area, when he heard a voice saying, "Shyama Charan, Shyama Charan." He was surprised to see a sadhu calling him from a distance. The sadhu approached him and said, "Can you not recognise me, my child, my son?" Then he uttered the names of Shyama Charan's father and grandfather. Even then Shyama Charan could not recognise him. The sadhu showed him abundant affection and led him into a cave and showed him a trident, a sacred water pot, a lion skin, a tiger skin and some beads. He said, "Can you recognise these? They are all yours." But Shyama Charan could not recognise them. The sadhu then placed his hand on Shyama Charan's spine. Immediately Shyama Charan came to recognise that those were indeed his belongings.</p>
<p>The sadhu said to him, "My name is Babaji, my son. You were my dear disciple in your previous incarnation. You left the body at a very high stage of spiritual development. I want you to complete your spiritual life in this incarnation."</p>  </div>
