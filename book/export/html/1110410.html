<h2>Bharater rabi</h2>

<p><em>Translation by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>

<p>O Sun of India’s sky,<br /> O World-Poet,<br /> O Moon of Bengal’s heart,<br /> You were beautiful in your inner life,<br /> You were beautiful in your outer life,<br /> You were beauty incarnate in God’s entire Creation.<br /> Gloriously and triumphantly you secure your place<br /> In the world-assembly with your creative force,<br /> Supremely meaningful and fruitful in various walks of life.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
