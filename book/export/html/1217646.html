<p>"AUM" is a sacred Sanskrit mystic syllable which prefaces all Hindu prayers.</p>
<p>The first issue of the journal AUM (Vol.1, No.1) deals with its full spiritual significance.</p>
<p>AUM is a monthly journal devoted exclusively to the spiritual writings of Chinmoy Kumar Ghose. It will deal with the spiritual life and its problems from the point of view of Indian philosophy and yoga.</p>
<p>AUM is intended to help aspirants of the West in their search for a true inner life by acquainting them with the realisations of a seeker of the Supreme.</p>
<p>We wish to offer our deepest gratitude to Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan President of the Republic of India for his kind message of November 10, 1965 in which he sends his best wishes for the success of AUM</p>
