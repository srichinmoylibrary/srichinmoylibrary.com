<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you sing, please try to sing soulfully as well as powerfully, not just powerfully. Do not put too much force into the song without also using the soul. Otherwise, you will only have the body but not the soul. When you use power, it is the body. When you sing soulfully, you come to know that the soul is manifesting itself through the body. So some of the body is needed, but not to the exclusion of the soul.</p>  </div>
