<p>One day when I was in Pondicherry recently, I was running near the Bay of Bengal. A little Tamil boy said to me, "Sir, you will not be allowed to run here tomorrow."</p>
<p>I asked, "Why?"</p>
<p>He said, "Because you are running too slowly !</p>
<p>I said to him, "All right. I will not come this way tomorrow. Tomorrow I will go to some other place."</p>
<p>Then he said, "No, come here! No matter how slowly you run, come here. I like you."</p>
<p>All this was in Tamil.</p>
