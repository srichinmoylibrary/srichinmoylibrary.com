    <title>Question: A friend of mine who is a pianist had an experience that he told me about. He was playing a passage on the piano, a very fast arpeggio, and suddenly he realised that without reducing the velocity of the passage he could stop and look at every note he was playing. He looked at the notes as though he was looking at what he was doing from another plane where time had not the same dimension as time has here. He was playing very fast and all the time he was looking at what he was doing. There seemed to be no relation to the time concept that we have in this plane. Would you say that this was a case of concentration?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It was not concentration at that time. His soul was playing and having communication with two worlds. He was not concentrating on anything. His soul was communicating with two worlds and he was just observing it.</p>  </div>
