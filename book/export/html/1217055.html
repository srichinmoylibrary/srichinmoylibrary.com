<p>In so many places I have seen paintings, sculptures and carvings of the crucifixion. When I look at some of them, I can feel the sufferings of the Christ, but somehow I can bear it. But when I saw one particular wooden carving of the crucifixion in the Cathedral, I was so overwhelmed. This carving shows the Christ's utter helplessness and, at the same time, his total surrender to his Father. It was the same type of carving that I had seen previously, but some portrayals are more heartbreaking than others. This was one of those carvings.</p>
