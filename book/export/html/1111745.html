<p>Previously when I would start a race, hundreds of people used to go ahead of me. I would just run at my own pace and let everyone pass me. Now I can't believe it — when I run, I go ahead of others. That means my speed has increased. So many people I pass — ten here, two or three farther on. In silence I ask them, "What are you doing? You are doing what I used to do-falling back." Those people are having the same experience that I used to have.</p>
