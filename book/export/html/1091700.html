<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, the occupants will never feel it, because they themselves don't remain in the soul-consciousness. Only people who are spiritually developed, only those who deal with the subtle life will notice the change in the vibration of the room. How is it that today they are not in a very high frame of mind, whereas previously inside that room they used to get a kind of soulful feeling? That is what they will notice.</p>  </div>
