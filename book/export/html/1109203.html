<p>Division and separation will not and cannot appease the inner hunger of the comity of nations. It is the unity in multiplicity that can and will fulfil this hunger. And our Secretary-General tells us that the hour has struck and the world is ready for a new truth-the truth of world-union:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The main issues of the time we are about to enter are multilateral in their essence. They can only be tackled and solved by nations working together. And that collective action will inevitably require international organisations. Thus, the United Nations fits the future. Its Members know they need it. They will certainly use it."</p>
