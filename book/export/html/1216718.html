<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many spiritual methods to communicate with the souls of those who have passed away. The easiest and most effective way is to invoke the soul on the strength of your concentration-power. If you have acquired a free access to the soul’s realm, then you can either go to the soul you want or bring the soul to you, regardless of whether the soul is in the body or in the soul’s world.</p>
<p>Some people find it more difficult to communicate with souls that are in the soul’s world, while others find it more difficult to communicate with souls that are in a physical body. Spiritual Masters of the highest calibre find it quite easy to communicate with both the souls in Heaven and the souls on earth.</p>  </div>
