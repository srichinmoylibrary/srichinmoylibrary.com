<p>Comparing the Okinawa consciousness to the ordinary Japanese consciousness is like comparing the village consciousness to the city consciousness. The city consciousness feels it is superior because it has the mind, whereas the village consciousness feels it is superior because it has the heart.</p>
<p>The village consciousness says, "You say we are uncivilised. But what has your civilisation taught you? To be indifferent!"</p>
<p>If one village person needs money or assistance, others will give it to him. In the city, a rich man will not come to your aid even if you are the poorest man!</p>
