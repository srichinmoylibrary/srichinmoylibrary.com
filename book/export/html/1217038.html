<p>Around 7:15 this morning I was sitting outside. All of a sudden Vidura's soul came to me for blessings and love. I blessed his soul. Then I thought, "He is physically not here in the Bahamas, but his soul came to me for blessings. What is his wife, Devaki, doing?"</p>
<p>It did not take ten seconds! I saw Devaki passing by and I gave her a little smile. Just after Vidura's soul came to me, she passed by. How the souls work! Tomorrow is his birthday, but I blessed him at my place before we left New York. I had a birthday party for him. Today his soul came to me for more blessings.</p>
