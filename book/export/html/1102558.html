<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Through prayer and meditation. When we pray and meditate every day, our necessities diminish. Right now, let us say, we have twenty desires. But if we pray and meditate, over a period of time our desires will gradually decrease until we have no more desires. If we can live even for five minutes without any desires, then we are bound to get peace of mind.</p>
<p>We can also have peace of mind if we can surrender our individual will to God's Will. Now we separate our will from God's Will. We may want a particular thing, although we know perfectly well that God wants us to have something else. He wants us to be liberated from the meshes of ignorance, while we want to enjoy the worldly life or pleasure-life. But if we continue to pray and meditate, eventually we will care only for the aspiration-life â€” Him to serve, Him to fulfil here on earth and there in Heaven. At that time we will most assuredly have peace of mind.</p>
