<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There they are receptive. Although they are fighting and making war in the vital world, when they feel light they try to receive it. On the physical plane, no matter how much light I give, sometimes it does not work. On the inner plane, they may do the same wrong thing, but they appreciate light and immediately try to accept it. On the lower planes, light is not appreciated at all, because when there is light, people immediately feel that they will be exposed. In the inner plane, the attitude towards light is different. There people surrender to light, whereas here they do not surrender.</p>  </div>
