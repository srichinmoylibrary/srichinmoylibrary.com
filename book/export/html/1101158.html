<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can easily know if we are pleasing God, because there will be a cheerful feeling not only inside our heart but also inside our thoughts. Inside the heart there will be something at every moment that will make us feel that we are doing the right thing, and this will give us happiness. At the same time, encouraging and inspiring thoughts will come into our mind and give us satisfaction. So if we get satisfaction inside our heart and inside our thoughts, then we can know that we are pleasing God. Real satisfaction does not come from the pleasure-life. It only comes from pleasing God in His own Way.</p>  </div>
