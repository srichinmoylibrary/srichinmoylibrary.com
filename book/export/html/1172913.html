<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Pray and meditate. Pray, pray, pray and pray to the Supreme. Meditate and meditate on the Supreme. On the physical plane, lose some weight. On the vital plane, lose some insecurity. On the mental plane, lose some impurity. Then your goal is won. There is no other way.</p>
<p>The physical plane means lethargy, which often manifests itself in the form of excess weight. The vital plane means insecurity. The mental plane means impurity. If you can conquer all these, then your goal cannot remain a far cry.</p>  </div>
