<p>This morning I went to buy jalabee for R's birthday. At the counter they had broken pieces, while in one corner they had good ones. I said, "I would like to buy five pounds of the whole ones."</p>
<p>Whatever the price was, I gave it to the man. Then he wanted to give me the broken ones.</p>
<p>I said, "But I want the whole ones."</p>
<p>He said, "Oh, the taste is the same."</p>
<p>I said, "But my eyes won't appreciate them."</p>
<p>Then he looked at me and asked, "Are these for you or for somebody else?"</p>
<p>I said, "They are for somebody else."</p>
<p>He said, "Why didn't you tell me? All right, I will bring the other kind."</p>
