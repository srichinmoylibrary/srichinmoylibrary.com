<h2>Question: When I do my daily activities, I do not feel concerned about them. Is this the right attitude?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you are doing your daily activities you should pray to the Supreme, to the Inner Pilot, who is operating in and through you. God has infinite Concern for human beings in each of their activities. If you are not concerned, that is a mistake. You will have concern, but you will not feel that this concern is coming from you. Feel that it is coming from somewhere else and that an Inner Hand is guiding you. This is the right approach.</p>  </div>
