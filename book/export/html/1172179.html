  <h1 class="book-heading">No refuge from the Florida lady</h1>
  
 
<p>On the last day, I went to my sister's place for an hour. We were talking, talking, talking. My sister was cutting jokes with me and I was cutting jokes with her. She was saying, "Take care of your health. I can see how fat you have become."</p>
<p>I said, "I have lost weight."</p>
<p>On the last day, my sister was giving me absolutely so much joy. Alas, the Florida lady! How could she come into my sister's room at the nursing home? When I saw her, I said, "O my God!" My sister was so sad and upset. Of all people, that lady was coming with some flowers, standing ten metres behind us, near the other patients. I said, "O God, this is too much, too much!"</p>
<p>Then I looked at my sister and I meditated very powerfully for four or five minutes. I said, "I may come once or twice more, but today is the last day. We have cut so many jokes. Now let me meditate. I am not going to pay any attention to that lady. You also do not pay any attention to her. Let us meditate."</p>
<p>When I was about to leave, the Florida lady said, "Please wait, wait. These flowers are from Sri Aurobindo's room."</p>
<p>I was so surprised. I said, "How, how could you get flowers from Sri Aurobindo's room?"</p>
<p>Then she said, "Oh, they are not actually from Sri Aurobindo's room, but while I was plucking them, I thought of Sri Aurobindo's room. So I brought these flowers."</p>
<p>First she said they were from Sri Aurobindo's room. Then she said she thought of Sri Aurobindo's room while plucking them. The last time I went to Sri Aurobindo's room in January, she was there to bother me. This time I did not go. Perhaps she knew somehow. Perhaps she had been observing me. When I challenged her about the flowers, she said, "No, but I was thinking of Sri Aurobindo's room when I picked them."</p>
<p>She brought the flowers near my sister to give them to her, but I got disgusted and I started to move away. Instead of giving the flowers to my sister, that lady had to follow me! Look how sincere her compassion for my sister was!</p>  </div>
