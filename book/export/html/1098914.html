<p>In 1965 I moved to New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn. This apartment was quite good. I made progress; this time I think I paid $70 a month rent. Downstairs there was a flower shop and across the street was the printing shop where I used to go and scream at the printer, who was my very dear friend.</p>
<p>The train used to pass only two or three metres away from this apartment. Not across the street! It went right by the side of the building. Such a noise it made!</p>  </div>
