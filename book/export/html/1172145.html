<p>When I reached Bombay, I wanted to go to a hotel nearby named Samraj. I was going to be in Bombay for three hours, and I wanted to stay in the hotel for two hours. At the airport I asked a hotel representative, "How much do you charge for two hours?"</p>
<p>The man said, "Eight hundred rupees."</p>
<p>I asked, "For half a day there is no special rate? I will be there only for two hours."</p>
<p>He told me, "No, this is our fixed rate."</p>
<p>I decided to go anyway. I asked, "How long does it take to get there from here?"</p>
<p>The man said, "It takes only three minutes."</p>
<p>"Then please take me," I told him.</p>
<p>He said, "Just wait, the coach is coming."</p>
<p>Five minutes went by, then ten minutes, fifteen minutes, twenty minutes. Finally, I said to the man, "Instead of the coach, let me take a taxi." I was ready to give him money, but he said, "We do not take money here. We only make arrangements for the hotel."</p>
<p>After twenty minutes had passed I got disgusted. I said, "I am going to another travel agency to make arrangements."</p>
<p>He cried, "No, no, no." At that moment, somebody came and said the coach was there. Instead of three minutes, it became twenty minutes!</p>  </div>
