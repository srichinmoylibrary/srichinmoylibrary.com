<p>In Bangkok I was looking for someone to massage my back. But in the Grace Hotel, where I was staying, they only had ladies who gave massage. I said, "Thank you very much, but no thank you."</p>
<p>I started calling other hotels. Finally, the Ambassador Hotel told me they had a man who gave massage, so I went there for a massage.</p>
<p>The man who gave massage had been to Australia to learn Russian massage, Chinese massage and general massage. In Indian currency, he charged 120 rupees.</p>
<p>When he first saw me, he said, "You are a Hindu! I can tell from your name. But I am a Muslim."</p>
<p>I said, "Who cares whether you are a Muslim or a Hindu? There is only one God."</p>
<p>He said, "I also feel that."</p>
<p>At first he did Chinese massage, using his elbow. How painful! Then be tried Russian massage. I was lying down, and suddenly he jumped on my back and began jogging on it. I let him go from the base of my spine to my shoulder blades. But when he got to my shoulders, my chest was hurting so much that I asked him to stop. I said, "Russian massage is the worst!"</p>
<p>Then he gave me a general massage. After that I asked him, "Can you come to my hotel at 8 o'clock tonight? I will give you more money."</p>
<p>He agreed, and took down my room number.</p>
