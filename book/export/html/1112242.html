<p>When I ran the New York Marathon some years ago, I noticed that in the beginning, on the hill, the runners enjoy talking. All ridiculous things they tell each other. But most of them have the same story: their wives are laughing at them or their wives have predicted that they will not be able to finish the race.</p>
