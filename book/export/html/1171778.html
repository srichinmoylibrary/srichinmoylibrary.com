<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That means you are perfectly in tune with your soul. You always listen to your soul, so how can there be any discrepancy between your soul's way and your way? It is because you are perfectly in tune with your soul that your soul has made you such a great composer at this age.</p>  </div>
