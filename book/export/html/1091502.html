<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This coolness is the descent of peace. Your third eye is consciously invoking peace. When peace descends, the doubtful mind and restless vital give way to peace. In your case the mind is not doubtful, but the vital to some extent is restless. The third eye is the eye of vision with which we see the past and future at once. The third eye knows what is best for you at this stage of your spiritual life, so it is invoking peace to still your restless vital. When peace is increased, the mind establishes peace within itself. If the descent of peace continues, it will give you much light.</p>  </div>
