<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, have you ever bored your audiences with <em>banal</em> talks?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, I am sure I have done it quite a few times, if not each time I give a talk at a university or some other place. But, thanks to the unconditional kindness and forgiveness of my audience, nobody — not even once — has told me that my talk was <em>uninspiring, commonplace and devoid of originality</em>.</p>  </div>
