<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Since God has created everything under the sun, there is no aspect of His creation which He does not like. Parents can bring into the world somebody very smart, very great and innovative. Again, if a child is blind or deaf, do the parents hate him? On the contrary, the parents show him the same compassion and affection. Whatever God has created, he is bound to like. Philosophy is a creation of His, so He has to like His own creation.</p>
<p>When we create something, on the mental level we may make comparisons. The mind may say that one thing is not as beautiful or as perfect as another thing. But the heart will take what we did in the beginning, what we are doing now and what we will be doing in the future and place them all together, like three children in a family. In the same way God will place philosophy, religion and spirituality together as inseparable creations of His.</p>  </div>
