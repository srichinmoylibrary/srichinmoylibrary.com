<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, why don’t you allow your Centres to be <em>autonomous?</em></p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, you want my disciples in our Centres to be <em>self-governing</em>? You want them to be free from my guidance? For God’s sake, my dear Madal, you should know that it is they who do not want to govern themselves. It is they who realise the fact that the Supreme in me will be able to guide them most effectively and successfully. Finally, it is they who, unlike you, feel that they and I are inseparably one. So the question of self-government on their part does not arise at all. Madal, thank you for this grand question.</p>  </div>
