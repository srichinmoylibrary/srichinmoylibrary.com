<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No amount of physical fitness can be superior to prayer and meditation. Physical fitness can help prayer and meditation, if it is done soulfully. And again, prayer and meditation will be able to help us increase our physical fitness.</p>
<p>But if you have to separate them, if you put physical fitness on one side and the heart's inmost cry for God's Compassion, God's Love, God's Light and God's Peace on the other side, I feel that this inner cry is infinitely more important than physical fitness. At that time, even if you do not want to have the necessary physical fitness, God will give it to you because God wants you to pray and meditate more soulfully and sleeplessly. So if God wants you to pray and meditate more soulfully and more devotedly, He will definitely give you a certain amount of physical fitness.</p>  </div>
