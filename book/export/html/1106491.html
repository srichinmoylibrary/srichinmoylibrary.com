  <h1 class="book-heading">The first day of my 1,000-pound lift</h1>
  
 
<p>Today I lifted 1,000 pounds with both arms for the first time — 500 in each arm. When it came to the fourth lift, I turned on the camera and it went so well. Then I lifted it four more times.</p>
<p>Can you imagine — 1,000 pounds! Is it believable? It is not physical force; it is supernatural. Luckily my back is all right. No wonder why I am shrinking! From 5'8" why did I have to come to 5'7"?</p>
<p>Normally when weightlifters reach a certain weight, a very appreciable weight, they advance by ten pounds at a time. Many years ago I also did that. Now I go by 100 pounds.</p>
<p>Today my bodyweight is 170½ pounds. So I have lifted almost six times my own bodyweight. No matter how you look at it, the fact is that I am dashing against 1,000 pounds with my 170 pounds.</p>
<p>I am so lucky that today the still pictures worked and the video also worked.</p>
