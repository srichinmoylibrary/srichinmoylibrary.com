<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely we shall reach the goal, for the One who has created the goal is also with us and within us. It is He who is at the goal and, at the same time, He is with us in our inner journey. He is inside us to guide us and lead us to our destination.</p>
<p><em>Joel Martin:</em> Thank you, Sri Chinmoy.</p>  </div>
