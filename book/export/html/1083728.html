  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Can spiritual music be played during meditation?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, although it depends on the one who meditates. There are many seekers on earth who meditate extremely well, but who have not developed their musical sense. Their ears have not been trained, so we cannot expect them to change their nature overnight. They either lack the capacity of appreciation or they have some austere feeling about music. There are many seekers who have the silly notion that all music comes from the lower vital. They don't encourage their children to learn music because they feel that as soon as they enter into the music world, they will fall. There is some truth to this because we all know that vital music is most appreciated all over the world. Psychic music is not very widely appreciated, and very few people appreciate the soul's music. They feel it is like a stranger, that is entering into their consciousness. But it is actually their eternal tenant, their soul, that is deep within them waiting to come to the fore.</p>
<p>Naturally, undivine music will immediately lower the consciousness. But if divine music is played during deep meditation, it enhances the meditation. Soulful music will immediately help in elevating the consciousness. This is why we play music from time to time in our Centre. We do not encourage music all the time because there are many people who do not appreciate or admire music. We don't want to create problems for them, since it is a group meditation.</p>
<p>So, if you are fond of music, then please play soulful songs or chants during your meditations at home. Soft, soulful music will definitely help you.</p>  </div>
