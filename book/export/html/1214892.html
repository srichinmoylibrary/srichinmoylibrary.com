<p>What is my duty? I have stopped dining with ignorance-sea. I have stabbed darkness-night. I have given a smart slap to frustration-giant. I have boxed the ears of anxiety-twinges. I have broken the nose of jealousy-impurity. I have kicked off my insecurity-world.</p>
<p>What is my next duty? I have literally taken the life-breath out of pride-autocracy. I have soulfully embraced humility-light.</p>
<p>What is my next duty? I have unlearned everything that I have learned from this insufficiency-world.</p>
<p>What is my next duty? Simplicity’s life I have become. Sincerity’s heart I have become. Purity’s soul I have become.</p>
<p>What is my next duty? I have seen God face to face. I have loved God’s Earth-Body and God’s Heaven-Soul all at once.</p>
<p>What is my next duty? My vision has inseparably become one with God the Silence in Heaven. My mission has inseparably become one with God the Sound on earth.</p>
<p>What is my next duty? My next duty, my only duty, is to beg the present God the Creator to transform Himself into a new Creator. I shall then urge the new Creator to create a new world which will be known as Infinity’s Satisfaction-Delight, founded upon Immortality’s Perfection-Light.</p>
