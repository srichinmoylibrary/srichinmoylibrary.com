<p>The other day I was running near the outdoor flea market on the corner of Parsons Boulevard and Union Turnpike. Some young boys were playing near the street. One of them stopped playing and came running towards me. He folded his hands and called out, "Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>Only two hours before that, in the Queens shopping mall, someone else had stood in front of me and folded his hands when I was there shopping.</p>
