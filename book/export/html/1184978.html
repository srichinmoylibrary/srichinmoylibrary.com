<p>Don't throw your today<br /> Against tomorrow.</p>
<p>Don't throw your today<br /> Against yesterday.</p>
<p>Allow today to grow and glow,<br /> To sing and dance in its own way.</p>
<p>Like yesterday, today too<br /> Has much to contribute.<br /> Like tomorrow, today too<br /> Has much to contribute.<br /> Give today its full value.<br /> Let it play its role unhindered,<br /> Unobstructed.<br /> Let it play its role in full majesty,<br /> Sovereign,<br /> Alone.</p>
