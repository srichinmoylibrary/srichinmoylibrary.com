<p>While most of the questions of Book 1 of <em>Earth’s Cry Meets Heaven’s Smile</em> were posed by seekers attending Centre meditations or public talks in the New York or San Juan areas where Sri Chinmoy’s major Centres were located, those in Book 2 reflect the steady expansion of the Master’s spiritual mission.</p>
<p>Questions from all parts of the United Kingdom and some from continental Europe now make their appearance. Onwards from 1969, public lectures were given by Sri Chinmoy in various European countries. Each talk was followed by a question period, samples of which first appeared in the series Sri Chinmoy Answers, reprinted here.</p>
<p>A number of Sri Chinmoy Centres, established as early as 1968, will be represented in later books of this series.</p>  </div>
