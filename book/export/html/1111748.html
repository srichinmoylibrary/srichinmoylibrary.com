<p>Sometimes I see that after only four miles or so, strong young men start walking. They are very strong and muscular; their chests, arms and legs are so developed. Perhaps they think that their muscular power alone will carry them through the race. But if that were the case, then weight-lifters would all be excellent runners.</p>
