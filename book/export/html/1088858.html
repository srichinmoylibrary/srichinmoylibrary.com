    <title>&lt;em&gt;Donna Halper:&lt;/em&gt; In other words, to hear music helps one to become more in tune with God. How does it do this? If I were an atheist and I heard that music I don&#039;t know if I would think about God, but I know that I would feel very relaxed and peaceful. Would you say that that feeling means being closer to God?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We cannot define God in terms of one specific feeling or experience. Each one has to experience God for himself. If we say God is all Peace or God is all Delight then there will be people to contradict us. Each one has to define God for himself. We all want he have satisfaction. I have satisfaction by experiencing truth and light and others will also derive satisfaction from that reality-experience although they may call it by a different name.</p>  </div>
