<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have been trying for the last ten years to create a Heaven on earth. After staying with me for five six seven years some people make an about-turn and go away. So you see temptation is everywhere. Here somebody is tempted to seek earthly experience. Or perhaps he is tempted to experience again something undivine that he did ten years ago. He may also be tempted to do something new that is divine. So even the cosmic gods may succumb to temptation. Then, when they make a mistake they fall.</p>  </div>
