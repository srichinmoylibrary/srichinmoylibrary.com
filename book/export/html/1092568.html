  <h1 class="book-heading">Nationalism</h1>
  
 
<p>Nationalism is not a highly political or mental aspiration. What is nationalism? In the words of Sri Aurobindo, "Nationalism is not a mere political programme; Nationalism is a religion that comes from God..."</p>
<p>Now let us observe what Jawaharlal Nehru writes about the contribution of Rabindranath to Nationalism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nationalism, especially when it urges us to fight for freedom, is noble and life-giving. But often it becomes a narrow creed, and limits and encompasses its votaries and makes them forget the many-sidedness of life. But Rabindranath Tagore has given to our nationalism the outlook of internationalism and has enriched it with art and music and the magic of his words, so that it has become the full-blooded emblem of India's awakened spirit."</p>
