<p>A little boy came home from school, and he was crying and crying. His father asked him, "Why are you crying? Have you not done well in your examination?"</p>
<p>"I am sure I have done well," said the boy. "I knew the answers to so many questions, like the longest rivers in the world, the largest and smallest countries, the highest mountains and many, many more. But during the examination, I was absolutely sure I was right in the answer I gave to one particular question. Now that I have come home, I see that I was definitely wrong."</p>
<p>"What was the question?" asked the boy's father.</p>
<p>"I shall tell you in just a moment, but I have something very important to ask you. You once told me that if we pray very sincerely, then God listens to our prayers. I remember praying to get a bicycle, and God answered my prayer. Then I prayed once for Cousin Jimmy to stop teasing me, and he stopped. Now I am praying to God with all my heart for only one thing," the boy said. "Father, please tell me the absolute truth. Is it really true that God listens to our prayers?"</p>
<p>"Yes, son, it is absolutely true," his father replied. "Now will you tell me what you are praying for?"</p>
<p>The boy said, "I am praying that Paris, which is in France, will move to England."</p>
<p>"What are you saying?" asked the astonished father. "What kind of prayer is that?"</p>
<p>The boy replied, "On my school examination the teacher asked, 'What is the capital of England?' I answered that the capital is Paris. Now I am praying and praying to God that immediately Paris should move to England and London should move to France!"</p>  </div>
