<p>The husband and wife were blessed with a daughter. The husband told their Master that he had had a dream. In the dream he saw that it was Sri Ramakrishna himself who had come into their family. The Master said, “It is impossible; Sri Ramakrishna has not come. A great soul like Sri Ramakrishna has not come into your family. Just yesterday, in the soul’s world, I had a talk with Ramakrishna about something.” But the husband’s dream was so vivid that he felt either the Master was telling a lie or the Master did not want to give him or his family proper credit for the kind of soul that had come into their family. So both of them left.</p>  </div>
