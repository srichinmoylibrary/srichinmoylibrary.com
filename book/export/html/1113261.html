<p>I was working in Nolini-da's room on the floor near his bed. Suddenly he came and sat on his bed with a thud. "Do you know that yesterday I ran against Madanlal? (Madanlal was at least twenty years younger than Nolini-da.) I kept up with him for eighty metres, but the last twenty metres he drew ahead of me."</p>
<p>"That is nothing. At the start, perhaps you didn't have the determination to keep up your speed to the end. Otherwise, you could easily have kept pace with him to the end."</p>
<p>"I too think so."</p>
<p>"Moreover, recently you developed some pain in your leg. That, too, should be taken into consideration."</p>
<p>"Needless to say, you are my staunchest supporter and my best lawyer."</p>  </div>
