<p>Leave me alone, leave me alone.<br /> I need my rest in my soaring nest.<br /> My bleeding heart for God's bending Ears.<br /> His Heart my host, His Soul my guest.</p>
<p>Leave me alone, my play is done.<br /> O world, no more shall I stab your pride.<br /> Your lessons wild are harrows of death<br /> I shall unlearn — in God to hide.</p>
<p>Leave me alone, leave me alone.<br /> I have now seen my goal's highest Soul.<br /> In the glow and flow of Silence-Sea<br /> My life of cries has found its role.</p>
