<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to try to be more conscious is to spend more time in meditation. If you spend one hour now, then try to spend an hour and a half; then increase it to two hours. God has given us twenty-four hours a day. Out of twenty-four hours, we can spend quite a few hours in meditation. We spend much time on the telephone. God has given us aspiration, and God has also given us a mouth. But in silence we can say more; in silence we can also act more powerfully. So if we want to be conscious of our inner experiences during sleep, then we have to try to spend more time on our spiritual life.</p>  </div>
