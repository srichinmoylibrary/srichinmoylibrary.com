<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I came to America in 1964. I lived in Manhattan for a year or so, and then I lived in Brooklyn. I have been in Queens for about 30 years, in Briarwood. Truth to tell, it was difficult for me to adjust to Manhattan. The hustle and bustle of life was not congenial to my life’s activities. It is not that I dislike Manhattan — far from it! I go to Manhattan twice a week to offer my peace meditations at the United Nations, but I feel that Queens is more peaceful in comparison.</p>  </div>
