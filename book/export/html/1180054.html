<p>There was a time<br /> When I wanted to enjoy God's Fellowship<br /> Only to become<br /> An extremely important member<br /> Of God's cosmic Society.</p>
<p>Now I enjoy God's Fellowship<br /> Only to unlearn<br /> What the ignorant world<br /> Has taught me forcefully<br /> Over the years.</p>
<p>There shall come a time<br /> When I shall enjoy God's Fellowship<br /> Only to offer to the world at large<br /> One message in supreme silence:<br /> Just because God knows<br /> What we truly are,<br /> He needs us infinitely more<br /> Than we need Him.</p>
