<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is my progress report. I always advocate progress. Sometimes when the boat is nearing the shore, it either capsizes or it increases its speed. In my case, luckily the boat didnâ€™t capsize; it reached the shore very fast. As Bill Pearl has said, I have no preconceived ideas about weight and what is or is not possible to lift. So if you are not afraid of something, you just try it. If nothing bad happens, you are lucky. Otherwise, you may be miserable to the end of your life. Luckily, I was protected by my Beloved Supreme. Otherwise, any day some accident could have happened. After 1,300 pounds the bar was bending like anything. When I did 2,000 pounds, it was bent so much that many people thought it could break.</p>  </div>
