<p>How can he be happy<br /> When wild storms are ahead of him?<br /> How can he be happy<br /> When red dangers are beside him?<br /> He can be happy,<br /> He can be happy<br /> Because his Master has said:<br /> "Be happy."</p>
<p>How can he be happy<br /> When he knows that he has failed<br /> In his life-examination?<br /> How can he be happy<br /> When he knows that he has fought<br /> Against the compassion-warriors of Light?<br /> He can be happy,<br /> He can be happy<br /> Because his Master has said:<br /> "Be happy."</p>
