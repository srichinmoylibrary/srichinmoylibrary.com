<p>Yesterday we went to a shoe store in Brooklyn to buy running shoes. They know Tarak there, and they like him very much. The wife has a tremendous soul's connection with Pratibha, and the husband has a tremendous soul's connection with Kanan. While I was talking to them I was seeing their soul's connection with our disciples.</p>
<p>If you go there, you will see on the wall my picture in the New York Marathon. Thousands of people are ahead of me, but I am clearly visible.</p>
