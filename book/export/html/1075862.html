<p>Once a very large meeting took place at Bhabananda Park in Calcutta. C. R. Das was presiding over the meeting and his wife, Basanti Devi, was beside him.</p>
<p>The eminent scientist, P.C. Ray, said to them, "Here I see a real king and a real queen. Although they are without crowns, we are all ready to listen to their commands most willingly and most gratefully."</p>
