<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are a seeker, then it is absolutely possible. A seeker knows that he is nothing and he can do nothing unless and until God's Grace operates in and through him. He knows that he is not the doer. It is God, out of His infinite Compassion, who is acting in and through him. This moment God has given him the capacity to do something, and the next moment God can give the capacity to someone else. So if he knows that the capacity does not belong to him but that God, out of His Compassion and Oneness, has granted him the capacity to do something or become something special on the earth plane, then how can he become vain?</p>  </div>
