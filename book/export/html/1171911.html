SCS 76-79. Questions and answers following /Love me or hate me, but don't ignore me./</p>
<h2>Question: How can one bring harmony into one's inner being when there is conflict in one's life?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to acquire harmony, one needs peace of mind; and in order to acquire peace of mind, one has to pray most soulfully. How does one pray soulfully? One prays most soulfully when one offers gratitude to God, the Inner Pilot, or to the Light that makes him feel the necessity of harmony. Harmony has to be invoked, and if one properly invokes harmony one is bound to get peace of mind. And if one gets peace of mind, there will be harmony in what he does and what he becomes. Even in his outer movements there is bound to be harmony. We are wanting in harmony in our outer life only because we do not have an iota of peace of mind. When the mind has peace, then there is always harmony in one's whole being.</p>  </div>
