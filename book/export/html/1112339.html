<p><em>(Woodrow Wilson in his White House Office.)</em></p>
<p><em>Woodrow Wilson:</em> Alas, a world war has begun with all its atrocities. I want my country to stay out of the war. To me, war is undivine and inhuman; therefore, it is beneath my dignity to fight. I have urged my nation not to enter into the vortex of war. We have had enough of war. What we need and what we shall always need is peace. <em>(He glances at the morning news and is horrified.)</em> I can't believe my eyes! German submarines have sunk our ships! I wanted to remain out of the war. Now I see that this can never be. Fight we must to defend our country. But I shall tell my country and the world that, for America, this will be a war to end all war.</p>  </div>
