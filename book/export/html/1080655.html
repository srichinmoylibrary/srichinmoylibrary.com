<p>I was honoured on March 9th to be a guest of Sri Chinmoy and his disciples at a luncheon at the Annam Brahma restaurant. We came as strangers, but found a common meeting ground â€” the mothers through love for their children, the children through love for their Guru and the Guru through his love for God. The result was sincerity, which to me is excellence. My heart was thankful to Sri Chinmoy for the thoughtfulness he has inspired in the young people who worked so hard and generously to show us their love. The feeling of graciousness was only outshone by the feeling of love that went into the preparations to make us welcome. The food was delicious, our presents were beautiful, and Guru's words to us and his answers to our questions were as reassuring as the bright and happy faces around us. The paths that we travel are different, but I am glad we can reach out,and have the understanding to appreciate each other.</p>
