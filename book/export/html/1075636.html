<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The world is constantly evolving, progressing, consciously or unconsciously. It is like a tiny seed which is sprouting into a plant, and then growing into a tree. Like this the world is evolving. There was a time when we were in the mineral world, then in the vegetable world, then in the animal kingdom. Now we are humans; but if we are sincere enough, we will see that although we have a conscious, developed mind, we still have not cast off our animal propensities and qualities. We are still half animals, quarrelling, fighting, struggling. But a day will come when there will be divine people on earth. We will see them just as we are now seeing human beings in front of us.</p>  </div>
