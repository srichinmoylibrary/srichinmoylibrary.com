<p>This incident happened before Charoibeti came back to our path. I was cycling around Flushing Meadow Park and I did not see that there was a big bump in the road. I fell down miserably.</p>
<p>Charoibeti happened to be walking there and she saw me fall. Full of sympathy and concern, she cried out, "Oh, Guru!" Then she ran to get help. More than four hundred metres she covered to tell the disciples what had befallen me and she had to jog quite slowly because she was pregnant. Chataki was inside her mother.</p>
<p>Afterwards Charoibeti said that she had gone to the park with the hope of seeing me.</p>  </div>
