<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> During practice, the seeker-athlete should feel that he is preparing himself to become a beautiful flower. Then, at the time of competition, he has to feel that he has grown into the beautiful flower and is now ready to place himself at the Feet of his Lord Supreme.</p>  </div>
