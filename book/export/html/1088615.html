<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, most of the ancient sages have taken additional human incarnations, but they did not necessarily incarnate in a spiritual family or continue with their spiritual life. In some cases they entered into other fields, like science or politics, because they wanted to see the world in all its potentialities and capacities, and experience life in different ways. Some of them are not even following spirituality. They felt they had had enough. They had reached a certain height and did not want to continue in that direction immediately. It is like somebody who went to graduate school in one field and then changed subjects without getting a Ph.D. in the particular subject in which he started.</p>  </div>
