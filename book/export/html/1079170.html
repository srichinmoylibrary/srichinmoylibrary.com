<p>Two cannot agree. When God agrees with my desire-life, His suffering becomes unbearable. When I agree with God's ever-transcending Vision, my suffering becomes unbearable, for I am not ready to be one with Him at every moment of my life. But I am begging my Lord Supreme not to agree with my desire-life, but to give me the capacity to become one with Him devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally-always and always.</p>
