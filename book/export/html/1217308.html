<p>I have twice had the opportunity to witness such a performance. I was not afraid because fortunately I was not one of the performers. And I was not astonished because I was aware of the power of faith. They had a tremendous faith in Govinda (Lord Krishna). Chanting the name of Govinda with intense devotion, they walked unscathed over the fire.</p>  </div>
