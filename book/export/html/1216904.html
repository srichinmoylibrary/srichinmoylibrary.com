<p>I was on my way to our hotel lobby for the Montreal Peace Concert. I got into the elevator on the twelfth floor and went down.</p>
<p>Kirit and Surashri had pressed the button for the elevator on the tenth floor. When the door opened, I saw them standing there. I thought that was the lobby so I went out of the elevator. They didn't say anything to me because they didn't know what I was doing.</p>
