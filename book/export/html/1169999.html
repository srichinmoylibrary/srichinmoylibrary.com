<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is absolutely necessary for the parent, the teacher and the child to love one another. The parents, the teacher and the child must all feel that they belong to the same family. The parents were the child's first friends. Then his teacher came to him as a friend. The more friends that the child has, the easier it will be for him to conquer his enemy: Ignorance. So when he gets more friends, new friends, then he must always welcome them.</p>  </div>
