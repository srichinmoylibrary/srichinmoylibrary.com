<p>Last but not least, I visited my former coach, Saumitra, a German runner who coached me in India. Now he is head of a school which has three or four thousand students. He is the father of three sons and he does not run anymore. He has lost a lot of his hair, but nobody can defeat me in losing hair. He looked at me and I looked at him. In silence we talked about our hair.</p>
<p>I spent an hour and a half with him. What a moving experience! We talked and talked and talked about many, many things. He gave me the greatest surprise. In 1958 I had given him a small album with some pictures. Also, I had composed two songs about him. One was sung in front of the head of the ashram by two hundred athletes. He has kept that song plus the other song I had composed, one of my pictures and the album. Projjwal had sent him a photograph of me running a marathon. He has kept everything like a treasure. I had totally forgotten about the album and the pictures, but he has preserved them under lock and key in a cupboard with his most valuable things. He brought them to me with such concern and care.</p>
<p>We discussed many, many things and gave each other tremendous joy. His wife is extremely spiritual. When he was in India, he was not yet married.</p>
<p>Our old friendship we revived. At one point I said, "You were an excellent coach but I was a hopeless case."</p>
<p>He said, "I never told you that you were a hopeless case. It is all your mental creation!"</p>
<p>I said, "I could not learn your way."</p>
<p>He said, "But that does not mean you were hopeless. In your own way you did so well."</p>
<p>That was Saumitra.</p>  </div>
