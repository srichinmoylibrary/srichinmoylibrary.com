<p>The embrace of bondage<br /> Demands and commands.</p>

<p>His life closed three times<br /> Before its final close:<br /> Once when he entered<br /> Into the private chamber<br /> Of the fear-queen,<br /> Once when he entered<br /> Into the cave<br /> Of the doubt-monster,<br /> Once when he threw himself<br /> Into the flow<br /> Of the insecurity-river.</p>

<p>When God-freedom<br /> In me was crucified,<br /> I fought life.<br /> I received from God<br /> His adamantine Will<br /> Which now pulsates<br /> From life to life.<br /> It goes from start to start,<br /> It runs from Vision to Reality.</p>

<p>I want to be happy.<br /> But alas, how can I,<br /> When others are surpassing me?</p>
<p>I want to be happy.<br /> But alas, how can I,<br /> When others are governing me?</p>
<p>I want to be happy.<br /> But alas, how can I,<br /> Since I have not pleased my Inner Pilot,<br /> Not even once?</p>
<p>I want to be happy.<br /> But alas, how can I,<br /> Since I know I can never be<br /> What I want to be?</p>

<p>The other day God asked me<br /> What I was aspiring for.<br /> I said, "I would like<br /> To offer infinite praises to man."<br /> He immediately granted my prayer.</p>
<p>The other night man asked me<br /> What I was aspiring for.<br /> I said, "I would like<br /> To become the dead dust of God's Feet."<br /> Man's answer: "How dare you think<br /> God would condescend to grant you<br /> Such a mighty prayer?"</p>

<p>I died for beauty,<br /> But beauty came not.</p>
<p>I died for joy,<br /> But joy came not.</p>

  </div>
<div id="node-1216162" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">532. Transformation</h1>
  
 

<p>Birthless and deathless I was,<br /> And then I was raised above<br /> The throes of birth and the buffets of death.<br /> This was my first transformation.</p>
<p>Across the river<br /> Of life and death<br /> I sang only one song: uncertainty.<br /> This was my second transformation.</p>
<p>My third transformation will take place<br /> When the animal in me<br /> Surrenders to the divine in me<br /> And Immortality embraces the divine in me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1216163" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">533. Integrality</h1>
  
 

<p>My life-tree has four branches:<br /> Sincerity, purity, humility, divinity.</p>
<p>These four branches bring me<br /> The message of integrality<br /> From far Heaven.</p>
<p>When sincerity offers me<br /> The message of life divine,<br /> Purity, humility and divinity together dance.</p>
<p>When purity offers me<br /> The message of self-dedication,<br /> Humility, divinity and sincerity together dance.</p>
<p>When humility offers me<br /> The message of world-illumination,<br /> Divinity, sincerity and purity together dance.</p>
<p>When divinity offers me<br /> The best message of God-perfection<br /> Here on earth, there in Heaven,<br /> Sincerity, purity and humility together dance.</p>
<p>The dance of sincerity, purity, humility and divinity<br /> Is the highest flight of God,<br /> The integral Universal Self.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1216164" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">534. Courage</h1>
  
 

<p>The animal in me<br /> Showed the animal courage<br /> By fighting and strangling.</p>
<p>The human in me<br /> Showed the human courage<br /> By snubbing and belittling.</p>
<p>The divine in me<br /> Shows the divine courage<br /> In accepting and loving.</p>
<p>The Supreme in me<br /> Shows the supreme courage<br /> In transforming, widening, deepening<br /> And finally transcending.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1216165" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">535. Music</h1>
  
 

<p>When I play music<br /> I know for sure someone is there<br /> To listen to my music.<br /> No matter what music I play,<br /> Whether heavenly or earthly,<br /> Sublime or deadly,<br /> There is someone to listen to my music.<br /> There is God.</p>
<p>When God plays His Cosmic Music<br /> Day in and day out from time immemorial,<br /> I enjoy and fulfil<br /> The strongest adamantine demands<br /> Of my inconscience-deep.<br /> I sleep and snore and snore and sleep,<br /> Nadir of universal futility.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1216166" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">536. Exaltation</h1>
  
 

<p>The other night I was exalted<br /> When I dined with God the Supreme.</p>
<p>The other day I was exalted<br /> When I breathed the excruciating pangs<br /> Of earth-penuries.</p>
<p>From this life of mine<br /> Only two more exalted experiences I need,<br /> I most desperately need.</p>
<p>I need the experience unprecedented<br /> Of seeing two human shoulders<br /> Carrying the burdens of hell-fire,<br /> Earth-water and Heaven-wine.</p>
<p>I need the experience<br /> Of seeing Heaven-Beauty's glorious Transcendence<br /> Fulfilling earth-beauty's splendour-light.</p>
<p>My journey's start was the exaltation<br /> Of God-man in me,<br /> And my journey's close will be the exaltation<br /> Of man-God in the Absolute Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1216167" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">537. Devotion</h1>
  
 

<p>I offered my purest devotion to God.<br /> He accepted my devotion only to increase<br /> Its height and depth in boundless measure.</p>
<p>I offered my surest devotion to man.<br /> He accepted my devotion<br /> Only to criticise and belittle<br /> My sincerity's heart.</p>
<p>I offered my blue-gold devotion to Heaven.<br /> Heaven accepted my devotion<br /> With a smile, a half-knowing smile.</p>
<p>I offered my devotion to the green-brown earth.<br /> Earth suspected, rejected,<br /> Strangled and buried my devotion-life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1216168" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">538. Awakening</h1>
  
 

<p>In my body's awakening,<br /> I saw God as a sweet dreamer.</p>
<p>In my vital's awakening,<br /> I saw God as a dauntless warrior.</p>
<p>In my mind's awakening,<br /> I saw God as a peerless seer.</p>
<p>In my heart's awakening,<br /> I saw God as an unconditional lover.</p>
<p>In my soul's awakening,<br /> I saw God as the sovereign<br /> And absolute Liberator.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1216169" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">539. Life</h1>
  
 

<p>In this rare incarnation of mine<br /> I decided and planned to see the lives of God,<br /> Heaven, earth and man.</p>
<p>I have already seen man-life.<br /> It is nothing but a song<br /> Of deathless destruction-night.</p>
<p>I have already seen the life<br /> Of earth, too.<br /> It is nothing but teeming clouds.</p>
<p>I am now seeing the life of Heaven,<br /> Which is building my life-altar<br /> To reach the transcendental Heights.</p>
<p>I shall soon be seeing the life of God,<br /> Which will discover the Zenith-perfection-light<br /> Founded on my acceptance-might.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1216170" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">540. Gratitude</h1>
  
 

<p>When I offered my feeble gratitude to God,<br /> He immediately said,<br /> "Ah, what is it? I have never seen<br /> Such a beautiful thing in all My life<br /> Either in Heaven or on earth.<br /> Can I use it for a purpose divine?"<br /> I smilingly said,<br /> "Certainly You can.<br /> It is for Your daily and constant use."</p>
<p>When I offered my powerful gratitude to man,<br /> He immediately blurted out,<br /> "You know your deception<br /> Has touched the topmost bough of the earth-tree.<br /> I have given you my silver advice, my golden promise<br /> And my diamond assurance.<br /> Although they were the products<br /> Of the world of fury,<br /> I certainly deserve infinitely more<br /> Living and fulfilling gratitude<br /> Than what you have given me today.<br /> Take it back,<br /> Take it back,<br /> You rogue, you beggar-woman!<br /> From now on my life of compassion<br /> Shall barter nothing<br /> With the bones of a beggar-woman."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1216171" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">541. Adoration</h1>
  
 

<p>I adored my Lord Supreme<br /> With my fear-fever.<br /> Furious he became.<br /> He bolted His Golden Gate from inside<br /> With all the power at His command.</p>
<p>I adored my Beloved Supreme<br /> With my heart-flames.<br /> Self-enamoured He became.<br /> In a twinkling, sooner than at once,<br /> He opened His Golden Gate wide;<br /> He offered me His French-bowed emerald throne.</p>
<p>I adored my Eternal Friend<br /> With my surrender-light.<br /> Perfection-Infinity He immediately donned.</p>
<p>O Lord Supreme<br /> Your forgiveness I implore.<br /> O Beloved Supreme,<br /> Your Love-sea I shall eternally treasure.<br /> O Eternal Friend,<br /> Your Heart's ever-widening Magnanimity<br /> Has made my life<br /> The Voice of transcendental Silence.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1216172" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">542. Progress</h1>
  
 

<p>Lord Supreme,<br /> I want You to be<br /> Totally frank with me.<br /> Have I made any progress<br /> In my three years<br /> Of spiritual life?</p>
<p>"Certainly, My son, you have.<br /> Let Me tell you about<br /> Your great progress:<br /> You now love Me<br /> Infinitely more than<br /> You love yourself.</p>
<p>And here is your greater progress:<br /> Nothing will satisfy you<br /> Unless and until<br /> You have become the unconditionally<br /> And supremely surrendered instrument<br /> Of Vision-nourished Reality-Will.</p>
<p>Lo, Your greatest progress:<br /> You claim Me as your own,<br /> Your very own."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1216173" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">543. Transcendence</h1>
  
 

<p>Self-transcendence<br /> And<br /> God-transcendence<br /> Are the Self-form<br /> Of the same transcendental Reality.</p>
<p>When I endeavour to fathom<br /> My self-transcendence<br /> With my human comatose eyes,<br /> I see the radical transformation<br /> Of the devouring tiger in me<br /> Into the fast-running, sure-winning deer.</p>
<p>And when I plead with the Supreme<br /> To elucidate the signification<br /> Of transcendence, He just smiles<br /> And declares:<br /> "Yours is the transcendence-task<br /> To touch the feet of My creation<br /> For its fire-pure transformation.<br /> Yours is the transcendence-goal<br /> Where the comity of souls have discovered<br /> Their only haven."</p>

<p>Father, my Father,<br /> I have now caught You tightly.<br /> Just tell me in brief<br /> The actual meaning of heart-essence,<br /> And then I shall let you go.</p>
<p>"Child, My child,<br /> The heart-essence<br /> Of the aspiring earth<br /> Is the surrender-tree<br /> Of the Supreme's Nectar-delight.</p>
<p>The heart-essence<br /> Of the sailing Heaven<br /> Is the silence-tree<br /> Of the Supreme's Nectar-delight.</p>
<p>The heart-essence<br /> Of the liberating Supreme<br /> Is the surrender-silence-perfection Tree<br /> Of the Absolute Supreme's Nectar-delight."</p>

<p>O sweet Lord of my unconditionally<br /> Surrendered heart,<br /> O sweet Pilot of my life-boat,<br /> O sweet Speed of my soul-river,<br /> O sweet Smile of my Goal-shore,<br /> Just tell me the difference<br /> Between<br /> My lustre-drop and Your lustre-sea.</p>
<p>"O sweet child of My Vision's Immortality,<br /> The difference is very simple and clear.<br /> With your lustre-drop I body forth<br /> And feed the birthless and deathless hunger<br /> Of the entire universe;<br /> And within My lustre-sea I claim you,<br /> I own you as My only<br /> Fulfilling and manifesting<br /> All."</p>

<p>The whole world moves on,<br /> But I stand still.</p>
<p>The whole sky descends,<br /> But I stand still.</p>
<p>The whole earth aspires,<br /> But I stand still.</p>
<p>With my outer stillness,<br /> I see the Feet of God.<br /> With my inner stillness,<br /> I become the Heart of God.</p>

<p>In the inner world<br /> What he needs and wants<br /> Is Immensity's rest.</p>
<p>In the outer world<br /> What he needs and wants<br /> Is the sea of pleasure.</p>
<p>In the world of the Supreme<br /> What he needs and wants<br /> Is the Perfection-throne.</p>
