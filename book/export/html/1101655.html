<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> I pray to You to grant me<br /> Only one Boon<br /> In this incarnation of mine:<br /> Every morning and every evening<br /> I wish to wash<br /> Your Infinity's Compassion-Feet<br /> With my heart's gratitude-tears.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101657" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Absolute Lord Supreme<br /> My outer Success entirely depends<br /> On Your Eye's Compassion-Flower.<br /> My inner progress breathlessly depends<br /> On Your Heart's Satisfaction-Fragrance.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101658" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3.</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1101659" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Absolute Lord Supreme,<br /> From today on<br /> I shall use my heart<br /> In a new way<br /> To feel spontaneously<br /> Your Compassion and<br /> Forgiveness<br /> Infinitely more<br /> And also to give You<br /> My newly-born love and surrender<br /> Cheerfully and unconditionally.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101660" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Absolute Lord Supreme,<br /> Is there any special way<br /> To please You in Your own Way<br /> At every moment of my life?<br /> "My sweet child,<br /> There is a way, there is a way.<br /> Just give Me your obedience-<br /> Cheerful obedience<br /> And soulful obedience,<br /> Oneness-obedience<br /> And fulness-obedience.<br /> Lo, you have the capacity<br /> And you are the capacity<br /> To please Me in My own Way<br /> At every moment of your life."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101661" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Absolute Lord Supreme,<br /> Alas, why do I feed and nourish<br /> Teeming imaginary sufferings<br /> And thus disappear<br /> From Your Eye's<br /> Compassion-Illumination-<br /> Protection-Nest<br /> To enter into<br /> The desolate desert-Sahara?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101662" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Absolute Lord Supreme,<br /> In my devouring<br /> Animal incarnations<br /> You loved me unconditionally.<br /> In my doubting<br /> Human incarnations<br /> You loved me unconditionally.<br /> And now,<br /> In my aspiring divine incarnation<br /> You are loving me unconditionally.<br /> My Lord,<br /> Do grant me the supreme capacity<br /> To breathe in the sweet fragrance<br /> Of sacred remembrance.</p>

<p>My Absolute Lord Supreme,<br /> My body is hiding my purity.<br /> My vital is hiding my humility.<br /> My mind is hiding my sincerity.<br /> My heart is hiding my divinity.<br /> My soul is hiding my Immortality.<br /> My Lord, my Lord, my Lord,<br /> Do compel them to give me back<br /> My Eternity's treasures<br /> In infinite measure.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101664" class="section-2">

<p>My Absolute Lord Supreme,<br /> With my heart's mounting cries<br /> I wish to prove to myself<br /> That I need You only.<br /> With my eyes' glowing smiles<br /> I wish to prove to myself<br /> That I love You only.<br /> With my life's self-giving ecstasies<br /> I wish to prove to myself<br /> That I serve You only.</p>

<p>My Lord,<br /> You are telling me<br /> That You are not going to waste<br /> Even a fleeting second with me<br /> Anymore<br /> If spirituality is my mind's luxury.<br /> But if spirituality is my heart's<br /> Supreme necessity,<br /> Then every day You will teach me<br /> A new lesson<br /> Absolutely illumining<br /> And supremely fulfilling.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">28.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> My Beloved Supreme,<br /> What is a miracle?<br /> A miracle is something<br /> That the finite cannot accomplish<br /> By itself,<br /> But that the Infinite can easily do<br /> In and through the finite.<br /> I am the finite.<br /> You are the infinite.<br /> I am gratitude sleepless.<br /> You are Compassion breathless<br /> And deathless,<br /> Plus unconditional,<br /> Unconditional,<br /> Unconditional.</p>

  </div>
<div id="node-1101686" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">31.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> This is a day off for me<br /> From trying to fool You.<br /> Today I shall only<br /> Devotedly and soulfully<br /> Count and see<br /> How many Compassion-Eyes<br /> And how many<br /> Forgiveness-Hearts<br /> You have for me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101687" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">32.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord, my Lord,<br /> I am engulfed in the flames<br /> Of doubt, fear, worry and anxiety.<br /> Prayerfully I invoke You,<br /> Soulfully I implore You<br /> To come to me and save me!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101688" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">33.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord, my only Lord,<br /> It is I who have allowed myself<br /> To be whipped by unwillingness,<br /> And now I am dumbfounded<br /> By the ruthless threats<br /> Of giant doubts.<br /> My Lord, save me,<br /> Save my existence-life on earth!</p>

<div id="node-1101689" class="section-2">

  </div>
<div id="node-1101691" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">36.</h1>
  
 

<p>My sweet Lord Supreme,<br /> Now that I am absolutely certain<br /> That my love for You<br /> Is genuine and unconditional,<br /> I wish to forget once and for all<br /> Even my last stumbling dance<br /> With uncertainty, incapacity<br /> And unwillingness<br /> When I could not make<br /> My unconditional surrender<br /> To You.</p>

<div id="node-1101692" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">37.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Eternity's Lord Supreme,<br /> Today You have made me<br /> A pioneer-citizen<br /> Of the transcendence-delight-world.<br /> May my ever-climbing<br /> Gratitude-heart-tree<br /> Someday, at Your choice Hour,<br /> Touch Your ever-descending<br /> Golden Feet!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101693" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">38.</h1>
  
 

<p>My dear Lord, my sweet Lord,<br /> My Absolute Lord Supreme,<br /> As Your unconditional<br /> Compassion-Ocean<br /> Is far beyond my comprehension,<br /> Even so, alas,<br /> It seems my conscious love<br /> For the temptation-volcano<br /> Is far beyond<br /> Your Comprehension.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101694" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">39.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Beloved Supreme,<br /> Could You spare a moment?<br /> I shall be eternally grateful to You<br /> If You powerfully put<br /> Your Purity-Handcuffs<br /> Around my impurity-mind.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101695" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">40.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> When I tell You<br /> That I have been thinking of You,<br /> I sincerely feel that I am offering You<br /> A piece of good news.<br /> My Lord Supreme,<br /> When You tell me<br /> That You have been thinking of me,<br /> I immediately feel<br /> That I have made<br /> Tremendous progress<br /> In my life of aspiration,<br /> And I clearly see<br /> That my life's transformation-goal<br /> Is not a far cry,<br /> But is within my easy reach.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101696" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">41.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> I have only two friends:<br /> Your Compassion-Eye<br /> And Your Forgiveness-Heart.<br /> "My child,<br /> I also have only two friends:<br /> Your morning's smiling face<br /> And your evening's singing heart."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">46.</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1101702" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">47.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> I am sure that You are<br /> Extremely happy today,<br /> For I have finally dethroned<br /> My life's ego-king.<br /> "My child,<br /> I am more than happy,<br /> More than proud<br /> And more than satisfied.<br /> But now you have to do<br /> Something else for Me.<br /> Soulfully, devotedly<br /> And cheerfully,<br /> You have to become another God!"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101703" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">48.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord, my sweet Lord,<br /> My Supreme Lord,<br /> I do know that my life's<br /> Unconditional surrender to You<br /> Is fast asleep.<br /> But I clearly see that my heart's<br /> Most sincere gratitude to You<br /> Is wide awake.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101704" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">49.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord, my Lord, my Lord,<br /> I may not know<br /> What Your Compassion-Eye<br /> Looks like,<br /> And I may not know<br /> What Your Forgiveness-Heart<br /> Feels like,<br /> But I do know<br /> That You have been<br /> Sleeplessly and eagerly waiting<br /> For only one perfection-cry<br /> From my heart<br /> And for only one satisfaction-smile<br /> From my life.</p>
