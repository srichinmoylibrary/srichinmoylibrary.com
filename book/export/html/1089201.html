<p>With gratitude, joy and pride I also dedicate the following poem to my dear brother and friend Akishige Matsumoto, who is officiating as the Japanese Chairman of the China/Japan Friendship Association. Quite a few delegates are here tonight. For the last fifteen years friendship-oneness has reigned between these two countries, and today they are observing this oneness.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more precious than when the unfortunate enemies of the past become dearer than the dearest oneness-friends. This is the supreme victory over ignorance-night. Now the Supreme's Light is illumining these two countries with His blessingful Peace on earth.</p>  </div>
