<blockquote>
<p>If you hope to lead the people, then I invite you to first learn to follow the people. Go to the people and learn from them first. Learn also not only to ask questions, but to seek the answers.</p>
<p><em>Let Us Protect Sri Lanka</em> <em>by Ranasinghe Premadasa</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who wants to be the student? "Not me!" Our answer will immediately be in the negative. Who wants to be the teacher? "Me, me, at every moment!" Immediately our answer will be in the affirmative. Indeed, this is a common experience for Mother-Earth.</p>
<p>If you do not want to be a student first, then how will you learn? If you do not learn, then how are you going to teach? If you do not want to be led at first, then how will you know whether the road you are on is straight or crooked and full of obstacles, whether it is a sunlit path or a road of tenebrous darkness? Be first a student of the heart. Then you will be able to become a teacher of life.</p>  </div>
