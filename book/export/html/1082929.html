<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the physical, the vital, the mind and the heart are not cooperating with the soul, the soul finds it difficult to manifest its divinity. The soul has infinite Peace, Light and Bliss, and the soul has the potentiality and capacity to manifest the Light of the Supreme. But if the body, the vital, the mind and the heart consciously refuse to accept the soul's Light, the soul's mission will be temporarily delayed. But all the unruly members of the family are bound to surrender to the soul's light eventually. We can expedite this event by consciously trying to become one with the soul's Peace, Light and Bliss through our prayer and meditation.</p>  </div>
