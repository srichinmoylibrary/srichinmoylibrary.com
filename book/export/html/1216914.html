<p>When Vajra went to Yannick Noah's restaurant in New York, Noah's wife came and greeted him with folded hands, saying, "Sri Chinmoy is here." She thought it was me, and she was showing him utmost respect and veneration.</p>
<p>A similar thing has happened many times during our parades. I am on the sidewalk running alongside the marchers, and Vajra is marching in the parade. So they think he is the Guru, the chief.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sri Chinmoy himself paid a visit to Noah's restaurant. But since Noah's wife didn't feel the same kind of divinity in me, the treatment could not be the same.</p>
<p>So if you want to see my divinity more revealed and manifested, then Vajra is the answer!</p>
