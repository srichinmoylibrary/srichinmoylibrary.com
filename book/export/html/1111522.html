<p>At the two-mile point two women were running near me. When I was passing by, one of them was so excited to see me. She said to the other one, "Do you know who that is?"</p>
<p>The other one said, "Who?"</p>
<p>O God, the first woman who saw me answer because I was coming very near them and she didn't want me to hear. Perhaps she was afraid of the pronunciation, afraid that she would be embarrassed.</p>
<p>Then, when I was about five metres ahead of them, the lady said, "Sri Chinmoy." But when I was running next to them, she wouldn't tell her friend who I was.</p>
