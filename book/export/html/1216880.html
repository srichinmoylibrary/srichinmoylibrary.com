<p>When I went to the Spanish Consulate to get my visa, the clerk was very unkind. For a long time she was avoiding and ignoring everyone. Then a little girl came to our rescue; she came as our saviour.</p>
<p>She was only two or three years old, and she was smiling and laughing and making lots of noise. She was very cute, and she made everybody smile. Even the undivine clerk started smiling, and then everything changed for the better; she started to do her job properly. Soon we got everything we needed. Otherwise how many hours we would have stayed there!</p>
<p>So that little girl changed our fate. God sent her to help us and save us.</p>
