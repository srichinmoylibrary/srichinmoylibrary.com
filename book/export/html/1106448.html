<p>Today I tried seven times to lift up 600 pounds (300 pounds in each arm). All the attempts were negligible and useless. On other days, when I spend so much energy, it goes, but today no. Something is wrong with my footing perhaps. Otherwise, this kind of pushing is in no way less than what I did before. Or perhaps it is the breathing. Previously, towards the end of the push, I used to take a fresh breath. That one breath is so important. Nowadays I have not been doing that. Strangely enough, I feel stronger than I felt three weeks ago.</p>
