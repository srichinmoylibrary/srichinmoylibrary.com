<p>Naren, When are you planning<br /> To come down to the earth?<br />   "I have no such plans."</p>
<p>Gadadhar, When are you thinking<br /> Of coming down to the earth?<br />   "I don't cherish that kind of thought any more."</p>
<p>Jesus, When will you illumine the world<br /> To celebrate your second resurrection?<br />   "I am more than satisfied<br />   With my advent and with my first and last resurrection on earth."</p>
<p>Siddhartha, Have you ever thought of moving<br /> From your Nihil house to Earth house?<br />   "Oh no! I shall forever<br />   Remain in my Nihil house<br />   Of Immortal Peace<br />            And<br />   Immortal Bliss."</p>
<p>Kanu, You declared that you enter into the world-arena<br /> Whenever righteousness declines<br />            And<br /> Unrighteousness prevails,<br /> To destroy the dark hands<br /> And save, elevate and illumine the snow-white hearts.<br /> Since then, how many times<br /> Have you appeared and disappeared<br /> From the earth-scene?<br />   "I am not accountable to the world for my lofty promise.<br />   In top secret I tell you:<br />   The absolute Supreme is not going to fire me<br />   Even if I hopelessly fail to stick to my well-intentioned promise."</p>
