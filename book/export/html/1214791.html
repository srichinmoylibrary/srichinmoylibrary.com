<p>His was the life of conscience. His was the heart of compassion. His was the mind of serenity. His was the vital of determination. His was the body of sanctity.</p>
<p>To him, an outer life of violation indicated an inner life of imminent destruction.</p>
<p>His single-minded service to the United Nations for ten long years showed the world what mental equanimity and psychic luminosity can do for mankind.</p>
<p>He showed the world that a life of self-transcendence, a life of truth-discovery and a life of light-manifestation must not remain always a far cry.</p>
<p>In him the United Nations quite astonishingly discovered a faithful servant, a soulful friend and a fruitful leader.</p>  </div>
