<p>Once I went alone to visit Ericâ€™s parents in Pittsburgh. While coming back at night in the bus, I was only watching the moon for the entire journey. It took three and a half hours or even more. There were no other passengers. The bus driver was driving and I did not want to talk to him. I was only meditating and meditating on the moon.</p>  </div>
