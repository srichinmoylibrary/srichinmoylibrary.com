<p>I couldn't believe the fellow who stood first in the long jump! I used to do it in four steps, but now I would die if I tried. All the competitors were old men like me, but I wouldn't dare to try it.</p>
<p>When I saw the javelin competition, I felt sorry that I didn't join. Perhaps I would have won. But they used a 16-pound shot for the shot-put. The man from Thailand who stood first was three times my size. He threw it so far!</p>
