<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What happens when we don't love God? If we don't feel our love for Him in the morning, our whole day is miserable; there is a sense of frustration. But if we do love God, then even if everything in our outer life is unpleasant, it does not matter.</p>
<p>If we don't meditate, no matter how much people appreciate us, we feel that something is missing. But if we do meditate, no matter how many calamities take place, still we are happy. So we have to know what we want. If we want divine satisfaction, we have to meditate on God as soulfully as possible. In the beginning it is difficult because God is only theoretical. But when we meditate for a while, we feel that God is something natural and normal. He is like us, except that He is illumined and divine. We start with the idea that we need God. Then we come to realise that we need only God and we must choose God above everything else. Then, God asks us to take Him as our very own and fulfil Him and please Him in His own way.</p>  </div>
