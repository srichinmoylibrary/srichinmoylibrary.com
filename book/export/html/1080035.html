<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is through prayer and meditation. Right now this body which we claim as our own is our only truth. This body, which will live for sixty or seventy years, is our life. But when we pray and meditate, we see that this body is not our entire existence. Our entire existence is eternal life. Here on earth for seventy years we play a specific role; then we leave the body and take rest. After some time, again we will come back to earth to love God, to manifest God.</p>
<p>How can we be eternally aware of what we have within us? We can be eternally aware of our inner existence, our inner life, only through constant prayer and meditation. When we are not aware of this truth, it is as though we are sick. We have to take medicine, and this medicine is our aspiration. When we are unaware of what we have, that means we have developed a kind of disease. And in order to cure this disease, what we need is aspiration.</p>  </div>
