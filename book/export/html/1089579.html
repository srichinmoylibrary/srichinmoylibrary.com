<p>In one village there were a few notorious boys who used to torture men and women alike while they were walking along the street. In various ways these rogues would torture the villagers. They would beat people up, tie them up on the street and do all kinds of terrible things.</p>
<p>One day the village scholar was walking along the street. He was well respected because he had studied spiritual scriptures. These boys wanted to make fun of him, so when he was passing by, one of the boys threw a stone at him. The stone struck his forehead, and he started bleeding profusely. The boy who had thrown the stone got frightened, and all the boys started to run away.</p>
<p>The great scholar said to the boy who had struck him, "Come here, come here! I have something very nice to tell you."</p>
<p>The boys could not believe that this scholar was so kind, compassionate and forgiving. So all of them came back. The scholar said, "I am so happy that you have someone among you who has such good aim. I tell you, one of these days I will ask the zamindar, the village chief, to walk along this street. He will definitely be pleased to see what good aim you have because he needs a few hunters. I can see clearly that all of you will be very good hunters. The zamindar will be so pleased with the one who is able to throw a stone most accurately that he will want his daughter to marry that person."</p>
<p>A few days later the zamindar was going somewhere, and he and his bodyguards took that particular street. The boy who had thrown the stone was waiting on that street. He was so happy because he thought that he would be able to marry the daughter of the village head. When the group passed by, this fellow came very near and threw a stone at the zamindar. The boy was caught immediately by the bodyguards, and they put him and his whole gang in jail, instead of asking him to marry the zamindar's daughter.</p>
<p>From this story we learn that a weak person can be wise, and a strong person can be a fool.</p>  </div>
