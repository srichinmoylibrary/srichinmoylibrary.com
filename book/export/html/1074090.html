<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I feel that Westerners have always been open to our Eastern concepts. They readily, lovingly, soulfully and self-givingly have accepted our Eastern concepts.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Does it take extra training?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it does not. Their hearts are completely ready. Therefore, it does not take extra training for them to accept the spiritual way of India.</p>  </div>
