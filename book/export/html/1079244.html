    <title>&lt;em&gt;Question: I&#039;d like to know if there is any way that we can still meditate and practise yoga without giving up our own religion?&lt;/em&gt;</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is very easy. Yoga is not a religion, and at the same time, it is not at all against religion. Religion is a house. I have to stay in my house; you have to stay in your house. We will not be able to stay in the street. But we have to know that there are quite a few things that we do not get in the house. Yoga we may get somewhere else, but we can easily bring it into our house. Aspiration, prayer, meditation will not conflict with any religion. Yoga is just like a course in school. It is a path that we can all walk along together, regardless of our religion.</p>  </div>
