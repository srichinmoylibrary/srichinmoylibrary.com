<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! A flower signifies purity, and white means divinity. When we have purity and divinity, then we have peace within us all the time.</p>
<p><em>Joel Martin:</em> Guru Sri Chinmoy, I thank you very much. Sri Chinmoy — of India, living now in New York and frequently on Long Island, an international figure — has been with us for this half hour. It has been a very interesting half hour, and I thank you very much for being with us. Until next time, thank you, Guru.</p>  </div>
