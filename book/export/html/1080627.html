<p><em>Sri Chinmoy (showing some photographs of his meetings with other musicians):</em> This is Pablo Casals. He was shedding tears when we met and saying, "In the evening of my life, you have come." He played his cello for me. It happened in Puerto Rico many, many years ago.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Yes, I knew him very well. Very interesting.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In Manhattan we met Leonard Bernstein twice. Each meeting we started with a meditation.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Lenny Bernstein's lifestyle was quite different.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> But when he was with us, he was always fond of meditating.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> He was a genius, a remarkable man, a marvellous man. But he was torn inside. <em>(Sri Chinmoy shows photographs of his meetings with Zubin Mehta, Kurt Masur, Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan. Then he presents Mr. Menuhin with a copy of the song that he has composed about him.)</em></p>  </div>
