  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: When did you study philosophy?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I studied philosophy at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram where I grew up. Between the ages of nineteen and twenty-three I studied, or you can say devoured, all the Western philosophers in considerable depth. The Ashram library is my witness. When I was studying Immanuel Kant’s 800-page book, <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, my professor came up to me and said, “What are you doing?” I said by way of joke, “I want to enjoy sleep. When I read these works, I fall asleep!”</p>
<p>Among the philosophers that America has produced, I sincerely appreciate, admire and adore Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson had an illumined mind. He studied our Indian Vedas and Upanishads. From there he got a higher wisdom and he was able to go very deep. His philosophy is mine.</p>
<p>Before Emerson was Thoreau. Thoreau was a nature-worshipper. He brought in another approach. Each philosopher has a different approach. Sometimes the philosophers do not know that they are borrowing from a previous philosopher. Truth is, after all, one. So each philosopher tries to decorate the truth in a different way.</p>  </div>
