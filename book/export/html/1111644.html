<p>If Khudita can run fast, what is wrong with me? I may be fifty years old, but I am not as "thin" as she is. Again, she carries all her extra weight so powerfully. She has physical strength. She is so strong! Such determination she has to carry her body. I am proud of her.</p>
<p>Each disciple-runner has some peculiarity. When I see "tall man" — Adhiratha — how he is struggling! His strides are quite long, but there is no speed inside them. He looks like he is going so fast, but what actually happens? Why is he behind so many people?</p>
