<p>When one becomes great, one’s nationalism grows into internationalism and every nation claims one as its own, very own. But alas, when one brings discredit to one’s nation, that nation, even though it is one’s motherland or fatherland, does not hesitate to disown its son or daughter.</p>
<p>Einstein said, <em>“If my theory of relativity is proven successful, Germany will claim me as a German and France will declare that I am a citizen of the world. Should my theory prove untrue, France will say that I am a German and Germany will declare that I am a Jew.”</em></p>  </div>
