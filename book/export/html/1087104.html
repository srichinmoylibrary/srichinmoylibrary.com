<p>In a store in a Delhi hotel I saw a tabla book and I thought of Sahishnu. A few months ago I had said nice things about his tabla playing. So I said, "Now let me get him a book."</p>
<p>I was browsing through the book. I did not know the cost, but I made up my mind to buy it. I asked the owner, "How late do you stay open?"</p>
<p>He said, "9:30."</p>
<p>I said, "I will come back again." I was really hungry, so I went to eat.</p>
<p>Around 3 o'clock I came back. Their afternoon siesta is wonderful. Their lunch break is three hours, and the store was closed. So I came back again at 8 o'clock. Can you imagine? That book was sold. The shopkeeper said, "Do you expect opportunity to come again and again?"</p>
<p>I said, "Tell me the truth. How many months have you had that book here?"</p>
<p>He said, "Months? It has been here for two years."</p>
<p>So look at Sahishnu's luck. Nobody had bought the book for two years, but that day somebody had to come and buy the book. It was my stupidity. I should have bought it the first time.</p>
