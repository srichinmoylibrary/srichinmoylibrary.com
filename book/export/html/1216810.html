<p>On the way from Hiroshima to Nagasaki, I had a wonderful conversation with the driver of the train. I was appreciating him, and he was smiling like anything.</p>
<p>How I wish I had his job! He works for three days and then has one day rest. Then again for three days he works. Each day he works for only a few hours. But his job takes great patience. Even after fifteen minutes, most people would be tired of doing it.</p>
