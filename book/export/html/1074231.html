    <title>Disciple: I just finished reading a book about the Bermuda triangle. It is a place where planes and ships disappear into thin air, or ships with full crews are found abandoned with no people on board and no signs of any chaos. Can you explain what happened here?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some occult power, forces, have the capacity to disintegrate existence-reality. Therefore, we notice the disappearance of the ships.</p>
<p>Also, some Indian spiritual Masters have consciously and deliberately taken away the five elements that constitute the physical body and dissolved them for a couple of hours. Then they revitalised them at a different place.</p>  </div>
