  <h1 class="book-heading">The price of peace</h1>
  
 
<p>Peace is humanity's sleepless and breathless need. Needless to say, no earthly human sacrifice can ever be too great to make for the Heavenly divine peace. According to the seer-statesman Mr. Perez de Cuellar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Peace has its price. In terms of political compromise, of accommodation, even of short-term disadvantage for the sake of the longer gain, the price may be considerable. It requires courage and statesmanship. In terms of finances, the price is negligible. In a pragmatic sense, war's devastation dwarfs the costs of peace. And in a moral sense, there is no price to place on single human life."</p>
