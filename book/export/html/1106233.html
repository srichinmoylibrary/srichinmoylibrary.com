<p>2,000 pounds feels so difficult compared to 1,500. But extra strength comes from within. This extra strength you can see in my screaming. For today’s 2,000-pound lift, the noise that I made you can’t imagine! It is so frightening!</p>
<p>I concentrate on each weight before I lift it. At the same time, I don’t think of it. When I look at the weights, believe me, there is nobody more frightened than I am. I say, “This is the weight I am going to lift!” But then more inner strength comes.</p>
