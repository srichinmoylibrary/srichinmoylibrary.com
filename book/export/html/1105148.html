<p><em>(Sita is seated in the circle awaiting her husband's arrival. Enter Ravana, the King of the Demons, in the guise of an ascetic. Sita receives him with reverence. He chants from the holy scriptures.)</em></p>
<p>SITA: O Saint, my husband is in danger. I have scolded his brother mercilessly, and he has at last gone to help him. He did not want to listen to me. He thought that I would be in danger here. But I am perfectly safe. Now a saint has come to console me. O Saint, tell me what I can do for you.</p>
<p>RAVANA: I am hungry, Mother, I am hungry.</p>
<p>SITA: I shall give you food.</p>
<p>RAVANA: Mother, what is this? This circle?</p>
<p>SITA: Oh, Lakshmana made this circle for me. He said that I must not go outside it. He said that if I go outside this circle I will be in danger.</p>
<p>RAVANA: Mother, you know that you are not in danger here. I am a saint. I have come here just to console you. I feel sure that your husband will come back safe. He is a great hero. Now Lakshmana is with him. Even if he is in danger, he will come back, Mother.</p>
<p>SITA: I shall bring food for you.</p>
<p><em>(Sita goes outside the circle and immediately Ravana grabs her, puts her on his shoulder and runs. Sita begins to scream.)</em></p>  </div>
