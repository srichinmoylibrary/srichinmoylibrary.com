<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In some cases, the consciousness has generally gone higher. Even when they are not meditating, they are doing something else spiritual, and their consciousness remains high because they have established something permanent in the spiritual life. In other cases, only during the time of meditation, at the height of their meditation, has the consciousness gone higher. In the first category, the consciousness is raised during meditation and also during their normal activities. I am very grateful to them. They go up in their morning meditation and start the race. Then they continue running during the day. They work all day, and even at night, instead of watching television or listening to the radio, they work for the mission. They are constantly sacrificing and doing selfless service.</p>  </div>
