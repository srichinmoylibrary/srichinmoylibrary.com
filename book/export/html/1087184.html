<p>It takes such a long time to buy things in Chile because you have to write down what you want. I went into a restaurant to buy 100 cups of yogurt, but they thought I wanted only 20 cups.</p>
<p>I tried to show them that I wanted five times 20, but they thought I wanted just five.</p>
<p>Finally I took out the 18 or 19 yogurts that were there and then asked for more. Then at last they understood.</p>
