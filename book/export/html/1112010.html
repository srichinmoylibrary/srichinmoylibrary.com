<p>Today in the mini-triathlon only Databir, Pahar, Pulak and Dhanu couldn't swim. In the big triathlon, they would be forbidden — we cannot afford to lose four or five lives.</p>
<p>On the boys' side Kripan was the best! Luckily Kripan was not driving; he was swimming. First he would go to one side, towards Anugata. Then he would go to the other side. His wife was screaming. How much time he was wasting going to this side and that side! He totally forgot about geometry.</p>
