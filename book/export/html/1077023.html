<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every human being is of the opinion that a dream is infinitely more inspiring than reality. The immediate effect of a dream on our mind is to create inspiration, This is because when we are in the dream world all our soulâ€™s capacities are at our disposal. We can do many things and see many things which we cannot do or see during our waking hours. We can freely enter into many realms which we cannot enter at other times. When you develop the inner capacity to enter into all these realms at will, then you will see that dream and reality have become one. At that time reality and dream will be equally inspiring.</p>  </div>
