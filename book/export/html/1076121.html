<p><em>(Several days later, before Kumara returns home, he meets his enemy, Narada.)</em></p>
<p>NARADA: O Kumara, everything is finished.</p>
<p>KUMARA: What is finished?</p>
<p>NARADA: Finished. Your brother, Ganapati, has gotten married.</p>
<p>KUMARA: How? When? How did he reach our father before me? Has he gone around the world?</p>
<p>NARADA: Well, I do not know about that. But I can tell you that I have just come from your house, where I saw that he has two most beautiful girls as his wives.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Two? He has married two?</p>
<p>NARADA: Yes. Your parents are so pleased with him, so proud of him. Instead of one, they have brought him two beautiful, most beautiful girls. I don’t know. When you get married, I doubt that you will get as beautiful a girl for yourself.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Two wives? Two beautiful wives? I can’t believe you!</p>
<p>NARADA: If you do not believe me, you can go and see for yourself. You are very near your house.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Unbelievable! Unthinkable! My parents, my own parents have deceived me! Let me go and see.</p>  </div>
