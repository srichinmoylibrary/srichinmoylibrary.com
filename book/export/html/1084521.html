<p>Silence, are you sure<br /> That you are the seed of my life?</p>
<p>Aspiration, are you sure<br /> That you are the plant of my life?</p>
<p>Realisation, are you sure<br /> That you are the tree of my life?</p>
<p>Revelation, are you sure<br /> That you are the flower of my life?</p>
<p>Perfection, are you sure<br /> That you are the fruit of my life?</p>
