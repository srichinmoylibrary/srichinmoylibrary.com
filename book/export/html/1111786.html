<p>A lady told Shephali that she saw me running once a few years ago before she knew anything about meditation. She said, "I saw a man running at a distance. He was like a light. I was so curious that I followed him in my car." The lady pointed to her third eye and told Shephali, "He was just like a light."</p>
<p>Then Shephali showed her one of my "Run and Become" books, and the lady was laughing while reading the stories.</p>
