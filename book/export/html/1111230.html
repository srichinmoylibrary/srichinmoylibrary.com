<p>As I made a left turn off 150th Street, I noticed an old man on the corner, looking at me. I looked at him and said, "Good morning." In a few seconds he felt inspired to also start running. I said to myself, "O God, what is he doing?"</p>
<p>As he approached me, the time came for me to show off. I ran fast, but then I cursed myself. Usually, if people pass by me, I say, "Oh, perhaps he is doing only one or two miles and I am doing eight or nine." This time I felt sorry for my stupidity.</p>
<p>For 200 metres we ran together. Then he made a right turn and I made a left turn.</p>
