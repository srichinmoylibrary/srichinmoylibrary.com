<p>Yesterday I went to a grocery store nearby. When I went to pay, the man behind the counter said to me, "Do you have a brother named Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I said, "Why?"</p>
<p>He said, "You look exactly like him."</p>
<p>Then he looked at me again and dropped his bag of plantain chips and said, "Sri Chinmoy! Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>He told me, "Two or three years ago I went to one of your meetings in Manhattan. There I saw you meditating." He couldn't believe that I would be shopping in a grocery store. He came from the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>He was so excited. He told his friend, "Sri Chinmoy is in my store! Sri Chinmoy is in my store!"</p>
