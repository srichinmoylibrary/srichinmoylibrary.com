<p>I am truly grateful<br /> To man and God,<br /> To earth and Heaven,<br /> Because<br /> They are pleased with my books.</p>
<p>God is pleased with my books,<br /> Because<br /> My books devotedly manifest Him<br /> On earth.</p>
<p>Man is pleased with my books,<br /> Because<br /> My books represent him<br /> Adequately.</p>
<p>Heaven is pleased with my books<br /> Because<br /> My books carry many seekers<br /> To Heaven.</p>
<p>Earth is pleased with my books<br /> Because<br /> My books embody earth-pangs<br /> And earth-smiles.</p>
