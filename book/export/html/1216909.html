<p>There are very few disciples of mine who do not like Japan. The Japanese love the beauty of the East in their inner life and they love the power of the West in their outer life.</p>
<p>When I come to Japan, at every moment I am inspired to compose songs. Yesterday I composed a song about Japan in the sports store. Today I composed a song on the bus. The last time I visited the Kamakura Buddha, I composed "Namo namo" in front of the statue. The first time we visited it, I composed "Jaya jaya."</p>
