<p>I had been planning to give up my weightlifting after the 17th, but the Supreme Himself has asked me to continue. This weightlifting brings joy and inspiration to thousands and thousands of people. So I will be taking my lifting equipment to Brazil and I do hope that I can make some progress there.</p>
