<p>Even if a mature seeker<br /> Is doubting his own spirituality,<br /> Even if around him<br /> Is nothing but frustration and hell,<br /> He still has a golden chance<br /> To rediscover in himself<br /> The divine qualities<br /> Which he has temporarily lost.<br /> How? Just by sincerely encouraging<br /> The new seekers who have come after him.</p>
