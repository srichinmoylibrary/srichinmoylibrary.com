<p>When we were celebrating Madhuri’s birthday, she asked me why I give animals such importance. I told her that it is because they give me joy. It is like playing with a top or a new toy.</p>
<p>I see how restless the monkeys are! My monkey Madhu is restlessness incarnate, but it gives me such joy to watch him.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I used to have animals at home — dogs, birds, monkeys. Now I am bringing back my old habits. These are not bad habits; old habits can also be good.</p>
<p>Everything has an inner reason. The main reason I keep animals is because they give me tremendous joy. Also I feel that these innocent beings need my special attention. Every day I hear the birds and look at the monkeys and various other animals — the guinea pigs, gerbils and so on. Every day I do it.</p>
<p>I really feel sad when one of the birds falls sick or when the monkeys and other animals do not do well.</p>
<p>Animals have restlessness and cuteness and, at the same time, sweetness and fondness. All these qualities go together.</p>
