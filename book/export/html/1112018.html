<p>The other day while I was walking, a gentleman with a cane grabbed my left arm and said, "You are not doing the right thing. You must run, always run!"</p>
<p>I said, "Do you run?"</p>
<p>He said, "I can barely drag my leg, so I cannot run."</p>
<p>A nice gentleman! But he didn't realise that I also have serious leg problems!</p>
