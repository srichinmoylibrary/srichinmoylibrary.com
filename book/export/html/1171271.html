    <title>Mrs. Tripathi: Creative expression is also a form of &lt;em&gt;bhakti&lt;/em&gt;, don&#039;t you think? You yourself are an artist in many ways. That is also a form of &lt;em&gt;bhakti&lt;/em&gt;, isn&#039;t it?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely! <em>Bhakti</em> means devotion. A true creator offers everything to God as part of his devotion. He prays to God not for anything specific, that is, not to become a good poet or a great singer or a great athlete. If he is a true seeker, he prays to God: "Please make me a choice instrument of Yours. You express Yourself in and through me, if You want to, as a writer, as a singer or as an artist." He surrenders his own desire-life to God, and he accepts God's Will with his aspiration-life.</p>
<p>In the desire-life we go from wanting one house to two houses to three houses to four houses, from one car to two cars. It is only the expansion of material wealth. But in the aspiration-life we say to God, "Whatever I need, please give me. I do not want to have any choice. If You want me to have one house or a car because You feel that it is of supreme necessity, then You can give it to me. But if You feel that it is not at all necessary, then do not give it to me." The aspiration-life is the life of surrender to God. The aspiration-life says to God, "Please utilise me in Your own Way." The desire-life says to God, "I want to become happy in my own way. If You give me material wealth, I will be happy."</p>
<p>But the more material wealth we get, the quicker we bind ourselves. Whereas, if we get even an iota of light, peace or bliss from Above or from within, then we enter into the effulgence of the vast ocean of light. So desire binds; aspiration liberates.</p>  </div>
