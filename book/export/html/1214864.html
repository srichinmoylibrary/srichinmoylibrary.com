  <h1 class="book-heading">Patience</h1>
  
 
<p>Patience is our unrecognised capacity; patience is our unrecognised achievement. Capacity succeeds; achievement proceeds.</p>
<p>Physical power, vital power and mental power are no match for patience-power. When physical power is misused against someone, the patience-power of that person will eventually triumph. In the outer life and the inner life, the victim will eventually succeed.</p>
<p>Human power is nothing short of animal power, destructive power, if we do not aspire, if we do not long for truth, light and beauty. Patience is our soul’s light. This light is always unconditional.</p>
<p>Here on the physical plane we notice patience in the mother and in the father. The mother’s compassion-light is patience; the mother’s concern-light is patience. The father’s wisdom-power is patience in his son. The father’s wisdom-power, his all-seeing wisdom for his son, is patience.</p>
<p>God created this world. In His creation vast He considers only one person as His friend: Patience. God and His Patience are inseparable.</p>
<p>God’s creation is not complete; perfection is still a far cry. God with His infinite Patience-Light aspires in and through each creation of His. God feels that His Patience-Light is a divine, magic power that can undo the past and transform it into the golden future.</p>
<p>There is nothing on earth that can undo the past but patience. If we have patience we can easily undo the past. The past is a morning mist, a meaningless experience in comparison to our future realisation. The past brought us the message of suffering, sorrow, weakness, limitation, bondage and death. Again, the soul’s light, which is patience, will eventually conquer delusion, illusion, temptation, limitation, everything undivine. God’s Patience-Light will conquer everything in and through us.</p>
<p>Man needs patience in order to discover what he truly is and God needs patience in order to make man feel not only that he is God’s son, God’s dearest creation, but that he is exactly the same as God. Man has to realise what he eternally is: God Himself. Man is now God veiled; with patience-light man will unveil his inner divinity. Man is God yet to be consciously and constantly realised and God is man yet to be manifested totally, completely and unmistakably here on earth.</p>
<p>Deliberately and consciously man claims something as his own which is not actually his: ignorance. But there is only one thing that man can claim as his own: God, nothing less and nothing else. Unless and until man comes to realise this, he will never know who he is. Man is divinity’s reality. This is the only thing that he has to discover: his real reality which is dormant within him.</p>
<p>When he is in the desire-life, each man should realise that in him there is God-seed. That God-seed is going to germinate eventually into a plant, and from a plant it will grow into a banyan tree. Again, when the same person enters into the spiritual life, he has to feel that the fruit, the eternal fruit, is already there just for him to eat. In the desire-world he has to discover God the seed so that he can grow and grow in aspiration. In the aspiration-world he has to discover God the fruit so that he can recognise what he eternally is.</p>
<p>Patience is our revealing and revealed faith in God, the Supreme Pilot, and our revealed and revealing faith in our own existence. Patience is our faith in our own discovery that we are not only of God but also for God.</p>
<p>The human cry that climbs up from the inmost recesses of our heart makes friends with patience in order to see the smiling face of Heaven and the Eternal Pilot. Again, the Eternal Pilot makes friends with patience so that one day He can see here in humanity’s cry the perfect liberation, everlasting salvation, complete illumination and total transformation of humanity.</p>
