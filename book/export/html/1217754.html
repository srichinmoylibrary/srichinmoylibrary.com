<p>Dear President, Vice-President, Counsellor, Legal Adviser, Secretary, Treasurer, Head of Public Relations, Head of Intellectual and Cultural Activities, Head of Selfless Service, and Members of the Aum Centre:</p>
<p>On this divinely significant day, let us offer our deepest gratitude to the Supreme. No human being is inaugurating the Centre. The Supreme is inaugurating the birth of His own child.</p>
<p>If you think of the Divine child, the Supreme will think of you. If you feed the child with your heart's aspiration, the Supreme will feed your body, mind, heart and soul through Eternity. If you become one with the child, you will see and feel that the Supreme has already become one with you.</p>
