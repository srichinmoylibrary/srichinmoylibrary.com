<p>Human thoughts drenched his eyes.<br /> Divine thoughts purified his eyes.<br /> Human thoughts drenched his eyes of sleep.<br /> Divine thoughts illumined his eyes of dream.<br /> Human thoughts made him feel<br /> His life is a series of frustration-death.<br /> The divine thought made him feel<br /> That his life is an express train<br /> Of measureless length.</p>
