    <title>Question: Why have you come to the West rather than remaining in your own country where there are so many tremendous problems, such as the population explosion, and where, in fact, no progress has been made since the departure of the British?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Concerning the population explosion, the Government is in charge of this particular problem. However, as a spiritual man, I myself have every right to pray to God to illumine the Government to do the right thing. In regard to what progress India has made in the past twenty years, you must go to India yourself in order to make a fair judgement concerning this. Since you probably cannot do this, read newspapers or books that are written by Indians. Or failing this alternative, I suggest that you surrender your proud ignorance to the true truth.</p>
<p>Only the other day America had to face the same problem of British control. You were under British subjugation and yet, if I were to ask you what progress has been made here since independence was achieved, I would probably be sent to a mental asylum. Nevertheless, I recently read a book called <em>Only in America</em>, written by an American. In this book countless unthinkable, unimaginable, absurd things taking place in this country are described.</p>
<p>Wherever God wishes me to go, I go. For a spiritual person, there is no country, no geographical boundaries. In your case, your world is circumscribed not only by geographical limitations, but also by your obligations to your wife, your children and your job. But a spiritual person is not bound by such limitations. I am God's son, and His entire creation is my world.</p>  </div>
