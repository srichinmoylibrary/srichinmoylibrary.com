<p>I tell my desire-mind<br /> That God is not pleased with us<br /> Because we want to possess Him,<br /> But my mind does not believe me.</p>
<p>I tell my aspiration-heart<br /> That God is extremely pleased with us<br /> Because we want to be possessed by Him,<br /> But my heart does not believe me.</p>
<p>I tell my illumination-soul<br /> That God is extremely pleased with us<br /> Because we are manifesting Him<br /> In a remarkable way,<br /> But my soul does not believe me.</p>
<p>O my Lord Supreme,<br /> Nobody believes me.<br /> Do You think that at least<br /> You can believe me?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> Not only do I believe you,<br /> But I also appreciate your mounting<br /> And illumining wisdom-flames."</p>
