<p>Six months ago I had a wonderful conversation with three Yogi-Friends of mine. I was curious to know what they thought of their disciples. I wanted to know if they were satisfied with their disciples.</p>
<p>My Yogi-Friends A said, "Well, I think that in this life I have made only one serious, nay, irreparable mistake in accepting disciples. I really do not know whether I am their master or they are my master. I am mightily lucky that God told me that this is my last incarnation."</p>
<p>My Yogi-Friend B said, "Well, I do not and can not blame God for having such unfortunate disciples. Now each disciple of mine is a real headache, a serious problem and heavy burden. I thank God that this is absolutely my last incarnation. No more shall I make friends with Mother-Earth."</p>
<p>My Yogi-Friend C said, "Well, in no way can I blame my disciples. I have not been able to please them. How can I expect them to please me? I wish to come back into the world once again with more peace, more bliss, more light and more power so that I can please them, that is to say, illumine their stark bondage and abysmal ignorance. In this life I must say that I am a most deplorable failure."</p>
<p>Now my Yogi-Friends asked me what I thought of my own disciples.</p>
<p>I was more than eager to tell my friends what I felt about my disciples, but my Supreme in no time sealed my mouth.</p>
<p>Five minutes later on my behalf He said, "He does not have a single disciple. They are all My disciples. Since they are all My disciples, he has nothing to say about My disciples. Let Me tell you about My disciples.</p>
<p>In the morning they cry for their realisation.</p>
<p>In the afternoon they cry for humanity's liberation.</p>
<p>In the evening they cry for My full Manifestation on earth."</p>
<p>"My Lord, may I have the honour of telling You something on behalf of Your disciples?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you may. But do not to contradict Me, do not embarrass Me, My Son."</p>
<p>"On behalf of Your disciples, to You, My Lord, I offer gratitude, constant gratitude and eternal gratitude."</p>  </div>
