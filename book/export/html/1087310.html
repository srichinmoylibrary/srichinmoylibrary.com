<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly! God wants people to be patriotic because God has sent each soul to a particular country with a special mission. If the soul does not care for the country it has accepted and adopted to fulfil God's vision, then God-manifestation does not take place. Here, patriotism means love of one's own country. If I love the members of my own family, then I will love my own country, and if I love my country I will love all countries, because the root is God. If I love the branches and the leaves of a tree, how can I not also love the root? Whatever is created by the Creator, we have to love. We love the Creator because He has created this particular country which we belong to and love.</p>  </div>
