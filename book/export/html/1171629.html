<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because human beings are not doing the right thing. The right thing is to love God. If you love God and pray to God every day, then you will not do anything wrong. So first things first. Pray to God. If you do not pray to God, then you cannot do the right thing. Every day, in the morning, you have to pray to God for a few minutes, you have to meditate on God for a few minutes. That is the right thing. Once you start doing the right thing, then everything goes right.</p>  </div>
