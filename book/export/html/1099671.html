<p>India, my India, will always remain immortal, either positively or negatively. This was my very first experience on Indian soil this time. I landed at Calcutta Airport, and there were many coolies who were welcoming the passengers and helping with the luggage. When I went outside the airport building, I looked for a taxi to take me to a particular place called College Street or Bankim Chatterjee Street. It is better known as College Street, which is its old name. There you can get thousands and thousands of old second-hand books. It is my most favourite place in Calcutta.</p>
<p>I had thought of going to Belur Math, the Ramakrishna Mission, and I was even planning to go to Mother Teresaâ€™s place. It falls practically on the way to College Street. But something within me was more interested in buying old books, Bengali books. College Street gives me immense joy.</p>  </div>
