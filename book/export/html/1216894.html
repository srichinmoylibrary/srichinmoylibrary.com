<p>Today Kailash and I went to East Berlin. At the place where you cross over, every 10 metres they ask to see your passport. Within 50 metres, at four different places you have to show your passport! Can you imagine!</p>
<p>I have to change Kailash's name to patience. He was so patient with those people. If I had known German, I would not have waited there. After being stopped the second time, I would have just gone back.</p>
<p>In some cases they opened the car trunks and lifted up the seats to see if you had brought something illegal. They are very, very strict.</p>
<p>Germans have to enter through one place and Swiss through another place. Indians go the same way as the Swiss, so Kailash and I went together.</p>
