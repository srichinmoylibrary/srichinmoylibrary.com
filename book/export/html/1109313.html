<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I ask you to draw a straight line, but you draw a circle instead, then that is not perfection. If you are supposed to draw a triangle, but you draw a square instead, then where is the perfection there?</p>
<p>Again, perfection is in love. The mother loves her youngest child, and to her he is always perfect even though he is at the age where he constantly breaks things, makes noise and causes all kinds of problems. Since my spiritual children love me, to them I am all perfection. When you come to me full of love and devotion, at that time I am all perfection, but when you are angry or displeased with me, at that time you feel that I am all imperfection, totally undivine.</p>  </div>
