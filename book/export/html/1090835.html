<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Before you start your meditation I wish you to repeat the name of God, "Supreme", about twenty times as fast as possible. First purify your breath by repeating "Supreme." The breath has to be purified; unless and until the breath is purified, the mind will wander and cannot remain one-pointed. If the breath is purified, then the mind will not act like a restless monkey.</p>
<p>Then I wish you to concentrate on your inner divinity. Always try to feel that you are safe when you are with God, with divinity. Let God and the divine qualities within you act against your human, undivine qualities. When you use the word "God," please try to feel your real love for God. When you are concentrating, feel that you are really growing into God, into the very breath of God. Then your concentration is bound to do something for you.</p>
<p>Next I would like you to focus your attention on a picture. You can look at my picture or you can look at yourself in the mirror. If you concentrate on your own reflection, try to enter into the image that you are seeing. You have to feel that you are totally one with the physical being that you see. From there you should try to grow. How will you grow? You will grow with one thought: God wants you and you need God. Repeat: "God wants me, I need God. God wants me, I need God." Please try to do this. Then you will see that slowly, steadily and gradually God the divine thought is entering into you and permeating your inner and outer existence, giving you purity in your mind, in your vital and in your body.</p>  </div>
