<p>One day the great seeker Ramdas met the God-realised soul Tulsidas and prayed to him, "O great soul, do help me realise God. I have been praying and meditating for years and years, but still God-realisation is a far cry. Do help me realise God."</p>
<p>Tulsidas said, "I shall not only help you to realise God, but I shall make you see God tomorrow."</p>
<p>Ramdas said, "Tomorrow? O great soul, perhaps you are cutting jokes with me. Am I fit for God-realisation?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you are more than fit," answered Tulsidas. "Tomorrow, God will come to you. Keep your house clean, prepare nice, delicious food for God and pray and meditate the whole day most soulfully. God will definitely come to you."</p>
<p>The next day Ramdas brought many beautiful flowers to decorate his room and made a delicious meal for God. He remained soulful the whole day and prayed and meditated.</p>
<p>But O God, the whole day passed, and there was no sign of God. Ramdas was lamenting like anything. "Why has God not come? How could such a great soul like Tulsidas deceive me? But there is no sign of God."</p>
<p>All of a sudden Ramdas saw a buffalo standing near his door. He was so mad. "How could that buffalo come here? Where did it come from?" he said.</p>
<p>The buffalo entered into his house and began eating the food and destroying the flowers. The animal ate many of the fruits which Ramdas had kept so devotedly for God. Ramdas was so furious that he took a stick and started beating the buffalo. But the buffalo just kept eating to its heart's content and then ran away.</p>
<p>"Is this my fate?" cried Ramdas. "I wanted God and instead a buffalo has to come and ruin everything. O Tulsidas, is this your God? Tomorrow when I see you, I will give you a piece of my mind!"</p>
<p>The next day he went to Tulsidas, but the God-realised soul was in a very high mood. For some time Ramdas did not dare to speak. Then Tulsidas said, "So, God came to you?"</p>
<p>Ramdas said, "God came? A buffalo came!"</p>
<p>"A buffalo?" asked Tulsidas.</p>
<p>"Yes," answered Ramdas. "It came and ruined everything."</p>
<p>"You fool!" Tulsidas said. "It was not a buffalo. It was God in the form of a buffalo. He wanted to examine you to see if you had established your oneness with his entire creation. If you had been in a very high consciousness, you would have seen and felt that it was not a buffalo but God Himself. God took the form of a buffalo and examined you. You have mistreated God so mercilessly that now it will take a very long time for you to realise God. So you may as well forget about God-realisation."</p>
<p>Ramdas cried and cried before Tulsidas, "How could I have known God would take the form of a buffalo and thus play a trick on me?"</p>
<p>Tulsidas said, "Pray more soulfully, more devotedly, more unconditionally and more unreservedly. Then you will know everything: where God is and who God truly is."</p>
<p>Ramdas said, "From now on, I shall try to be worthy of one day receiving God in God's own Way."</p>
