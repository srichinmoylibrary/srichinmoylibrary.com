<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day, every hour, every minute, every second the seeker must know how to open the heart-door of the Supreme. He needs the key, and the name of this key is joy. When the seeker is happy, he not only has the key, but he is the key. The happier the seeker is, the easier it is for him to open up the heart-door of the Supreme. The key is most perfect when the seeker is the happiest of human beings.</p>  </div>
