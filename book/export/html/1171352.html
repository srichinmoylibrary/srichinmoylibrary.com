<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fairies exist more in the vital world. Angels exist in the psychic world. Angels will appear at the time of our death or when something very significant is happening in our life. When I am dying, do I want to see a fairy? No, I will pray for the Supreme to come. If the Supreme does not come, at least He can send some cosmic gods and goddesses. If that also He does not do, He will then send some angels.</p>  </div>
