<p>Shivaram's younger brother used to work with me at the Indian Consulate in New York. With Shivaram I was always serious; we talked all about spirituality. But with his brother there was no spirituality — only jokes and mundane things. We were two jokers.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe he was the same person when I saw him yesterday at the Los Angeles airport. How much respect he showed me! He prostrated himself right at my feet.</p>
<p>All credit goes to Shivaram. He has changed his brother's attitude completely.</p>
