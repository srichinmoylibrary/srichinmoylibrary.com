<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You should use an alarm. Otherwise, you have to become a Yogi to get the special Grace to wake you up. But please, when you meditate, do not keep a watch in front of you at every second. Some students may have this tendency, because they know they have to get ready to go to school. But if you really want to meditate soulfully, just dive deep within. True, you are not entering into Nirvana, but when you meditate, you are pleasing the Supreme. He will make you conscious of the fact that it is time to go to school. If you are really meditating, He will do this. But if you are in the fairyland, dreaming, wasting your precious time, it will not be His responsibility.</p>  </div>
