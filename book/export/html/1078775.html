<p>Intuition, you are great. You run faster than the fastest. You have the lightning speed. You have free access to the past realities and to the present realities. You are great because you have lightning speed. Your lightning speed frightens the weak, encourages the strong, confuses the foolish and pleases the wise.</p>
<p>O intuition, you are really great. You have the capacity to know the world, inner and outer. But alas, you do not have the capacity to change the world. If you want to change the world, then you will have to go to realisation. It will not only fulfil your desire, but will also grant you another boon: satisfaction in God-realisation, satisfaction in God-revelation, satisfaction in God-manifestation.</p>
