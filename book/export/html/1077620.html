<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The realised soul remains with the body. If the soul remains in the body when a person is realised, then he can consciously work for the divinity in humanity. He will feel at that time that he is a conscious instrument of God, that God is the Doer and God is the Action and that God is utilising him. When the veil of ignorance is removed, the soul gets the greatest opportunity to fulfil Godâ€™s Mission on earth. At that time there is no death, no destruction, no ignorance around the soul.</p>  </div>
