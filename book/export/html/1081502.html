<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The real inner light and the Master's light are the same. Where did you as a seeker steal the light? From your Master. The problem is that sometimes you are not able to utilise your inner light. You have it locked within, but you have misplaced the key. The Master secretly searches and helps you find the key, but he does not tell you that he did this. The Master, by serving you, is pleasing the Supreme. What you should ask is whether what you feel is the inner light is real inner light, and how you should use it.</p>  </div>
