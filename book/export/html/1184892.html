<p>He loves his death.<br /> He feels that death<br /> Will give him some rest.<br /> He feels that death<br /> Will care more for him than life.<br /> He feels that the other shore is greener.<br /> He feels that a new experience<br /> Will gladden him and fulfil him;<br /> Therefore<br /> His love for death<br /> He treasures,<br /> Expands,<br /> Distributes.</p>
