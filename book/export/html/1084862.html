<p>Lord, I would have championed Your cause:<br />              Love-Manifestation,<br /> If I had had the time, the necessary time.</p>
<p>"Son, I would have championed your cause:<br />              Ignorance-feast,<br /> If I had found that you really needed it,<br /> Or that it would do you any good."</p>
