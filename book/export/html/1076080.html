<p><em>(The home of Ratan and Rohini. The Master has come to visit them and is playing with their daughter, Rula.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Rula, Rula, today you look so pretty. I see a necklace of pearls around your neck. You look so beautiful, so beautiful.</p>
<p>RATAN: Oh Master, it is all due to your grace. We had little money, little material prosperity before you came into our lives. Our wealth is all due to your grace.</p>
<p>ROHINI: We depend entirely on you, Master. It is your grace that has made us rich. It is your grace that has made us happy. It is your grace that will help us accomplish everything we wish to accomplish here on earth. We are so grateful to you. We shall do everything, everything, everything for you, Master.</p>
<p><em>(Master blesses the couple.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: I am indeed proud of both of you. <em>(To Rohini.)</em> Please make me a most delicious meal today. I have not had the pleasure of eating one of your meals for a long time. You feel that I am a great Master, but I feel that I am a great eater.</p>
<p>ROHINI: Master, you eat our food, which takes an hour or two to prepare; but the food that you give us would have taken us centuries to get without your help. There is no comparison between your food and ours. When we eat your food, our life becomes constant gratitude to you. Where else can we get Peace, Light and Bliss if not from you?</p>
<p>MASTER: That is true, but we need each other. The disciple needs the Master, and the Master needs the disciple. <em>(To Ratan.)</em> I shall go out for a walk with Rula. We will be back in half an hour. In the meantime, please help Rohini prepare the meal.</p>
<p>ROHINI: Master, I shall do my best to make a most delicious meal for you. If you like my food, what more do I need on earth? For my Master to say that he likes my food means that I possess Heaven right here on earth.</p>
<p><em>(Master smiles. Ratan and Rohini bow to him with folded hands.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Exeunt Master and Rula)</em></p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Scene II</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(Master and Rula are walking in the street. Master is showing much affection to Rula and she is very happy.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER <em>(suddenly)</em>: Rula, please give me your necklace. It is so beautiful. I wish to have it. I shall give you something more beautiful than this one, much more beautiful, in return.</p>
<p>RULA: No, I want to keep this one. <em>(Pauses.)</em> Let me see the one you have that is better than this.</p>
<p>MASTER: Today you give me this one and tomorrow I shall bring you the new one.</p>
<p>RULA: No, I won’t give it to you. Give me the better one first and then I shall give you this one.</p>
<p>MASTER: If you don’t give it to me I shall take it away and leave you here, and you will have to go home all alone.</p>
<p><em>(Rula starts to cry.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Stop crying!</p>
<p><em>(Rula cries louder.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER <em>(aside)</em>: I need money badly. I could sell this necklace for thousands of rupees, but how can I get it away from this stubborn child? She is making so much noise that I shall be caught. I'll have to kill her. Then I can take the necklace and leave the city.</p>
<p><em>(As the Master grabs Rule, she starts to scream. He strangles her. When she loses consciousness, he snatches the necklace and runs away, leaving the child lying senseless on the ground. Enter two neighbours who catch the Master as he is leaving the scene.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST NEIGHBOUR: What’s going on here? What’s all the noise about?</p>
<p><em>(They notice the child lying on the ground and discover the necklace which the Master is trying to hide. Putting two and two together, they begin to curse the Master and strike him.)</em></p>
<p>SECOND NEIGHBOUR: Now tell us! Whose daughter is she?</p>
<p>MASTER: She is the child of Ratan and Rohini.</p>
<p>NEIGHBOURS: Take us there.</p>
<p><em>(One neighbour lifts Rula in his arms; the other holds the Master securely.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Exeunt omnes)</em></p>  </div>
<div id="node-1076086" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Scene III</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(In front of Ratan’s house. Enter neighbours with Rula and Master. Ratan rushes onstage.)</em></p>
<p>RATAN: What are you doing? This is my Guru! And why are you carrying my daughter?</p>
<p>FIRST NEIGHBOUR: This is your Guru? This rogue? This criminal? Look what he has done! He has killed your daughter to steal her necklace.</p>
<p>RATAN <em>(momentarily shocked, but quickly recovering)</em>: Don’t worry. I know that my Guru has the power to revive her. See, I am touching his feet and praying to him. <em>(Touches Master’s feet.)</em> Oh Guru, save my child. I am sure she is not yet dead; she is just unconscious. You have the power to revive her. Please use your power, dearest Master. Just look at her once and my Rula will be all right.</p>
<p><em>(Master looks at Rula, placing his hands on her. She revives and starts striking him.)</em></p>
<p>RULA: I hate you! You tried to steal my necklace! You hurt me!</p>
<p>RATAN: No, no, Rula. He was just playing a game with you. See, you are not hurt. Look at our Master’s power. He has just shown you a trick.</p>
<p><em>(Exeunt Master, Ratan and Rula)</em></p>
<p><em>(Neighbours shrug as they watch them go off together.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST NEIGHBOUR: These Masters are such rogues! Had it been my daughter, I would have killed the man immediately.</p>
<p>SECOND NEIGHBOUR: I would have called the police and had him arrested! But this stupid Ratan has such faith in his Master, even though he’s obviously the world’s worst rogue. Someday something really serious will happen, and then he will learn.</p>
<p><em>(Exeunt omnes)</em></p>  </div>
<div id="node-1076087" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Scene IV</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(The home of Kadu, another disciple. Enter Master.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: I have come to visit you, Kadu, and I am in a mood to show some of my occult power. You can invite all your friends, relatives and spiritual brothers and sisters. Today I shall perform a miracle. I have never performed any miracles in public, but today I am going to do it since most of you people have no faith in me at all.</p>
<p>KADU: Master, I do have faith in you, I do have faith in you. You don’t have to show me your occult power. But if you want to show it to others, then naturally I shall invite them. Everyone will be very happy and delighted to watch, I am sure.</p>
<p>MASTER: All right, invite them.</p>
<p><em>(Kadu calls his servant. Enter servant bowing.)</em></p>
<p>KADU: Go and invite all my friends and relatives and all my spiritual brothers and sisters. Today Master is going to perform some miracles for us. He is going to use his occult powers. Everyone is invited.</p>
<p><em>(Exit servant. Moments later, enter friends, relatives and other disciples.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER <em>(to Kadu)</em>: Where is your son, Kavir?</p>
<p>KADU: Oh, he is studying in his room, Master.</p>
<p>MASTER: Bring him here. I wish to see him.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Kadu. Re-enter Kadu, followed by Kavir with folded hands.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Now watch. Here is Kavir. Kavir, I am going to strike you once very hard. You will definitely be knocked unconscious by my blow.</p>
<p>KAVIR: Oh Master, I don’t want to. I don’t want that to happen.</p>
<p>MASTER: Is there anybody here among my disciples who wants to participate in this miracle? After I knock the person unconscious, I will touch his head and revive him.</p>
<p><em>(Several disciples step forward to volunteer.)</em></p>
<p>ONE DISCIPLE: Master, it is such an honour to be struck by you — such a joy, such a source of pride, such an honour!</p>
<p>OTHER DISCIPLES: Please choose me!</p>
<p>KAVIR: No! Master chose me first. I want to be struck by Master. I want to do it.</p>
<p>MASTER: All right, Kavir. Come here.</p>
<p><em>(Master strikes him and Kavir falls down, unconscious. His mother begins to cry.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Now I shall perform the miracle. I am touching his head. <em>(Places his hands on Kavir.)</em> Kavir, arise!</p>
<p><em>(No response from Kavir’s inert body. Onlookers become alarmed.)</em></p>
<p>DISCIPLE: Somebody get a doctor!</p>
<p>MASTER: No, no! I can do it, I tell you, I can do it. Just the other day I performed this miracle at Ratan and Rohini’s house. Where is Ratan? Ask him to come here. <em>(Exit one of the onlookers to get Ratan.)</em> He will tell you that I did it. He said, “Master, use your power. You have the power.” And I did it. Today I have invited everybody here to watch me, but now this power is not working.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Ratan. The women are crying. The men are terribly angry with the Master.)</em></p>
<p>RATAN: Master, what is the matter? Why aren’t you using your occult power? Please, please do it. I know you have the capacity. You did it for my daughter; you can do it here also. Master, Master, why are you allowing yourself to be embarrassed when you have such tremendous spiritual and occult power? <em>(Ratan touches Master’s feet and pleads.)</em> Master, look at Kavir. Please touch his head. <em>(Master touches Kavir’s head. Kavir immediately gets up and looks around.)</em></p>
<p>KAVIR: Oh Father, where was I? I seemed to be in another world. I saw my mother crying for me. I don’t know where I was, but my mother and father couldn’t see me. Master, I don’t want to play your game anymore.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1076088" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Scene V</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(Master and Ratan are at the home of the Master’s richest disciples.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER <em>(to husband)</em>: You are my richest disciple.</p>
<p>HUSBAND: Oh Master, I may be rich on the physical plane, but you are the one who is rich on the spiritual plane.</p>
<p>MASTER: Well, I have come to the richest person on this physical plane. It is my wish to cook for you here today. Your wife has cooked for me many times and her food is always delicious. Now I wish to cook for the two of you. And when your son comes home from school, he can join you.</p>
<p><em>(Husband and wife are overjoyed and full of gratitude. Exit Master to cook. Husband and wife set a table. After a while, enter Master.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Good. I am finished. Now you are the guests, so begin eating. Ratan will help me serve.</p>
<p>WIFE: No, no, Master. How can we allow you to serve us while we eat? Let us wait for you, and we shall all eat together.</p>
<p>MASTER: No, no, no. Obedience comes first in the spiritual life. Since you are my disciples, you have to obey me. We will join you later. Now you start eating.</p>
<p><em>(Master and Ratan begin serving the two disciples. After eating a few morsels of food, both husband and wife collapse onto the floor.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Ratan, I have put poison into their food. <em>(Ratan is shocked and dismayed.)</em> Now we can go upstairs and look for their money. I am sure that they have thousands of rupees hidden away. Let us get the money; then I shall heal them as I have healed others in the past with the help of your prayer. I know that I don’t have any occult power at all. The first time, when I cured Rula, I thought it was my own power that did it. But after trying since then, I came to realise that it is only when you are there to touch my feet that I can do anything at all. It is your faith in me that cures everybody. It is from your faith that I get the capacity to perform miracles. Otherwise, I have no power at all. Now, let us go upstairs and take the money. Then you will pray to me and I shall cure them. You have helped me to do it before. I am sure we will be able to do it this time too.</p>
<p><em>(Exeunt omnes)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter Dayal. Seeing his parents on the floor, he immediately runs to the door and shouts for the police. Enter two policemen who examine the bodies, look around, then go upstairs. Dayal sits down and buries his face in his hands. Re-enter policemen with Master and Ratan.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST POLICEMAN: You are both under arrest. Let’s go.</p>
<p><em>(Exeunt policemen, Master and Ratan.)</em></p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Scene VI</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(Ratan’s house. Dayal is staying with Rohini and Rula while Ratan is in prison.)</em></p>
<p>ROHINI: Dayal, you know that my husband is completely innocent. He did not wish to kill your parents. They were always so kind to us. We were very good friends.</p>
<p>DAYAL: I know it. I know it, Mother Rohini. Uncle Ratan was always extremely good to me. It was because of the Guru that he did it. I do not blame you or my uncle at all. I blame the Master, that rascal! It is because of him that I have lost my parents!</p>
<p>ROHINI: Do not call him a rascal, my child. He is our Master. He knows the kind of experiences we need for our spiritual growth. You have lost your parents, and I have lost my two friends and my husband. I know that your loss is infinitely worse than mine. How can I console you, sweetest Dayal? Only God can comfort you, and I am sure He will. The ever-compassionate Father will certainly console you.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(A few weeks later. The Master and Ratan are in the prison yard doing hard labour. The sergeant of the work gang is standing guard.)</em></p>
<p>RATAN <em>(to sergeant)</em>: Please, please allow me to do two men’s jobs. I don’t want my Master to have to do this kind of work. I would be so grateful if you allowed me to do his work.</p>
<p>SERGEANT: You fool! Just because of him you are now here. You are an innocent fellow. He has exploited you, you fool! He is a rogue, a real criminal! You will be freed one day, but not that shameless creature! Never!</p>
<p>RATAN: Call me a fool, say anything you want against me, but please don’t criticise my Master. He is everything to me. My heart breaks to see him here in prison, but it pains me even more to see him working like a labourer. He is not in the habit of doing this kind of work.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1076091" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Scene VIII</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(Rohini, Rula and Dayal come to visit the Master and Ratan in prison. Rula runs toward her father, stretching out her little arms to him.)</em></p>
<p>RULA: Father, Father, when will you come back home? Everybody says that you are innocent. Everybody says it is Master who has done wrong and gotten you in trouble.</p>
<p>RATAN: Hold your tongue, Rula. He is my Master: he is my all. One more word against him and I shall thrash you. I am sure your mother has told you all this nonsense.</p>
<p>ROHINI <em>(bursting into tears)</em>: No, no, my Lord, I have not. I told her nothing. She has been hearing about our Master from our neighbours and friends. <em>(Bows to the Master with folded hands and addresses him.)</em> Master, I do not know anything. I am an insignificant human being. I do not know what is best for us. We gave you our total surrender, and this is the result. My husband is here in jail suffering with you, and we are outside suffering for you. But I wish to keep my surrender unwavering. I am sure that what you have done is best for us. If this had not happened, perhaps something else infinitely worse would have happened. So I am grateful to you that only this has happened. But I do not know how to console Dayal, poor boy. He has lost both his parents. His loss is really severe.</p>
<p>DAYAL: No, no, Mother Rohini. Master, last night I had a dream. My parents came to me and told me that you had done the right thing in poisoning them. They said that they were already dead, that their inner beings had already been poisoned by their money. They had thousands of rupees but did not give you anything. Their minds were corrupted; their hearts were corrupted. They loved their money more than they loved you. So, Master, they feel that you saved them from wasting many years in ignorance and bondage. In their next incarnation, they feel that you will give them more spiritual wealth and less physical wealth so that they will be able to dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to the service of God. Master, they feel that you have done the right thing, and for that they are most grateful to you. And I, too, am grateful. My parents say that they are very happy in the other world, and that makes me happy, even though I still miss them. I know that they will come to me from time to time and bless me inwardly. That will be enough. Meanwhile, my aunt Rohini will be my mother now. She is all kindness, all affection, all love. I get everything I need from her. And when my uncle comes back, he will be my father. So I shall still have a father and a mother who are your disciples.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Scene IX</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(Ratan and Master are asleep in their prison cell. An angel appears to Ratan, who wakes up and rises to his feet.)</em></p>
<p>ANGEL: Ratan, the authorities have learned of your innocence, and they will set you free tomorrow.</p>
<p>RATAN: I don’t want to be freed without my Master. He is everything to me. If he is not freed, I am not going to leave this prison. I will stay with him and serve him here. I won’t go without him.</p>
<p>ANGEL: Your Master has ruined your life. He has ruined the lives of many innocent people and caused them terrible suffering. Many people had great faith in him, and now see what he has done to them. His spiritual children dare not show their faces, for his crime has been like a slur on their lives, and they are now ridiculed and mocked. Can’t you recognise your stupidity?</p>
<p>RATAN: You call it stupidity, but I call it my oneness with my Master. This life of mine will last only for a short while. I have given it to my Master unconditionally, and I won’t take it back now. I have surrendered everything to my Master. My body, vital, mind, heart and soul are all for his use only, until I die. I never want to be separated from my Master. If he is in hell, that will be my Heaven. I shall stay with him. And if he goes to Heaven, there I too shall go. I don’t need earthly freedom, I don’t need anybody on earth except him.</p>
<p><em>(Ratan sings.)</em></p>

<p>Guruh Brahma Guruh Vishnu<br /> Guruh devo maheshwarah<br /> Gurureva param Brahma<br /> Tasmai shri gurabe namah<br /> Guru is Brahma, Guru is Vishnu,<br /> Guru is the great God Shiva.<br /> Indeed, Guru is the Brahman.<br /> To that Divine Master I offer my obeisance.</p>

<p>ANGEL: Suppose I were to give you illumination this very moment. Would you not leave your Master then, seeing that he is far inferior to you?</p>
<p>RATAN: No, even if you were to give me illumination I would not leave my Master. He taught me about God, he gave me the message of God, he inspired my love for God. If you gave me illumination, I would give it to my Master.</p>
<p>ANGEL: So you admit that your Master does not have illumination?</p>
<p>RATAN: I do not know whether my Master has it or not. But I feel that he has.</p>
<p>ANGEL: If he had illumination, how could he do such inhuman, absurd, unthinkable things? Would an illumined soul poison his own disciples in order to get their money? Those two disciples whom he poisoned have such nobility that they came to their son and told him lies in order to protect their Master’s reputation and to prevent their son from losing all faith in the spiritual life. I tell you, you yourself are far superior to your Master in spirituality. Your Master is a real fake. You are deceiving yourself and placing your faith in a fraud.</p>
<p>RATAN: I cannot judge my Master. He knows what is best for me and for all his disciples. I am sure that whatever he has done has been for the best.</p>
<p>ANGEL: I shall give you some sound advice. One who has a truly illumined Master will realise God infinitely sooner than one with a false Master. Therefore, one should use discrimination and look for a genuine Master. But because of your tremendous sincerity and devotion, I am going to give you illumination anyway.</p>
<p>RATAN: I shall look upon the illumination you give me as a fruit. If you give me a fruit, I shall share it with my Master. If you free me, I shall take my Master with me, and if he is not allowed to leave, then I also shall stay. So whatever you give to me, you are giving equally to him.</p>
<p>ANGEL: The moment I touch your head, you will be illumined. Then wake your Master if you wish and touch him. You will give him illumination.</p>
<p><em>(Angel places his hands on Ratan’s head. Master wakes up and watches his disciple receiving illumination. When the angel removes his hands from Ratan’s head, Ratan immediately prostrates himself and touches his Master’s feet. Master is illumined. Master and Ratan embrace each other, and the gate of the prison cell disappears.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Yagnyavalkya and Katyayani.)</em></p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Katyayani, I am now an old man.</p>
<p>KATYAYANI: My Lord, there comes a time when every human being becomes old. You are no exception.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Yes, you are right, Katyayani. Katyayani, I wish to make a simple suggestion to you. May I?</p>
<p>KATYAYANI: Certainly, by all means.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: As you know, I have now reached a ripe old age. According to tradition, at this stage of life one must enter into the forest and offer one’s life to God in prayer and meditation. It is high time for me to do that.</p>
<p>KATYAYANI: Who stands in your way, my Lord? Certainly I am not the one who will ever prevent you from doing the right thing.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA Thank you, thank you, my dear Katyayani. Now here is the problem.</p>
<p>KATYAYANI: What is it? Tell me, my Lord.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Before I leave, I wish to offer you half my wealth, property and possessions, and the other half I wish to give to my other wife, Maitreyi.</p>
<p>KATYAYANI: That is fine with me, although it is I who take care of you most of the time. Maitreyi only wastes her time in fruitless meditation.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Katyayani, my dear, Maitreyi’s meditation is not fruitless. Nor does she waste time when she meditates.</p>
<p>KATYAYANI: It is simply useless to tell you anything about Maitreyi. What I have said is not at all against her. I have just brought to your attention a mere fact, an undeniable fact. Anyway, since she too can claim you as her own, you may as well divide all your possessions between your darling Maitreyi and your maidservant Katyayani. I hate Maitreyi, I literally hate her! I do everything for you, and she takes all the credit. I have never seen such an irresponsible, careless and callous woman. Yet you love her dearly, more dearly than your very life. I tell you once and for all that I hate Maitreyi with all the hatred of the world at my command!</p>
<p><em>(Enter Maitreyi)</em></p>
<p>KATYAYANI: Just think of the devil and the devil appears! Maitreyi, you have appeared unexpectedly, and I disappear deliberately!</p>
<p><em>(Exit Katyayani)</em></p>
<p>MAITREYI: My Lord, I wish to meditate for a few minutes. Will you kindly join me?</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Certainly I will.</p>
<p><em>(Yagnyavalkya and Maitreyi meditate together. Meditation over, Yagnyavalkya blesses Maitreyi.)</em></p>
<p>MAITREYI <em>(thrilled and overjoyed)</em>: My Lord, O matchless sage, I have seen, I have seen!</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: What have you seen, Maitreyi?</p>
<p>MAITREYI: I have seen your third eye wide open. Fathomless is its beauty. Measureless is its power.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: I am proud of you. I am proud of your aspiration. <em>(Pauses.)</em> Maitreyi, I have something quite important to discuss with you. Do you have the time?</p>
<p>MAITREYI: Of course, my Lord, for you I have always the time. I am always at your disposal. This life of mine is ever at your express command.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: I knew it. I knew it. Now Maitreyi, I have already discussed the matter with Katyayani. She has fully agreed.</p>
<p>MAITREYI: Please let me know what it is all about.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Ah, of course, forgive me. The time has at last come for me to enter into the forest and spend my remaining days meditating on the Absolute, offering my existence, inner and outer, to my inner Pilot.</p>
<p>MAITREYI: My Lord, indeed, that’s a splendid idea.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: But listen, my divine wife. I want you to have one full half of my wealth, property and possessions, and the other half, needless to say, goes to Katyayani.</p>
<p>MAITREYI: My Lord, do listen to me first, before I accept or reject your kind offer. You have always taught me that material wealth is of no avail. It is nothing in comparison to the inner wealth. Why, then, do you bind me with material wealth? Tell me one thing, my Lord: will this material wealth in any way add to my heart’s mounting cry?</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Unfortunately, no.</p>
<p>MAITREYI: Then why do you impose on me things that will take me away from the path of Truth, from the path of Divinity, from the path of Immortality? My Lord, my heart pines only for the immortal, transcendental Self. I want nothing but Immortality’s Life. <em>Yenaham namrta yam kim aham tena kuryam.</em> What shall I do with the things that cannot make me immortal? Let Katyayani have all your material wealth. Let her cherish your earthly possessions, and I shall treasure your heavenly possession — your loftiest realisation, your total oneness with the Absolute.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA <em>(while blessing Maitreyi)</em>: Maitreyi, you are my heart’s pride. You are my soul’s pride. You are the pride of the absolute Supreme. Your footprints on the sands of time are indelible. Maitreyi, here is my last request: please sing a few soul-stirring songs for me.</p>
<p><em>(Maitreyi sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Yenaham namrta syam</em><br /><em>Kim aham tena kuryam</em></p>
<p><em>[What shall I do with the things that cannot make me immortal?]</em></p>
<p><em>Hiranmayena patrena</em><br /><em>Satyasyapihitam mukham</em><br /><em>Tat tvam pusan apavrnu</em><br /><em>Satya-dharmaya drstaye</em></p>
<p>[The Face of Truth is covered<br /> with a brilliant golden orb.<br /> Remove it, O Sun, so that I who<br /> am devoted to the Truth<br /> may behold the Truth.]</p>
<p><em>Vedaham etam purusam mahantam</em><br /><em>Aditya-varnam tamasah parastat.</em></p>
<p>[I have known this Great Being,<br /> effulgent as the sun,<br /> beyond the boundaries of tenebrous gloom.]</p>
<p><em>Anandadd hy eva khalv imani bhutani jayante</em><br /><em>Anandena jatani jivanti</em><br /><em>Anandam prayantyabhisam visanti</em></p>
<p>[From Delight we came into existence.<br /> In Delight we grow.<br /> At the end of our journey’s close,<br /> into Delight we shall retire.]</p>

<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Maitreyi, dearer than my life, to you I offer my heart’s eternal gratitude. This heart of mine shall remain sempiternally with your supremely illumined heart in the direct Vision, pure Revelation and total Manifestation of the Absolute Supreme.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(King Ashwapati and his daughter Savitri.)</em></p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: My daughter, you are so beautiful.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Thank you, Father.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: My daughter, you are so spiritual.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Thank you, Father.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: Savitri, I love you more than I love my own life.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, I love you, too, more than I love my own life.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: Savitri, you are my All. In you is my realisation of the Truth. In you is the Perfection of my inner life. Do you know, my daughter, why I have named you Savitri?</p>
<p>SAVITRI: No, Father, I do not know.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: For many years your mother and I had no child. So I prayed and prayed to the goddess Savitri to grant us a divine child. After a long time the goddess was pleased with me, and gave me the gift I longed for. And that gift is your life, your dedicated life. So it is from the goddess Savitri, my Supreme Mother. that you get your name.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, I am so happy, so proud to hear that. From now on I shall try to identify myself with that Supreme Goddess Savitri. and I shall try to please you in every way.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: Savitri, all along you have been pleasing me. You already please me in every way. I am so proud of you. Savitri, now the time has come for you to have a partner. You need a divine consort. I have tried very hard to get a suitable husband for you, but I have not succeeded. It pains me severely, but I don’t see anybody on earth who is really worthy of you.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, forgive me, but you are mistaken.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: I will be happy if you can prove that I am mistaken. I really want to be proven wrong, for when I see that you have someone whom you love and who is really worthy of you, I will be the happiest person on earth. Please tell me, my daughter, what is the name of your future husband?</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, it is Satyavan.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: Who is he?</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, he is the son of King Dyumatsen. I am sure you have heard of Dyumatsen. He is the King of Shalva.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: Yes, my child, yes. Of course I know of Dyumatsen. But don’t you know that he has been driven out of his Kingdom by his enemies? He is now roaming in the forest like a beggar.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Yes, Father, I know, I know. It was in the forest that I met his son, Satyavan. He has conquered my heart, Father.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: My daughter, my Savitri, to please you is to fulfil my soul. But I know that on the physical plane you will suffer much if you marry the son of a beggar. You are embracing poverty, but I am ready to offer all my wealth to make you happy and to make Satyavan’s parents prosperous again. In your happiness is the fulfillment of my life and the manifestation of my soul.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, Father, Father, I am yours. My life is yours. My life-breath is a garland of gratitude which I place at your feet.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Narada.)</em></p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: O sage Narada, do you know anything about Satyavan, the son of King Dyumatsen, who is now dethroned and roaming in the forest?</p>
<p>NARADA: Yes, I know, I know. Dyumatsen has now become blind. And his son — I have seen him quite a few times. He is very intelligent, very beautiful, very spiritual and divine. In every way he is a great, most promising young man.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: I am so happy, so happy to hear you say this, because my daughter wants to marry him.</p>
<p>NARADA: Savitri? Savitri wishes to marry Satyavan?</p>
<p><em>(Savitri looks down, embarrassed.)</em></p>
<p>SAVITRI: O sage, please tell me, what is wrong with that? What is disturbing you?</p>
<p>NARADA: Nothing is wrong with me, but everything is wrong with you, O Savitri.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Please, please tell me what is wrong with me?</p>
<p>NARADA: Savitri, you have no vision of the future. But I do have that vision, and I tell you that Satyavan is going to die soon. Savitri, he will live on earth only for one fleeting year.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: Only one year, one year? And then I have to see my daughter a widow? Impossible, impossible!</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, just a few minutes ago you told me that to please me is to fulfil your soul. Now you are changing your mind. Father, real love does not care for earthly years. I love him, and that is all. I do not need anything more from my life. If my Satyavan is destined to live only for one year, I am fully prepared to accept him as my husband for that short time. If he dies, what can I do? To see him, to be with him for as long as I can, is the only thing I need in my life.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: My daughter, I am all for you. You want him; that is more than enough. I am going to speak to his father, Dyumatsen, and then we shall make arrangements for your wedding.</p>
<p>NARADA: Savitri, on the day you get married, start counting the days. When one year is completed, you will lose your husband. But my blessing will be with you, Savitri, because you are most devoted to him.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Bless me, O sage. Satyavan, Satyavan! He is my heart’s light; he is my soul’s sun.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Scene II</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(Dyumatsen, Satyavan and Savitri in the forest.)</em></p>
<p>DYUMATSEN: Savitri, my daughter, you have now been one of us for some time. My son is so fond of you, and I am so fond of you. We are all fond of one another. But my heart breaks when I see you working so hard, and when I see my son going every day to cut down trees for fuel. This life of hardship is unbearable. I was a King. I was thrown out by my enemies. Now I am in the forest, helpless. I have lost my sight, but you and my son, Satyavan — both of you are my inner eyes. My outer eyes God has taken away, but He has given me two inner eyes. One is my son; one is my Savitri. Through your eyes I see the world, and through your hearts I feel the world, O Savitri, O Satyavan.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, we shall make you happy. Satyavan and I will make your life happy. You may not get your Kingdom back, but you have us. We shall give you constant joy, constant satisfaction. We assure you, Father, at every moment we shall try to please you in your own way, according to our capacity.</p>
<p>DYUMATSEN: I know, I know. You and Satyavan will do everything for me. I live on earth only to feel happiness in your two dedicated lives. You are spiritual, my son is spiritual and I am spiritual. Our life of spirituality is our only consolation. Our life of spirituality is our only illumination. Our life of spirituality is God’s real Pride. <em>(Pauses.)</em> You know, Savitri, Satyavan, I am happy I am happy because my life I have dedicated to the Will of the Supreme, to the Will of God. I have no will of my own. He is now my All. He gives me inner joy, inner satisfaction. My Kingdom I have lost, but I have found God inside my heart. The kingdom of falsehood has deserted me, but the Kingdom of Truth has dawned in my devoted heart.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(Savitri is alone.)</em></p>
<p>SAVITRI <em>(thinking aloud)</em>: Today is the last day of my husband’s life. Throughout the year I have prayed to the god Surya to protect my Satyavan, but this is the fatal day. I have kept it a deep secret. Nobody knows, neither my husband nor my father-in-law.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Satyavan.)</em></p>
<p>SAVITRI <em>(to Satyavan)</em>: Lord, today I would like to come with you. I would like to follow you into the thick forest where you cut down trees for fuel.</p>
<p>SATYAVAN: Savitri, why do you want to go into the thick forest? Why? Why?</p>
<p>SAVITRI: My Lord, since our marriage I have never made a request to you for anything. This will be my first and last request. If you fulfil my request, I will be most grateful to you. I will never ask you for another boon as long as I am on earth.</p>
<p>SATYAVAN: Savitri, is there anything on earth that I would not do for you? My body, my vital, my mind, my heart, my soul are all for you, for you, my Savitri. Come with me.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1076103" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Scene IV</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(Savitri and Satyavan are in the thick of the forest. Satyavan has just plucked a few fruits, unripe, which they both are eating.)</em></p>
<p>SAVITRI: Do you come here every day? This place is not safe. I hear the sounds of ferocious animals. How do you come home safely?</p>
<p>SATYAVAN: Savitri, you have more faith in God than I have. It is God who protects me. It is God who has given me the strength to cut down the trees and make fuel. We are poor, Savitri, you know, but there was a time when we were rich and my father used to rule the Kingdom of Shalva. Now the days of outer prosperity are gone, but the days of inner prosperity have started. This last year, since you have come into my life, has been all Joy, all Love, all Delight, all Divinity. Savitri, you have transformed our inner kingdom. Before we met you, our inner kingdom was the kingdom of worries, but now it is the Kingdom of Light and Delight. Our outer kingdom was the kingdom of frustration; now it is the Kingdom of Joy and Fulfilment. <em>(Pauses.)</em> Savitri, I have finished eating. Now you observe, while I go and cut down trees.</p>
<p><em>(Savitri meditates with folded hands, silently looking at Surya, the sun god.)</em></p>
<p>SAVITRI <em>(in a low voice)</em>: O God, Lord Surya, O Sun, today is the last day of my husband’s life. Protect him, protect him. Narada told me that today would be my husband’s last day. I know the prophecy of the sage Narada can never prove false. But, O Lord Surya, you can save me, you can save my husband. I pray to you.</p>
<p><em>(She begins chanting Surya’s name.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Satyavan comes over to where she is sitting.)</em></p>
<p>SATYAVAN: Savitri, I feel extremely tired. I don’t know why, but I am unable to move. My hands have no strength at all. My feet have lost all strength; I can’t stand up.</p>
<p><em>(Satyavan falls to the ground. Savitri takes her husband’s head on her lap. Enter the King of Death, Yamaraj, tall and stout.)</em></p>
<p>SAVITRI: Who are you?</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: I am Yamaraj, the King of Death.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: What brings you here?</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Your husband’s life has ended.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: I was told that it is your messengers who come to take people away. How is it that you have come yourself, O King of Death?</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Your husband led a most devoted, spiritual and divine life. That is why I personally have come instead of sending my messengers. Savitri, now your husband is my possession. I am taking him with me.</p>
<p><em>(Satyavan rises and follows Yamaraj, like a sleepwalker. Savitri follows Yamaraj and Satyavan.)</em></p>
<p>YAMARAJ: What are you doing? Where are you going?</p>
<p>SAVITRI: I am Satyavan’s wife. Wherever my husband goes, I have to go.</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Go home. You will not be able to come with us. I will not take you: your time has not come. We will walk very fast. We will disappear.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: O King of Death, be compassionate. I have been all devotion to my husband. I want to be with him. Now, can you not take me also? To live without my husband is impossible for me. Take me with you, please. Do me this favour. I am at your feet.</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Savitri, don’t be so silly. I cannot do that. But if you go home, I will give Satyavan’s father back his eyesight. I will grant you that boon, if you will go home now.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Thank you. I am so grateful that you will give my father-in-law back his eyesight. But I cannot leave my husband. I want to go with him.</p>
<p><em>(Savitri has been following Yamaraj for a long time. She is becoming exhausted, but she will not stop.)</em></p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Savitri, I am ready to give you any boon you want, but I tell you, I can’t take you with me, nor can I give back your husband’s life.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: O Yamaraj, either take me with you wherever you carry my husband, or give his life back to me. I will not leave him.</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Savitri, your love for your husband is unique. I shall give you another boon. I shall bless you with one hundred sons. These sons will make you happy.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: O Yamaraj, what kind of boon are you offering me? How will I have one hundred sons without a husband? How is it possible? I have been all faithfulness, all devotion to my husband. You know, during this one year of our marriage, what kind of life I have led.</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Savitri, forgive me. Forgive me.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: O Yamaraj, I do not want to have one hundred sons. Even if you give my husband’s life back, I do not want a hundred sons. I want only my husband. My husband is all I need. Either give his life back to me so that we can go home where his old blind father is waiting for us, or allow me to go with you wherever you carry him. I shall follow your footsteps. I am tired, I am exhausted, but I am prepared to die while following my beloved husband.</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Savitri, your faithfulness, your devotion, your love have pleased me. Yours is the life of love, yours is the life of devotion. Your life has taught humanity what love is, inseparable love, divine love. Your life has taught and will teach humanity what devoted oneness is. Savitri, I give you your husband.</p>
<p><em>(Yamaraj touches the forehead of Satyavan and disappears.)</em></p>
<p>SATYAVAN: Where am I, Savitri? I don’t recognise this place. Where have you brought me? Where am I?</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Is this place new to you?</p>
<p>SATYAVAN: Totally new. I have never seen this place. How did you bring me here?</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Well, I shall tell you tomorrow how I brought you here.</p>
<p>SATYAVAN: I was fast asleep, Savitri. Why didn’t you wake me up? True, I was exhausted, but I would have gotten up. I would not have been offended. Now what will Father think of us? He will think that both of us today have been very immature. Poor Father, I am sure he is thinking of us, he is missing us. Every day in the evening I come back home. Now it is already night. Father will think that, just because today we have been together in the forest, we have forgotten all about him.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: I shall speak to your father. I shall ask him for his forgiveness and he will surely grant it.</p>
<p>SATYAVAN: But tell me, tell me, how have I come here? How is it that we are here? This place is so unfamiliar.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: I will tell you all about it, O Satyavan, O Lord of my life. Let us go home, let us go home. I have a sweet story to tell you. This story will give you immense joy. Let us go home. Father is waiting. He needs us desperately. Let us go home.</p>  </div>

<p>WIFE: Kali, Kali, all the time Kali! What has Kali ever done for us? She has only created untold problems.</p>
<p>HUSBAND: Krishna, Krishna, all the time, all the time! What has Krishna done for us? He has only deceived the world, and he is deceiving you.</p>
<p>WIFE: Krishna has deceived the world? My Krishna has deceived the world? My Krishna is all love, all love for mankind. Your Kali is ruthless. She kills people, she destroys people. She is called destruction. I have lost my only daughter because of her. When she was seriously ill you prayed to Kali. You assured me that Kali would cure our daughter. Now we have lost our only daughter. <em>(Cries.)</em></p>
<p>HUSBAND: Why didn’t you pray to your Krishna? If he is so kind, so generous, so compassionate, why didn’t you call on him? Why didn’t you pray to him to cure our daughter?</p>
<p>WIFE: I didn’t invoke Krishna because I did not want to conflict with your prayer. I thought that since you were praying most ardently to your Kali, your Kali would cure our dearest, sweetest daughter. We have lost our daughter because of Kali. Now if our son gets even a headache I will not allow you to pray to Kali. I will pray to Krishna, my Krishna. He will cure our son. There is no danger on earth which I cannot conquer with my prayers to Krishna. Our son will remain on earth, happy and prosperous, all by Krishna’s Grace. Our son will become great, very great. And I know it is Krishna’s Grace that will make him great.</p>
<p>HUSBAND: I also want our son to be happy and great. If you feel that your Lord Krishna will make our son happy and great, then you pray to Krishna and I shall remain silent. I shall silently pray to my Kali to give me joy, to give me peace of mind, so that I can bear your constant scoldings and insults.</p>
<p>WIFE: If I scold you, then you have to know that you deserve it. You are callous, useless, hopeless in every way.</p>
<p>HUSBAND: Let us not quarrel. Let us not fight in front of our son. I wish you to be happy; I wish my son to be happy; I wish my Kali to make me happy.</p>
<p>SON: How I wish I could do something so that all our problems would be solved! Father is fond of Kali; Mother is fond of Krishna. I do not know of whom I am fond. No, I <em>do</em> know of whom I am fond. But if I say I am fond of Krishna, Father will be displeased; and if I say I am fond of Kali, Mother will be displeased. So I won’t say.</p>
<p>WIFE: All right, keep it secret.</p>
<p>HUSBAND: Even if you say you are fond of Krishna, I will not be displeased. You are free to choose.</p>
<p>WIFE: I also want to tell you, my son, that if you are fond of Kali, you must not think I will be displeased with you. You have a free choice. But it is better for you to be fond of one particular deity, to have total faith in him and love and adoration for him, You should worship only one deity, and that deity will make you really happy, great and prosperous.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(Night. The son is sleeping. He suddenly awakens.)</em></p>
<p>SON: What a strange dream I had! I dreamt that I struck the statue of Kali which is in my father’s room and broke it to pieces. I was so happy to inform my mother that now there is only one statue in the house. All along I have been inwardly, secretly praying to Krishna. I am fond of Krishna and not of Kali. Let me go and see if the statue is broken or not. <em>(Opens the door to his father’s room and sees a statue of Krishna, not of Kali. He is wonder-struck.)</em> How can it be? How can it be? <em>(Goes to his mother’s room and looks in. Her own statue of Krishna is still there.)</em> Now we have two statues of Krishna! But perhaps I was mistaken. Let me go again to Father’s room and see. Maybe Father has replaced Kali’s statue. Perhaps he has given away Kali’s statue and bought a statue of Krishna so that Mother will be happy. Perhaps he does not want to quarrel with Mother anymore. <em>(He goes to his Father’s room and sees that the statue of Krishna is still there. He wakes his father.)</em></p>
<p>FATHER: What are you doing here at this hour?</p>
<p>SON: Why have you replaced Kali? Why do I see Krishna’s statue?</p>
<p>FATHER: Krishna? Krishna? How did Krishna get here? Has your mother brought her statue here and put it in my room?</p>
<p>SON: No, the same Krishna statue is in her room. I was just there.</p>
<p>FATHER: Let me go into your mother’s room and see.</p>
<p><em>(Father and son go into the mother’s room and see the same statue of Krishna there.)</em></p>
<p>MOTHER: What is the matter? What are you doing here at this hour? What are you doing in my room?</p>
<p>SON: Mother, Mother, now there is only Krishna in our family! In your room is Krishna and in Father’s room is Krishna.</p>
<p>MOTHER: What? Is it true? I can’t believe my ears! That means your father has now become Krishna’s devotee. I am so glad. I am so glad that at last you have replaced Kali with Krishna.</p>
<p>FATHER: I have not done it. I don’t know how Krishna’s statue got into my room.</p>
<p>MOTHER: Then how could this happen?</p>
<p>SON: Father, this must be a miracle. Since it is a divine miracle, let us meditate together. Let the three of us meditate together and see what we can learn from within.</p>
<p><em>(They sit down to meditate. An angel appears.)</em></p>
<p>ANGEL: It was your son’s prayer that we heard. Your son has always been suffering from your quarrels. One of you cries for Krishna, the other is all for Kali. Although he was fond of Krishna, your son felt miserable because each of you was always fighting for his own chosen deity. In order to prove to you that Kali and Krishna are one, Kali has taken the form of Krishna. From now on there will be no quarrel between you, no dispute between husband and wife, for you know that Kali and Krishna are one. Now Krishna is in both rooms because both wife and son like Krishna. Let there be no more disputes about which deity is better. You two may worship Krishna directly, and you <em>(addressing the husband)</em> may worship Kali inside Krishna. She is most certainly there. They are one.</p>

<p>SUNDA: Marvellous, marvellous! No matter who composed the song, it was undoubtedly composed for us to sing. Brother, our love for each other is invincible; our beauty, unfathomable; and our power, immeasurable.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: In us the world can see the supreme incarnations of authority and power. All we need now is the Life of immortality. We have to be immortal like Indra. That’s all.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indra! Don’t use that filthy name! He is our worst enemy. We must dethrone him. We must destroy him. We must prove to the world that he is but a speck of dust, doomed to nothingness.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Alas, he is a cosmic god. Hence he is immortal.</p>
<p>SUNDA: God, god? What kind of god is he? He has no sense of morality. His wild vital does not have even an iota of purity. He is a shameless creature. His life can never love the breath of Truth. It can only love the physical beauty of women.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: You are not an inch from the truth. But we <em>have</em> to become immortal like Indra.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indeed! Indeed!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: We must start worshipping one of the principal gods in order to get a boon which will grant us Immortality.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indeed! Indeed!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: I personally don’t care for Shiva.</p>
<p>SUNDAY Neither do I.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: I don’t care for Vishnu, either.</p>
<p>SUNDA: I also don’t care for Vishnu.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: But I love Brahma.</p>
<p>SUNDA: I, too.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Let us then pray to Brahma day in and day out. Let us practise austerities. Brahma’s transcendental Blessing will grant us Immortality.</p>
<p>SUNDA: I am sure it will.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Let us leave our palace tomorrow and go to the forest to pray to and meditate on Brahma. Let us sacrifice everything for an immortal life.</p>
<p>SUNDA: A splendid idea, indeed!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: From tomorrow on we must lead the life of true ascetics in the thick of the forest.</p>
<p>SUNDA: We must, without fail, we must.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(Inside two forest caves Sunda and Upasunda are chanting, praying and meditating only to please Brahma. Each one has a picture of Brahma in front of him.)</em></p>
<p>SUNDA AND UPASUNDA <em>(chant together three times)</em>:</p>
<p><em>Hiranyagarbhaya vidmahe</em></p>
<p><em>Veda purushaya dhimahi</em></p>
<p><em>Tanno brahma prachodayat</em></p>
<p>We know Him as the Cosmic Creator.</p>
<p>We meditate on Him as the Purusha of the Veda.</p>
<p>May Brahma awaken the Supreme in us.</p>
<p>O Brahma, do appear before us. Do make us immortal like Indra. Everything we have, except Immortality. We don’t want to remain inferior to Indra. O Brahma, O Ocean of Infinite Compassion, it is you alone who can and will fulfil our inmost desire. O Brahma, O Father of Creation, do bless us with your divine Presence supreme.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Indra secretly. Having observed the severe austerities and penances of the two Asura brothers, Indra is terribly frightened. He feels that soon these two brothers will be more powerful than be is, and then they will seize his Kingdom, dethrone him and chase him out of heaven. Indra gets an idea and exits in silence, going back to Indra Puri, the City of Indra.</em></p>
<p><em>Soon he returns to the two Asura brothers with four extremely beautiful dancing girls who, he hopes, will tempt them and ruin them. The dancers offer their superlative performances to the two brothers. In every possible way they try to lower the consciousness of the two aspiring brothers. But all their efforts are in vain. The two genuine seekers are rapt in meditation.</em></p>
<p><em>(Frustrated, disheartened and defeated, Indra leads away the four dancing girls.)</em></p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Scene III</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(The following day. With their eyes slightly open the two brothers are in a very high meditation. They are deeply absorbed in the transcendental consciousness of Brahma.</em></p>
<p><em>Enter Brahma. The two aspirants immediately leave their seats and touch Brahma’s feet for benedictions.)</em></p>
<p>BRAHMA: Your aspiration has pleased me. Your determination has pleased me. What can I do for you?</p>
<p>SUNDA: Lord, we want to equal the cosmic god Indra. Something more, we want to dethrone Indra and become the King of the gods.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: We feel that in order to fulfil our heart’s desire we need only one thing, and that thing is an innortal life.</p>
<p>SUNDA AND UPASUNDA: You have just said that you are pleased with our aspiration and determination. If what you say is true, then please, please, please grant us an immortal life so that we can conquer Indra.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: No shadow of a doubt that I am truly pleased with you. But Indra’s supreme position is wellfounded. Ask for another boon.</p>
<p><em>(Sunda and Upasunda are both sunk in despair.)</em></p>
<p>SIUNDA: Then please give us at least the Life of Immortality. We do not want to be killed by anybody. We want our joint strength to be unparalleled in the entire history of the world.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA <em>(seeing Brahma quite hesitant)</em>: All right. At least this much of a favour you can do: if we have to die at all, then we wish to die at the hands of each other.</p>
<p>BRAHMA <em>(blessing them together)</em>: <em>Tathastu</em>. So be it.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Brahma)</em></p>
<p><em>(The two brothers embrace each other and dance with joy.)</em></p>
<p>UPASUNDA: So, we are now immortal!</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indeed, we are!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Brahma’s loftiest vision failed to see into our future.</p>
<p>SUNDA: His third eye didn’t function well today.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA <em>(roaring with laughter)</em>: How can we kill each other? Our sweetest, deepest oneness inseparable shall last through eternity!</p>
<p>SUNDA <em>(with another roaring laugh)</em>: How can we kill each other? Impossible! Creation has never seen and will never see such inseparable oneness.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: That goes without saying. So we are now really immortal!</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indeed, we are. We are immortal forever!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Although Brahma says that that hostile Indra’s position is well established, I simply don’t believe him. Do you?</p>
<p>SUNDA: Not in the least.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: We know that our power is invincible.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indeed, indeed!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: We shall be able to conquer Indra. Look at that rascal! Even while we were practicing hard austerities he had to bring down four most beautiful dancers to try to ruin our aspiration and determination.</p>
<p>SUNDA: You know, Brother, that Indra is a rascal of the deepest dye.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Let us first conquer all the kings on earth, and then with their added power — although we don’t exactly need any more power than we already have — we shall attack Indra, we shall dethrone Indra, and we shall chase Indra away like a cat out of heaven!</p>
<p>SUNDA: How wonderful to hear that!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Let us go back to our palace. Let us wage war against all the kings immediately. Let us totally destroy their capitals. Delay is not for us. We can easily become the undisputed rulers of the whole world.</p>
<p>SIUNDA: Certainly we can.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: No, nobody on earth will dare to question our supremacy. Once we have conquered the length and breadth of the world with our absolute power, we shall threaten, frighten, attack and dethrone Indra all at once.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Yes, Brother. We must do that. We must and we can. If we don’t, we can’t have everlasting joy.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: We simply <em>must</em> do it.</p>
<p>SUNDA: And we easily can.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(Early morning. Brahma’s abode. Brahma’s blessingful meditation on the world is just over.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter four saints.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST SAINT: O Lord Brahma, save us, save the world. Sunda and Upasunda are destroying the whole world.</p>
<p>SECOND SAINT: O Lord Brahma, the two <em>Asura</em> brothers have conquered all the peoples of the world. These two <em>Asuras</em> have looted all their wealth.</p>
<p>THIRD SAINT: They are now fully prepared to cross swords with the cosmic gods.</p>
<p>FOURTH SAINT: And soon they will be ready for a ruthless attack on Indra, the King of the cosmic gods.</p>
<p>THE SAINTS <em>(together)</em>: O Lord Brahma, save us, save the world from these two <em>Asuras</em>, or very soon the human race will suffer an eternal end.</p>
<p>BRAHMA <em>(smiling)</em>: My sweet children, I am fully aware of the grim situation. I am fully conscious of the unspeakable misdeeds of the two <em>Asura</em> brothers. Do not burn with impatience. I assure you that their days are numbered.</p>
<p><em>(Brahma starts meditating. In five minutes he creates through his third eye the most beautiful girl of eighteen the universe has ever seen.)</em></p>
<p>GIRL: My Lord, my Creator, my All! My life of unconditional and eternal service I place at your feet. I am sure you have a special plan for my life. My duty, my beauty, my reality and my divinity — all I place at your feet. You are my life’s soul and you are my soul’s goal.</p>
<p><em>(Brahma blesses her. While being blessed she offers her soulful prayer to her creator, the Creator of the universe.)</em></p>
<p>GIRL:</p>

<p>My life began with duty’s pride.<br /> My life shall live with beauty’s light.<br /> My life shall sport with reality’s soul.<br /> My life shall end with Divinity’s Height.</p>

<p>BRAHMA: Tilottama, O beauty unparalleled, O beauty’s perfection, descend into the world and do me a service.</p>
<p>TILOTTAMA: A service! This life of mine is at your express command.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Go and create a terrible dispute between the two <em>Asura</em> brothers, Sunda and Upasunda. Go and tempt them with your beauty’s mightiest power and make them kill each other while fighting for the possession of your matchless beauty.</p>
<p>TILOTTAMA: My Lord, my beauty is yours. My capacity is yours. My victory is yours. I am all yours.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Tilotama)</em></p>
<p>THE FOUR SAINTS <em>(together bowing down to Brahma)</em>: We are sure that Tilottama’s beauty will kill the two <em>Asura</em> brothers. O Lord Brahma, you have saved us, you have saved the world and you have saved the human race. To you we offer the breath of our eternal gratitude.</p>
<p><em>(Brahma smiles. Exeunt the four saints.)</em></p>  </div>

<p><em>(The Asura brothers are in the seventh heaven of enjoyment. Lower vital music and vulgar dancing are all around.</em></p>
<p><em>Enter Tilottama. Immediately Sunda and Upasunda are swayed by tenebrous passion.)</em></p>
<p>SUNDA: Who are you? Your body’s beauty is torturing every limb of mine.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Do you need money? Do you need jewels? Do you need name and fame? I shall give you immediately anything you want. Stand beside me, please. Stay with me, please. My heart needs you badly.</p>
<p>TILOTTAMA: Please let me think over the matter. After all, it is quite serious.</p>
<p>SUNDA: O paragon of beauty, my heart can brook no delay. I love you. You are mine. You are absolutely mine.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Stop, Sunda! I can clearly see that she loves me infinitely more than she loves you. Such being the case, it is I who deserve her, and not you.</p>
<p>SUNDA: I am not sure. Granted, she loves you more than she loves me. But I love her infinitely more than you love her.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: O beauty unparalleled, how do you declare your life on earth?</p>
<p>TILOTTAMA: My name is Tilottama.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Like your beauty, your very name is torturing my heart and soul. You make me dream, and I make the world tremble. You are in all my thoughts. I must have you. I must tell you that I love you only, and I love nobody else on earth.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Tilottama, my darling, Sunda is a stranger to truth and I am a stranger to falsehood. I love you only. I am all yours. You are all mine. The moment I saw you my heart came close to breaking with stupendous ecstasy, my darling.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Upasunda, not once but twice, you dare to call her your darling! She is all mine. I am all hers. You rightly deserve most severe punishment from me for your unpardonable audacity.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Who punishes whom? You fool, you rogue, you brute!</p>
<p><em>(Upasunda severely strikes Sunda with his naked sword. Sunda immediately crosses his own sword with Upasunda’s. A terrible fight starts between the two. The fight is unbelievably fierce. In a few minutes the two brothers kill each other. Enter Brahma and Indra. Tilottama bows down to Brahma.)</em></p>
<p>TILOTTAMA: O my Creator, O my Source, I was a mere instrument of yours. You have blessed the world with your divine victory supreme. Once again this world of ours shall be flooded with light and delight.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Tilottama, you are my greatest joy and highest pride.</p>
<p>INDRA: Tilottama, you have saved me. You have saved my divine pride. You have saved my Kingdom’s life. My heart’s garland of gratitude to you I offer.</p>

<p><em>(Shiva, Kumara and Ganapati.)</em></p>
<p>KUMARA: Father, I want to get married.</p>
<p>SHIVA: Why, my son? Why do you want to get married?</p>
<p>KUMARA: I need a woman in my life. I feel that my heart is barren. I need somebody to give me love.</p>
<p>GANAPATI: Father, I also want to get married. I also need love from somebody, from a woman. I need it badly, Father.</p>
<p>SHIVA: So both of you want to get married. It is a good idea. But we can’t afford to have two marriages performed at the same time. One of you will have to wait.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Father, I should get married first, since I made the proposal first.</p>
<p>GANAPATI: No, Father, I should marry first because I am older than he is, and as you know, it is the older child that gets married first. That is our Indian tradition.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Father, please listen to me. It is I who should get married first. All the time his mind remains in his books. I tell you, if you allow him to get married, he will neglect his wife. He won’t take care of his wife. He will ruin her, and you will feel miserable when you see your daughter-in-law come to you shedding bitter tears. Don’t allow him to get married, Father. It is I who should get married. I belong to this world. I know the ins and outs of this world. I will take care of my wife.</p>
<p>GANAPATI: Father, Kumara knows how to talk, and I know how to act. I tell you, he talks and talks and talks, but when it is a matter of action, he will not be seen anywhere. I shall please my wife. Believe me, Father. Give me the chance. I want to get married first.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Father, Father, it is always said that the youngest son in the family gets the first chance in everything. I am the youngest, Father, so I should get the first chance. I should get married first.</p>
<p>SHIVA: All right. I will tell you what you have to do. Both of you go and travel around the world. Whoever comes back first will be given the opportunity to get married first. I will wait.</p>
<p><em>(Kumara immediately runs away. Ganapati remains.)</em></p>
<p>GANAPATI <em>(to himself)</em>: With this huge belly of mine, how am I going to run like him? Oh God, give me some wisdom. How can I outrun my brother Kumara? He is thin, swift, agile. For me even to walk, to cover a quarter-mile, is an extremely difficult task. I will die if I have to circumnavigate the world. I won’t be able to do it. After I have covered two or three miles, I shall return to God instead of returning home. Let me meditate and see if I can get any ideas.</p>
<p><em>(He meditates. After some time, a brilliant idea enters his mind.)</em></p>
<p>GANAPATI <em>(to himself)</em>: My father! My father is all divinity. This world belongs to him. Naturally, if I go around him, that means I am going around the world. <em>(To his father.)</em> Father, please be seated, please be seated.</p>
<p><em>(Shiva sits down. Singing the glory of his father, Ganapati walks around him seven times.)</em></p>
<p>GANAPATI: Father, I have won.</p>
<p>SHIVA: How have you won?</p>
<p>GANAPATI: Father, I have won seven times over. You are the world. You are the Lord of the world, and you embody the world. You are the Creator; you are the creation itself. I have gone seven times around you. That means I have gone around the world seven times. Father it is I who should get married first.</p>
<p>SHIVA <em>(deeply pleased)</em>: Go and call your mother.</p>
<p><em>(Ganapati goes out and returns with his mother)</em></p>
<p>SHIVA <em>(to his wife)</em>: Your son Ganapati has won a race against Kumara. This morning both brothers insisted on getting married. When I agreed, each of them wanted to be the first to marry. I said the first one to travel around the world would be the first to get married. Ganapati asked me to sit down. I sat down, and he walked around me seven times. Naturally he is the winner.</p>
<p>DURGA: I am truly happy that we have a son who is wise. The other son is strong and powerful, but he does not have wisdom, alas. He will run and run and run. God knows when he will come back. I feel sorry for that boy, and I am proud of this boy. Let us marry this son. It is my wish that this son will marry two girls at the same time.</p>
<p>GANAPATI: Two? Two, Mother?</p>
<p>DURGA: Yes, my son, two. I need two girls to help me. And who knows, when Kumara comes back, he may be disappointed, seeing that you have married first, and he may not marry at all. So the best thing is for us to get two girls for you.</p>
<p>GANAPATI <em>(very happy)</em>: Oh, Mother! They will help you, so you won’t have to work anymore. And I will be so happy and proud. Everybody else has one wife, but I will have two wives!</p>
<p><em>(Shiva smiles and blesses his son.)</em></p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Scene II</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(Several days later, before Kumara returns home, he meets his enemy, Narada.)</em></p>
<p>NARADA: O Kumara, everything is finished.</p>
<p>KUMARA: What is finished?</p>
<p>NARADA: Finished. Your brother, Ganapati, has gotten married.</p>
<p>KUMARA: How? When? How did he reach our father before me? Has he gone around the world?</p>
<p>NARADA: Well, I do not know about that. But I can tell you that I have just come from your house, where I saw that he has two most beautiful girls as his wives.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Two? He has married two?</p>
<p>NARADA: Yes. Your parents are so pleased with him, so proud of him. Instead of one, they have brought him two beautiful, most beautiful girls. I don’t know. When you get married, I doubt that you will get as beautiful a girl for yourself.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Two wives? Two beautiful wives? I can’t believe you!</p>
<p>NARADA: If you do not believe me, you can go and see for yourself. You are very near your house.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Unbelievable! Unthinkable! My parents, my own parents have deceived me! Let me go and see.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1076122" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Scene III</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(Kumara, running, enters his home and sees two most beautiful girls with Ganapati and his parents. He is furious.)</em></p>
<p>KUMARA: <em>(to his parents)</em>: You have deceived me! You didn’t even wait for me. How did he come back before me?</p>
<p>SHIVA: My son, he knew that I am divine. He knew that I am the Creator and I am the creation. He knew that I am God and I am the world. So he went around me not once, but seven times. And you, my son, you have come only now, so late.</p>
<p>KUMARA: No! It is all deception, all deception! I can’t tolerate this. I am going into the forest. I will never, never marry in this life. I don’t need women, Who cares for a woman’s beauty? Beauty is, after all, only skin deep. I shall care only for the soul’s beauty, the eternal beauty. Women are bondage. I don’t need bondage. My brother now has double bondage: two women in his life. He was a fool to get married. Now he is stuck, but I can run towards my goal the fastest because I am free from bondage.</p>
<p><em>(Shiva blesses his son.)</em></p>
<p>SHIVA: Kumara, in some cases, marriage does help; in other cases, it is an obstruction. For you, marriage would be an obstruction, a curse. You do not need a wife. You need only God. To realise Him, to fulfil Him, is your sole aim. Marriage would not allow you to think of God, to meditate on God, And I want you to realise God as soon as possible without having this added burden on your shoulders. So to remain unmarried is, for you, a real blessing. But in Ganapati’s case, marriage is a blessing, a real boon. With his marriage, he will be able to fulfil himself and God. The added strength it gives him will allow him to run the fastest in his own way. We want satisfaction, real satisfaction, from both of you. Your unmarried life the world will adore. In his case, the world will see that with a wife one can also go to God. God is both man and woman. How can you ignore the part that is woman? Ganapati will take the other half, woman, to God. Both husband and wife can go to God simultaneously to fulfil Him, which is absolutely necessary. God wants you to remain unmarried and He wants your brother to lead a married life. Your brother is fulfilling God’s wish, as you will be from now on. So you please God in one way, and he pleases God in another way. Both of you are pleasing God in His own way.</p>
<p><em>(Shiva sings.)</em></p>

<p>What is marriage?<br /> The smile of love<br /> That allows two souls<br /> To soar above.</p>
<p>What is marriage?<br /> The curse of Night.<br /> A tug-of-war.<br /> No escape to Light.</p>
<p><em>(To Ganapati.)</em></p>
<p>What is marriage?<br /> God’s fulfilment true.<br /> In Silence and Power<br /> His Vision’s due.</p>
