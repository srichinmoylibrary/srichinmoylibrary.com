<p>I had so many problems with the English translator. At one point the interviewer asked how I help Carl Lewis with his prayer and meditation, but the translator said, "Now tell us something about how you help Ben Johnson with his prayer and meditation."</p>
<p>At another point when I said "pray and meditate," the translator said "play and meditate" in German. Kailash told me afterwards.</p>
