<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God does love ignorance, because He loves you. If God loves you, then He is bound to love ignorance. Again, you have to know that what we call ignorance is not totally dark in God's Eye. It will someday grow into God's all-illumining and all-fulfilling Light. For us, seeing ignorance is like standing in front of a mirror. When we look in a mirror, we see only the outside of things. But God can easily see the inner existence as well. For Him, the inner existence and the outer existence go together.</p>  </div>
