<h2>Imagination has a reality of its own</h2>

<p>When you are singing very, very devotional songs, at that time try to imagine the Feet of the Supreme. If you can see and feel that you are looking at the Feet of the Supreme, then your devotion will automatically come to the fore. This is a very effective way. I always say that imagination has a reality of its own. So if you can imagine the Feet of the Supreme, according to your aspiration and dedication, then automatically the soulfulness will come. You will be filled with prayerful feelings.</p>
<p>That is one way. There is another way. While singing very powerful songs, if you can concentrate on one particular limb of your body, then you will be able to bring to the fore the power aspect. Divine power is inside the heart, true, but as soon as we think of power, we think of our shoulders or our arms. If you place your concentration there, you will be able to sing most powerfully.</p>
<p>I like the song <em>Khule dao ankhi</em> very much.</p>

<p><em>Khule dao ankhi khule dao hiya</em><br /><em>khule dao man pran</em><br /><em>khule dao deha khule dao sab</em><br /><em>ogo prabhu bhagaban</em></p>

<p>It means:</p>

<p>O, open up my eyes,<br /> Open up my heart,<br /> Open up my mind,<br /> Open up my vital,<br /> Open up my body,<br /> Open up everything of mine,<br /> O my Lord, O my Lord Absolute Supreme.</p>

<p>In Bengali, the word 'God' has many, many synonyms, but the one that comes immediately in the hearts of all Bengalis is <em>bhagavan.</em> <em>Ishwa</em> and <em>param prabhu</em> are other words that we use, but in the Bengali heart, we get an immediate response from <em>bhagavan.</em> <em>Bhagavan</em> is absolutely embedded in our heart-breath.</p>
<p>When you sing the song <em>Bhagavan, bhagavan</em> nicely, I get such joy. God has hundreds of synonyms, but <em>bhagavan</em> comes first of all, before all other synonyms. It embodies all the God-aspects. Again, when we say <em>param pita</em> or <em>param prabhu</em>, at that time the devotion aspect comes more to the fore. <em>Prabhu</em> also means God, but there the devotion aspect is paramount.</p>
<p>Similarly, to a little child, his mother and father are one, but the word 'Mother' touches the heart or breath of the child more than the word 'Father'. This is my own feeling. The Bengali word for Mother is <em>ma</em>. We use this word when we want immediate attention. When you are in pain or anything is wrong, the Mother comes first. The Father enters into the picture when it is a matter of something very large. The Father belongs to the large, larger, largest world. The Mother is intimate, most intimate. She is the one who will come to our immediate rescue. When the Father comes, immediately we enter into vastness. But when the Mother comes, immediately we enter into the world of affection, sweetness, fondness and intimacy.</p>
