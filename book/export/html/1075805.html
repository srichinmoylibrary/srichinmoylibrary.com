<p><em>(Time: 5 p.m. Tea is served in Aurobindo's cabin. Aurobindo and Bijoy come down to the lower deck, receive Srinivasachari and Moni and take them to the tea-table.)</em></p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: I am sorry I suspected your emissary. I have instructed him to come a little later with your companion and your luggage. You and I can proceed in a <em>pousse-pousse</em> [fn:10] waiting for us.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: First, have a cup of tea before we land.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: Thanks, Aurobindo Babu, thanks. The fish-shaped biscuits play upon my nerves.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Biscuits are biscuits. No real fish. What objection then?</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: My conscience would prick me all the same.</p>
<p><em>(Moni and Bijoy, amused, exchange glances, and smile. Then they both empty the dishes.)</em></p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: My heart is too full of joy at your arrival to say anything. One of my friends has suggested to me that Shanker Chetty's house would suit you best. So I have taken a part of it for your use. Come along with me to the shore. We have first to board a catamaran.</p>  </div>
