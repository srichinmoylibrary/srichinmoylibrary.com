<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If your meditation is very high, very powerful, fire is emanating from your eyes. Then if one who is cherishing worldly thoughts looks at you, he will be compelled to give up those thoughts. Many times I have seen when three or four aspirants meditate together, if one of them is in a very high meditation, then the others have to leave the place or are compelled from within to meditate soulfully.</p>  </div>
