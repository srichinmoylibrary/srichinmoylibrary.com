<p>Although thy pen was silent, mute,<br /> A sea of knowledge dire<br /> In thee the world of yore had seized.<br /> Thy voice was Spirit's fire.</p>
<p>All wealth and ease of the world sublime<br /> Thy deeds were apt to disdain.<br /> Therefore thy spouse, Xantippe,<br /> Was tortured by a ceaseless pain.</p>
<p>Many a foe of giant cloud<br /> Against thy knowledge stood.<br /> But gloom saw its doom in thee,<br /> With thee thy high manhood.</p>
