<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that time the ego is transformed. While you are bathing, your body becomes clean. When you jump into the swimming pool, you surrender your whole existence to the water and immediately your body becomes clean. Similarly, think of the ego as something dirty and throw it into the sea of light. When you make total surrender to your Master, you enter into the sea of Light and become illumined. When you enter into the sea of water, the dirt is dissolved but the body remains the same. You have not lost your body, but the same body is clean, purified. One minute ago it was dirty, but now you have jumped into the water and it is clean. In the same way when the ego enters into the sea of Light, when it surrenders its existence to the sea of Light, then immediately it becomes illumined.</p>  </div>
