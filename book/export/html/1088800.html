<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can overcome fear of other people the moment you think that other people are just extensions of your own existence. In your life, you pay attention not only to your eyes, but also to your nose and other parts of your being. But, in this case, you give importance only to your personal existence, and you do not feel that other people are part and parcel of your existence The moment you cherish a feeling of separativity, then you are afraid.</p>  </div>
