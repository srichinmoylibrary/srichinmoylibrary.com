<p>Look and see<br /> If you have criticised God.</p>
<p>Look and see<br /> If you have deceived man.</p>
<p>Look and see<br /> If your proud mouth has overestimated yourself.</p>
<p>Look and see<br /> If your timid heart has underestimated yourself.</p>
<p>If you have criticised God,<br /> Don't worry. He will illumine you.</p>
<p>If you have deceived man,<br /> Don't worry. He will deceive you back.<br /> Therefore you will not owe him anything.</p>
<p>If you have overestimated<br /> Or underestimated yourself,<br /> Don't worry. Just dive within<br /> And you will unmistakably know<br /> Where you really stand.</p>
