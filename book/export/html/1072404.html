<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Individual aspiration has to grow along with the collective aspiration. If one feels the need of realising God, this is his individual aspiration. With this aspiration he must enter into the collective world, because without entering into the collective world, he will have no existence of his own. His true existence lies in offering himself to the rest of the world. In the field of aspiration and in the field of realisation, individuality and collectivity must go together.</p>  </div>
