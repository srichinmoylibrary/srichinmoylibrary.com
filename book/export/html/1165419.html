<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No! There are many who work hard and do heavy work, but if they are not doing it consciously, then they will not get the same result. Many can do physical work, but if they are not consciously trying to develop their strength or to feel the presence of a higher force in their action, then they will not get the same experience.</p>
<p>If both a seeker and a non-seeker have physical strength, the seeker will get more benefit when he works than the non-seeker, for he is doing it consciously. He tries to be constantly conscious of what he is doing and why he is doing it. A desire-man, a non-seeker, does not know why he is working and for what he is working. Because he lacks oneness-power with the Inner Pilot, he will not get the same sense of satisfaction as the one who is a seeker-weightlifter.</p>  </div>
