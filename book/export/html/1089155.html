    <title>&lt;em&gt;Mr. Utsunomiya:&lt;/em&gt; I am certainly impressed with what you have said, and this has to be repeated. The trust you have spoken of now and the beliefs which I have referred to in some way should be widely disseminated among the people. One of the worst possible effects of a nuclear war would be the destruction not only of the men who started it but also of all other living animals, plants and beings.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we can pay not only more attention but all attention to peace, then we can try to avoid it. We can't deny that the danger exists, but we can easily avoid it. If there is a hurdle, we shall try to surmount it or we shall take another direction, which is the direction of peace. The world is now talking about destruction, but we are talking about peace. According to our capacity, God is utilising us to spread peace all over the world. So let each of us spread peace according to our capacity. We know that people are threatening to set fire to our building. But if we keep the building strong, we are well protected. Similarly, while the danger of war threatens us, if we can inundate the world with love and peace, that love will prove stronger than the strongest, and war itself will be destroyed.</p>
<p>God is all Love, and inside Love is infinite Power. So if I can bring forward my love and if you can bring forward your love, then our love-power will definitely silence this destruction-power.</p>  </div>
