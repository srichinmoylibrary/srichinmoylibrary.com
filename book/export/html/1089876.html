<p>The physical reality is almost a dream. The spiritual reality is Eternity, Infinity and Immortality. If you concentrate daily on truth, you will feel your oneness with your own reality. This is your real life. And what is your own Reality, the ultimate Reality? The ultimate Reality is the fulfilled and manifested divinity that humanity will one day become.</p>  </div>
