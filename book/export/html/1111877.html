<p>After speaking to Fred, I went into the rest room and then I went into the stationery store in the hotel to buy The New York Times. Who came up to me? Fred Lebow again!</p>
<p>He said, "I was looking for you. Here, I am giving you this T-shirt." On the T-shirt was written, "Training for the New York Marathon 1983."</p>
<p>He said, "I want you to have it."</p>
<p>I thanked him. Then I asked, "This time, are you going to Russia to run a marathon?"</p>
<p>He said, "No, not to Russia, but I am going to China next month." In another two weeks he was going to Shanghai to run. He also told me that two weeks earlier he ran a marathon in New Orleans.</p>
<p>I asked him, "Will you run one of our races? Have you ever run in Germany?"</p>
<p>He said, "No."</p>
<p>I said, "We have a few marathons in Germany. I would be so happy and honoured if you could run in one. I also will go once this year."</p>
<p>He said, "If you are going to run, then you let me know and I will come to join you."</p>
<p>He gave me the New York Road Runners Club schedule for the whole year. Then both of us said that we would see each other the next day at the race.</p>
