<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> My soul-reality's All,<br /> Countless times<br /> I have withdrawn from You.<br /> I have withdrawn<br /> My promise-oneness.<br /> I have withdrawn<br /> My willingness-oneness.<br /> I have withdrawn<br /> My soulfulness-oneness.<br /> I have withdrawn<br /> My surrender-oneness-bliss.<br /> Still You have not<br /> Withdrawn from me.<br /> You remain<br /> Your Eternity's Compassion-Eye.<br /> You remain<br /> Your Infinity's Forgiveness-Heart.<br /> You remain<br /> Your Immortality's<br /> Vision-Fulfilment-Cry.</p>
