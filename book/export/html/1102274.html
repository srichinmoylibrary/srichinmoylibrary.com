<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The main problem is the feeling of superiority and inferiority, which is found where the sense of separativity looms large. When the feeling of identification is wanting, the receiver and the giver are not willing to stand on the same footing of inseparable oneness.</p>  </div>
