  <h1 class="book-heading">Buying a notebook</h1>
  
 
<p>I went to the store in our hotel in Puerto La Cruz to buy a small notebook. The owner said, "The price is forty bolivars, but that is too much. You give me twenty. It is not even worth twenty, but I have to charge you twenty."</p>
<p>I said, "Fine," since I liked the cute notebook.</p>
<p>Then he said, "Are you the same gentleman that I see on the ring the ladies wear?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He said, "Oh, I saw you in the newspaper with the President."</p>
<p>I said, "I have seen all three presidents-the present one, the future one and the previous one."</p>
<p>The man said, "I am so happy and so honoured to meet you. Please tell me how your people support themselves if they always go around with you."</p>
<p>I said, "No, only for one month they have come here."</p>
<p>Then he asked me the significance of the sari. He said, "It is very beautiful. Where does it come from?"</p>
<p>I said, "India. I am Indian, and I like this Indian form of dress."</p>
<p>He said, "You have Indian skin, but your face is not Indian. You don't look like an Indian."</p>
<p>He was so happy, and he was shaking my hand. I wanted to buy two T-shirts for some disciples who had stayed home, so he said, "My hands are dirty. You please take them yourself."</p>
