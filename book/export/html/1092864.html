<p>In a letter to his wife Emilie written just ten days prior to his resignation as Congress President, Subhas states candidly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Perhaps you know that I was re-elected President in spite of the opposition of the Gandhi group. They were greatly annoyed that I defeated their candidate. Gandhi-ji himself called my victory a defeat for himself. Ever since the election I have had great trouble with the Gandhi group and the trouble is not over yet."</p>
