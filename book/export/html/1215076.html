<p>The easiest way to please God is to feel that God has done everything for us. On my part I have only to soulfully and gratefully appreciate what He has done for me and to be fully satisfied with it. If I do not constantly offer my soulful appreciation, if I think that God has dealt with me in a wrong way, then I am asking God to start His creation anew just for me. If I am not satisfied with God, He will again and again try to please me. There is no end to what He will do for me. But if I am not pleased with what He has done, then I am not pleasing Him in His own way. The easiest way to please Him is to feel that He has already done everything for me unconditionally.</p>  </div>
