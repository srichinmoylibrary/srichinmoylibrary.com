<p>When I was race-walking, Dhanu's car was following me. There were some distinguished people in the car: Nirvik, Ila, Garima, plus Trishul. I covered many miles.</p>
<p>When I had covered only 500 metres, a young boy smiled at me and said to me, "How is your business going on?" Now, what is my business?</p>
<p>Later, a young man offered me a can of beer. I smiled at him. He said afterwards to the people in the car that there was much protein in beer.</p>
