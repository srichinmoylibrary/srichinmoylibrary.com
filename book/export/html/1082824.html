<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each spiritual Master has some doubting and insincere disciples. Some may doubt the Master's realisation; they doubt whether the Master has actually realised God. Now, who is the loser here? If the Master is realised, then he is far above the disciples' doubt and suspicion. The Master will remain in his own highest consciousness. He will never be affected if these disciples doubt him.</p>
<p>Then, there are some disciples who are convinced to a degree that the Master is realised, but they doubt their own acceptance of the spiritual life. They feel that they are not totally sincere. These kinds of disciples can have faith in the Master but not in themselves. To doubt the Master is not good, but to doubt oneself is worse. And to doubt one's Master and oneself is the worst thing one can do.</p>  </div>
