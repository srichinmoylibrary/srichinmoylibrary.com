<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two kinds of pride: one is human pride and one is divine pride. Human pride enjoys the sense of separativity. It cannot mix with the rest of the world. It is beneath its dignity to become one with the world or to stand on the same footing as the rest of the world. It always gets satisfaction by standing at least a few inches higher, so that it can lord it over others.</p>
<p>But divine pride feels, “I am of God, I am for God. So how can I mix with ignorance, how can I wallow in the pleasures of ignorance? I have to become one with my Source, I have to become perfect like my Source. The way my Lord Supreme is perfect and spiritual, I also have to become perfect.” We have to brave the buffets of ignorance when it threatens our progress. We have to tell ignorance that we cannot mix with it, because our Source is Light and Delight. When we have this kind of oneness with our Source, then we can enjoy divine pride in a divine way.</p>  </div>
