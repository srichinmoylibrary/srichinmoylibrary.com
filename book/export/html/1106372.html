<p>Today I lifted 130 pounds two times with both arms together. These lifts are better than yesterday, true, but still they are not satisfactory to me. What I am doing wrong, God alone knows. Every other lift I am doing miraculously, but when it comes to two arms some magic is needed. I would really like to have a little better results.</p>
