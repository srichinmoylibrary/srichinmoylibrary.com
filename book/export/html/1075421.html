<p>"Son, are all your debts paid?"</p>
<p>Father, I was heavily indebted<br /> To my friends<br /> For their sublime<br /> Appreciation and admiration.<br /> But I have paid all my debts<br /> With my ceaseless gratitude.</p>
<p>Father, I was deeply indebted<br /> To Ignorance-Night<br /> For her constant<br /> Attacks and confusion.<br /> But I have paid all my debts<br /> With my adamantine certitude.</p>
<p>"Son, such being the case,<br /> I welcome you<br /> To share<br /> My Infinitude."</p>
