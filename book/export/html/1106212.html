  <h1 class="book-heading">“blessed” By My Sister</h1>
  
 
<p>This month at least four times I have been “blessed” by my sister. She didn’t want me to do this kind of lifting. She felt my “imaginative” lifts were beneath my dignity. Two weeks ago my brother said he felt sorry about the way she was scolding and insulting me. But the main reason she was scolding and insulting me is that she is worried I will get hurt. When she hears about the heavy weight, she thinks, “O God, one day he will get hurt!”</p>
