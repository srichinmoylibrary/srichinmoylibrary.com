<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! Suppose your father is sick and you pray to God. If your prayer is soulful, then God will definitely cure your father if that is His Will. But even if your prayer is most soulful, if God wants your father to go through an experience of sickness, He knows what is best for your father as well as for you. Then you have to know that God Himself is suffering in and through your father. It is God Himself who is having that particular experience. But even if God does not cure your father, your soulful prayers will not be lost. God will fulfil your prayers in a different way. Since your prayer has knocked at Godâ€™s Door, God will keep the sincerity, the soulful quality of your prayer inside His Heart. Your prayer God preserves as a peerless treasure. Then He will enlarge and expand your heart and illumine your life. He will give you a very big heart. Today you are crying and praying for the cure of your father; tomorrow you will cry for ten persons; the day after for the vast humanity. At that time, you will pray not just for your near and dear ones; you will pray for all of suffering humanity. God will give you the divine capacity to pray for all of humanity.</p>  </div>
