<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Do we remember even what we ate this morning? If I asked you what you ate last Friday or Saturday, you would be totally lost. Why? Because you did not give any importance to it. It is the same thing in the case of our past lives. Right now it is not necessary for us to remember them.</p>  </div>
