<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If someone does not get any exercise at all, then the physical will really remain unlit, lethargic and a real hindrance to the aspirant. If you try to keep fit, the physical will add its contribution to the soul. I know the importance of the physical consciousness. If the physical consciousness does not aspire, it will remain separated from the soul. Then rest assured, you will never be able to achieve perfection. The physical has to aspire in its own way to increase its capacity so that it can hold light. Then you will be able to aspire much more.</p>  </div>
