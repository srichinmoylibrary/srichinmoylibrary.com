<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have seen the Supreme in many forms, but the form I appreciate or admire the most, and the form He Himself likes best for me, is a very brilliant one, all golden, shining and very, very tall. In just a second, like pressing a button, I can see Him in this form, so high that you cannot conceive of it, infinitely immense and brilliant. That is the form I enjoy the most.</p>  </div>
