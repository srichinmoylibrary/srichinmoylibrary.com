<p>"My Lord,<br /> I have read much about Heaven and Hell.<br /> I have also heard more about Heaven and Hell<br /> Than I can possibly digest.<br /> What do they mean when they say<br /> That someone is living in Heaven<br /> And someone is living in Hell?"</p>
<p>"My son,<br /> I do not know what they mean<br /> When they speak of Heaven and Hell.<br /> But I shall tell you what I mean.<br /> To live with Me is to live in Heaven.<br /> To live without Me is to live in Hell."</p>
