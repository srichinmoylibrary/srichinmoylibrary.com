<p>Common Sense Number One: You are God's chosen son.</p>
<p>Common Sense Number Two: Not only do you need God, but God also needs you. You need God to realise your true Self; God needs you to fulfil Himself.</p>
<p>Common Sense Number Three: You want to realise God. Even if you don't want to realise God, He will not allow you to remain unrealised.</p>
<p>Common Sense Number Four: You may think that today you are an animal, but you must know that you are tomorrow's God.</p>  </div>
