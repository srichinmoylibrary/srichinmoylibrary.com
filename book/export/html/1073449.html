<p>My Captain, do tell me the secret<br /> To make You happy.<br /> My Captain, there was a time<br /> When I was in the desire-world.<br /> Therefore, You were so sad.<br /> But now I am in the aspiration-world.<br /> Why are You so sad now?<br /> It seems that I will never be able<br /> To make You happy.<br /> "My child, while you were in the desire-world,<br /> You were a ferocious and all-devouring tiger.<br /> Therefore, it was impossible for Me<br /> To be pleased with you and remain happy.<br /> Although you now live in the aspiration-world,<br /> Your aspiration-life is as weak as a tiny ant.<br /> How can I be proud of you?<br /> How can I be happy?"<br /> My Captain,<br /> My desire-life created sadness for You.<br /> My aspiration-life is creating sadness for You.<br /> I do hope someday I shall realise You,<br /> And my realisation-life<br /> Will make You truly happy.<br /> "My child, it entirely depends<br /> On what kind of realisation you want.<br /> If you long for a realisation-drop<br /> And not a realisation-ocean,<br /> Then you will undoubtedly<br /> Make me once more unhappy.<br /> Right now your realisation-hour is a far cry.<br /> But since you are in your aspiration-life,<br /> Aspire and aspire for the highest height.<br /> Your achievement of your highest height<br /> Will eventually blossom<br /> Into an inseparable oneness-realisation<br /> With My Universal Life.<br /> "Forget your desire-life.<br /> Neglect not your aspiration-life.<br /> Inject your aspiration-life<br /> With your heart's promise-light<br /> So that at My choice Hour I can bless you<br /> For your realisation<br /> Most powerfully, most proudly and most happily<br /> With My Immortality's Satisfaction-Delight."</p>
