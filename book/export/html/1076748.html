<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, well geography tells us something, history tells us something, and literature also tells us something. I will tell the children at the YMCA in a few hours my impression of Puerto Rico, strictly from the spiritual point of view, whatever it is; from the spiritual point of view plus a little geography and general knowledge. But it is all based on the spiritual feeling of the island, now that I have seen the place, and since I have been taken around.</p>
<p>But more than that, the moment that I entered and touched the feet of Puerto Rican soil, it has given me the knowledge of what it is. As soon as I landed there at the airport, my first thing was to touch the feet, to touch the soil and be blessed by the Puerto Rican presiding deity. And then she gave me the wisdom-knowledge of what she is and what she represents.</p>  </div>
