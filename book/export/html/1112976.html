<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We tend to believe everything that we hear from our parents, from our friends, from the world around us. When we speak of having 'faith', this is stronger than mere 'belief'. Faith deals with our strong inner convictions. George Bernard Shaw once said that we have not lost our faith in God, but we have transferred our faith to the medical profession. This is often true. Very often people have more faith in doctors than in God; most of us have more faith in human beings than in God.</p>  </div>
