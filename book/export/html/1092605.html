<blockquote>
<p>"United we stand, divided we fall."</p>
<p>â€” Motto of the State of Kentucky, U.S.A</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our National Song is an expression of our National Soul, Mother India's prayer to the Divine voiced by her Poet of Dawn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Thou art the ruler of the minds of all people, Thou Dispenser of India's Destiny. Thy name rouses the hearts Of the Punjab, Sind, Gujarat and Maratha, Of Dravid, Orissa and Bengal. It echoes in the hills of the Vindhyas and Himalayas, Mingles in the music of Jamuna and Ganges, And is chanted by the waves of the India Sea. They pray for thy blessing and sing thy praise, Thou Dispenser of India's destiny. Victory, Victory, Victory to thee."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Tagore, India should and must seek power in union, and not in competition with the West in brutal wars.</p>  </div>
