<p>Death, why are you not natural?<br /> "Pilgrim, who told you that?<br /> Just live in your soul,<br /> And you will see<br /> That nobody is as natural<br /> As I am."</p>
<p>Death, why are you not useful?<br /> "Pilgrim, who told you that?<br /> Just live in your heart,<br /> And you will deeply appreciate<br /> My tremendous usefulness."</p>
<p>Death, why are you not universal?<br /> "Pilgrim, who told you that?<br /> Just live in your mind,<br /> And you will learn<br /> That my universality surprisingly surpasses<br /> The rest of God's creation put together."</p>
