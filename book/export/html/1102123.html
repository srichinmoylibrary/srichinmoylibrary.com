<p>"My most perfect Lord, I am most certain that You appreciate my sincerity."</p>
<p>"Not only do I appreciate your sincerity, My child, but I admire your sincerity. What is bothering you now, My child, sincerity incarnate?"</p>
<p>"For the last twenty-five years, my Lord, I have been using and explaining and interpreting three most complicated words: Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. But to my sincere sorrow, I myself do not know what they actually mean. At long last I have decided that I shall no longer fool humanity nor shall I fool myself. That means I shall not use the words Infinity, Eternity and Immortality any more."</p>
<p>"My sweetest child, you don't have to deceive yourself and humanity. I am teaching you the meaning of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. Infinity means the realising, the realised and the eternally realising God. Eternity means the revealing, the revealed and the eternally revealing God. Immortality means the fulfilling, the fulfilled and the eternally fulfilling God."</p>
