<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are my true disciple, you are bound to see me when you leave the body. That much I assure you. If you are my real disciple, you will not be able to die without my knowledge and consent. At that time I will stand right in front of you and take you in my chariot. I will carry you in a golden or silver or bronze chariot; you will see. This is the promise that great spiritual Masters give: they will come and take the souls of their disciples.</p>  </div>
