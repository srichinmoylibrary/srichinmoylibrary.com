<p>Ask me the right question.<br /> "Who is God?"<br /> God is your integral Self.</p>
<p>Ask me the right question.<br /> "Where is God?"<br /> God is inside the meanness of your mind<br /> And the vastness of your heart.</p>
<p>Ask me the right question.<br /> "How is God?"<br /> His Mind thinks He is sick,<br /> His Heart feels He is weak,<br /> His Soul announces that He needs rest.<br /> His Goal predicts that He will enter<br /> Into a new Cosmic Game.</p>
