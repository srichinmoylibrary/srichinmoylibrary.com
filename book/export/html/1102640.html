<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As earth is our body's world, so also there is a world which we call the soul's world. We are all God's children. A child always has a home. After going to the playground for a few hours, he returns home. Then, after taking rest, the next day he goes out again to play. Similarly, the soul comes here on earth to play for a few years and then it goes back to its own region, to where it came from. After taking rest for some time, it returns to earth in another body.</p>
<p>The soul's original abode is <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda.</em> It means 'Existence-Consciousness-Bliss.' There is a Bengali song, <em>"Phire Chalo,"</em> which means, "Let us go Home." The aspiring soul is returning home, to a place where it is all light and delight. In this home there is no death, no suffering, no sorrow, no decay; it is all joy, light and delight.</p>
