<p>O my heart,<br /> Since when have you freed yourself<br /> From the strains and stresses of life?<br /> I am now so proud of you.<br /> You are really great.</p>
<p>O my mind,<br /> Since when have you freed yourself<br /> From doubt and pride?<br /> I am now so proud of you.<br /> You are really great.</p>
<p>O my vital,<br /> Since when have you freed yourself<br /> From dust and din?<br /> I am now so proud of you.<br /> You are really great.</p>
<p>O my body,<br /> Since when have you freed yourself<br /> From fear and indolence?<br /> I am now so proud of you.<br /> You are really great.</p>
