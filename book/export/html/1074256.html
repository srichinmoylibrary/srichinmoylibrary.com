<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The only wrong thing was accepting others’ suggestions as to whether you should go to a doctor or not. Because doubt had entered into you, because this other force had entered, I had to put a special force on your foot. Otherwise, it would have gone its natural course. It is like a patient. The patient is getting well in a natural, normal way, but then the patient does something more undivine, so the divine doctor gives him a more powerful dose of medicine.</p>  </div>
