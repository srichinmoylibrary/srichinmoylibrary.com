<p>To his friend Charlie Andrews, Gandhi-ji once wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I feel Subhas is behaving like a spoilt child of the family. The only way to make up with him is to open his eyes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same Gandhi-ji, in answer to a question from the American journalist Louis Fisher, described Subhas as "the Prince among the Patriots." Gandhi's opinion of Subhas continually wavered between enfant terrible and prince. Was this the basis on which to build the best possible relations?</p>  </div>
