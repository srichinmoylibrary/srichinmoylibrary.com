  <h1 class="book-heading">Who is the winner?</h1>
  
 
<p>Who is the winner? Not he who wins, but he who has established his cheerful oneness with the result, which is an experience in the form of failure or success, a journey forward or a journey backward.</p>
<p>Who is the winner? Not he who wins the race, but he who loves to run sleeplessly and breathlessly with God the Supreme Runner.</p>
<p>Who is the winner? Not he whose glory we sing, but he who embodies God’s Compassion-Light in abundant measure.</p>
<p>Who is the winner? Not he who has acquired tremendous name and fame and amassed a big fortune, but he who requires only one thing: God-Satisfaction in God's own Way.</p>  </div>
