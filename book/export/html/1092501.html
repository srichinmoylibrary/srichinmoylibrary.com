<p><em>(The King is ready for initiation. He has shaved his head and cut off his beard and is sitting in front of the spiritual teacher.)</em></p>
<p><em>(The King sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>He jogiraj dikkha amai dao go aji dikkha</em><br /><em>Rupantarer amar bani pabo aji shikkha</em><br /><em>Ghurbona ar dure dure</em><br /><em>Nachbo shudhu hriday pure</em><br /><em>Gaibo giti premer sure</em><br /><em>Dekhbo amai pran mukure</em><br /><em>Nirabatar lagi ami magi aji bhikkha</em></p>


<p>[O Yogi of the highest magnitude, initiate me. Today offer me your initiation.<br /> Today I shall learn the immortal message of transformation from you.<br /> I shall not wander anymore in the farthest corners of the world.<br /> I shall only dance in the city of my heart.<br /> Inside the city of my heart I shall sing songs of Love Divine,<br /> And I shall see myself in the mirror of my sanctified heart.<br /> Today I beg of you to offer me only one thing: silence, silence.<br /> O Yogi of the highest magnitude, initiate me today.]</p>

<p><em>(The King touches his feet.)</em></p>
<p>KING: You have taken all my impurity, all my imperfections. In return I give you my whole Kingdom and all its wealth. Anything you want from me is yours. O Guru, I am at your command. My royal family is at your command. My subjects are at your command. And all my possessions are at your command.</p>
<p>GURU: O King, from now on I expect you to lead a spiritual life, a divine life. From your example, your Kingdom will begin a new life, a life of purity, a life of renunciation, a life of divine perfection.</p>
<p>KING: Guru, I know, I know. I am most grateful to you for initiating me. I was not worthy of being initiated, but from now on, through my acts, I shall prove to you that I can be what you want me to be, and I shall not betray your trust.</p>
<p><em>(The King sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Jagiyachhe bishwanath asundar prane</em><br /><em>Chalilam shashwater ahana sandhane</em></p>


<p>[The Lord of the Universe is awakened inside the heart of ugliness itself.<br /> Now towards the Eternal Dawn I march, I run towards the Eternal Dawn.]</p>

<p><em>(The Guru blesses the King with joy and pride, and then leaves.)</em></p>  </div>
