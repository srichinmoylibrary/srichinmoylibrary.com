<p>What is a Guru?<br /> A Guru is he who devours<br /> The ignorance-sea of his disciple.<br /> What is a disciple?<br /> A disciple is he who swims<br /> In the wisdom-sea of his Guru.<br /> What is a Guru?<br /> A Guru is he who finds himself<br /> In the soul of his disciple.<br /> What is a disciple?<br /> A disciple is he who loses himself<br /> In the heart of his Guru.</p>
