<p>Another colleague was so kind to me. His name was Vincent Jovial. He wanted to become a priest. Once he took me to see his uncle who was a priest and his uncle tried to convert me. Unfortunately, this priest was a rogue. A few weeks later, he issued many, many false checks. Then jail invited him! He had wanted to publish my book on Tagore. Luckily, I got it back.</p>
<p>So that priest was no good. Then Jovial took me to another priest. Priests are not allowed to marry, but this priest was married. I told my friend that we should call him a minister, but my friend replied that Indian priests can get married.</p>
<p>One Sunday I was invited to give a talk in this priest’s apartment. Around thirty people were there. I spoke for about an hour and a half. Afterwards, one Indian lady came and fell flat at my feet. She had been planning to go back to India because nobody was nice to her. She told me that during my talk she had received so much joy, love and affection from Mother India. She saw India inside me. Then she said, “Now I do not need to go back to India anymore.” I saved her the trip.</p>
<p>That was my first private talk.</p>  </div>
