<p><em>Yogi:</em> As long as you want me to understand you in your own human way, you will know nothing about me and you will feel nothing about me. But when you want to know me and please me in my own divine and realised way, you will know everything about me, you will feel everything about me and you will receive everything from me.</p>  </div>
