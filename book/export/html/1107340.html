<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, nobody thinks that. If they think that, then they are making a terrible mistake. I am not God and I have told them repeatedly that I am not even the Guru. I tell them that God is their Guru. God is the only Guru, not only for me but for everyone. I am the leader, I am the messenger-boy. I come to my disciples and tell them, "Give me what you have." They have ignorance and they give me their ignorance. Then I go to God and say to Him, "Please give me what You want me to take to the disciples." God then tells me to give them Compassion and Love. So I am the messenger between my disciples and God.</p>  </div>
