<p>Einstein was absent-minded even as a youth. But we have to know that although today’s absent-mindedness may incur hurtful ridicule, tomorrow’s new and fulfilling realisation will claim the highest admiration and deepest gratitude. Once, when Einstein was young, he stayed overnight at a friend’s house. When he left the next morning, he forgot his suitcase. The friend’s parents said to Einstein’s parents, “That young man will never amount to anything, because he can’t remember anything.”</p>  </div>
