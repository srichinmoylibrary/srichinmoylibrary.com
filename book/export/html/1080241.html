<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want peace, then you have to meditate on peace. If you want love, then you have to meditate on love. If you want joy or any other divine quality, the best thing is to meditate on it. That is the only way you can get these qualities. Each individual will have a different way of meditating because his mind or his heart will want different qualities. You will be knocking at a particular door and somebody else will be knocking at another door. Each one has his own way.</p>
<p>The general rule for my students is to knock at my heart's door. That is an absolutely general rule. Once the door is open, if you want to go to the kitchen, you go. If you want to go to the living room, you go. If you want to go to my study you go. If you want to go to the meditation room, you go. But the general rule is to open the door first and then select the room that you want to enter.</p>
<p>In the heart there is no necessity of justification; it is all illumination. In the heart we see light which does not have to justify its existence. The sun does not have to justify its existence on earth. Light is light. Its very presence is illumination. When we accept the spiritual life, it is all aspiration. Aspiration itself is light, illumination.</p>
<p>We try to justify ourselves when we see that somebody is doubting us and we feel sure of what we are doing. If we are really sure, then immediately our justification capacity comes forward to prove that we are doing the right thing. But if we know that we are doing the right thing and we also are the right thing, then we don't have to justify. Let us become the sun. The sun does not justify its light because it knows that it is light itself.</p>  </div>
