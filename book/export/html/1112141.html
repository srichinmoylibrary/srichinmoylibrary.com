<p>After the marathon, one runner was making a phone call. I heard everything he said because I was standing behind him, waiting to use the phone. The runner had a bandage around his right quadricep. He was begging his brother to come and pick him up. God knows what the brother said.</p>
<p>Then the man called someone else, whom he called "Honey." But this person also did not want to come.</p>
<p>Then he called "Mum." But Mum also said no. She was the third person to refuse him. Then he said such a nasty word to his mother over the phone.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I saw him cross the street to get the bus. Poor fellow, once he had to cross the street to make the phone calls, and again he had to cross to go to the bus stop.</p>
