    <title>&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; Guru, one time when I was meditating I suddenly found myself thinking about some friends who needed some help. Mentally I could never describe the power I felt at this time, but I took these friends and lifted them. Two or three days later these friends were helped. Somebody needed a job and he got it and somebody was ill and he got better. Is it related to my experience or was it mere coincidence that they were helped?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, no, no. It was not a coincidence; far from it. It was your own inner being that helped them. When you meditate and enter into your highest consciousness, your soul automatically tries to help your friends. When one enters into a very high, deep realm of consciousness, automatically the power from within comes to the fore and one can help others. Sometimes the friends do not know who has helped them. But your soul knows and their souls know perfectly well that the help has come directly from you. It is not your mental hallucination or ego. No. At that time you became the instrument of the Inner Pilot, the Supreme. The Supreme wanted you to help those people and He actually made you the instrument to help them. It was not coincidence.</p>  </div>
