<p><em>Seko:</em> Thank you.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am sure Mr. Kobayashi will come with you.</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> Mr. Kobayashi is afraid of airplanes. He has never ridden on a plane. He is afraid even to fly to the South island. He goes by train. He would like to take a boat to America.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Like Mahatma Gandhi, he is afraid of planes. Gandhi also used to take trains.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Kobayashi:</em> I have inherited Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have seen you in Japan. Now we would like to see you in America.</p>  </div>
