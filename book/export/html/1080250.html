<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The thing is that if the actor or the actress is sincere enough to follow the spiritual discipline, then he or she is doing the right thing. But if others follow Yoga just because they do, then they are making a mistake. Yoga is not to be pursued just because such and such persons are following Yoga. If somebody feels the necessity of practising the inner life, the spiritual life, then he should go to India or anywhere where there are spiritual Masters.</p>  </div>
