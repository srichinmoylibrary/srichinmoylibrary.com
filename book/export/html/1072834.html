  <h1 class="book-heading">Indifference</h1>
  
 
<p>Indifference reigns supreme in my life.</p>
<p>My body is indifferent to the dynamic urge of my vital. My vital is indifferent to the well-earned rest of my body.</p>
<p>My mind is indifferent to the soulful cry of my heart. My heart is indifferent to the inquisitive quest of my mind.</p>
<p>My soul is indifferent to the slow efforts, slower success and even slower progress of my life.</p>
<p>Even my Beloved Supreme, it seems, is indifferent to my supreme realisation. Had He flooded my entire being with His Concern supreme, I am sure I would not have been waiting for millennia for my realisation.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O my Beloved Supreme, do tell me why You are indifferent to me, and why the rest of the members of my family are indifferent to one another.</p>
<p>"My sweet child, I am not indifferent to you. Dive deep within and you will see that constant Concern is My only name.</p>
<p>"And about your body, vital, mind, heart and soul, I wish to tell you that they can be freed from the fatal disease of indifference only by using the medicine oneness-concern. When oneness-concern plays its role within and without, satisfaction at every moment shall loom large in your life. At that time the indifference-blow will be found nowhere. Only the oneness-flow will be found all-where."</p>  </div>
