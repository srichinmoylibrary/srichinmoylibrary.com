<p>Each of her spiritual children<br /> Thought of her differently,<br /> Spoke of her differently,<br /> Saw her differently,<br /> Loved her differently,<br /> Judged her differently.<br /> To each she represented<br />     Something else.<br /> But one sweet fact they all affirmed:<br /> “To see her is to own her.”</p>
