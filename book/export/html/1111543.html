<p>During our marathon in New Jersey I ran thirteen miles. For the first seven miles I ran at an 8:10 pace. X was running just a little ahead of me. She wasn't looking over her shoulder, but each time I came near her, all of a sudden her speed would increase. Whenever I came only four or five metres behind her, she would hear my footsteps and go faster. But she never looked behind her.</p>
<p>I tell my disciples to surrender, but I myself don't know how to surrender, especially to my girl runner-disciples. Each time I am determined to defeat them badly.</p>
