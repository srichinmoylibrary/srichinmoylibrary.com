  <h1 class="book-heading">&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; How do you feel about the attention that you get? Is that sometimes a hindrance for you?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, because I know that I am not the one who is getting the attention. I know that I am not the doer. If somebody offers me love or admiration, I know that it is my Inner Pilot who is receiving it. I am only an instrument.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> So it is not Sri Chinmoy?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not Sri Chinmoy. It is the One who, according to my receptivity, according to my capacity, is manifesting Himself in and through me. So if you speak highly of me, I know I am not the one who deserves it, I am not the right person. But there is Someone who has given me the capacity to draw your appreciation and that Person deserves the credit, not me. I am not the doer; I am only an instrument, a channel. So if you appreciate me, this appreciation is going directly to the Source and not to me.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> So it is a measure of how successful the Source has been?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, according to my capacity and receptivity. The One who is inspiring me and trying to manifest in and through me I call my Inner Pilot. Your appreciation directly goes to Him.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> You have had this special relationship with God since you were a child?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have been praying and meditating since the age of four. Now I am 57.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> So you have always known?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I came from a religious family and I was fortunate enough to follow in the footsteps of my brothers and sisters.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Well, you have been very gracious to meet with me and I want to thank you very much for taking the time. I wish you well.</p>  </div>
