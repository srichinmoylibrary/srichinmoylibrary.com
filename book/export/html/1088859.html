<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They do come to me for that but only people who believe in God come to me. Stark atheists do not come to me. For them God is something else. The God we speak of is not God for them. But again I have deepest respect for their God. If they say that there is no such thing as God I say all right. As long as they believe in something I feel that that very thing is God for God is omniscient omnipresent and omnipotent.</p>  </div>
