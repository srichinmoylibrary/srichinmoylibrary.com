<p>It is well known that Sir J.C. Bose and Rabindranath were bosom friends. Immense was their intimacy, much was their mutual help. The discoverer of the nervous impulse in plants (for which the Royal Society did him a signal honour) declares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With open palms much have we received from the world; likewise we too through your [Tagore's] hand have offered much to the world at large."</p>
