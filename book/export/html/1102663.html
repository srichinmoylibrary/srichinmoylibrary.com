<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can fulfil the hearts and souls of the children of the world only by becoming the hearts and souls of the children of the world. This means that at every moment we have to be eager to learn something illumining and fulfilling â€” to learn more about truth, light and delight. It is our eagerness to learn that will give us a childlike heart and a childlike soul and enable us to fulfil the hearts and souls of the children of the world.</p>
