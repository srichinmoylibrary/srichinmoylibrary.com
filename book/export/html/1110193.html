<p>President Premadasa is religious to the core. His oneness-heart is the ever-lasting bridge between India and Sri Lanka:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"President Premadasa is a deeply religious man who goes to both Buddhist and Hindu temples and prays with equal veneration. He is very conscious of India's ancient links with Sri Lanka, and he knows that Buddha brought India and Sri Lanka very close to each other. He himself has done a great deal to bring India and Sri Lanka together, and we look forward to his continued leadership."</p>
<p>His Excellency L. L. Mehrotra</p>
<p>High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka</p>
