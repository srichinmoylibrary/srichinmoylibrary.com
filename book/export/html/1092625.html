<p>The Infinite is She. Therefore infinite was my folly to have ventured my pen to set forth her life ever unknowable. But the Mother's Bounty is infinitely more powerful than my error, however grave.</p>
<p>Since the dawn of earth-time the Mother as the Shakti has walked the soil along with her Divine Compeers, the Avatars. Alas, our ignorance paid no heed to her supernal Love and Grace. To the Avatars alone we built our altars. Their Shaktis remained almost concealed, and at times even ignored by humanity. Unnoticed, as it were, they appeared on the scene and unnoticed they disappeared.</p>
<p>But according to our Master, "In her deep and great love for her children she has put on the cloak of this obscurity, condescended to bear the attacks and torturing influences of the Falsehood, borne to pass through the portals of the birth that is a death, taken upon herself the pangs and sorrows and sufferings of the creation, since it seemed that thus alone could it be lifted to the Light and Joy and Truth and eternal Life. This is the great sacrifice called sometimes the sacrifice of the Purusha, but much more deeply the holocaust of the Prakriti, the sacrifice of the Divine Mother."</p>
<p>But this time our Mother, the Mother of the Golden All, has accepted the human cloak at her sweet will with her boundless Power for the full manifestation of the Divine here on earth. Her mission in life is to create a transformed humanity.</p>
<p>She is the sole hope of Nectar-Bliss for those who are burning with an unquenchable thirst for the unique Birth. And She will be crowned with Triumph only when we, her children, cease to be the finite.</p>
