  <h1 class="book-heading">48. In His shadow</h1>
  
 

<p>I wish to live in His shadow.<br /> Why?<br /> Because His heart of deeds<br /> Gets priority<br /> Over His mind of thoughts.</p>
<p>I wish to live in His shadow.<br /> Why?<br /> Because His one single smile<br /> Is fraught with more meaning<br /> Than<br /> All the sermons of the world collected together.</p>
<p>I wish to live in His shadow.<br /> Why?<br /> Because His Silence is the Source<br /> Of my countless freedom-deeds.</p>
