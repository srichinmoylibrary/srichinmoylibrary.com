<p>When I came back to New York, Aushadi was my saviour. At customs I did not have any problem. His friends or colleagues or bosses were so kind, so kind. Everything was faster than the fastest when I dealt with them. They were cutting jokes with me. I had so many unfortunate experiences during my journey back to New York, but this last experience was very good.</p>  </div>
