<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to enter into my inner elevator, you have to develop the power of imagination. Imagination is of paramount importance. Scientists, poets — not to speak of Yogis — have all come to realise that imagination is the precursor of reality. What we call imagination is nothing short of reality in some other plane of consciousness. So when you meditate, try to imagine that I bring for you an inner elevator that climbs up fast, faster, fastest.</p>  </div>
