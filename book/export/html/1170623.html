<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Musically he was developed, but not spiritually. Some souls that at one time were great in the musical world or in some other world have taken incarnation again. When we think of them, we immediately feel that they are in Heaven. But if we use our occult vision, we see that some of them have long ago taken another incarnation. Some of these souls who did something very significant in a previous incarnation are now leading very ordinary lives on earth.</p>  </div>
