<p>Tagore had two or three devoted students who were great artists. His nephew, Abanindranath, was number one. He was the greatest. And he learnt this kind of artwork from the British. The British ruled us, true. But, at the same time, they taught us many, many good things. Another artist’s name was Mukul Dey. His young daughter used to dance. Tagore came to learn that Mukul Dey’s daughter knew how to dance, so he was inspired to introduce dancing at Santiniketan.</p>
<p>In those days, dancing was not viewed favourably. However Tagore was a revolutionary; he could do anything. This little girl danced in public, while some people sang. And the audience was full of appreciation. Unfortunately, Tagore gained quite a few enemies as well because dancing was frowned upon by many people. In the course of time, dancing in India became so popular. In South India, they perform Bharat Natyam dances, which are very, very devotional.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
