<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They go together. It is like two hands clapping: one hand is perfection and the other hand is realisation. If I try to make a sound with one hand, I cannot do so. I need both hands. Again, it is like touching water: your consciousness enters into the water and the water enters into you. Now how can you say which comes first? They go together.</p>  </div>
