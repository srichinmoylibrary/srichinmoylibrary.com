<p>Two or three days ago I was coming back from my one-mile walk. Two old ladies were walking side by side ahead of me. They were going so slowly. Finally, one of them turned around and said, "Why do you have to listen to our conversation?"</p>
<p>They thought I was dying to hear their conversation! I wanted to go past them, but they were blocking my path.</p>
<p>A few moments later they stopped at an intersection to wait for the red light to change. I stopped at least thirty metres away from them because I did not want to be insulted again.</p>
<p>When I was in my own meditative consciousness, at that time I had to get their blessings!</p>
