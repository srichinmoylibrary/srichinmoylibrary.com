<p>I am so proud of myself. An old man was running about fifty metres ahead of me. I said, "I have to prove I am a good runner." Then I went far ahead of him.</p>
<p>After each minute I looked behind to see if he was catching up to me. But no, he was getting even farther behind. When I reached the end of the canal, he was still staggering.</p>
<p>I said, "At least I have one good competitor."</p>
