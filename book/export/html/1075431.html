<p>LET US UNITE OUR POSSESSIONS</p>
<p>Lord, since I am unable<br /> To give up my desiring mind,<br /> Is there any way I can get<br /> Some benefit from this mind?<br /> "Real benefit? No!<br /> Real progress? No!<br /> Take your present mind as unreality.<br /> Then you will get<br /> Whatever you want."</p>
<p>What is real, Lord?<br /> "Daughter, your aspiration is real."<br /> What else is real?<br /> "My Compassion is real."</p>
<p>Lord, what are we supposed<br /> To do with my aspiration<br /> And Your Compassion?<br /> "Daughter, we are supposed<br /> To unite our possessions<br /> So that we can sing the song<br /> Of perfect Perfection<br /> Together."</p>
