<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, but one has to know what religion is. Religion is a code of life that connects each of us with the rest of humanity. If we feel that our life has a special connection with others' lives, then only can we eventually achieve oneness with others. First we have to feel an inner connection; then only can we think of establishing our inseparable oneness with others.</p>
<p>So if you follow a specific religion, then you will feel that you have something in common with others, that you have some inner connection with others. Then, from this connection you have to go deep within in order to establish your inseparable oneness with them. And once you establish your oneness with the rest of the world, naturally you will see inside you and around you brotherhood and love.</p>  </div>
