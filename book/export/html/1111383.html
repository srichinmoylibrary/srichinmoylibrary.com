<p>At four o'clock in the morning, I got inspiration to go run. There was another madcap out at the same time; he was roller-skating. Either he is crazy or I am crazy. He was going up and down the 150th Street hill with his dog. The dog followed and chased him up and down the hill. The skater was going this way and that way, zigzagging all over the road. It was very dangerous.</p>
