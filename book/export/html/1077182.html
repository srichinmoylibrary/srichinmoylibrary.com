<p>When the final hour arrives, no one can deny its call. The oneness-heart of Einstein, which sailed with the Supreme Pilot, knew this. Therefore, he was dead against the use of any artificial treatment to prolong his life. Simple he was, natural he was, spontaneous he was. Any kind of artificiality was always foreign to him. His was a candid life-opening reality and truth-fulfilling divinity that pervaded the entire world. When Einstein was told that surgery might be able to cure his ailment, he only replied, <em>“I do not believe in artificially prolonging life.”</em></p>  </div>
