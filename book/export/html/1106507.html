<p>The first magazine article has come out about my 1,300-lb. lift with both arms. My Bhavani has done this. A British jockey has won the race. Britain has defeated America. She has defeated Agraha and everybody.</p>
<p>It is an excellent article and the title also is very striking: “A Man of God-Strength.” The picture has come out very well.</p>
