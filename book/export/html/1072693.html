<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can share delight with aspiring people because they will value delight. They know that delight is the most important thing in life. Through aspiration and surrender we realise the Highest and at that time are able to share delight with others who are also aspiring. But to share delight with unaspiring people is the height of stupidity, for they do not want delight. We have no right to impose anything on others. Our imposition can never lead others to God-realisation.</p>  </div>
