<p>One morning I saw Snigdha running. She was on one side of the street, and I was on the other side. She stops her watch when she stops running, even when she pauses for a minute at a side street.</p>
<p>Later that day we went to watch a three-mile race. There were many good runners and many bad runners. But the bad runners were many, many more in number.</p>  </div>
