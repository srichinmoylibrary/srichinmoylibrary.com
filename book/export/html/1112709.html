<p>I didn't have to pay the telephone bill, but I did have to pay a penalty to the airline. The price of my ticket had been fifty dollars less because I was on a three-day excursion. When I changed my ticket, I had to pay fifty dollars extra. So twenty-seven dollars I saved, but fifty dollars I lost. Still, I was happy to come home because here at any time I can get heat-at least from the radiator.</p>
<p>In Bermuda it rains only twenty days a year, but one of those days was when I was there!</p>  </div>
