<p>The divine will abides in the inmost recesses of our heart. This divine will tells us that we can do everything provided it is God's Will. Now how is it that the divine will in us can be separated from God's will? The divine will that we have inside us is limited in comparison to God's infinite Will, just because we are still in ignorance. But once we can cast aside the veil of ignorance through aspiration, through constant aspiration, then the divine will within us can respond to the highest infinite Will above, and be fully at one with it.</p>  </div>
