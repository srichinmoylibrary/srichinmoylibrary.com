<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The universal Heart originated in God’s Silence. When God was absolute Silence, inside this Silence something was growing all the time. This was the universal Heart. The universal Heart came into existence before God’s sound-life came into existence. And where is the universal Heart? It is deep inside us, where reality constantly grows.</p>  </div>
