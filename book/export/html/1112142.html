<p>I made calls to four different places: Annam Brahma, my house, Ashrita's house and one more place.</p>
<p>The man behind me was so annoyed. Perhaps he thought I was dialing the same number each time.</p>
<p>He said, "What is the matter with you? Why are you dialing again and again?"</p>
<p>First he had to wait for the injured man to call all his relatives. Then he had to wait for me.</p>
