<p>A husband and wife came to court to get a divorce. The wife said to the judge: “Sir, Your Honourable Sir, he always bothers me. He always calls me, ‘Monkey, Monkey, Monkey!’ And I loathe him for this. Am I a monkey?”</p>
<p>“Why do you call her ‘Monkey'? What right have you to call her ‘Monkey’ all the time? How dare you call her ‘Monkey'!</p>
<p>“Your Honour, pardon me, but would you please allow me to call any monkey my wife?”</p>
<p>“Certainly!”</p>
<p>Then the wife said: “Since, Your Honour, you have fulfilled his wish, will you also fulfil my wish?”</p>
<p>The judge said, “First of all, I have to hear it.”</p>
<p>“Your Honour, can I call a donkey my husband? If I see any donkey in the street, can I call him my husband?”</p>
<p>“Certainly you can.”</p>  </div>
