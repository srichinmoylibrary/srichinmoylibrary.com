<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme is all-Patience and all-Understanding in your life. If you see what He is doing for you and if you are grateful, then naturally that very thing you will want to do for your sweet child. Since you see that someone is doing for you the very thing that you are trying to do for your daughter, only infinitely better, then there is every possibility for you to do the same for your child.</p>  </div>
