<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is very easy to surrender. You have already surrendered to ignorance. You can't say that you have not surrendered to anybody. So you know the art of surrender. You can surrender to the Supreme in the same way that you have surrendered to ignorance. Now you have only to change your master. At every moment you have to feel the need of a new teacher. The new teacher is the Supreme, so try to learn from Him. Somebody has taught you everything wrong; now there is Somebody waiting for you who will teach you everything correctly. The one who has taught you is not the real teacher, but you have surrendered to him for hundreds and thousands of years. Now the same surrender you will have to make to the Supreme, to the new teacher.</p>  </div>
