<p><em>Don Pablo:</em> How can a child make progress if he does not know what he is? His father and mother do not know this. In the school the child does not learn this. And this is what produces the humanity, the bad humanity, we have. This is my idea: the child must know from childhood.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The child must learn from the parents. The parents have to feel also that they have the supreme responsibility. A child is the flower of God, a child is the instrument of God, the representative of God. The parents have to feel this.</p>
<p><em>Don Pablo:</em> But they don't.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is why the problem starts. If they feel that their children are representing God, then all the time the parents will teach this to their children.</p>
<p><em>Don Pablo:</em> That is why I say that the children must know what they are, the miracle that they are, as soon as they understand the sense of the word. This is my idea.</p>  </div>
