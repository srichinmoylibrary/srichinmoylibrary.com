<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, if you go deep within, you can easily know. There are various levels of the mind, starting with the physical mind. We have the intuitive mind, the overmind, the supermind and so forth. So you have to know from which plane you are operating. An ordinary human being does not know, but a spiritual man knows from which plane he is operating. Whenever he does something, he knows whether he is doing it from his physical mind, intuitive mind, higher mind or overmind. So in your case, if you want to act from the intuitive mind, let us say, then by your aspiration you should be able to stay there all the time.</p>  </div>
