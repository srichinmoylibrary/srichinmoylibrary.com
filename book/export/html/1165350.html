<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First, I asked all of you to tell me about your birthday. Then, when I knew your birthday, I put a special concentration on it and immediately entered into the day your soul took a physical body and came into the world. At that time my special blessings entered into the soul. I have the power not only to bless your physical body but to bless your soul also.</p>  </div>
