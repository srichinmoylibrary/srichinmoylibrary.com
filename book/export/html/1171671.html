<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Tennis will never help your running, far from it. But running will help your tennis, specially if it is sprinting. Stretching exercises and speed work definitely will help your tennis. That is what Arthur Ashe does. Again, if you want to play five sets, if you want to become a world champion tennis player, then you need stamina. For that you have to practise long distance running.</p>
<p>Tennis is not going to help your running speed, that is absurd. But if running does not give you joy and tennis gives you joy, then you can play tennis for joy.</p>  </div>
