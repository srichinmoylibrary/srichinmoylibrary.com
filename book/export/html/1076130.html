    <title>Question: Guru, wasn’t that whole idea of the second coming meant to be looked at symbolically and not really as an actual event? In other words, the second coming was the transformation that was to take place within the individual.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you take it that way, it is absolutely true. That should be the attitude, instead of saying that the human form, the human body, will come back again. Why should he come back again as Christ? Why should I have to wear the same dress every day? Why should I have to retain the same personality and individuality? First you come in one form, and then you appear in another form. But your inner soul, your inner capacity, you will maintain.</p>  </div>
