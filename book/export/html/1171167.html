<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The heart means oneness. The heart is something that is always expanding itself by receiving light. The mind, on the other hand, is not receiving light like the heart. Most of the time it is unconsciously limiting and binding itself.</p>
<p>The heart is like a flower. The flower is not only beautiful but also fragrant. As soon as we see a beautiful flower, we get tremendous joy. Then, when we smell its fragrance, our joy increases even more. When we enter into the heart, first we feel its beauty and then we smell its fragrance. That is what the heart is like.</p>  </div>
