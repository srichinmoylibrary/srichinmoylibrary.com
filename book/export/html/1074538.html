<p>We can know what God actually is only through aspiration, not through desire. By desiring day in and day out we will never be able to know what God is or what God looks like. By desiring, we are limiting ourselves. But God is limitless, boundless. Through our aspiration we transcend ourselves, we go beyond ourselves. When we go beyond ourselves, at that time we become what God is. So it is through aspiration that we know what God is and what He looks like.</p>
<p>There is no end to our desires. But there is only one aspiration and it goes up, up, up. It does not fluctuate like desire. The ultimate goal of aspiration is to go to the Beyond, the ever-transcending Beyond. And the ever-transcending Beyond is nothing other than God.</p>  </div>
