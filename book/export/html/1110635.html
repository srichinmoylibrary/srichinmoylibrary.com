  <h1 class="book-heading">Selflessness</h1>
  
 
<p>Selflessness has its true significance only in some higher ideal, higher reality, higher truth. Selflessness has to have an ideal in order to fulfil itself. For the seeker of the ultimate Truth, selflessness means to embrace the ideals of the realised Master, the Guru. The disciple's selflessness is his conscious inner cry for oneness with the Master â€” the Master's ideals and the Master's mission on earth. Total oneness with the Master's ideals is the supremely significant task. If one does not identify with the Master's consciousness, then one can never selflessly serve his ideals. So I wish to tell you that there cam be nothing more important, more significant than selflessness. It is the real prize that God cherishes in your aspiring heart; it is the peerless treasure of the Supreme.</p>  </div>
