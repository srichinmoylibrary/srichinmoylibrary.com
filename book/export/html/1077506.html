<p>Aspiration, in its simplest definition, is a lovely flame climbing Heavenward.</p>
<p>True aspiration can and does make us feel that if God is for us, who can eventually stand against us?</p>
<p>We feel a desire to have God on our side. But we need the aspiration to throw ourselves on God’s side.</p>
<p>Just as the sun is the only remedy for dark clouds in the sky, similarly, there is no other medicine for our troubled hearts than aspiration.</p>
<p>Aspiration is the first rung of the sky-kissing ladder; Realisation is the last.</p>
<p>True human aspiration has three intimate friends: Purification, Quietude and intensity. Aspiration has an enemy called impatience.</p>
<p>Aspiration is the mounting flame of our divine wish to raise ourselves to the crest and crowning of Divine Perfection.</p>
<p>The vital aspires through dynamism.</p>
<p>The mind aspires through self-search.</p>
<p>The heart aspires through the feeling of union.</p>
<p>The soul aspires through the perfection of God’s manifestation.</p>  </div>
