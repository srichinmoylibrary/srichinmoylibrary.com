<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a matter of inner love and an inner bond, like the connection between a mother and son, let us say. Even if the mother lives in India and the son has come to America to study, the mother’s heart is all the time inside the son, and the son’s heart is all the time inside the mother. Even while the son is talking to his professors and colleagues, he can feel his mother’s presence constantly inside his heart. When he sees something beautiful he thinks, “If only my mother could see this, she would be so happy.” If he does well in his studies, and the teacher appreciates him, immediately he thinks, “Oh, how I wish my mother could hear this.” If something goes wrong, he will think, “Where is my mother to ease my sufferings?” His mother is always vivid in his consciousness, because he has established his loving oneness with his mother.</p>
<p>Similarly, you should try to establish that kind of oneness with me in every aspect of your life: in your success, in your failure, in your progress. Any time that you accomplish something or see something that pleases you, immediately you will say, “How I wish Guru were here!” Of course, this is only in your physical consciousness. If you have done something really good, I will feel it in my inner being, and if you have done something really bad, then too, my inner being will know it. But if you want to be conscious of your oneness with me at every moment, then whenever you perform an action, whether it is good or bad, immediately think of me. If it is something good or successful, immediately say to yourself, “Oh, I have got so much! How I would like to share it with my Master!” And if it is a failure or something sad or bad, then immediately say, “How can I bear it all by myself? I need my Master.”</p>
<p>In this way you can invoke and feel my presence at every moment. Think of me as a life-long friend who is always beside you, whether you are in the sun or in the rain. Your spiritual Master is your Eternal Friend.</p>  </div>
