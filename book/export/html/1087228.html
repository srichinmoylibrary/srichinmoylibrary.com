<p>I bought a white coat that cost $165.08. I gave the man at the cash register $166. While he was taking care of me, a young man came up and started talking to him. What keys they press on the cash register, God knows!</p>
<p>When the man left, the cashier gave me back one dollar and some change. I asked him, "Why did you give me the dollar?"</p>
<p>He said, "Why not? That's what the computer says."</p>
<p>I said, "They might fine you."</p>
<p>"They will fire me?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, I said they might fine you."</p>
<p>He said, "The world needs honest people like you. All right, then let me just give you the change."</p>
<p>I said, "You already gave it to me. The change is in my pocket."</p>
<p>When I went to Vinaya's car, I saw that the change he had given me was only 58 cents instead of 92 cents. He had not meant to deceive me; he had wanted to give me more change.</p>
