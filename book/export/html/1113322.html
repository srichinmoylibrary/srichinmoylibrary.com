<p>"In the playground today, as you all know, I shall read out to you about my athletics. It is in Bengali. I hope to give you the English version next time, but that is all. You cannot expect me to read it in other languages as well. For example, I can't present the Chinese version, which can only be appreciated by my Chinese friend. Hushu." The audience burst into roaring laughter.</p>
<p>Everybody greatly enjoyed his talk on athletics. On the way back he said to Yogananda-da: "I hope you enjoyed my article."</p>
<p>Yogananda da said: "Of course. Not only did I enjoy it, but I also learned a great deal!"</p>
<p>Nolini-da said to me: "Chinmoy, I am sure you too liked it."</p>
<p>I said to him: "In my case, I not only like all your writings without exception, but I also learn much from your writings. Each article of yours is like a new illumining dawn to me. How I wish that everything you have written about relaxation could be translated into as many languages as possible!"</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "Ah, I see. That is your headache, since that is your project. Then he added: "I wish to translate a few portions of this article and read them out loud to the Mother."</p>
<p>Both Yogananda-da and I said: "It is an excellent idea. We feel the Mother will deeply appreciate it."</p>  </div>
