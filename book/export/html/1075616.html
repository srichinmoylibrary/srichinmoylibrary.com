<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It <em>is</em> possible to realise God after committing suicide or after being violently killed. But God knows how many incarnations it will take. Only in the case of spiritual Masters is it permissible. Spiritual Masters sometimes commit suicide; they become so disgusted with earth that they consciously and deliberately leave the body before they would have done so in the ordinary course of events. But in their case the Supreme allows it because they have already realised Him and worked very hard for Him.</p>  </div>
