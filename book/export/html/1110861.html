<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a matter of personal opinion. In India they purify the body after death by burning it. They feel that there have been impurities in the body during life, so after death they purify it by burning. Here in the West they bury the body. They feel that since the body has made tremendous sacrifices, it has to offer itself to the earth. In your case, if you feel that by sacrificing your body to medical science you are doing something helpful, then you can do it. But again, if you feel that when you sacrifice your body, some silly doctor will have no concern and respect for it, and will just butcher it in order to gain some experience, then you may not want to do it. It is you who must decide. When you pray and meditate you will be able to know what is the right thing for you to do.</p>  </div>
