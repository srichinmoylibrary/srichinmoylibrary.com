<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your inner being is all light, but your outer self is dark â€” just as a house may be beautiful on the inside while the outside is not at all beautiful. You have to bring your inner light to the fore to illumine your outer darkness. Your inner light is the soul, the true self.</p>  </div>
