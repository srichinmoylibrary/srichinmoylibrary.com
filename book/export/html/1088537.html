  <h1 class="book-heading">Dr. Satyendranath Bose</h1>
  
 
<p>Dr. Satyendranath Bose was a truly immortal name in the scientific world, not only in India but also in various other countries. Some people are great, but they may not have goodness. In his case, however, he was not only great but also extremely good, kind and humble.</p>
<p>Dr. Bose's heart was the heart of a little child. He had a special fondness for children and used to play many games with them. And they, for their part, accepted him as their hero.</p>
<p>Satyen's guru was Einstein. Once, when he was teaching at Dhaka University, he wrote an article on physics which he sent to Einstein. Einstein was so deeply impressed that he translated it into German. The scientific world remembers their immortal friendship in a most significant way. Satyen once wrote something which Einstein improved upon. Thereafter, it was known as the "Bose-Einstein Statistics."</p>  </div>
