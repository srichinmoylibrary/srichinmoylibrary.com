<blockquote>
<p>"Ignorance is vincible. We don't want to know something; that is why we don't know it."</p>
<p>â€” Aldous Huxley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Huxley has said is absolutely right. Ignorance is not something permanent and unchangeable. We can enter into the very breath of ignorance and transform it into wisdom and knowledge. But instead, we deny the existence of the ignorance inside us. This is a mistake. We have to accept the fact that right now we are full of ignorance. That does not mean that we have no light within us. Deep inside there is a little light, but we have to bring this light to the fore and make it grow in order to realise our own highest Truth.</p>  </div>
