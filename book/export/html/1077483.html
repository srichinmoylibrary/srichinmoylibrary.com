  <h1 class="book-heading">Transformation</h1>
  
 
<p>Neither an individual effort nor an individual abnegation can bring about the transformation of your consciousness. This transformation is possible only by the descent of a Higher Light.</p>
<p>To think of physical transformation without having some kind of realisation is to count your chickens before they are hatched.</p>
<p>Surrender has to look up with folded hands. Transformation has to look down with palms facing the earth-consciousness.</p>
<p>The transformation of human nature in its completeness must unavoidably progress at the speed of a tortoise.</p>
<p>Both the descent of Truth into the lower nature and the ascent of the lower nature into the higher Truth are capable of solving the problem of problems, the illumination of human consciousness. They are equally effective and have an equal speed.</p>
<p>Be Universal in your love. You will see the universe to be the picture of your own being.</p>
<p>There is but one Knowledge. There is but one Realisation. You are at once the Seeker and the Fulfiller.</p>
<p>What is liberation? It is the extinction of a divided consciousness in the all-pervading oneness of the Supreme.</p>
<p>What is meant by spiritual perfection? It is the constant capacity to live in God and to reveal Him in oneâ€™s every moment.</p>
<p>In the field of true spirituality, Experience serves as breakfast; Realisation as lunch; Transformation as dinner.</p>  </div>
