<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I know that in your case you work for twelve or fifteen hours every day. You want to minimise your working time because you have other, more important things to do than to be in your office or your studio all the time.</p>
<p>On the practical plane you have to get more workers who will be efficient in running your business. You have to train some people to such an extent that your physical presence is not needed. You not only have to train them, but you also have to have confidence in them. If they make mistakes, you have to forgive them and sympathise with them. If they do something wrong, you have to say, "Perhaps I would also have made that mistake had I been in their place." You have to train them with utmost concern and utmost compassion. If you train these people and show them utmost concern and compassion, and if you have oneness with them, you will easily be able to minimise your working time so that you can do more important things. Meanwhile, those whom you have trained will be able to do the work without your physical presence because they will have your inner guidance.</p>  </div>
