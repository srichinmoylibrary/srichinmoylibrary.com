<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While playing a musical instrument, you have to feel that music has and is the key to unlock the Heart-Door of the Supreme. It is only music that has a free access to the Heart-Door of the Supreme. If you can feel that, then the musician in you will be able to manifest the highest.</p>  </div>
