<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In mineral consciousness there is practically no light and in plant consciousness there is a streak of light. In human consciousness there is or there can be limited light, which again is capable of housing unlimited light. Finally the divine Consciousness embodies boundless, infinite Light.</p>  </div>
