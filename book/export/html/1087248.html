<p>Sometimes when I speak Tamil, it is all wrong, but the owners of one store in Singapore were very pleased with my Tamil.</p>
<p>I wanted to buy something, so I asked, "Can you not reduce the price?"</p>
<p>They said, "Of course we shall reduce it."</p>
<p>They reduced it and I asked, "You won't reduce it any more?"</p>
<p>They said, "Oh, no, no!"</p>
<p>Then an elderly lady, the aunt, said, "If you can say correctly the total price in Tamil, then we shall reduce it more."</p>
<p>I was very happy and I said the price correctly. So when the total figure came, the old lady said to reduce it by three Singapore dollars.</p>
<p>The younger one, who was around 14 or 15 years old, said, "No, Auntie, he speaks Tamil, so please give him a five dollar reduction."</p>
<p>So I got a five dollar reduction by knowing Tamil.</p>
