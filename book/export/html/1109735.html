<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is from one that we go to many. If you can inspire one person, then that person will inspire somebody else. This is the way the world evolves. The Christ was only one individual, but his Light has inspired millions and millions of people. When a spiritual Master inspires his disciples, the disciples inspire quite a few more. In this way his consciousness spreads.</p>
<p>We cannot dream of transforming humanity overnight. It is a slow and steady process. On the earth plane it takes many years to get anything done. It takes quite a few incarnations for spiritual perfection. We have to have infinite patience in order to see a little transformation in human nature. We must not lose hope. Just because our friends and neighbours are not following the spiritual life, we cannot give up. We have to know that there was a time, either in this incarnation or in past incarnations, when we were also like them. Once upon a time we were also unaspiring, unspiritual. But by God's Grace somebody or something on earth inspired us and we became spiritual. We may not be conscious of who actually helped us, but there were people who helped us in our spiritual journey, in our inner awakening.</p>
<p>So, with that idea we shall also try to inspire people. If one person gets inspiration from us, that is enough. Gradually, gradually, the number of seekers will increase. Right now the undivine forces are ruling the world. But a day will come when the divine Light will rule the world. Some people are conscious of the fact that Light exists, while others are not aware of it. Those who do not feel the existence of Light will naturally progress slowly. Those who do believe in Light will advance much faster toward the Goal.</p>  </div>
