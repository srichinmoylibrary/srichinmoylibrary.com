<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each religion must feel that it is nothing but a branch. If there is a branch, then there has to be a tree; and the tree is love of truth. Truth finds fulfilment only when it embraces the Vast as its very own. Each religion has to feel the necessity of embracing other religions for its own satisfaction and perfection. Alone it can never be satisfied; alone it can never be perfect. Only when all the religions join together will they be able to create something beautiful, soulful and fruitful. But when you go deep within, you do not see each religion as something separate. You see only one Reality operating in and through many forms, many ideas, many ideals and many religions.</p>
