    <title>Question: Guru in meditation I seem to reach a certain height or plateau, which I can&#039;t go beyond. There are no thoughts and I don&#039;t have an awareness of my body, yet at the same time I feel I&#039;m not making any progress. What technique can I apply to expand beyond this point?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have made considerable progress in your life of inner search, but unfortunately you have a preconceived notion of inner progress. Do not have any preconceived ideas with regard to progress. You do not have to see, you do not have to feel. Just try to be always one with the soulfulness of your meditation-capacity and your dedication-sincerity. If you can do this, then automatically you will be able to trace, see and feel your progress.</p>  </div>
