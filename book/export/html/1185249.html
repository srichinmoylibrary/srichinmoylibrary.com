<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am not an authority on hypnotism. What I am qualified to talk about is spirituality and Yoga. In Yoga, when you are meditating, you are dealing with consciousness. But when you are hypnotised, you are not conscious. In Yoga you are aspiring; there is an inner mounting flame inside you that wants to climb high, higher, highest to reach the goal of realisation and perfection. In meditation, nobody is forcing you to realise the highest Truth. It is your inner cry that is compelling you to realise the Highest.</p>  </div>
