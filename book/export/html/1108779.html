<h2>Sri Chinmoy’s remarks after receiving the <em>Heart of Gold</em> award</h2>

<p>I bow to the soul, heart and life of Corazón de Oro, the Heart of Gold. I wish to offer gratitude to this august organisation from the inmost recesses of my heart.</p>
<p>I am a man of prayer. For me, music is a true form of prayer. Each song is a beautiful flower with fragrance exquisite.</p>
<p>I am a singer and musician of no consequence. But I have been blessed over the years by Himalayan-height musicians, composers and singers. Today I am extremely happy and extremely grateful to be in the immortal galaxy of Mexican composers. Music is the heart of universal oneness. It is also the language of universal oneness. I do not know Spanish, but I have heard over the years many, many, many Spanish songs, and they have touched the very depth of my gratitude-heart and my music-loving soul.</p>
<p>On the way to Mexico City, in the plane, I composed a song about this great award. With your kind permission, I wish to recite the words:</p>

<p>Corazón de Oro, Corazón de Oro, Corazón de Oro!<br /> O Heart of Gold, O Heart of Gold, O Heart of Gold!<br /> Infinity’s oneness-delight you ever enfold.<br /> Your song-beauty, music-fragrance, treasured by God’s Core.<br /> Your culture-heritage is the summit-pride of the Golden Shore.</p>

<p>I am also very happy to have set to music your motto, “In harmony with the universe.” This motto is a momentous message, a universal message. With harmony we can be true choice and perfect instruments of God. This world of ours is lacking in harmony; therefore, we are suffering. We are suffering excruciating pangs because we have not yet established harmony in our lives. Your message is at once hopeful, illumining and fulfilling.</p>
<p>Finally, to my musical friends, composers and singers, I wish to offer my heart’s prayerful and soulful joy and love. We are sailing in the same boat, and our destination is the Golden Shore. Yours is a heart of gold; our destination is the Golden Shore, where we will have peace, light and bliss. My happiness-heart and my gratitude-life to each of you I am offering prayerfully, soulfully and lovingly.</p>
<p>[Sri Chinmoy’s students perform his song dedicated to Mexico. Sri Chinmoy then plays the esraj, after which his students perform his song <em>In Harmony with the Universe</em>. Sri Chinmoy then teaches the song <em>Corazón de Oro</em> to his disciples, who sing it for the audience.]</p>  </div>
