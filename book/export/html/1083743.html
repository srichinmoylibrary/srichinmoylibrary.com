<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are going to listen to records or tapes, it is always better if you listen to my voice rather than to others' voices. Otherwise, you may listen to other persons' singing and immediately your jealousy will start. But if you hear my voice, it will give you inspiration and aspiration. I am not joking. Somebody does something very well, but just because it is he or she that has done it, you can't appreciate it. Since you can't appreciate it, your aspiration will not go high.</p>  </div>
