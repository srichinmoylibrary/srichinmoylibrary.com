<p>On the way to Flushing Meadow Park today, I was walking toward Main Street. After my 1200-metre mark, a bearded young man in a van saw me as I was waiting for the red light. He had the green light in his favour but he waited, allowing me to cross.</p>
<p>I was looking at him and he was looking at me. Then he said, "Good morning, Sri Chinmoy. It is so nice to see you again."</p>
<p>God knows when I had seen him before!</p>
