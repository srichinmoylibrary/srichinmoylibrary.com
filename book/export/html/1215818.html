<p>Einstein says:<br /> "If my theory of relativity is proven successful,<br /> Germany will claim me as a German and<br /> France will declare that I am a citizen of the world."</p>
<p>The realised soul in me whispers:<br /> "If my God-realisation is proved,<br /> Mother India will claim me<br /> As her very own.<br /> If my God-revelation is proved successful,<br /> Father America will claim me confidently<br /> As his very own.<br /> If my God-manifestation is proved victorious,<br /> My world-sisters and brothers<br /> Will claim me unreservedly<br /> As their very own."</p>
