    <title>Russell Barber: We have another videotape here that shows some of your other efforts at meditation, which we’ll look at now. It’s just amazing the things that you’ve been able to achieve. Here, for example, are some of the paintings that you have done. And we see you here in an archway with some of your 700 books. What are you trying to say to those of us who don’t seem to have this kind of power? Are you trying to give us examples of how, through meditation, we can find God and achieve amazing things with our life?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! Through meditation we can find peace. And once we have peace of mind, impossibility cannot exist for us. Our Lord Supreme will then be able to manifest Himself in and through us all the time, so there will be no such thing as impossibility in our life. If we pray and meditate soulfully, then we can transcend all our barriers — mental and otherwise.</p>  </div>
