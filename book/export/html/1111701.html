<p>At four o'clock this morning we vagabonds went to run. We had planned to run fifteen miles, but in the end we had to be satisfied with seven.</p>
<p>Seven miles a day I ran for five days. Is it a joke? And Union Turnpike has hills!</p>
<p>I have maintained my weight at 138 pounds for so many days! Today I have come down to 136. I have a chart of good runners. Out of twelve runners, only one runner is fat. Eleven are thin.</p>
