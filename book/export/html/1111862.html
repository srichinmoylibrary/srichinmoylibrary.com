<p>Last night I was running slowly near my 700-metre mark. There were five or six boys around 17 or 18 years old watching me. They shouted, "Shrai, Shrai, you are running too fast!"</p>
<p>On the other side of the street I saw Saurjya. Saurjya was running much faster than I was, but those teenage boys didn't say anything to him.</p>
