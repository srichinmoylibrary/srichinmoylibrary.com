<p>True, the world's recent achievements are significant encouragements, but these achievements are shockingly insignificant when we measure them against our quenchless thirst for ultimate achievements. "Never give up, never give up" is the birthless and deathless motto of aspiring humanity. Here the great worshipper of the all-embracing and all-illumining temple of the world tells us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We cannot rest on our laurels. It is of the utmost importance that the positive trends which have recently emerged are strengthened and extended to other issues- some of them of major importance-which still remain unresolved. The present historic moment calls for a firm resolve on the part of all Member States to sustain the momentum for peace, to consolidate the recent improvements in international relations and to expand the areas of agreement on issues of common concern. The climate of conciliation should not be allowed to prove transitory."</p>
