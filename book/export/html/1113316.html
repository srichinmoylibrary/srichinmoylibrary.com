<p>"Chinmoy, my mosquito net is torn in various places. Will you take it to Albert so he can mend it?"</p>
<p>I took it to Albert-da immediately. Albert himself fixed it, though he had many workers under him. Such was his love for Nolini-da.</p>
<p>On my return, Nolini-da said to me: "One thing is done. Now something more: the laces of my shoes are all torn. Can you get me some new ones?"</p>
<p>I went to Harpagon and got a pair of laces from Panu-da. When I came back Nolini-da lovingly said: "Your running speed and working speed are two great rivals." In silence, I offered him my I inmost gratitude.</p>  </div>
