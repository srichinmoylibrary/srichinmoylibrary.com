<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The heart got the vision, not the mind. When a vision comes from the heart, your mind cannot claim it. Just throw the mind away. However, if the mind wants to claim the vision and glorify itself, if it says, "I want to bask in your divine glory," then you can allow the mind to keep the vision.</p>  </div>
