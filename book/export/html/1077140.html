<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are a spiritual person; you have been praying and meditating for several years. So, if you get angry with your mother, naturally your anger will not be so intense. But your mother does not meditate. If she becomes angry with you, her anger will be greater than yours. Again, if a spiritual person has been praying for dynamic power and if his lower vital is not completely purified, then when he becomes angry, his anger will possess tremendous destructive force. So it all depends on the particular situation.</p>  </div>
