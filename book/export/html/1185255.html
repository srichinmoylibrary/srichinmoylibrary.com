<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Early in the morning when the day dawns, one has to feel that God comes first in his life. For a few minutes he has to invoke the Presence of God. The Presence of God is always inside us, but if one feels that God is somewhere else, in the highest Heaven, then that person has to invoke His Presence. Again, if one feels that God is already within him but He is so deep that the seeker is unable to feel His Presence, then that particular seeker must pray to God to come to the fore. So either he has to bring God into his living consciousness through invocation or he has to bring God’s Presence to the fore.</p>
<p>Then, when he feels God’s Presence during his meditation, when he feels God’s infinite Power and infinite Light, at that time he feels that his life is secure. Suppose a friend visits you for a few minutes and then leaves. Even when he leaves, still his presence remains — the memory of how he talked and smiled. Similarly, God’s Presence for ten or fifteen minutes will remain with you during the whole day amidst your multifarious activities. Your reminiscences about a friend remain for many months, many years. Similarly, the memory of God’s Presence — even for a few minutes — remains in you for hours, days, months, years. If you meditate every day and feel God’s Presence for just ten minutes, that is more than enough for you to have peace of mind, joy, bliss, amidst the hustle and bustle of life. If you remember how you felt during meditation in the morning, then that is enough for you to be protected by God during the whole day.</p>  </div>
