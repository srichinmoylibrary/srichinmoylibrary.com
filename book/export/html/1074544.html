<p>Desire is that which binds us. It wants to possess and be possessed. When we desire, we cry for one hundred, two hundred, three hundred things. When we aspire, at that time we don’t want to possess and we don’t want to be possessed. Inside us there is something which is boundless, limitless, infinite. When we aspire, we want to enter into that very thing within us which is boundless. We want only to become part and parcel of Him who is infinite. So desire is something that is going to bind us, whereas aspiration is something that throws us consciously into the sea of infinity.</p>
<p>Aspiration and desire are two different things. We cannot satisfy our desires. We can only change the object of our desires.</p>
<p>Today I would like another car and tomorrow I would like another house. If I am frustrated, if I am not fulfilled in a particular desire, then tomorrow I will have some other desire. Desires are constantly being changed. One moment we think of our aspiration and the next moment we think of our desire. If we get an opportunity to fulfil ourselves through desire, we don’t hesitate. Again, when aspiration enters into us, we try to fulfil ourselves through aspiration. One time we take poison and the next time we take nectar. But we have to know that poison will destroy us, whereas nectar will fulfil us. Let us drink only the nectar of aspiration.</p>  </div>
