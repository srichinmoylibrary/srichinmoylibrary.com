<p>In the five-mile race I was very bad. I was telling Gangadhar to defeat Snigdha, his wife's best friend. But Gangadhar just raised his arms and surrendered. Of course, it was the human in me that told him to defeat her; the divine in me always wants whoever deserves it to win.</p>
<p>Gangadhar is a man. What was he doing behind Snigdha? When I encouraged him, the distance between him and Snigdha became even wider. The moment I told him to defeat her, Snigdha started going faster.</p>
<p>Later I saw Snighdha in her car quite happy and cheerful. I thought that definitely she had defeated Gangadhar. Then I found out that he had defeated her by one second.</p>
