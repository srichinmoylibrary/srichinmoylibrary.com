<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not only do they have the capacity to help humanity, but they <em>do</em> help, provided people believe in their existence. They help humanity mostly through inspiration. The inspiration that they offer is not received by the mind, but by the life-energy, during the inhalation and exhalation of the aspiring breath. Again, there are destructive beings, but you are not speaking of the destructive beings.</p>  </div>
