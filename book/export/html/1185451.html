<p><em>Caller:</em> When I choose a particular Guru, should I look at him as a person or should I try to see him as just a pure channel of God?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have a teacher, then it is best for you to look at the teacher as a channel, as an instrument of God. You are an instrument of God and your teacher is also an instrument of God. But the difference is that the teacher has become a conscious instrument of God whereas right now you are an unconscious instrument of God. So by listening to the teacher, you will eventually become a conscious instrument of God, as the teacher is right now.</p>  </div>
