<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We don't surrender our identity; we only surrender our limited, earth-bound individuality, the individuality that binds us, that says 'I and mine,' instead of 'we.' What we do is develop our conscious identity with God and God's Will, in order to achieve an inseparable oneness with Him. At that time we do not worry about losing our puny human individuality, for we gain God's infinite vastness in its place.</p>  </div>
