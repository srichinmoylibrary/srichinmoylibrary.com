  <h1 class="book-heading">Lakhan Mehrotra</h1>
  
 
<p>To our extreme delight, a great author and good ancient history lover, a lover of India's traditional art and of world art, a distributor of the Vedic and Upanishadic lore to the world at large, a promoter of Indian culture throughout the length and breadth of the world, and an unreserved inspirer of perfection within and perfection without is Lakhan Mehrotra. Yours is the life of bounty, lofty and free. Yours is the soulful seed and fruitful tree.</p>
<p>While walking along Eternity's Road, Lakhan Mehrotra, the pilgrim-soul, is offering lovingly and breathlessly his heart's birthless and deathless goodness-fragrance to each and every human being on earth.</p>  </div>
