<p>I was running about half a block from the house in Hawaii. All of a sudden a car went against the light, made a wrong turn â€” everything. He ran into me and I just fell down. But I was so lucky. One foot away there was a pole, and I fell against it. Otherwise, my whole head would have been smashed.</p>
<p>At that time, I did not think license number. The accident seemed like nothing. But when the shock was over, about two minutes afterwards, I could not see anything."</p>
