    <title>Question: Are the people who come to these sessions people who really need to be there, people whose attitudes need to change and will change, or are they people who would normally came because they are good people and have been seeking the inner road already?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here I must say that people come to spiritual gatherings when they have made some inner progress and they are already ready to lead a better life, a more progressive, more illumining and more fulfilling life. They have felt and seen considerable progress in their own lives, therefore they know that progress exists, and they are trying to make more progress in their day-to-day lives.</p>  </div>
