<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you look at me, my consciousness registers in your physical world. If you don't look at me, often you fall fast asleep and enter into the dream world. There you do something but you can't account for it. During conscious meditation, if you receive, then the mind is convinced and you feel something very sublime. When you dream, you get something but because its existence is in the inner world, you don't value it. I insist that people look at me from time to time because then my being registers in the mind. If you see the source, you know you are getting something. Otherwise, if you stand with your eyes closed in front of the ocean, you don't see or feel that you are receiving anything.</p>  </div>
