<p>Slowly Nolini petal on petal grows<br />     At the Feet of his Master Divine.<br /> On him the Fount of moon-gold Vision flows;<br />     Through aeons its splendours shall shine.</p>
<p>He spreads in hush the Mother's nectar Light.<br />     In secret through the days<br /> He bears the tears and smiles of our yearning's flight<br />     To the Mother's earth-humble Grace.</p>
<p>With the crescent souls a child of lucid thrill —<br />     They barter with his heart their bliss.<br /> He lulls to sleep his mind's volcano-will<br />     In his eyes' unchanging peace.</p>
<p>Expunged is Ignorance-dream from his Ideal vast.<br />     Through the pen he bares his Soul.<br /> He reaps the golden fruit of his tireless past;<br />     Now within grasp his Goal!</p>
