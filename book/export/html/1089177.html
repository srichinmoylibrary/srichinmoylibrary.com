<p>How many are running the marathon tomorrow? Are you also running?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Most of my students will run tomorrow. Unfortunately, I am having problems with my knees so I will not be able to run the marathon. Is it your left ankle that is injured?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> The sole of my right foot has been injured for five months.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> So for five months you have not been practising?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> Very little. Only jogging.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is getting better now?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> It is a little better; there is a little progress. Next year I would like to go to Chicago to run the marathon.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Chicago and New York marathons are practically in the same month.</p>  </div>
