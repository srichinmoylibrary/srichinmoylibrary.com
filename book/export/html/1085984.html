<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no essential difference between sound and silence provided they are the divine Sound and the divine Silence. The divine Sound is God-manifestation and the divine Silence is God-realisation. God in His highest Height is Silence. God in His universal Form is Sound. So if we are speaking of the divine, then we have to know there is no difference; it is like the obverse and the reverse of the same coin. But if it is all false silence and false sound, then it is only the song of self-deception.</p>  </div>
