<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your inner beings, your aspiration and the entire universe inside your spiritual heart determine what you dream. But if your aspiring heart is not big enough for you to identify with the universal Consciousness, then you will feel that things are coming from the outside. Your aspiring heart can be made bigger only through aspiration. There comes a time when the aspiring heart becomes one with another Heart, which is flooded with Light and Delight. That Heart holds even the universal Consciousness. It is this Heart that determines all dreams from the most significant to the most insignificant.</p>  </div>
