<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the beginning it is necessary. When one becomes a very advanced seeker it is not necessary. At that time one can do excellent meditation at any moment â€” while lying down, while running, while jumping. When one is advanced, one does not have to maintain any particular posture. But in the beginning, it is much better for the proper circulation of the breath to sit with the spine erect. Once your consciousness goes far beyond the domain of the mind, it will not be necessary. Once you can go beyond the confusion of the mental world, you can take any posture. You can meditate anywhere and any way you want to. But, in the beginning, it is really advisable to sit with your spine erect.</p>  </div>
