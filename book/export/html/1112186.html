<p>The other day I was telling you that I saw a tall, thin, black girl running on 150th Street early in the morning. Her outfit was very flamboyant. She was very happy to see me. During our Wednesday night meditation at PS 86, I was so surprised and happy to see that this same girl came up to meditate with the seekers.</p>
