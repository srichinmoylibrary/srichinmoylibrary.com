 <p>
SCA 230-232. Sri Chinmoy answered three questions during a special programme at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. on 21 July 1995.</p>
<h2>Question: How can we help bring peace into our own lives and into the lives of others?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can be of help to ourselves and to others only when we feel the necessity of praying and meditating every day. We have to feel that there is Someone who is always eager to make us happy and to show us the way to serve our brothers and sisters of the world. But we have to pray and meditate to get His inner Guidance. It is from within that we have to get the message of light, and only then will we be in a position to offer this message to the world at large.</p>
<p>Every day, preferably at a fixed hour early in the morning, we have to pray and meditate. Then one day we are bound to get illumination, and this illumination will transform our lives. Spiritual books can help us to some extent, but if we want to be good or perfect instruments of our Inner Pilot so that we can make not only ourselves but also other human beings happy, then we must look to our inner life. In that inner life we will find the answers to all our outer questions.</p>  </div>
