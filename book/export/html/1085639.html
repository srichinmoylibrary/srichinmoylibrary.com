<h2>Editor's note</h2>

<p><em>While he was in Malaysia for three months from mid-November 2005 to 25 February 2006, Sri Chinmoy meditated twice a day in private with his dearest Ongkar. From 24 December onwards, every morning Sri Chinmoy offered Ongkar his own prayer, which Ongkar would recite out loud during their meditation together. Ongkar left this world on 28 February 2006.</em></p>  </div>
