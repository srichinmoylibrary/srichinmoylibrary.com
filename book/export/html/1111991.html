<p>Avery informs me every day about the six-day race in England.</p>
<p>One runner, an Englishman, was leading right from the beginning. At one point he said, "Now I am going to speak to Sri." Then he left the track and for five minutes he looked at my picture. He is not a disciple.</p>
<p>The person who is third also looks at my transcendental picture every time he comes near it.</p>
<p>One man tells Avery every day to say hello to me, and another runner was appreciating our races. Beverly Nolan and Bob Cannata were wearing our T-shirts right from the beginning.</p>
<p>Avery is helping all of the runners — not only Trishul. Our London disciples come every day also, to inspire the runners. If there is inspiration, there will be aspiration; and if there is aspiration, there is bound to be manifestation.</p>
