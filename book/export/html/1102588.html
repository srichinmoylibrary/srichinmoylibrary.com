<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can get rid of your expectation by realising that expectation ends in frustration. So do not expect anything; just do the needful. Then you will get infinitely more than you expected. If you follow the path of expectation, then at each moment you will want something more. But if you do not expect anything and only do what you are commanded to do from within, then you will be fulfilled beyond your imagination.</p>
