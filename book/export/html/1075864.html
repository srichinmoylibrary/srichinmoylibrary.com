<p><em>As a prayerful offering on the occasion of the Birth Centenary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on 23rd January 1997, and the forthcoming 50th Anniversary of India's Independence that same year, Sri Chinmoy wrote a book entitled</em> Mother, Your 50th Independence-Anniversary! I Am Come. Ever in Your Eternity's Cries and Your Infinity's Smiles, Subhas. <em>Chapter four of this book is devoted to the relationship between Subhas Chandra and Chitta Ranjan. Subhas accepted Deshabandhu as his political Guru.</em></p>  </div>
