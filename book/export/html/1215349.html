<p>After seeing Nemi, I made a right turn and I was coming towards Sulochana's and Pramoda's area. Behind me, I was hearing somebody's heavy footsteps approaching. I did not know who it was, but right in front of me, I was seeing Sandhani's soul. I was blessing the soul, but who was behind me I did not know.</p>
<p>Then, while I was blessing the soul, I saw that Sandhani was passing me on my left side. His soul was right in front of me, and he was passing me, but he did not greet me and I did not greet him. He went about 100 metres and then turned into his driveway. I am certain that it was Sandhani. I was getting the same vibration from the soul.</p>
<p>When I asked Snigdha if Sandhani went out to run this morning, she said he never runs early in the morning. He always runs in the evening. But I saw him quite clearly! Then I asked Sandhani and he said he did go out early this morning. So it was proved. Then I asked him if he had seen me and he said no. That explains why he did not stop and greet me. He just passed by on my left side and then made a right turn into the driveway.</p>
