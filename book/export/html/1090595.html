<p><em>[Matsyendranath is seated amidst great luxury, surrounded by beautiful girls. Some of the girls are dancing.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: How can this be? My Master is of the highest order. Perhaps my vision is wrong. Let me concentrate again.</p>
<p><em>[Gorakshanath concentrates.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: My Master has fallen! He is surrounded by so many beautiful girls, all singing and dancing. He is enjoying all kinds of vital life. I must save him! I will transport myself to this spot occultly.</p>
<p><em>[Gorakshanath approaches the group but is stopped by the gatekeeper.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: I wish to speak with that man. He is my Guru. He is Matsyendranath of Kaul. I must see him.</p>
<p>GATEKEEPER: Matsyendranath, Your Guru? Is that the renowned Matsyendranath of Kaul? He has fallen! What he was and what he has become now! He has fallen to such an extent that I cannot believe my ears when you tell me that this is Matsyendranath.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: I must rescue him immediately!</p>
<p>GATEKEEPER: If you can rescue him from this place, you will be extremely lucky. This is Mayapuri, the Illusion-City. Once a person enters here it is most difficult for him to leave again.</p>
<p><em>[Gorakshanath tries to approach Matsyendranath, but the dancing girls will not let him near.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: It seems I shall have to use my occult power to make myself into a beautiful girl, or I will never get near my Master.</p>
<p><em>[Exit Gorakshanath and re-enter as a beautiful girl. Matsyendranath does not recognise him.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, what are you doing here? What kind of life are you leading? You are a God-realised soul. What are you doing here enjoying vital life?</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Oh! I am fallen, I am fallen! I am fallen to such an extent! Now save me!</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: I shall use my occult power and take you away from here.</p>  </div>
