<p>Today I was walking near my house when Radha, the little girl who lives on my block, saw me. Even if she sees me ten times during the day, every time she has to say something to me. This time she said, "Guru, Guru, please wait! You have to give me the book with the story you have written about me!"</p>
<p>I said, "Tomorrow I will give it to you."</p>
<p>She said, "What time tomorrow?"</p>
<p>I said, "Tomorrow, anytime."</p>
<p>She said, "No, please give me a time."</p>
<p>Then I said, "Then come tomorrow at four o'clock."</p>
<p>I totally forgot that tomorrow we will be having our own annual Masters Games, and I will be away all day.</p>
