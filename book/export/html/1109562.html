<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You know that coffee and tea are slow poison. They just take a little longer time to kill you. So if you take coffee and tea, you have to be careful. Then again, you may have some power to hold off their bad effects. And if it is very slow poison and if your body fights against it, then you may win the battle. But you must not drink coffee and tea unless you are certain of your power to fight against this so-called poison. You say that sometimes you feel drowsy and you feel that it is perilous to drive in that condition. Why should only coffee or tea come to the rescue in your life? I have spoken before about other ways to awaken yourself, spiritual ways. Please try other ways.</p>  </div>
