<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You may not immediately recognise that I am your Master because of fear or doubt, but gradually you will feel joy. Your inner joy will grow like a muscle and become very strong. The Master is someone who has tremendous love. It is the Master’s love that is transformed into joy in the disciple’s heart. So when you feel joy, tremendous joy, from being with a spiritual Master, please feel that that person is your true Master. When there is strong faith in the seeker’s own life, then the Master’s presence immediately convinces the seeker that he is the true Master. Also, the moment you get your Master, you become a spiritual child; you act like a divine child. This is another way that you will know.</p>  </div>
