<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. There are two roads. They do not cross. Descent has one road; ascent has another road. They are not like a two-lane highway. If, while descending, the soul is stationary at one particular place, then it can happen, but usually it does not. While there is movement — one soul is descending, another soul is ascending — it does not happen.</p>  </div>
