<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, opportunity is a gift: it is a grace. But this opportunity can be a real obstacle if it is misused badly. To have money, to have material wealth, is to have a great opportunity in serving the poor. But if you misuse the money-power, the opportunity you had now stands as an obstacle to your realisation of Truth and Light. Therefore, you must always try to use all your opportunities devotedly and wisely.</p>  </div>
