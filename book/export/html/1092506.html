<p><em>(The prison. Enter the King, Minister and Guru. The King and his Guru both have their signs on.)</em></p>
<p>KING: I have come here to set you free. Now, have you anything to say? Whatever you do, I shall gladly accept.</p>
<p><em>(The Master places his right hand on the King's head and his left hand on his disciple's head.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER <em>(to the King):</em> My blessing illumines you. <em>(To his disciple.)</em> My blessing forgives you and liberates you.</p>  </div>
