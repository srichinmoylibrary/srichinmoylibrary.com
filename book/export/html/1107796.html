<h2>My Lord Supreme</h2>

<p>My Lord Supreme does not want to know what I have done for Him. He just wants to know how I am. I tell Him that I am perfectly all right and perfectly happy. Immediately He becomes exceedingly happy. He tells me that my happiness is everything to Him. When I am happy, He does not need anything else from me; I have given Him everything.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme does not want to know if I see anything in Him. He just wants me to dive deep within: and if I see anything sweet, pure and divine in the inmost recesses of my heart, then that is more than enough to Him. He tells me that if I can see anything divine in the depth of my own heart, then I have seen everything inside Him. I have seen His illumining Vision and fulfilling Reality.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme does not want to know how much I know. He just wants me to become His oneness-companion. He tells me that if I become inseparably one with His Compassion-Light and Satisfaction-Delight, then immediately I shall know everything.</p>
<p>At that time, the past, present and future will open their doors to me.My Lord Supreme does not want me to prove to Him how much I love Him. He just tells me to cry inwardly and soulfully and to smile outwardly and unreservedly. My inner cry and my outer smile are more than enough to inundate His Divinity within and His Divinity without with my love.</p>
