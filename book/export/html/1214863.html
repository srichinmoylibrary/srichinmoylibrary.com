<p>What is aspiration? Aspiration is speed.</p>
<p>What is aspiration? Aspiration is the fastest speed.</p>
<p>What is aspiration? Aspiration is Eternity’s fastest speed.</p>
<p>What is aspiration? Aspiration is Eternity’s fastest speed-communion between man and God.</p>
<p>What is aspiration? Aspiration is silence-vision. It is God the Supreme Beloved’s Silence-Vision.</p>
<p>What is aspiration? Aspiration is sound-mission. It is God the Supreme Lover’s Sound-Mission.</p>
<p>What is aspiration? Aspiration is the crying man’s duty. Aspiration is the smiling God’s Beauty. Aspiration is God’s constant declaration of man’s capacity. Aspiration is man’s conscious necessity of God’s real Reality within and without him.</p>
<p>Aspiration is not and cannot be the destination. Aspiration is the eternal journey. It is man’s eternal journey to self-transcendence in the soul-light of perfection.</p>
<p>Aspiration is God’s eternal journey of supreme manifestation in the satisfaction-heart of His transcendental Height, universal Length and unfathomable Depth.</p>
<p>With aspiration God started His journey. With aspiration He asks His children, His creation, to continue the journey.</p>
