<p>Today I bought a little clock for $20. It had only one battery, which was smaller than the smallest. The man at the counter said to me, "Are you ready to pay an extra 50 cents for the battery?"</p>
<p>Then the man's wife came up and scolded him. "What are you doing?" she said. So I got the battery free.</p>
