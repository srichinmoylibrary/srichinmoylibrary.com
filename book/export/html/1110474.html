<blockquote>
<p>“Santiniketan is India.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This high tribute was paid to Tagore not by an insignificant human being, but by the father of the Nation, Gandhi-ji. And our Prime Minister<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> went the length of saying that “he who has not visited Santiniketan has not seen India.”</p>
<p>Although many have worked and many will continue to work for Santiniketan, we can safely say that Santiniketan is a one-man University. Viswabharati is surely an invitation to the remotest corner of the world. It is a cheerful sacrifice to attain to the all-fulfilling truth of mankind. Now let us quote Tagore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It has been my steadfast endeavour, that the boys of my Santiniketan school should acquire a true vision of the history of humanity as a whole, broad and untainted with our race-hatred.”</p>
<p><em>Modern Review</em> December 1917</p>
