<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Today it is from pure negligence. I came here today an hour before my talk and I went to buy some books in spite of knowing that I was catching cold. If I had been careful to be more warmly dressed, then I would not have caught cold. But, I donâ€™t take this cold as punishment or suffering. I take it as an experience. I did something; now I am getting the result of my action.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I am sick, it is not negligence. Sometimes I take diseases from the wrong forces of my disciples. I know the way to throw these diseases into the universal Consciousness, but usually I do not do it immediately because it is better for my disciples to see and feel what kind of suffering they are causing me by cherishing so many wrong movements. But an hour ago I did something wrong, so why should I fight when the result comes to me. Since I allowed myself to catch a cold in a natural way, let it be cured in a natural way.</p>  </div>
