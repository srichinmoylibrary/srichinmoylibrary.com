    <title>&lt;em&gt;Governor Takada:&lt;/em&gt; I am very impressed with your words, and I agree with your opinion that suffering and disaster can offer a new promise. I have made many efforts with the citizens of Nagasaki to recover from the disaster and bring Nagasaki to its present condition. I have a great desire for Nagasaki to be the last place in the world to suffer such a disaster again.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes when you suffer, you learn to value the highest goal. It is not that suffering is necessary, but sometimes when you suffer, you learn to appreciate and value the highest goal more than otherwise. If you have to climb the Himalayas, then you will truly appreciate their height and value attaining the summit. But if you just take a plane and fly above the Himalayas, you do not get the same intensity. When Hillary and Tenzing climbed, what suffering they had! But from their achievement the world got new determination, new inspiration to do something especially great.</p>
<p>The whole world needs peace. But if one goes through the suffering of war, only then does one truly value the supreme necessity for peace.</p>  </div>
