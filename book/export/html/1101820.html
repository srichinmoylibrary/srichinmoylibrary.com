<p>My Lord,<br /> When I do anything wrong,<br /> You immediately scold me<br /> Ruthlessly.<br /> But when I do many things right-<br /> I mean, most satisfactorily-<br /> You do not say even one word<br /> Of appreciation.<br /> Is it fair?<br /> "My child,<br /> When you do things<br /> To My great Satisfaction,<br /> I am all admiration for you.<br /> But, alas, your giant pride<br /> Does not understand My language.<br /> What is worse, it deafens<br /> Your two long and beautiful ears.<br /> "My child,<br /> At that time you should sympathise<br /> With Me,<br /> Instead of finding fault with Me.<br /> "My child,<br /> I do hope<br /> I have defended My case<br /> Most honourably<br /> And most satisfactorily."<br /> My Lord,<br /> In that case,<br /> I am terribly sorry for You.<br /> Or, should I say,<br /> I surrender completely<br /> And unconditionally<br /> To Your inscrutable Cleverness.</p>
