<p>We now know that the soul does not make any demands. When the ego makes a demand, it is all self-centred â€” "I", "me", "mine." The ego wants to possess and be possessed. By feeding the outer personality, the ego wants to fulfil itself. But this is simply impossible, as there is no end to its cravings. When the soul wants to have something, it is not for its own personal benefit but for the fulfilment of the Divine. The ego eventually meets with frustration, whereas the soul, by fulfilling the Divine Will, realises its own absolute fulfilment.</p>  </div>
