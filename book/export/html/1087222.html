<p>On my first piano anniversary, X blessed me with a cake, and Y also blessed me with a cake. Then I went to a store to get three more cakes.</p>
<p>The lady asked, "The cakes are for whom?"</p>
<p>I answered, "They are for me, because I play the piano."</p>
<p>She asked, "When are you going to play at Carnegie Hall?"</p>
<p>I said, "I have already played there."</p>
<p>She did not believe me.</p>
<p>Then I said that I have also played at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Sydney Opera House. In the beginning she did not believe me at all. After I mentioned five or six places, maybe she believed me. Or perhaps she herself had never heard of those places!</p>
