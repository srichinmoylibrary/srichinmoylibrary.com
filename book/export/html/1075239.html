<p>WHY DID HE FAIL?</p>
<p>He failed to reach his Goal.<br /> Why?<br /> Because he did not know<br /> That such a thing existed.</p>
<p>He failed to reach his Goal.<br /> Why?<br /> Because he never cared for it,<br /> Even unconsciously.</p>
<p>He failed to reach his Goal.<br /> Why?<br /> Because he forgot<br /> To stretch out his hand.</p>
