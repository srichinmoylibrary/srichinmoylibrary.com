<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When God was born, He did not have a B.A. or an M.A. Did Jesus Christ have a degree? Did Sri Ramakrishna have a degree? Did Lord Buddha have a degree? Did Sri Krishna have a degree? Does Sri Chinmoy have a degree? No. Yet professors and big shots come to spiritual Masters because we have got just one degree: we love God. Once you have got your "Master's degree," once you have this long tail, it is very hard to cut it off.</p>  </div>
