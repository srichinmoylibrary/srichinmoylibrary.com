<p>I composed a song for Malcolm while I was in Europe this time. As soon as people think of Malcolm, they laugh. But he has a very good soul and I am really pleased with his exemplary dedication. I wanted to make him happy, so I composed a song.</p>
<p>The children in our London Centre are better singers than the children in America. They learned so many songs and performed them extremely well. They also performed excellent plays.</p>
<p>One boy, in a play, recited the Sanskrit for "The Soul cannot be won by the weakling": "<em>Nayam atma balahinena labhyo</em>." Then, instead of singing that song, he sang instead "<em>Tomai dite</em>." I said, "Wonderful!" I called him down from the stage after the play and set tune to the Sanskrit words. I taught the song to him, and then all the children learned it.</p>  </div>
