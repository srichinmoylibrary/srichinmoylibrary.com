<p>I still can't believe that in Puerto Rico I recently walked and ran a divine twenty-seven miles!</p>
<p>The first five miles I ran and the second five miles I walked and ran. Like this I continued, and finally it became twenty-seven miles.</p>
<p>Even from the first mile I was literally dying. My whole body was swimming in perspiration.</p>
