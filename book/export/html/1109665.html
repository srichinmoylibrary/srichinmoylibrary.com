<p>When we have dynamic energy, easily we can conquer sleep. Divine manifestation needs constant movement. We have to feel inside ourselves a flowing river of dynamic energy and dynamic light. Then we have to feel that we have become that river and we are continually moving toward the sea, which is our goal. We are in the process of continuous movement — running forward, climbing upward, diving inward toward our goal. When we feel this, then we cannot be attacked by lethargy or sleep.</p>  </div>
