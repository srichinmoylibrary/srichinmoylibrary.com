<p>I was walking and running around 6:15 this morning. Some people who had crossed to the other side of the street came back when they saw me to say, "Good morning!"</p>
<p>Then I saw a black man on a bicycle. He was so excited to see me that he started screaming, "Sri Chinmoy, Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>How do these people know me? I was wearing a hat that practically covered my head, and it was early in the morning. Databir was following me in his car, and he was wondering why the man was screaming.</p>
