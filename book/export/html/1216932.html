<p>Always I have experiences with children on planes! When I was flying to California for our Peace Concert, one little boy was bothering me like anything on the plane. He was absolutely jumping and jumping, and two times he fell on me. I was so afraid he would get hurt.</p>
<p>His mother tried to take off his shoes, but he didn't want to take them off. Then so many times he kicked me!</p>
<p>What can you do?</p>
