<p>When we got to the market, I said to myself, “Before I buy a few saris or God knows what, the best thing is for me to buy a small bag so that I can keep my stuff inside it.”</p>
<p>I found a big bag for 25 rupees, which is less than a dollar. I bought the bag. While they were wrapping it, out of the blue the Florida lady came! I am “Ghose,” but my ghost was chasing me. She came and stood in front of me. This time I could not bring myself to say anything. I do not remember whether I laughed at her or smiled at her. In the end, I just went away and entered into the main market. Perhaps she could see that I was very angry and, for once, she did not follow me.</p>  </div>
