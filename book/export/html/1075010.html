<p>He says<br /> He is a self-made man.<br /> I pity him.<br /> I feel sorry for him.<br /> I accept his apology,<br /> Immediately.</p>
<p>He says<br /> He is a self-made man.<br /> I hate him.<br /> I hate his haughtiness.<br /> I trust not his insincere claim.<br /> I discard his meaningless life<br /> With its useless achievements,<br /> Immediately.</p>
