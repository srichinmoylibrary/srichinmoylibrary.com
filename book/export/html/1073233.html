<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The subtle body, which looks and acts exactly like the physical body and can be perceived by others, can appear at one place while the physical body is at another. We leave the physical behind, and with the soulâ€™s light we give form to the subtle physical at any place we want. The things that the soul can accomplish in a fraction of a second will take twenty years if we have to do them in an ordinary earthly way.</p>
<p>But while the soul and the subtle physical are outside the gross physical, the body must not be touched or disturbed in any way. If it is, it loses its purity and divinity, and decay begins immediately. Then the soul finds it very difficult to return. Even under excellent conditions, the soul must return to the body before 11 or 13 hours, or it will find the door closed.</p>  </div>
