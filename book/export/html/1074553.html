<p>In my travels to Europe I have been to many places, and I have noticed aspiration in all the places I have visited. In some places naturally I have observed more aspiration than in other places. Each place has aspiration. But when it is a matter of manifestation on the outer plane, at one place the inner message is properly received and at another place it is nowhere to be found. There are other differences as well. For example, in one city I have seen tremendous determination even in the people who are not aspiring, not spiritually conscious. There is tremendous determination on the physical plane and on the vital plane. In another city, in spite of aspiration on the inner plane, there is tremendous outer chaos, uneasiness, uncertainty. In some fortunate cities we can see that the people invoke light psychically, through the inner heart. There are other places that invoke spiritual light more through the mind than through the heart. They are invoking light, praying, meditating, but through the mind. Again, there are also places where the people invoke light through the aspiring and dynamic vital and the physical. But there are one or two places where there is tremendous turmoil and revolution on the outer plane. Aspiration is there, but on the outer plane there is tremendous confusion. So if you want to make a comparison, these are the kinds of differences. These differences we observe on the outer plane, but on the inner plane each country and each city is aspiring according to its capacity.</p>
<p>When it is a matter of aspiration, I definitely can say that the world is aspiring more and more. On the outer plane we see quarrelling, fighting and war, so we may think that the world is not progressing. But on the inner plane, since I last visited these places, I see that they now have more aspiration and more determination.</p>  </div>
