<p>There you are with a private plane. That was done out here in Suffolk County in East Moriches. The <em>Newsday</em> story where I read about it showed pictures as well. I think thatâ€™s better than 3,600 pounds.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is a regular plane. The next one is a seaplane. It is heavier.</p>  </div>
