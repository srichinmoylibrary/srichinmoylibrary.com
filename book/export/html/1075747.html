<p><em>(Lunch. Aurobindo, Ramesh Dutta and Dinendra Kumar. Keshta serves them.)</em></p>
<p>RAMESH: Mr. Ghosh, does your cook serve you with such dishes daily?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: No, no. These are special dishes for you.</p>
<p>DINENDRA: Good Heavens! special dishes, indeed! <em>(Looks daggers at Keshta.)</em> Keshta, how incorrigible you are! You have spoiled everything. Your very sight is repugnant to me. Barmecide covers were better far than your concoction. What a burning sensation from mouth to gullet!</p>
<p>KESHTA: Sir, excuse me this time. I am extremely sorry. I shall be very, very careful next time.</p>
<p>DINENDRA: And where is your ghee? You have given us so much water for our bath, you fool!</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: How is it that I was quite unaware of all this? I wonder how I could eat without feeling anything!</p>
<p><em>(Dinendra and Ramesh burst into laughter.)</em></p>
<p>DINENDRA: Aurobindo, my young friend, you do not belong to this earth. You remain in your own world.</p>
<p>KESHTA: <em>(Looking at Dinendra Kumar)</em> Sir, next time I shall prepare a grand dish.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(With a compassionate look)</em> Keshta, it will be quite nice of you if you can.</p>
<p>KESHTA: Sir, I promise, I shall be no fool again.</p>  </div>
