<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Human determination is not and cannot be the last answer. Usually determination comes from the vital or from the mind. It tries to achieve something by hook or by crook. Real will or will-power comes from the soul. There is no difference between the soul’s light and will-power. The soul’s light can illumine everything, and once we see something illumined, there is no obstruction. If the road is illumined, then we can walk and run. But if the road is obscure and dark, at any moment we may stumble and fall.</p>  </div>
