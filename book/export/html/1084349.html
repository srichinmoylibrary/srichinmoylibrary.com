<p>Lord, since You know<br /> That Your Presence is my<br /> Himalayan delight,<br /> Why don't You come to me<br /> More often?<br /> Lord, since You know<br /> That Your absence<br /> Is my oceanic sorrow,<br /> Why don't You tell me<br /> Why You are quite often,<br /> In season and out of season,<br /> Absent?</p>
