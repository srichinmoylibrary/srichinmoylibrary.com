<p>The young fellow from Dominea went to so many people and so many higher officials to get me on the flight. Finally he said, “Now it is five past eight. I have taken a risk. I have no idea whether people will come, but I don’t want you to worry any more.”</p>
<p>In India, there is a system that you have to identify your suitcase. First it will go to customs. Then when it goes to the other side, you have to go there and verify that it is yours. This young man said to me, “I know your bag. You don’t have to worry. I will go and identify your bag on your behalf. You just enter into the plane. I will go and check your bag for you.”</p>
<p>By that time it was 8:20. I entered into the plane. Whom did I see standing at the entrance but this young man. He said, “Mr. Ghose, I identified your suitcase. You don’t have to worry at all.”</p>
<p>I asked him for his card. He said, “I am an ordinary person. I don’t keep a card.”</p>
<p>I said, “Then you write down your name and address.” So he wrote it down. He was a very nice man.</p>
<p>I took the flight to Calcutta, and I did not have any problems in Calcutta with my ticket because it had been properly confirmed in Pondicherry.</p>  </div>
