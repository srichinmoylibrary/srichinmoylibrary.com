<p>She hears the nectar-voice of the One;<br /> Her Ears divine are awake to Its calls.<br /> Through her alone He fulfils his dream.<br /> They hear our thoughts, the shadow-falls.<br /> Our ills She bosoms as her own;<br /> She bears the blame of all our fate.<br /> She boons a music we cannot hear.<br /> Mother, deathless, immaculate.</p>
