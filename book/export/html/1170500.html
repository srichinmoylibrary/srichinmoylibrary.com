SCA 43-50. Excerpts from a television interview in Apia, Western Samoa, on 21 December 1993.</p>
<h2>Interviewer: Sri Chinmoy, what message are you trying to spread around the world?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am trying to offer a simple and prayerful message to the world at large, and this message is the message of peace. Unless and until we have achieved peace, we shall not be happy. We can have material things in boundless measure, we can be the richest human beings on earth, we can wallow in the pleasures of life, but we cannot be happy unless we have peace. We have to work together and pray together so that God will bless us with peace.</p>  </div>
