<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have very happy and delightful dreams, then they may encourage and inspire you to meditate. Suppose you have a dream about the Golden Shore. You may feel that it is not a dream at all but a reality. So you will say, "Let me work very hard in my meditation, and perhaps I can go there." Again, you may go on remembering all that happened in the dream, even during your meditation. Then you will be in the dream world and your real inner cry will not be able to come to the fore. Many times when people have had very high dreams they have tried to remain there. But then the real intensity of their meditation went away. When you meditate, you do not have to think of your dreams at all; just meditate most sincerely to go high, higher, highest. Then it will not be necessary for you to bring your dreams into your meditation at all.</p>
