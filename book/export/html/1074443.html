   <div id="node-1074444" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1.</h1>
  
 
<p>The Fire-God</p>
<p>The Fire-God consumes our ignorance-night. He also energises our aspiration-cry.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1074445" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Ahamkara</em></p>
<p>Pride</p>
<p>Pride destroys our satisfaction-beauty in the inner world and our perfection-reality in the outer world.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1074446" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Ananta</em></p>
<p>Endless</p>
<p>When I love only God unconditionally, endless is my satisfaction-delight. When I love only myself sleeplessly, endless is my frustration-destruction.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1074447" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Asura</em></p>
<p>Demon</p>
<p>The demons consciously make us feel how weak and helpless we are in their strong presence. The demons unconsciously make us feel our sleepless and deathless oneness with the Inner Pilot, our Beloved Supreme.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1074448" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Asvamedha</em></p>
<p>Horse sacrifice</p>
<p>In India the horse sacrifice grants us tremendous name and fame, but satisfaction may remain a far cry. Oneness-realisation will grant us not only boundless satisfaction but also the message of ever-transcending perfection.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1074449" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>

  <h1 class="book-heading">7.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Diksha</em></p>
<p>Initiation</p>
<p>Initiation is divinely meaningful and supremely fruitful. During initiation the crying heart of the disciple says to the Master, "I need you badly." The loving heart of the Master says to the disciple, "I shall not only love you unreservedly but also give to you unconditionally."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1074451" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Dikshaka</em></p>
<p>One who initiates</p>
<p>The one who initiates knows where his realisation is coming from. He knows also to whom he is offering it. His realisation is coming from his Father Transcendental and going to his brother, who is crying to be a conscious part of the Universal Reality.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1074452" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Idam</em></p>
<p>This</p>
<p>This world may frighten and discourage the God-seeker, but it can never, never remotely frighten or discourage a true God-lover, for he sees God the creation and God the Creator as one indivisible Reality.</p>
<p>This world is beautiful if we see the Creator in it. This world is fruitful if we add to it our own aspiration-cry and dedication-smile.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1074453" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Jagrata</em></p>
<p>Awake</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Jnana</em></p>
<p>Knowledge</p>
<p>Human knowledge is book-knowledge. Divine knowledge is soul-knowledge. And what is soul-knowledge? That we are of the One's Beauty and for the One's Duty.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Karma</em></p>
<p>Action</p>
<p>A desire-life is bad action in the body, vital and mind. An aspiration-life is the good action of the heart for the mind, vital and body.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1074456" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Katha</em></p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">18.</h1>

  <h1 class="book-heading">19.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Kratu</em></p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">20.</h1>

<div id="node-1074465" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">22.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Krpa</em></p>
<p>Compassion</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">23.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Krurata</em></p>
<p>Cruelty</p>
<p>What is cruelty? Imperfection. What is imperfection? Division. What is division? Self-importance. What is self-importance? The beginning of faultless frustration.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">25.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Kshana</em></p>
<p>Moment</p>
<p>An earth-bound moment tells me that I am nothing because I have nothing. A Heaven-free moment is a necessity that bridges man's choice of God and God's Voice in man.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">26.</h1>

<p><em>Kutira</em></p>
<p>Hermitage</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">31.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Lakshya</em></p>
<p>Target</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">32.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Laya</em></p>
<p>Dissolution</p>
