<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Try to keep a direct contact with my inner being. In that way you can make the fastest progress. Try to have a telephone connection so that your inner being can respond to my inner being. While you are meditating early in the morning and looking at my picture, please try to converse inwardly with me. Try to enter into my heart or into my third eye. Every day empty yourself into me. If you have fear, if you have doubt or anxiety or worries, just throw it all into me. Think of me as an ocean into which you can throw your garbage. Just throw anything that comes into your mind. Then your mind will be filled with the divine Light by the Supreme in me. At that time you will make the fastest progress.</p>  </div>
