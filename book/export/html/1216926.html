<p>The London disciples arranged a banquet like the one the Governor of Agadir had given us. Ten or twelve people were sitting around each table and we were being served.</p>
<p>They gave me a cake with 200 candles for my 200-pound lift and started singing, "I can lift up 200 pounds." They were singing the song so cheerfully and confidently that I began to suspect them.</p>
<p>I said, "You people are really great. I just wrote the song in New York and already you have learned it. When did you get in touch with Tanima?"</p>
<p>They said, "We didn't get in touch with Tanima. We just changed the words to one of your old songs!"</p>
