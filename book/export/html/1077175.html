<p>Mother Earth is compassionate enough to embrace each and every individual. She never excludes anyone, not even grossly insensitive and deplorably callous human beings. One evening, while Einstein was giving a violin concert, he noticed that several older women in the audience were knitting. He immediately stopped playing and put away his violin. When the ladies asked him why he had stopped, he explained, <em>“I would not dream of disturbing your work.”</em></p>  </div>
