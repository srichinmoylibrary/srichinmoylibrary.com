<p>I FEEL REALLY SORRY FOR YOU</p>
<p>Your heart-purity is snared<br /> By the ignorance-world.<br /> I feel really sorry for you.</p>
<p>Your mind-clarity is ridiculed<br /> By the ignorance-world.<br /> I feel really sorry for you.</p>
<p>Your vital-temerity is despised<br /> By the ignorance-world.<br /> I feel really sorry for you.</p>
<p>Your body-humility is misunderstood<br /> By the ignorance-world.<br /> I feel really sorry for you.</p>
