<p>PRIVILEGED LIARS</p>
<p>Poets are privileged liars.<br /> Without even seeing the truth,<br /> They tell the world<br /> That they have realised the truth.</p>
<p>Lovers are privileged liars.<br /> After having realised the truth<br /> In fullest measure,<br /> They tell the world<br /> That they are doubtful about the existence of truth.</p>
<p>Seekers are privileged liars.<br /> God repeatedly tells them<br /> That He has His Omniscience, His Omnipotence<br /> For them, only for them.<br /> They tell the world<br /> That they desperately need<br /> What God outwardly has<br /> And<br /> What God inwardly is.</p>
