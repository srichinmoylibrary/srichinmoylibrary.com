<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I inspire them to bring to the fore their own love of God. This is my main job. I do not teach them; I inspire them. When I offer peace concerts, thousands of people pray with me and meditate with me. I play different musical instruments and sing for about two hours. The peace-lovers who come to listen inspire me, and I inspire them. Everything is based on inspiration. If we are inspired, we will become good citizens of the world. If we are not inspired, then we will do all kinds of undivine things.</p>  </div>
