<p>This time I was saved from two very serious accidents while I was riding in a rickshaw. Once a bicycle came and dashed against the rickshaw. I thought that we would fall down, but the cyclist fell down instead. I told the rickshaw-wallah, "Stop! Let us see whether he is hurt."</p>
<p>He said he would not stop because the cyclist was the one who had dashed against us, and he went on.</p>
<p>The second incident was absolutely the most dangerous. As usual, I was sitting in a relaxed way and my right knee was outside the rickshaw. A motorbike was coming directly towards us on the right side. I thought, "O my God, my right knee will be finished!"</p>
<p>The motorcycle stopped within one foot of the rickshaw. If the driver had come a little closer, my right knee would have been smashed. Luckily, nothing happened and I was saved.</p>  </div>
