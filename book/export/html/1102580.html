<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Life is composed of perfection; only we say that there is lesser perfection and greater perfection. We do not say that this side is black and that side is white; we say that on this side there is more light and on that side there is comparatively less light. There is no negative and positive; there is only positive. But the thing that is less positive has less capacity and sometimes we call it negative.</p>
