<p>Bill Pearl joined us for our concert in San Jose, and he introduced the video of my weightlifting after the concert. While we were in California, he took measurements of my arms, chest and legs. He was appreciating the strength of my chest and leg muscles. He said my left calf is practically an inch larger than my right calf. He said all kinds of very nice things about me.</p>
<p>On the video when he saw me lift 1,500 pounds in the calf raise, he couldn’t believe it. He was screaming, “He is lifting, he is lifting!” When I was lifting the boat, he was so moved. Then he asked Nirvik if Nirvik would lift 500 pounds, but Nirvik said no.</p>
