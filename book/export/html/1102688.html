<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I appreciate and admire all religions, and my teachings embody the quintessence of all religions. But I do not belong to any particular religion. I was born a Hindu; therefore, I know the ins and outs of the Hindu religion. But I do not practise Hinduism or any other specific religion. My religion is to love God and to become a humble instrument of God. Hinduism is like a house; Christianity is another house; Judaism is another house. We each grow up in our particular houses, but then we come to one school to study. This school is spirituality. Through spirituality we discover our oneness with God.</p>
