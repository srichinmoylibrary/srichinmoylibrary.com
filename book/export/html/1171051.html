<h2>Before the <em>Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart</em> programme</h2>

<p>In my heart-garden today I am seeing a few most beautiful and most soulful flowers. I cannot go to Yugoslavia, but Yugoslavia’s soul and heart have come to me. And for that, my heart’s boundless love and gratitude and my soul’s infinite blessings and compassion I am offering to my spiritual children who are now here from Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>From this moment on, I shall grow in the very depths of your aspiration-heart every day, and every moment the beauty and fragrance of your hearts will please our Lord Beloved Supreme. I am extremely happy to have you all in our boat, the Golden Boat. And this boat will without fail carry all of us to the Golden Shore.</p>
<p>Once more, to each of you my heart of love and my life of gratitude I am offering.</p>
