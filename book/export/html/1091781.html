<p>One day Birbal asked Akbar, "Why is it that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west every day? Can it not sometimes rise in the west and set in the east?"</p>
<p>The Emperor said, "Only a fool like you can ask this kind of question, and only another fool can answer it."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know that," replied the Minister. "That is why I have come to you."</p>  </div>
