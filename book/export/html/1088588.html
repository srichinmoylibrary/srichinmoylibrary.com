<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely it does. Not only in India but everywhere, if the members of a family can live together peacefully, soulfully and self-givingly, then that family consciously or unconsciously is definitely getting very special spiritual benefit. It is following the rules and principles of spirituality although outwardly all the family members may not even know what spirituality is.</p>  </div>
