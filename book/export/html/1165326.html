<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the highest spiritual point of view, in God’s universal Vision there is no such thing as an invention. There is only the one spiritual Reality that is being manifested. Within our Supreme Beloved’s all-pervading, all-illumining, transcendental Vision what can be invented or discovered? Here on earth we have the mind and earthly organs and measurements to facilitate our discoveries. Very often in the inner world we will find something that will lead us to a discovery in the outer world. But in the inmost world there is no invention. There it is all oneness with the highest Reality; there is only creation. Each movement of God is a creation. He creates millions of realities at each second. Then, when we come down to the earth plane, invention starts. But in the highest transcendental Reality there is no invention.</p>  </div>
