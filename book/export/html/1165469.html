<p>When my disciples read my writings, they enter into my consciousness. If they read somebody else's writings, they enter into that person's consciousness. My writings contain my inspiration and aspiration, plus my realisation. I ask my disciples to memorise a few of my writings so that they will assimilate my writings and make them part and parcel of their consciousness.</p>
<p>When you read something four or five times in order to memorise it, each time you will get a new light from it. Each time you will see different things and get different meanings, and each meaning is absolutely correct. I personally do not like to explain my writings, especially not my poems. A poem is like a mantra, particularly when it comes from a master. My writings come directly from my heart. To explain them, I have to use my mind; then their inner significance goes away. When I use my mind I feel like a surgeon operating on someone. When I explain my poems or my other writings, it seems to me that they are undergoing surgery. When I read out a poem, there will be a few lines or one word that will give you joy. If it gives you joy, immediately with that word go deep within and there you will get the utmost Joy, Peace and Bliss. When I read out anything, do not feel that you have to know the meaning, the substance or the significance of each word. If any one word or line inspires you, feel that that is enough. Then build your own inspiration, aspiration and realisation on that particular word. If I have to explain it like a schoolteacher, then I will not be able to offer anything.</p>
<p>If you ask a gardener who has produced a flower to pick it for you, he will say, "How can I kill the flower? When a flower is fully blossomed it is like a living creature. How can I cut it into pieces and give it to you?" So, when it is a matter of explaining my poems, it will be an injustice to your own aspiration. I am reluctant because I feel that a poem of mine is like a living creature that is about to be cut into pieces and offered to people. If one starts explaining spiritual poetry, there is nothing in it. Once it is explained, its beauty and reality are gone.</p>
<p>I ask my disciples to try and read my writings for half an hour each day. In addition to reading my writings, you can also sing some of my spiritual songs. Singing is a form of meditation. If you can sing <em>The Supreme</em> (our invocation) most soulfully, that is worth an hour's meditation. Every disciple of mine should sing this song at least once a day. Even if you cannot carry a tune, no harm. The Supreme is not going to give you a mark. Tagore once wrote in a poem that God gave a voice to the bird, so no credit is given when the bird sings. But when a human being sings although God has not given him a voice, that is something. When you don't have something and you are offering it to God, that is something more. Sometimes people ask whether they can sing inwardly. Certainly, that is very good. But inwardly if you sing, you may stop in the middle of a line. Outwardly if you sing, you feel that there is a witness; you will be embarrassed if you don't complete the song.</p>  </div>
