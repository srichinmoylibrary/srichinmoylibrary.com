<h2>Editor's notes</h2>

<p>On May 22, 1967, Sri Chinmoy gave an invited talk to the School of Self-Defense, 280 Closter Dock Road. Closter, New Jersey. This school, under the direction of Mr. Michael Depasquale, a Police officer, teaches Jiu Jitsu, Karate, and other forms of self-defense.</p>
<p>The members of the school, men, women and children, were interested to learn, not only about Hatha Yoga (the ancient Hindu system of physical postures and breathing exercises) but also about the Indian spiritual disciplines and the various forms of Yoga, apart from. Hatha Yoga.</p>
<p>On May 24, 1967, the Guru addressed the Universalist Church of New York City, at the invitation of its director, the Reverend Leonard Helie, on the subject of “The Universality of Religion.”</p>
<p>The Aum Centre wishes to express its deepest thanks to Mrs. Fay vom Saal and Mrs. Arnold for their most generous services in arranging for the talk and preparing the Indian refreshments.</p>  </div>
