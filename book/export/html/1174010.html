<p>Yesterday you were always<br /> In my prayers.<br /> I was praying to God<br /> To transform your frustrations<br /> Into hopes.</p>
<p>Today you are always<br /> In my prayers.<br /> I am praying God<br /> To free you<br /> From your desire-breath.</p>
<p>Tomorrow you will always be<br /> In my prayers.<br /> I shall pray to God<br /> To grant you everything<br /> That I will eventually need from you.</p>
