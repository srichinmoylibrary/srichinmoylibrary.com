<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to feel all the time that the physical is not all, and that the spiritual is everything. Inside the physical is the spiritual. Outside is the body, but just because you have the heart inside, you are alive. In the spiritual life the heart and soul are most important. My presence must be inside you. If you can feel my presence inside your heart, then you will not feel that I am away. In this way you will be able to keep your consciousness high at all times.</p>  </div>
