<p>If you look at Cahit Yeter after he has run a marathon, he looks as if he has just warmed up. Yes, some other runners defeated him in our Plainsboro marathon, but nobody looked as fresh as he did. Everybody else was out of breath, dying. Because of his ultra-marathoning, 26 miles was nothing for him. But then, if one says to him, "You are an ultra-marathoner," he will say, "Oh, I am not an ultra-marathoner. So and so is a real ultra-marathoner."</p>
