<p>I adored my Lord Supreme<br /> With my fear-fever.<br /> Furious he became.<br /> He bolted His Golden Gate from inside<br /> With all the power at His command.</p>
<p>I adored my Beloved Supreme<br /> With my heart-flames.<br /> Self-enamoured He became.<br /> In a twinkling, sooner than at once,<br /> He opened His Golden Gate wide;<br /> He offered me His French-bowed emerald throne.</p>
<p>I adored my Eternal Friend<br /> With my surrender-light.<br /> Perfection-Infinity He immediately donned.</p>
<p>O Lord Supreme<br /> Your forgiveness I implore.<br /> O Beloved Supreme,<br /> Your Love-sea I shall eternally treasure.<br /> O Eternal Friend,<br /> Your Heart's ever-widening Magnanimity<br /> Has made my life<br /> The Voice of transcendental Silence.</p>
