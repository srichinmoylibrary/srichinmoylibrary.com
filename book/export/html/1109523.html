<p>The human breath has an inner cry for Immortality. It knows and feels that death is not and cannot be the ultimate answer. The real poet in Tennyson inspires us to sing,</p>

<p>"No life that breathes with human breath<br /> Has ever truly longed for death."</p>

<p>Needless to say, a true aspirant in his inner life does not long for death. He does not cry for Immortality either. What he needs and cries for is conscious, unreserved and unconditional surrender to the Will of the Supreme. To fulfil the Supreme's Will supreme is his heart's only cry.</p>  </div>
