<p>I spoke to Mahasamrat on the telephone and I was encouraging him about the New Year. Then Mahasamrat said, “Guru, I am telling you, I promised you I shall not fail you and I shall not fail you. I shall not fail you.” His mantra was only, “I shall not fail you.” His wife Judy was so happy. She has sent me a Christmas card and gifts.</p>
<p>R was in the other phone booth. She wrote down what I was saying; only what Mahasamrat was saying she could not hear.</p>
