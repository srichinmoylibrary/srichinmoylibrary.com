<p>Once Ramachandra said to his Guru, Vashishtha, “Lord, please tell me something about God.”</p>
<p>Vashishtha said, “God? He is all greatness. My son, meditate on this.”</p>
<p>Ramachandra meditated on God’s Greatness for a few seconds. Then Vashishtha said, “I am so glad that you have seen and felt God’s Greatness.”</p>
<p>Ramachandra then said, “Lord, please say something more about God.”</p>
<p>Vashishtha said, “God is all goodness. Meditate on God’s Goodness.”</p>
<p>Ramachandra meditated for a few seconds on God’s Goodness. Vashishtha said, “Excellent! I am so glad that you have seen and felt God’s Goodness.”</p>
<p>Again Ramachandra asked his Master to tell him something more about God.</p>
<p>“God is all kindness, all compassion and all concern. Meditate on this.”</p>
<p>Ramachandra meditated on God’s Kindness, Compassion and Concern for a few seconds. Vashishtha said, “Excellent, excellent, my son.”</p>
<p>Ramachandra then said, “Lord, please tell me something more about God.”</p>
<p>His Guru replied, “God is all justice. Meditate on this.”</p>
<p>Ramachandra meditated on God’s Justice and Vashishtha said, “Marvellous! You have seen and felt God’s Justice.”</p>
<p>“Lord, something more I want to hear about God.”</p>
<p>“God is all power. Meditate on this, my son.”</p>
<p>Ramachandra meditated on God’s Power, and Vashishtha said, “I knew, I knew that you would see and feel God’s Power in a very short time.”</p>
<p>“Something else I wish to hear from you, my Lord, about God.”</p>
<p>Vashishtha remained silent.</p>
<p>“Why are you silent, my Lord?” Ramachandra asked. Still Vashishtha remained silent.</p>
<p>“Lord, why are you silent? I wish to learn more from you about God.”</p>
<p>Vashishtha still remained silent.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you want to teach me, my Lord?” asked Ramachandra. “If you do not teach me, how can I learn more about God? I want to learn everything about God from you.”</p>
<p>Again, silence!</p>
<p>Ramachandra asked, “Have I offended you in any way? Consciously I know that I have not offended you. And if I have offended you unconsciously, please forgive me. Only I want you to teach me more about God.”</p>
<p>But Vashishtha only remained silent. “Lord, Lord, if you do not teach me more about God, then I will definitely remain ignorant. If this is your will, if this is the Will of God, then I must remain silent, too.”</p>
<p>Vashishtha blessed Ramachandra and said, “My son, you have got the answer. When all earthly questions are asked and all the answers are given, then question-life and sound-life come to an end. At that time, real answer-life and real silence-life begin. So silence is the answer. Silence is the unparalleled God. Silence unites the many and makes the many one. You and I are two. We are playing the role of teacher and student, Master and disciple. But you have learned everything that I know about God; therefore I remain silent. Silence is perfect oneness and oneness is God-perfection.”</p>
<p>Ramachandra touched Vashishtha’s feet and said, “Your name is silence, my Lord, Eternity’s silence; and my name is gratitude, Infinity’s gratitude. In silence and in gratitude we shall forever and forever remain inseparably one.”</p>
