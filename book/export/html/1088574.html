<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It could be either. They could have a special love for India because they had previous incarnations there. Again, they could have developed a special love for India in this incarnation because they have read inspiring books about India and heard about Indian spiritual Masters, or because they have studied the Indian forms of yoga and practised meditation in the traditional Indian way. If they have developed a special love for India, and if they want their forthcoming incarnation to be in India, they can pray to God to take a future incarnation in India.</p>  </div>
