<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Self-criticism you can take as a thorn that has entered into you. You are very bad, undivine, stupid. You feel that all the bad qualities of the world are inside you. Take this self-criticism as a thorn. One thorn has entered into you, and it has many names. One moment it is stupidity, the next moment it is insecurity, and so on. So what you have to do is take the help of another thorn. That thorn is: “I am God’s daughter, God’s chosen daughter, and I am going to be His perfect instrument. There is nothing on earth which can prevent me from becoming His chosen instrument.” You use this thorn to take out the other thorn that is causing you trouble. Self-criticism can only be conquered by proper divine appreciation. You have to claim the right person as your own. God is your Source. You have to take the positive approach. You have to be aware of who you are and what you stand for, not in an aggressive sense, but in a spiritual sense. Right now, you are not aware twenty-four hours a day. But a day will come when you will be aware all the time that you are God’s chosen daughter; you are on earth Him to serve, Him to fulfil.</p>  </div>
