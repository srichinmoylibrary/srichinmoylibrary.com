<p>“The Master does not care for me. He just pretends. He cares only for my father. My father serves him in so many ways. Therefore, he tries to make me feel that he also cares for me. But I can feel inside my heart that he does not care for me. Since his concern and love for me are not real, I cannot stay with him. Furthermore, he does not approve of my emotional-vital life. Therefore, who wants to stay with him?”</p>  </div>
