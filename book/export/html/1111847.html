<p>I was so surprised that at least twenty people recognised me during the marathon. Even from the second mile people recognised me. My number was not listed in the marathon book because I got it late, and I was wearing something over my Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team singlet. Even so, at one point two or three black girls recognised me and called out, "Guru!" They were not my disciples.</p>
