<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has various kinds of Power, but His most powerful Power is His Grace. The moment He uses His Grace for a seeker, He offers His very Life-Breath to the seeker. God and God's Grace can never be separated. The divine Grace is constantly descending upon us. He who is aspiring sincerely is consciously aware of this divine Grace, whereas he who is not aspiring is keeping his heart's door closed to it.</p>
<p>If we approach God through His Grace, then we will find Him more accessible. When we think of God, if we immediately feel that God is Grace within and without, then we will find it easier to approach Him. The moment we think of God's Grace, we feel that His infinite Peace, Light and Bliss are already entering into us and becoming part and parcel of our inner and outer life. But if we think of God as omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent, then His divine qualities we do not necessarily see flowing through us. From now on, let us not feel that by going to God we can get His Grace. Instead, let us feel that it is through the Grace of God that we can go to God. Let us think of God's constantly flowing Grace and let the flow carry us to the Source.</p>
