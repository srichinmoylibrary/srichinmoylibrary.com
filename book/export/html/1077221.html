<p>Zatopek's dedication and will power are Himalayan. Day in and day out, year after year during his training regimen, the courageous champion remained faithful and dedicated to the course he had set for himself. He clearly describes his training philosophy: "If one can stick to the training throughout the many long years, then will power is no longer a problem. It's raining? That doesn't matter. I am tired? That's beside the point. It's simply that I just have to."</p>  </div>
