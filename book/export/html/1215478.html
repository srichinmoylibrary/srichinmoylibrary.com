<p><em>Interviewer:</em> With me in the studio this morning we have Sri Chinmoy. Sri Chinmoy, for those of you who are not familiar with the name, is an Indian spiritual Master. He is the founder and director of the meditation group at the United Nations in New York and an exponent of Yoga and Eastern philosophy. Sri Chinmoy spent most of his early years living in an ashram. He is an accomplished composer and performer of music for meditation. And Sri Chinmoy is someone who knows a great deal about meditation — the benefits of meditation and the experiences that are available through it, not only in the area of consciousness, but also in the area of physical health. We are going to be talking primarily about meditation, and along with that we are going to be discovering and exploring, something of the personality and the being of Sri Chinmoy.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy, welcome to “Hawaii Health Line.” There are a lot of questions that I would like to ask you. I would like to start by finding out something about your early life. You grew up in an ashram?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I was brought up in an ashram. There I practised prayer and meditation for twenty years, and also I gave much importance to physical exercise to keep the body fit. I am very happy to be here today because this programme is about both physical fitness and spiritual awareness. These are perfectly harmonious with my philosophy and my code of life.</p>  </div>
