<p>O my body's stupidity,<br /> You do not need any other punishment.<br /> You are your own pounding punishment.</p>
<p>O my vital's impurity,<br /> You do not need any other punishment.<br /> You are your own pounding punishment.</p>
<p>O my mind's insincerity,<br /> You do not need any other punishment.<br /> You are your own pounding punishment.</p>
<p>O my heart's insecurity,<br /> You do not need any other punishment.<br /> You are your own pounding punishment.</p>
<p>O my soul's luminosity,<br /> You do not need any other reward.<br /> You are your own unparalleled reward.</p>
