<p><em>What is the name of your magazine?</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The name is AUM. You know A represents Brahma, the Creator, U represents Vishnu, the Preserver, M represent Lord Siva, the Destroyer. So what happens is that when we say AUM, we are invoking the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer. I beg to be excused, but in my philosophy, I feel that there is no destruction. It is all transformation. As a matter of fact, we canâ€™t destroy anything. First we create something, then we preserve it. Then what do we do? Transform the thing. So Creation, Preservation and Transformation. Brahma is the Creator, Vishnu is the Preserver and Shiva is the Transformer. If it is destruction, who is destroying whom? God only transforms us. In our creation, we enter into ignorance and we do many things wrong. For that He has to transform us and again take us back into His bosom of infinite Light.</p>  </div>
