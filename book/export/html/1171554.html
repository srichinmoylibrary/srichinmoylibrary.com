<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The purpose is very simple. We feel that this world is all one family. You and I are brothers. And there is only one God. That God you call Allah, and I call Him something else. But it is the same God. Similarly, Mohammed, Lord Krishna and the Saviour Christ all came from the Highest. When you pray to Allah and a Hindu or a Christian prays to God, we feel that it is the same God with different Names.</p>
<p>I go to so many countries to feel my oneness with God's children, with Allah's children, and to offer my love. Everybody cannot live in the same house. I have come to see your place. One day you may come to see my place. The human family is so big. That is why we live here, there and everywhere. But we are all brothers and sisters, so when we travel, we go to visit our relatives.</p>  </div>
