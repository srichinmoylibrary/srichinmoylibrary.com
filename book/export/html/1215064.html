<p>Sometimes we see that the creation becomes more powerful than the Creator. It is we who have created the hydrogen bomb and the atom bomb. Our human society has discovered them. But what is the good of our achievement if the creation becomes more powerful than we are?</p>
<p>Someone once said, “If we want destruction, that is up to us.” But if we feel that the power of destruction is greater than the power of God-realisation, then we are making a mistake. The power of destruction has come from whom? From the Source of creation. And who is the Source? God. He who first created us is undoubtedly more powerful than His creation or our creation because if He had not created the individual, then the individual could not have created anything else.</p>  </div>
