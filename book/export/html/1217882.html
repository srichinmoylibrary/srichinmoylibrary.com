<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible. It is always easier and safer, in fact, for one to practise Yoga at the beginning while remaining in his own religion. But once one has reached God by practising Yoga, he transcends all barriers of religion. God-Realisation reveals to him that each religion is nothing but a river that ultimately has to merge into the boundless Ocean. The ultimate aim of each religion is God-Realisation. And here also, Yoga comes as an inevitable aid, to transport the finite human being into the Infinite Divine Self.</p>
<p>Religion is Inspiration. Yoga is Aspiration. Divinity is Perfection. Inspiration, Aspiration and Divinity can easily and fruitfully blossom here on earth in transcendental harmony.</p>  </div>
