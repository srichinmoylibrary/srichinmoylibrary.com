<p>The Master had a German disciple. She always asked the Master the same question: “Can you tell me, Master, the condition of my soul?” Six or seven times the Master with utmost compassion told her about the condition of her soul.</p>
<p>Once the Master had to answer quite a few serious questions in a Centre meeting, and he was completely exhausted. Then, the last question was asked by the German lady: “Can you please tell me, Master, about the condition of my soul?”</p>
<p>The Master was not kind enough on that day, which he should have been. He simply said, “What will you do with the condition of your soul? Take care of your vital life and mental life.”</p>
<p>The woman became furious and told one of the Master’s disciples, who was a boxer, that she would have nothing further to do with an unsympathetic, cruel Master.</p>  </div>
