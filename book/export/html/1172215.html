<p>"... At the age of 55, he [began] running in Masters events, ... and he has been running ever since.... In 10 years Payton has lost only one race while becoming the darling of the geriatric set. That one setback occurred in a special sprint during halftime at an Oregon-Stanford football game, after Jordan pulled a leg muscle while warming up. He holds virtually every world record for sprinting events in all Masters age groups....</p>
<p>"If the pro football scouts didn't check birth certificates, they'd sign him up as a defensive backfield prospect, or maybe a wide receiver. Members of those species in the National Football League are considered super-fast if they can run 40 yards in 4.5 seconds. Payton at 65 is in that class without drawing a deep breath."</p>
