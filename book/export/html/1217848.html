<h2>Question: When someone is described as having a young soul, or an old soul, what does this mean?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the spiritual point of view, when one has higher and deeper experiences, acquired from previous incarnations, one is called an old soul. The one who is wanting in such experiences is called a young soul. As you can see, it is not the number of incarnations that determine the ‘status’ of the soul, but what one has learned and achieved in those lives.</p>  </div>
