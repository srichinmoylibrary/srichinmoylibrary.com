<p><em>(Another part of the forest. Enter the deer, followed by Rama, panting.)</em></p>
<p>RAMA: Ah! One moment the deer is near, and the next moment it is quite far. This moment I am about to catch it, and the next moment it is beyond my reach. This is indeed a mysterious animal. I have been running after it for a long time. Now I am tired, exhausted. Sita wanted me to bring back this deer alive if possible. But I find it is not possible to catch it. Well, I shall shoot the deer with my bow, but I shall not kill it. I shall wound it and then take it home to Sita. She will nurse and cure the animal.</p>
<p><em>(Rama aims his unfailing arrow at the deer. The deer falls down.)</em></p>
<p>DEER <em>(in Rama's voice):</em> Ah Sita, Ah Lakshmana! Ahhh Sita, Ahhh Lakshmana.</p>  </div>
