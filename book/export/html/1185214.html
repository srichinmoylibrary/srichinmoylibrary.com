  <h1 class="book-heading">Michelangelo and the Pope</h1>
  
 
<p>Michelangelo and Pope Julius II were always in the habit of quarrelling. The artist would frequently find it impossible to comply with the Pope's requests or commands. Once the Pope asked Michelangelo to add gold to some figures. Michelangelo responded, "It cannot be. Holy men cannot wear gold. They are poor."</p>
<p>The Pope argued, "Why not? They can!"</p>
<p>The artist would not listen, but on this occasion Pope Julius did not want to fight. He was sick of fighting with Michelangelo for he knew that the artist had a temper of the quickest, the worst possible temper. So he forgave Michelangelo's outbursts and rewarded him for his extraordinary capacities as an artist.</p>
<p>Here the Pope valued the art, ignoring the shortcomings of the artist.</p>  </div>
