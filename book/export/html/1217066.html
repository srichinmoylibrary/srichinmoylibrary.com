<p>One of the hotel cooks came up to me and said, "Please tell me what you want. I will make you food. Do you like Spanish food?"</p>
<p>I said, "I do like Spanish food."</p>
<p>He went on, "Is there anything I can make for you?"</p>
<p>I replied, "Nothing right now, thank you."</p>
<p>Some people are of the opinion that the food is better here in Cancún, but I disagree wholeheartedly. I liked Israel and Lisette's preparation at Lake Atitlan infinitely more.</p>
