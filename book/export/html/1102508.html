<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One day we shall realise everything that is natural. God is natural, so naturally we shall realise Him; but if we do not consciously aspire, then we may have to wait for Eternity. God has given us a conscious mind and conscious aspiration, but He is not compelling us or forcing us to use them. We can sleep if we want to; but if we consciously pray and meditate, then we will go faster. One day everybody will realise God because in God's cosmic Vision, He will never allow anyone to remain unrealised. But he who sleeps will not reach the goal as fast as he who is running. Again, if we want to wait, no harm; we can wait.</p>
