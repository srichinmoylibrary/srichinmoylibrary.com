<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, it is quite possible to realise the Highest in this lifetime. But you have to know how sincere you are, how much you love God, how much you need God. If God comes first and foremost, if you feel that you can live without everything or everybody but not without God, if God is constantly in your mind, in your heart, in your living existence, and if you are under the guidance of a fully realised spiritual Master, then realisation is possible in one lifetime. If the Master takes full responsibility for the disciple and if the disciple is absolutely sincere, then God-realisation can easily be achieved in one lifetime. God-realisation is your birthright; it is not the sole monopoly of any individual. If I can realise God, you can realise God too, but you have to be extremely sincere and devoted. Once you realise the Goal, that Goal becomes yours; at that time you don't have to share the Goal with anybody. It is all for you. Once you realise the Highest under the guidance of someone, at that time the Highest becomes yours. You don't have to share it with your Master. Once you get your Ph.D., then you don't need the help of the university. In the spiritual life also, once you get inner illumination, once you realise the Highest, you do not need the guidance of anyone and you don't have to share your realisation. But again, when you realise the Truth, you will try to share your Goal with everyone. At that time, your heart becomes one with the universe and you try to share your realisation with everyone.</p>  </div>
