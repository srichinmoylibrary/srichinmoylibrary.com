<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God created the gossip world so that His most precious Ears would not remain inactive. With extreme difficulty He created such beautiful Ears, and if they remain inactive or lifeless, then poor God will be miserable. Therefore He created ears to function well, and while His Ears are enjoying gossip, He is able to digest the ignorance-food that He voraciously eats at every moment.</p>  </div>
