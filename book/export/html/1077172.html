<p>Einstein emphasised the necessity of sincerity and truth in the blossoming consciousness of budding souls. Once a little girl went to Einstein’s home to ask for help with her homework, because a friend had told her that he was very good at arithmetic. She did not realise who Einstein was. The immortal scientist was very kind to the girl and invited her in to talk about her problem. After some time he told her that she should learn how to do the calculations from her teacher, who he knew was very good, or by herself. He said he couldn’t do her homework for her because this would not help her learn.The next day the child went to her teacher and bravely admitted that she did not understand how to do the problem. She told her of her encounter with Einstein and added that her teacher must indeed be very good, since Mr. Einstein could not do the problem either.</p>  </div>
