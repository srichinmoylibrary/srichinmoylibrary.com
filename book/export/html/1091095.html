<p>It is possible for you to believe that God is Omniscient, Omnipotent and Omnipresent. But it is impossible for you to believe that God has what you have: death. It is also impossible for you to believe that God is what you are: ignorance. But it is true. Father and son are one. Father is son's Realisation. Son is Father's Revelation.</p>  </div>
