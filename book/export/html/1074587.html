<p>In my hermit heart<br /> I dread noise and love silence.<br /> I have wrestled with heavy doubts<br /> And now I wear victory's crown.<br /> The length of my aspiring life<br /> Is increasing fast, very fast.<br /> The length of my desiring life<br /> Is becoming slender, very slender.<br /> Soon it will perish in the abyss<br /> Of lifeless nothingness.<br /> In my hermit heart<br /> God's Compassion is invoked by me to sing,<br /> God's Love is invited by me to play.<br /> My heart of gratitude,<br /> My life of surrender<br /> Will watch them sing and play.</p>
