<blockquote>
<p>"I am not ashamed to confess that I am ignorant of what I do not know."</p>
<p>â€” Cicero</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Had we been able to share this lofty truth of Cicero's, there would not have existed the giant wall of misunderstanding between England and India. The arrow of England is matter. The arrow of India is spirit. The victory of either can never be the true fulfilment of human birth. Both the arrows must be united to pierce the veil of ignorance. Lo, the victory of victories, the fulfilment of fulfilments, is at our disposal.</p>  </div>
