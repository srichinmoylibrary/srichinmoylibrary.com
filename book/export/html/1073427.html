<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The goal of the seeker is to please the Supreme in His own way. The real seeker will only try to please God in God’s own way. Then if God wants to give that particular seeker Light, Bliss and Peace so that he can offer it to mankind, that is up to God. The real seeker will only try to please God in His own way. His goal is not to have a little Peace or Joy or Love. He wants to reach the Highest and let the Highest decide for him how or what he can offer to the world.</p>  </div>
