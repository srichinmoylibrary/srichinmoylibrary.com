<p>I have only two hands<br /> Which I have used<br /> Millions of times<br /> To give and receive<br /> While I was doing business with God on earth.</p>
<p>I have only two eyes<br /> Which I have used<br /> Millions of times<br /> To admire and be admired<br /> While I was playing with God<br /> In the garden of Paradise.</p>
<p>I have only one heart.<br /> I never use it,<br /> But I always keep it clean<br /> So that if ever God comes in,<br /> I can offer it to Him<br /> For His private use.</p>
