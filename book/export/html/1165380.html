<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I remain silent, then you have to feel that I am inwardly working on the problem. I feel that if I work on it inwardly my help will be more effective. Or I may say to you, "You are being narrow-minded; it is your jealousy that is instigating you to complain." In either case, please feel that I am working on the problem in the manner that is most effective.</p>  </div>
