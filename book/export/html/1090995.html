<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people do enter into seclusion in order to realise God. They do not want to see God in humanity; they only want to see God above. They ignore and negate the world. They practise arduous spiritual disciplines all alone. Eventually they may realise God, the God who is in seclusion, but if their spiritual practice is not integrally done, they become arrogant to some extent.</p>  </div>
