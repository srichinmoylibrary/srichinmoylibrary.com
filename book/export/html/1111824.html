<p>Pulin was the race director for today's marathon. After the race I said to him, "Pulin, that man with the moustache definitely ran in our 24-hour race. Please invite him to run in our next ultramarathon.</p>
<p>Pulin is so divine! He went to a different man, who also had a moustache, and invited him to come to our next 24-hour race.</p>
