<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely. Physical work is the body's prayer, the body's meditation. You can surrender while you are washing dishes, while you are providing any kind of service. If you are surrendered to me, then you become a perfect instrument.</p>
<p>In prayer you go to God and ask Him to please do this or that; and in meditation God comes and tells you what to do. During your prayer you go up so your Father can please and fulfil you; and during your meditation He comes down and asks you to manifest Him. This kind of prayer and meditation you can do in the physical plane while you work. Devoted service is a real form of prayer and meditation. When you do dedicated service, you are performing the task of your soul.</p>  </div>
