<h2>Question: Why is it that I cannot see God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sweetest Stephanie, you see God, but you do not recognise Him. There are many people on earth whom you see, but you do not know who they are. But once somebody tells you who these people are, then later on when you see them you easily recognise them. For example, when you saw a policeman for the first time, you did not know who he was. But once your parents told you, each time you saw a policeman you knew that it was a policeman. Similarly, when you see God, one day either your soul or your Guru will tell you who God is. Also, you have one more eye in between your eyebrows, a little above. Pray to God to open up that eye. Once He opens up that eye, you will not only see God but recognise Him.</p>
<p>If you see through the third eye, you will be able to recognise God easily. But if you see with your two human eyes, then you will not recognise Him. At that time you need either your soul or your Guru to tell you that He whom you have seen is God.</p>  </div>
