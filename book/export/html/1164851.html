<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is true. If your body demands rest, what can you do? You have to be wise. You must try to regulate your life so that you can get adequate sleep. But sometimes the tricky mind and the lethargic body will tell you that you need more sleep when you actually don't. So please try to know whether your body really needs more sleep or whether it is only your mind which is making you feel tired.</p>  </div>
