<p>One day Bama saw a man in the street suffering from severe stomach pains. He had a very serious ailment in his abdomen. When Bama passed by him, he asked Bama to cure him. Bama scolded him most mercilessly. Then he touched the man's stomach and said, "Now you are cured, but lead a good life."</p>
<p>The man said to Bama, "O Master, I know that you are a God-incarnate soul."</p>
<p>Bama immediately replied, "I am not a God-incarnate soul. I am the dust of the dust of my Divine Mother Tara. It is the dust of Her dust that has cured you. I am a mere instrument."</p>  </div>
