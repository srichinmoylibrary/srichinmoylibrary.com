<p>I started the 5-kilometre race in Flushing Meadow Park yesterday evening way at the back. I am always afraid that the other runners will stamp on me when they start. I was just five metres behind Lavanya. Only one person was behind me — a lame, fat man. I felt sorry for him.</p>
<p>Then, one by one, I started passing people. My first victim was Mitali. Mitali is a rogue! As soon as she saw me passing, she stopped and started tying her shoelaces.</p>
<p>After one mile and 400 metres I saw a man with an artificial leg ahead of me. Can you imagine! What was I doing so far back?</p>
<p>Then I saw that Varayuvati and Prasannata were ahead of me. I felt that they were going so slowly, but I wasgoing even slower! Eventually I passed them. I also passed quite a few others.</p>
