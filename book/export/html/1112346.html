<p><em>(John F. Kennedy is making a speech on television.)</em></p>
<p><em>John F. Kennedy:</em> O world-leaders, I wish to tell you all something. I need your one-pointed attention. Together we shall save our planet, or together we shall perish in its flames. Many countrymen have joined me in a ban on atmospheric nuclear tests. And some have not. I offer my most sincere loving gratitude to those countries who have joined me in this world-protecting and world-fulfilling mission. And I place the countries that have not joined us at the Feet of God for their immediate illumination. What more can I say?</p>  </div>
