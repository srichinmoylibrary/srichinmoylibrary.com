  <h1 class="book-heading">Dr. Sisir Kumar Ghose</h1>
  
 
<p>Sisir Ghose lived most of the time in Santiniketan, West Bengal, where he was a Professor of English, an authority on the writings of Rabindranath Tagore and a world-renowned scholar of mysticism. But, from time to time, he used to come and stay at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram.</p>
<p>My beloved Sisir-da was unswervingly kind to me. He was unreservedly affectionate to me. He was unconditionally indulgent to me. He was undoubtedly an Himalayan mentor in my formative years at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. He showed me how an ocean of kowledge-light can at once lovingly and unassumingly play with a very tiny and shallow pond. My heart's gratitude-flames I am most soulfully offering to his heart's compassion-sun. I bow in all humility to a most precious diamond of Tagore's Santiniketan.</p>  </div>
