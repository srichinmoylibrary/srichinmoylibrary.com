<p>Dear Sri Chinmoy,</p>
<p>It gives us great pleasure to invite you as a Visiting Artist to the University of Victoria on June 3, 1998, on behalf of the Faculty of Fine Arts and the Centre for Studies in Religion and Society. We welcome this opportunity to extend our invitation to a poet, artist and musician of your caliber.</p>
<p>We have arranged to hold your Peace Concert in the David Lam Auditorium at 7:30 pm on June 3, and we will display your poetry and Peace Birds in the foyer.</p>
<p>We will be honoured to present you with a plaque entitled Sri Chinmoy: A Student of Peace for sharing your wisdom with millions of people worldwide. Your work is an example of the unimaginable creative potential which we all possess but which we rarely have access.</p>
<p>We feel very happy to be able to sponsor your visit to our campus.</p>
<p>With sincere regards,</p>
<p>David Lam Auditorium<br />University of Victoria</p>
<p>3 June 1998</p>  </div>
