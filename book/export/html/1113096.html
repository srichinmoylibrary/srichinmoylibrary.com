<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why they are rude to others I will not be able to say, but they are not doing the right thing. Yoga means conscious union with God. That means that we have to see and feel the presence of God in others. So if we see and feel the presence of God in others, how can we be rude to them?</p>  </div>
