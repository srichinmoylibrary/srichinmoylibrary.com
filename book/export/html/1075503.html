<p>Is he a saint?<br /> Catch him,<br /> Strike him,<br /> Kill him,<br /> Since he is not<br /> Adding anything<br /> To our world's<br /> Practical and real life.<br /> Ah, he is gone!<br /> He is dead!<br /> His silent gaze<br /> We miss so deeply.<br /> His pure life<br /> We miss so badly.<br /> His heart of compassion<br /> We miss so sadly.<br /> His soul of illumination<br /> We miss so unmistakably.<br /> Alas, he is gone!<br /> No more our saint is with us.</p>
