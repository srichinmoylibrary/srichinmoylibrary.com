<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As soon as you get an idea, you should consider it as a blessing from the Supreme. Creation is realisation; creation is progress. Please take these creative ideas as your own progress. When you get ideas, you have to know that they are creations from another world which want to manifest on the physical plane. When your meditation is over, you should write down the ideas. Afterwards, you can elaborate on them.</p>  </div>
