<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the soul of America and the soul of the world discuss things, they have many suggestions to make, much advice to offer to mankind. But primarily they have one suggestion, one piece of advice to offer and that is, “Move on, move on! The Goal, the ever-transcending Goal, is ahead and not behind.”</p>  </div>
