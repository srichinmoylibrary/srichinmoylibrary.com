<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a most effective path for opening the third eye, but it is not absolutely essential. If you can bring the inner being forward, or if the Supremeâ€™s Grace descends, or if your concentration and will power are most intense, then you can open your third eye without the breathing exercise. Breathing is one of the most effective methods, but you cannot say it is absolutely essential.</p>  </div>
