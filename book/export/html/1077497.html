<p>They say that India long ago lost the Milky Way of greatness. But we know that she has now a colossal hope that the overcast sky will clear at last, revealing again the myriad points of light.</p>
<p>What were the chief causes of India’s downfall? She neglected the body-consciousness and eschewed the material life; she narrowed her outlook and sealed herself up in the outworn rituals of the past; she clung to the festering shell of her ancient culture and succeeded in killing its living, growing spirit. And India’s doom was sealed the day she started these practices.</p>
<p>India began to rise the day she turned away from these tendencies and accepted life in all its dynamic aspects.</p>
<p>India will rise fully the day she becomes self-reliant. She knows well that she cannot achieve her goal if she has to depend permanently on alien help. Self-help is the best help. Self-help is God’s own help in disguise.</p>
<p>India has within her a voice that is the self-same, all-fulfilling voice of God. That voice she simply must hear and act up to.</p>
<p>What is actually meant by the emancipation of the Indian woman? It means that she must no longer be alienated from education. She must have free access to the world-wide knowledge of the present day, in addition to the sacred lore of the past centuries. True education helps us to live in the integral perfection which is the very backbone of our existence on earth. The Indian woman must be given a full opportunity to develop and manifest this perfection.</p>
<p>True, consumed with desires and temptations, Europe rushed towards India to acquire her fabulous wealth. It is equally and absolutely true that Europe’s soul came to India with a spiritual seeking and an occult urge to discover what India was actually like.</p>
<p>India has three world-conquering weapons: Non-Violence, Peace and the Wisdom that tells that she is in All as All is in her.</p>
<p>India’s choice is character. But she must feel that she needs personality as well.</p>
<p>Mother India’s fear is not in atomic bombs but in her children’s Self-forgetful amnesia.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, India has perfectly reconciled in herself the two worst antagonists: Renunciation and Epicurianism.</p>
<p>Perfection was the choice of the Greeks. Proportion was the choice of the Romans. Universality is the choice of the Indians.</p>
<p>India is the voice that never falters. Hers is the truth that cannot be silenced by the threatening darkness of centuries. Hers is the heart that sings perpetually the unity of mankind.</p>
<p>India is the vault of an ancient eternal wisdom that has a universal appeal. She is also the universal reserve-bank of an ever-growing wisdom and is destined to be the hub and dynamo of world transformation.</p>  </div>
