<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I draw upon cosmic energy, universal energy. I meditate for a few seconds or a minute before I lift and from deep within I draw cosmic energy.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> How long does it take to develop that skill?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends entirely on God's Grace. Some seekers have developed it in ten or twelve years, while others may take a lifetime. It depends on the receptivity of the individual.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> What do you think the implications are, besides sporting excellence?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Being a Truth-seeker and God-lover, I feel that if we can pray and meditate daily, punctually and soulfully, then we are bound to acquire boundless energy. This boundless energy we get in order to help us with our prayer, in order to expedite our capacity.</p>  </div>
