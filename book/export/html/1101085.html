<p>Dear seekers, dear sisters and brothers, I am also a seeker like you. We all are in one Boat. Our Goal is one: the Golden Shore of the Beyond. Here we are all members of the same divine family, so I feel that here I can be perfectly safe. Here I don't have to be something other than what I eternally am. What I eternally am is a seeker of the Absolute Truth. You are also the same, seekers of the Eternal Truth walking along Eternity's Shore.</p>
<p>If you have any spiritual questions, I will take them as a golden opportunity to be of service to you. I shall be extremely glad and grateful if you have anything to ask me.</p>  </div>
