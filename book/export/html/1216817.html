<p>On the way to the Taj Mahal I was reading a cute Taj Mahal story. I have read that kind of story before. Many wives are more than eager to die if their husbands are ready to build another Taj Mahal for them. The wives are ready to be immortalised, but the husbands are not ready with the money-power or heart-power.</p>
