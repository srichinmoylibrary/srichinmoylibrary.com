<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Two months ago you accepted our spiritual path. So feel that you are two months old. The day that you accepted the spiritual life was the real birth for you, and not twenty-four or twenty-five years ago when you came into the world. The moment you accept the spiritual life becomes your spiritual birth, a new birth for you, a new incarnation. So if you are only two months old, how can impurity enter into you? It is impossible. Always think how many years you have been with us and how many years you will be with us. Today you are two months old. Now you have to feel that you are an eternal child of God; but consciously you have to feel that you are an eternal child of God. As a child you will always remain pure. So if you say, "I will remain an eternal child of the Supreme," then naturally you will maintain all purity.</p>  </div>
