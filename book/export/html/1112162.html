<p>Today, while I was out running I saw a very nice car parked near Flushing Meadow Park. I said to myself, "These people keep their car so clean! I shall have to bless the car."</p>
<p>I put my left hand on the car to bless it. But then, O God, all my fingers became dirty!</p>
<p>From a distance, the car looked so nice.</p>
