<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, everybody has his own <em>mantra</em>. There are many, many Sanskrit <em>mantras</em>. A <em>mantra</em> can be only one syllable, or it can be a group of syllables or a sentence. But in the Indian scriptures it is said that if you want mental illumination, you can practice the <em>mantra</em>. If you want purity, you can use this <em>mantra</em>. If you want some other quality you can also use this <em>mantra</em>. AUM is a <em>mantra</em> which is most effective for anything and for anybody.</p>  </div>
