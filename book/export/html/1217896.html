<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now, I am staying at our Aum Centre. It is located at 659 Miramar Avenue. We are holding classes and meditations every night. The President of the Centre is Miss Carmen Suro. Our telephone number is 724-7286.</p>
<p>Thank you very much. Master Chinmoy, for your kindness to us and we hope that you will be visiting Puerto Rico very often. You are helping so many people. Thank you very much.</p>  </div>
