<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My simple answer to this question is that it is up to you what to believe or not to believe. If you believe what the Bible says, then you believe that if you do not follow its teachings, you will go to hell. But if you don't believe it, then you are not obliged to do what the book says.</p>
<p>There have been many spiritual Masters of the highest order on earth. The Christ was not the only one. Before him was the Buddha, and before the Buddha was Sri Krishna. A number of spiritual Masters of the very highest order have walked on earth. Recently there were Sri Ramakrishna and Sri Aurobindo. But if you believe that particular teaching of the Bible, it is up to you. If you believe it, prepare yourself divinely so that you can immediately go to Heaven, or prepare yourself to take your punishment.</p>
<p>Heaven and hell are largely in our mind. If you treasure a good thought, then you are creating Heaven. If you cry to God for Light, then you get a good experience, an illumining experience, and this experience is nothing but Heaven. Again, if you treasure a negative thought, then you are creating hell. Heaven and hell can be experienced every day.</p>  </div>
