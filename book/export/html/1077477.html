<p>All riddles of life can be unriddled, for a sweet concord in secret sports within us mortals.</p>
<p>It is a true truth that life was fast asleep in matter, and mind was fast asleep in life; now without the least hesitation we can say that something lies fast asleep in mind. The wheel of evolution ever moves — it stops not.</p>
<p>Fast asleep in mind lies the Consciousness Divine, fully illumined and patiently awaiting the moment of its unveiling.</p>
<p>When will Nature stop working? She will stop working only when she sees Immortality marching across the giant breast of Death.</p>
<p>Matter is the pride of Europe. Spirit is the pride of India. Neither of the two can possess a complete satisfaction, for the former is in the dark about the potentialities of the Spirit, and the latter about the cogency of Matter. There can be no abiding happiness until Matter and Spirit are amalgamated into one Reality.</p>
<p>Agnosticism is of various types. Fruitful agnosticism has every right to its own teeming knowledge. It is from agnosticism that we come to suspect that an Unknowable Reality engenders all our values: physical, intellectual and spiritual.</p>
<p>We ought to feel extremely happy at the thought that materialism today is no longer an impediment to our upward journey. At most it has the power to make us suffer an indefinite delay. True knowledge has become its soul’s real need.</p>
<p>If we cast aside the pall of ignorance and don the robe of knowledge, we find matter, life and mind to be nothing but energy. Though each has a world of its own, there is no yawning chasm separating them.</p>
<p>From its very beginning, Consciousness has been consumed with the snow-white desire to bestow on man a deathless Life, an infinite Knowledge, and an omnipotent Power.</p>
<p>God, the Inner Pilot, hides within us with His Vision of Unity, Omniscience and Omnipotence. And in His own time, He will appear before us. Doubtless we are ignorant of our ultimate aim. Yet for all our ignorance, we are proceeding in all our activities towards our Goal.</p>  </div>
