<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's Blessings are always unconditional. He gives us Peace, Light, Bliss and Power according to the capacity of our receptivity. He gives us always in an unconditional way. But if we offer Him our gratitude, then His gifts increase. He will give us one dollar unconditionally, but if we offer Him gratitude, then He will give us ten dollars. It is not that He wants something from us; but if we accept His gifts wholeheartedly and devotedly, then He is pleased and He gives us more. When He gives us a little bit of Peace we do not have to give Him something in return. No, He is giving just because He feels like giving. It is not even because we have cried for the thing. But if we accept His gift with joy, with love, with gratitude, then His satisfaction in us increases. If we take it with joy and gratitude, then He gives us much more because He feels that in us His gift will grow and grow. In us His Capacity will grow, His Light will grow, His Divinity will grow and grow, whereas in somebody else they will be suffocated.</p>
<p>But even if we do not accept His Blessings with gratitude, even if we take them ungratefully and don't pay any attention to them, still He will continue giving to us in the same unconditional way. Even then He offers Himself, because He feels that if He does not give to ungrateful people, then their very life will be totally destroyed. So out of His infinite Bounty He gives to everyone, and according to their receptivity, everybody receives. But while receiving, if one offers gratitude, love and joy, naturally his receptivity will increase. God feels that there is a passage, a door, that is wide open in him. God can come in at any moment and remain inside the room, and there He can grow most easily because the gratitude of the seeker nourishes and cherishes God's Blessing-Seeds.</p>  </div>
