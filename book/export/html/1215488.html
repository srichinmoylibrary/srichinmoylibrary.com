<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Regularity is of paramount importance. Every day we eat at least twice, if not three times, to satisfy the demands of our physical body. Similarly, we have to meditate every day to nourish our soul, our inner existence. So, let us do the first thing first. Since the soul was created before the body, we have to think of the child who came into the family first. If we think of the body before we think of the soul, we are putting the cart before the horse. So at least twice a day every sincere seeker should meditate.</p>  </div>
