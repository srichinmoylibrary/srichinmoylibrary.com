<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we doubt God, it becomes more difficult for us to receive good things from Him. Now the question comes, do we want anything from God or not? If we really need something from God, then do we not have to please Him? God does not mind if we doubt Him. But if we have faith in Him, it will be easier for Him to give us what we actually need.</p>
<p>God is beyond our doubt and faith. If we doubt God, it does not affect Him. But if we love God and if we have faith in Him, then it becomes infinitely easier for us to receive His Love, Affection, Compassion and Joy. If I need ten dollars but I doubt that my friend has any money at all, then how am I going to get money from him? I will not even ask him because I do not believe that he can give me ten dollars. But if I have faith that he has a hundred dollars or even more and that he will definitely give me something since I am asking him, then definitely he will give it to me. Similarly, if we doubt that God exists, or if we doubt what He has to offer us, then we will not ask Him for any of His divine qualities. If we doubt that God is good, why should we ask God to make us good or to make us happy?</p>  </div>
