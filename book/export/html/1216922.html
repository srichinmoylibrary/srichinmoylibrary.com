<p>The Ashram charges only 200 or 225 rupees to take me from Madras to Pondicherry. I had told the driver at the airport that I would give him 450 rupees for the ride. That is about double what the Ashram charges.</p>
<p>But even then, that man didn't trust me. "In case anything happens, could you give me some money in advance?" he asked. What was going to happen? But to prove my innocence, I gave him 100 rupees.</p>
<p>But then look what happened! After so many hours, still he could not take me all the way to Pondicherry. I gave him his full 450 rupees, but I was so disgusted.</p>
