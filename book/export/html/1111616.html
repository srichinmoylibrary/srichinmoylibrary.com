<p>In the two-mile race at the park where Cahit's running club practices, I will never forget that my first rival was Mitali. Next came Melissa and third was Amita. Then at the end it was Lavanya. I was telling her to go and she was telling me to go. In this way we finished the race. After the race the singers sang the song about Cahit.</p>
