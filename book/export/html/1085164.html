<p>My Supreme, my dear Supreme,<br /> My Lord Supreme and my Beloved Supreme,<br /> Over the years, out of Your infinite Bounty,<br /> You have shown me innumerable ways<br /> To please You in Your own Way.<br /> But today do tell me<br /> Which is at once the easiest and fastest way<br /> To please You in Your own Way.</p>
<p>"My child, My sweet child,<br /> My Divinity's child<br /> And My Immortality's child,<br /> For you, the easiest and fastest way<br /> To please Me<br /> Is to sincerely feel<br /> In the inmost recesses of your heart<br /> That I love you sleeplessly,<br /> Compassionately, blessingfully<br /> And unconditionally.</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> Your soulful question has deeply pleased Me. <br /> Therefore, I am telling you<br /> A most secret and sacred Dream of Mine.<br /> Every night, without fail,<br /> I have one single Dream.<br /> In My Dream I clearly and unmistakably see <br /> That you have become<br /> An absolutely perfect instrument of Mine."</p>
