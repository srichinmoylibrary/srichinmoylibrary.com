<p><em>(Aurobindo's residence. August 15, 1913. Birthday celebration. A small gathering. Amrita pays his homage to Aurobindo for the first time. Time: 5:15 p.m. One of the callers garlands Aurobindo amidst cheers.</em></p>
<p><em>The guests are seated in rows and served with sweets. Aurobindo slowly passes by, facing each of the party for a moment. Amrita's eyes sparkle with delight. After the repast, the guests take leave of Aurobindo one by one. Amrita stays on.)</em></p>
<p>IYENGAR: <em>(To Amrita)</em> You would see Babu privately?</p>
<p>AMRITA: That's what my heart longs for.</p>
<p>IYENGAR: Then you'll have to wait some time more. Three important persons, Bharati, Srinivasachari and V.V.S. Ayer, are expected. Do you want to meet Babu with them or with the inmates?</p>
<p>AMRITA: Preferably with the inmates.</p>
<p>IYENGAR: If so, you must wait.</p>
<p><em>(As these three leave after paying homage to Aurobindo they glance at Amrita with a shade of curiosity in their eyes as if to know if he wanted to be one of Aurobindo's inmates.</em></p>
<p><em>Time: 8:15 p.m. Aurobindo at a table. Amrita goes into Aurobindo's Presence with folded hands, walks around him and finally stands in front for a moment, their eyes meeting. Aurobindo signals to an inmate to give Amrita a sweet Amrita withdraws from the Presence, visibly moved.)</em></p>  </div>
