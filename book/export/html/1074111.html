    <title>&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; When we were listening to your synthesizer the other day, it seemed like different qualities were coming forward in different parts, and I was just wondering if you wanted to tell us anything about what was happening inwardly?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not a matter of telling; it is a matter of feeling. One person will feel that it is thundering. Somebody else will feel that a flute is being played. If you like thunder-roar, you will appreciate that part. If you like the sweet melody of the flute, you will appreciate that.</p>  </div>
