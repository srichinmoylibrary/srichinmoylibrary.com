<p>Every day my dear Supreme, my sweet Supreme,<br /> And my Beloved Supreme<br /> Comes to me seven times:<br /> The first time, He comes to examine my willingness.<br /> The second time, He comes to examine my readiness.<br /> The third time, He comes to examine my newness.<br /> The fourth time, He comes to examine my oneness.<br /> The fifth time, He comes to examine my fulness.<br /> The sixth time, He comes to examine my perfection.<br /> The seventh time, He comes to examine my satisfaction.</p>
