<p>I was not happy,<br /> Although my fame reached<br /> Unprecedented heights.<br /> I was not happy,<br /> Although the world kissed<br /> The dust of my feet.<br /> I was not happy,<br /> Although God offered me<br /> His Transcendental Pride.<br /> But now I am happy,<br /> Because<br /> The Blossoms of my service-tree<br /> Have all been devoured<br /> By man's ignorance-night and<br /> God's Blessing-Light.</p>
