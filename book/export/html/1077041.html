<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If they are bad dreams, do not try to remember them at all. On the contrary, forget about them immediately! The sooner you forget, the better it is for you in every plane of consciousness. But if it is a good dream, remember it, but do not give undue value to the dream. That is to say, donâ€™t think of the dream all the time and forget about your reality-life, which demands your conscious and constant attention. But if you remember the dream inside your heart, it will give you joy, inspiration and aspiration so that in your reality-life you can be more devoted, spiritual, divine and perfect.</p>  </div>
