<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God did not use the word ‘artistic’ at that time. Only He thought that what He wanted was to manifest His Dream, His Vision. When we say ‘artistic’, immediately we bring the creation down to the mental level. But if you see the creation as the expression or the revelation or the manifestation of God’s Vision, that is a better way to describe what God actually did. You have to say that God created nature with the view of manifesting His Dream as Reality. His Dream in the beginning was unreal, but He wanted to make it real to us by bringing it into the earth-consciousness and manifesting it as something tangible.</p>  </div>
