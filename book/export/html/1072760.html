<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am sorry that you find it difficult to be punctual. Punctuality in the spiritual life is of paramount importance. When God knocks at your door at a fixed hour, if you donâ€™t respond to Him, you will not be able to run the fastest and dive the deepest and fly the highest at His Choice Hour. Naturally the sincere seeker in you will feel miserable that you have not pleased God at the appointed hour. Regularity is good; punctuality is far better. Along with regularity and punctuality, if there is aspiration, then that is by far the best.</p>  </div>
