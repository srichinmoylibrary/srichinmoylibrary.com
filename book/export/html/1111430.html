<p>Today I rode in Vinaya's sauna-car for about an hour and a half. Chetana also came with us. When I finally got out of the car to run, some dogs came and frightened me, so Chetana got out to frighten the dogs. She was shouting at the dogs, "Get away!"</p>
<p>Not only dogs, but also children were so bad today, throwing snowballs at me! One snowball just missed my head and fell on my hand instead.</p>
