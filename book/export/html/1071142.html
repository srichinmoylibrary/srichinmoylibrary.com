<p>I have selected 207 poems out of 10,000 from my series, <em>Ten thousand Flower-Flames</em>, which was originally published in 100 volumes. Here the poet in me is soulfully satisfied, the reader in me is smilingly satisfied and the critic in me is surprisingly satisfied.</p>
<p>My Beloved Supreme, what more can I tell You, and what more do You expect from me?</p>
<p>"Be quiet, My poet-reader-critic-son. The Hour, My Hour, is about to strike."</p>
<p>â€” Sri Chinmoy</p>  </div>
