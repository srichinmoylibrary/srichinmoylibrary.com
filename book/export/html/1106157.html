<p>The greatest joy comes always from attempting something. If we can have patience or stupidity enough to continue our attempts, then we are really something. The whole world will laugh at me, including my spiritual children, but I have put 313 pounds on one dumbbell and 410 on another. Yesterday I had a long comic conversation with the Supreme while trying to lift 410 pounds. We said such cute things. So yesterday I started!</p>
