<p>"Father, tell me frankly, do my spiritual children really love me?"</p>
<p>"Son, tell Me secretly, do you unreservedly love them?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Father, I do. If not, I would have begged You, and forced You in Your unconditional Compassion to take me to the other world."</p>
<p>"Son, you are right, you are absolutely right. Now, tell me, when you are in a cheerful frame of mind, what do you think of your children? What do you think of their love?"</p>
<p>"Father, I think they are trying, I feel they are trying."</p>
<p>"Son, I know they are succeeding. I assure you they are succeeding."</p>  </div>
