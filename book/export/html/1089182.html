    <title>&lt;em&gt;Seko:&lt;/em&gt; If one feels that 40K is a very long run, an extraordinary distance, then one cannot be called a marathon runner. A marathon runner shouldn&#039;t fear distance.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> So, Pahar, now you try.</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> Fifty miles a week is not enough.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now he has to do 100 miles a week?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> And also he should do a long run of 20 miles at least once a week. Then the rest of the week he can do shorter distances.</p>
<p><em>Pahar:</em> Two runs a day?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> That is the best. One in the morning and one in the afternoon or evening.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Shorter distances.</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> Then, once a week he should do speed work. Three times in one session he should run 5000-metre intervals in order to run a 2:30 marathon.As soon as my injury stops giving me problems, at the beginning of next year, I will start seriously training for the marathon. After my marriage, I stopped participating in races, so the world is saying that I have become lazy. I have to be careful so that people do not say that my wife is preventing me from participating in marathons. So I would like to start again participating in marathons.</p>  </div>
