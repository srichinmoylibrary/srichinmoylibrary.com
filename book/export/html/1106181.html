<p>This morning, when I lifted 360 pounds for the first time, my mother’s soul came. My eyes were wide open and she was facing me. As I was lifting it, she was watching me very seriously, not fearfully but with such seriousness. Was I lifting the weight or was I only looking at my mother? I did not know if she was happy or displeased.</p>
<p>On the fourth attempt — which was my best lift — both my father and my mother came even before I concentrated. This time, my mother was smiling and my father looked very serious. Then they both left.</p>
<p>I never do five lifts in the morning. It is always four. But today, after the fourth lift, I was so happy that I wanted to do another one. O God, I couldn’t do it! This time, my mother and father had gone away. They had no time to wait.</p>
<p>If you see this kind of thing — father and mother — how can you concentrate? You get such joy, it either ruins your concentration or you get extra energy.</p>
