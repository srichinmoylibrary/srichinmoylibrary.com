<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Physically I do not think they will be able to live there, because that plane is not for the physical. People can go there only with their subtle bodies. Again, who knows the future? But right now our physical is not ready. If we go just a little above the earth, we freeze to death.</p>  </div>
