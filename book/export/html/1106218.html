<p>The day after we inaugurated the meditation at the British Parliament, we went to visit Jim Smith, the Registrar of Records for the British Amateur Weight Lifters’ Association. He lives about an hour and a half from London on a farm. There he has a flock of sheep and some cows. One of the rams was very bad-tempered, so he had to grab it by the horns. He used the word “nasty” when talking about the ram.</p>
<p>He also has six or seven ducks which he wanted to show me. I said, “Oh, this reminds me of my Chittagong days. Every week there I used to eat duck and duck eggs.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t believe it. He never eats duck, but he eats chicken and chicken eggs, which I never ate. He said he also eats fish. I said, “I used to eat fish every day. And until the age of 11 or 12, I used to eat turtle and duck.”</p>
