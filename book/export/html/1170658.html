<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Before, the sun was dissatisfied; now, it is disheartened. If, year after year, you try to give something to an individual and he does not take it, then you feel miserable. The sun rises each morning, but how many people get up at five o'clock or six o'clock to meditate? We easily can keep a few windows open to let in the light, but we keep them all closed. In how many ways we are rejecting the arrival of the sun in front of our eyes and inside our hearts. It is like a spiritual Master who is trying to make his disciples perfect. First he is disappointed; then he becomes disheartened. So how long can our sun be rejected?</p>  </div>
