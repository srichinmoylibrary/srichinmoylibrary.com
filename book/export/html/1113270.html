<p>At eight-thirty a.m. I presented Amrita-da with my poem translated into English by Nolini-da. He was extremely moved. He was speechless and did not want to descend to his usual humorous consciousness. In a high, contemplative mood, he said: "In silence I am telling you what I want to say about this poem."</p>
<p>After a few moments he said: "Chinmoy, today I will give you the best sweets, made by the best sweet-maker. Do you know who she is?"</p>
<p>"How can I know? Please tell me."</p>
<p>"She is our Shibarani, the Ashram's Shibarani, the Mother's Shibarani."</p>
<p>Later, I entered Nolini-da's room to work. He said to me: "Today we must observe Amrita's birthday. Here is a huge cake. Go and give it to him. We shall invite his dear ones to his room."</p>
<p>Then I showed Nolini-da the group picture taken on my birthday. He was very pleased. He said to me: "I need three copies: one for the Mother and two for myself."</p>
<p>Robi-da-also wrote a poem in Bengali about Amrita-da and asked his father to translate it into English. Nolini-da's translation of Robi-da's poem was also extremely beautiful.</p>  </div>
