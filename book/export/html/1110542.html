<p>Music has such capacity to inspire us. As soon as you hear Tagore’s Bengali songs, his prayerful and soulful songs, you enter into a good mood. You do not have to know Bengali. Thousands and thousands of people who do not know Bengali listen to his songs. Why is it that all over India Tagore’s songs are heard on the radio? Does a Gujarati understand Bengali? Tagore’s Bengali songs help the listeners considerably. After hearing his songs, they have some peace, poise and joy within. They do not have to know Bengali. Music is a universal language.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
