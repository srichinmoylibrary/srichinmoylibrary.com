<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is up to me. I can be fully aware if I want to be. But I do not always want to be aware. With my human eyes I can look at something and see it, but I do not have to absorb it. I am looking at my picture now, but I do not want to see whether I have a garland on. My inner beings can do that job. I have faith in them. They are very good instruments. My physical body may enjoy relaxation by spending time talking to you, but the spiritual inside me has no rest.</p>  </div>
