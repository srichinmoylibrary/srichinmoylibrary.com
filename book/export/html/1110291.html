<h2><em>Professor Joan Chatfield:</em> God has created us all in the image and likeness of God. But why is there such a discrepancy in the way that we human beings think about ourselves? We like to think of ourselves as so much better than our fellow human beings. Why do we like to foster our blatant elitism?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, the real God creates us all in the image and likeness of Himself, but we have accepted the false god — our mind — as our real boss. The limited mind wants to exert its supremacy over each and every thing and over each and every person. The ordinary human mind has not studied and does not want to study the oneness-philosophy-course. It wants to satisfy itself either through superiority or through separativity. But, alas, neither superiority nor separativity can satisfy the poor self-styled mind-god.</p>  </div>
