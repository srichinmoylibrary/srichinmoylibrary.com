SCA 962-978. Excerpts from an interview with Nils Lodin of <em>Spring-Time</em>, a Swedish running magazine, which took place at the United Nations on 26 October 1982, two days after both Mr. Lodin and Sri Chinmoy had run the New York City Marathon.</p>
<h2>Sri Chinmoy: Congratulations on your marathon! You did so well! Was it your best time?</h2>

<p><em>Nils Lodin:</em> Yes, it was my best time by about 55 seconds, but I feel that I could have done better.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It is always best to think that way. Then you can have hope and determination to do better in the future.</p>  </div>
