<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to deal with people who are actively opposed to the United Nations with perseverance, tolerance and forgiveness. If we have perseverance, then that is our first step towards world harmony. If we have tolerance, then we have put forward the second step; and if we can forgive then we have made the third and ultimate step.</p>
<p>So, with perseverance, tolerance and forgiveness we can eventually illumine people who are actively opposed to the ideas and ideals of the United Nations.</p>  </div>
