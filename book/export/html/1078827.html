<p>It is never too late for me to become a good instrument of God.</p>
<p>It is never too late for me to pray to God and to meditate on God in the small hours of the morning.</p>
<p>It is never too late for me to serve my Beloved Supreme inside my brothers and sisters — mankind.</p>
<p>It is never too late for me to love my sisters and brothers — humanity — inside my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>It is never too late for me to tell my sweet Lord that I am only for Him. Him to see face to face, Him to love, serve and fulfil, for this I saw the light of day.</p>
<p>It is never too late for me to learn what I truly am in the inner world and to unlearn what I truly am not in the outer world.</p>
<p>Finally, it is never too late for me not only to have a heart to heart talk with my Inner Pilot, but also to grow into His very image. I know that my Lord Supreme will be pleased with me totally only when I become like Him, another God, for what He wants from me is an equal share. He wants me to be His compatriot and not His slave.</p>
<p>Yes, there is one thing which it is too late for, and because I am too late for that, I am infinitely grateful to my Beloved Supreme. And what is that thing? It is my desire-life. It is too late for me to go back to my desire-life. Something more which is also true: I shall never be able to go back to the animal kingdom, never!</p>
