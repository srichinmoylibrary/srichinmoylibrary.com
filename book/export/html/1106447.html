<p>Todayâ€™s 600-pound lift was better than the day before yesterday, but it is still not as high as it was previously. I do not know what has gone wrong. It seems to me that my push is stronger than my pull. If I can make the pull stronger, then I will have more balance and I will be able to lift higher. Also my quadriceps are stronger then my hamstrings. I need to make my hamstrings stronger!</p>
