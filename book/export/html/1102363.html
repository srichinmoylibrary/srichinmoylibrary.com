<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The seeker's responsibility at the United Nations is to pray for and meditate on those who have served or are still serving the United Nations most devotedly and soulfully in any capacity. I feel that former Secretaries-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld and U Thant should receive special gratitude from the seekers who are now serving the United Nations, for they were exemplary world-servers. We should pray for the souls who have served the United Nations in the past, for those who are still serving, and for those who will join the United Nations and sing the unity-song in the future. In this way, we can connect the past glory, present promise and future achievements of the United Nations.</p>  </div>
