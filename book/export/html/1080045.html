<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, but one has to know here what religion is. Religion is a code of life that connects one with the rest of humanity. If one feels that his life has a special connection with others' lives, then only can he achieve or try to achieve oneness. First he has to feel an inner connection. If he starts with this connection, then only can he think of establishing his inseparable oneness with others.</p>
<p>So, if you follow any specific religion, then you will feel that you have something in common with others, that you have an inner connection with others. Then, from this connection you have to go deep within in order to establish your inseparable oneness with others and with the rest of the world. And when you establish your oneness, naturally what you see inside you and around you is brotherhood and love.</p>  </div>
