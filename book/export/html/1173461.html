<p>When my life was long in aspiration<br /> My Lord invited me to see His Eye.</p>
<p>When my life was long in dedication<br /> My Lord invited me to feel His Heart.</p>
<p>When my life was long in surrender<br /> My Lord invited me to sit at His Feet.</p>
<p>When my life was long in gratitude<br /> My Lord invited me to sing with Him.</p>
