<p>Someone is knocking -<br /> Perhaps God.<br /> God can wait;<br /> After all, He deals with Eternity.</p>
<p>Someone is knocking -<br /> Perhaps man.<br /> I am sure he can't wait,<br /> Since he has only<br /> A fleeting second<br /> At his disposal.<br /> Therefore,<br /> Let me go and open the door.</p>
<p>Someone is knocking -<br /> Perhaps Satan.<br /> Ah, he just breaks open the door.</p>
<p>God, You are kind to me.<br /> Man, I am kind to you.<br /> Satan, you are really something,<br /> You are really impossible!</p>
