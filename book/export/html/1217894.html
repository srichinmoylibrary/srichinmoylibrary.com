<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is my sole aim. They are ready, they are fit and they are able to enter into the inner life. Some of them are actually moving fast across the path of the spiritual life. To my sorrow, there are some who are not aware of their inner aspiration. So I wish to make them conscious of what they are truly doing.</p>  </div>
