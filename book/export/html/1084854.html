<p>He realised that his earth-fate<br />   Was too powerful;<br />        Therefore<br /> He gave up fighting<br />   In the battlefield of life.</p>
<p>He has realised that his Heaven-gate<br />   Is wide open;<br />        Therefore<br /> He has started running fast, faster, fastest<br />   To his destined goal.</p>
