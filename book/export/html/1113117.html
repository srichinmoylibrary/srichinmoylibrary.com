<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each person has likes and dislikes. If you like someone, then you talk and mix with that person and he becomes your friend. In the spiritual life also, when you look at a Guru, if you feel some inner affinity, if you feel that he is someone whom you can trust or that he has the thing that you want or need, then you will know that he is meant for you. The moment you see him, if you get a kind of confidence in him and also a kind of confidence in yourself, a feeling that you will be able to listen to him, then he is the real Master for you.</p>  </div>
