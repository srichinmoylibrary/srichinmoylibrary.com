<p>I went to a fabric store this afternoon. As soon as I entered into the store, the owner showed me that he had "Silence Speaks," my daily meditations, in his store. He said he was so happy to have "Silence Speaks" in his store, and I also was so happy.</p>
<p>He told Pahar that in one "Silence Speaks" picture-where I am feeding the lamb-I am more visible, while in the other pictures I am not at all visible. He showed me two pictures and said, "Here I recognise you, but there you are barely visible." For me it was all the same, but fortunately the right person was hearing it, since Pahar is the printer.</p>
