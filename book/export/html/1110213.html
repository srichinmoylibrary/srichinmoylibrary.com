<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! What we badly need is peace. This is not the problem of an individual or a particular country. It is a collective problem. The whole world, throughout its length and breadth, needs peace desperately. Somebody has to start; then from one it spreads to many. When we enter into a garden, we can see many, many flowers. Each flower blossoms slowly and steadily â€” petal by petal. In exactly the same way, peace also will blossom. It will not happen all of a sudden.</p>  </div>
