<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Working at the United Nations does give us a special sense of responsibility. The United Nations is the vision of world-unity, which will eventually be manifested as a divine reality. When we work for a higher cause such as this, naturally we get a more powerful sense of responsibility. This sense of responsibility eventually leads to astonishing self-perfection. And what is self-perfection? The self-perfection of mankind is God's complete Satisfaction inside the heart of humanity.</p>  </div>
