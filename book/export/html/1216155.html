<p>The other day God asked me<br /> What I was aspiring for.<br /> I said, "I would like<br /> To offer infinite praises to man."<br /> He immediately granted my prayer.</p>
<p>The other night man asked me<br /> What I was aspiring for.<br /> I said, "I would like<br /> To become the dead dust of God's Feet."<br /> Man's answer: "How dare you think<br /> God would condescend to grant you<br /> Such a mighty prayer?"</p>
