<h2>Editor's note</h2>

<p><em>From December 1976 to June 1977 Sri Chinmoy offered a series of aphorisms at his weekly prayer and meditation sessions at the United Nations. This series was entitled “To-morrow’s Noon.” These aphorisms highlight Sri Chinmoy’s love of the English language. They were originally published serially in Meditation at the United Nations (the Monthly Bulletin of the Meditation Group).</em></p>  </div>
