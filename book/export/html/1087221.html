<p>I was in an Indian sweet shop in Bayside yesterday buying jalabee for prasad. A young man recognised me and was so surprised. He said, "Oh boy!"</p>
<p>Then he saw Databir and asked, "How could Sri Chinmoy come here and go shopping?"</p>
<p>He has come twice to our meditations at P.S. 86 and is used to seeing me in my high meditative consciousness. He couldn't believe that I was standing in front of the counter buying jalabee.</p>
