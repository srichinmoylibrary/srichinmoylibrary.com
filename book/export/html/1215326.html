<p>Early in the morning I was inspired to go out walking on the sidewalk here in San Francisco. After I had walked for 33 minutes, whom did I see? Garima. Then I had such an experience. I saw one man. He was not a vagabond. He was quite well dressed, but he was lying down on the sidewalk, munching something so happily. I prayed to God to make me as happy as that man.</p>
<p>I came and stood right in front of him, not even one metre away. I said to him, "How I wish I could lie down in the street like you! You have peace, you have joy. How I wish I could exchange my life with yours."</p>
<p>He did not say anything. He was in his own world of happiness.</p>
