<p>In those days, elderly women were so kind to me. One old lady from the Bronx became my grandmother. She wanted to go to India. She came to apply for her visa and saw me there. Then she came to the Consulate many times. She used to bring yoghurt for me to eat. Once or twice she scolded me for not eating her food. She was short, but she used to grab me by the shoulder when she came to see me. She took me to the Bronx two or three times to eat her food. At that time she was around seventy years of age. She used to eat meat, fish and all that. I said, “I cannot eat these things.” So she always kept some yoghurt for me.</p>
<p>Afterwards, what happened to her? Where did she go? She went out of my life.</p>  </div>
