SCA 694-702. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 9 March 1993.</p>
<h2>Question: When I am aware that an undivine quality is manifesting itself in and though me, how can I illumine it?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can illumine an undivine quality only by invoking more consciously and more devotedly the Compassion of our Lord Supreme. If Compassion descends, then the undivine forces, undivine qualities, will not be able to manifest themselves. On the contrary, they will be transformed and illumined by the Compassion. What we need is more Compassion from God, and this Compassion we will get only by shedding tears of gratitude to God.</p>  </div>
