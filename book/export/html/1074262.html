  <h1 class="book-heading">The core of India&#039;s Light, part 1</h1>
  
   <div id="node-1074263" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1. Nama-Rupa</h1>
  
 

<p>Idea is what I am. Form is what I have. Essence is my God-Silence. Substance is my God-Sound.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074264" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2. Deva</h1>
  
 

<p>A <em>deva</em> is he who is at once a never-changing Reality and an ever-transcending Beauty. He is an experience of God-hunger on earth and a realisation of God-feast in Heaven.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074265" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3. Ahimsa</h1>
  
 

<p>What is non-violence? Heaven’s soul-flower and earth’s heart-fragrance.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074266" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4. Svarajya</h1>
  
 

<p>When I live in the night of my body, I cry for my ego’s dictatorship. I think that only freedom of my lower nature can fulfil me.</p>
<p>When I live in the light of my soul, I discover that only God-rule over my entire earth-field is my real freedom, my divinity’s eternal freedom.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074267" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5. Karma</h1>
  
 

<p>A self-giving action is a God-manifesting dream.</p>
<p>A self-indulging action is a Satan-strangling reality.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074268" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6. Kama</h1>
  
 

<p>Body-pleasure is death-construction and life-destruction, earth’s success-suspension, Heaven’s progress-procrastination and God’s Love-consumption.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074269" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7. Dharma</h1>
  
 

<p>I need only God. He is my Eternity’s All in everything that I say, do and become. Self-discovery is life-recovery. God for God’s sake. I am of God’s eternal Cry. I am for God’s universal Smile.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074270" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8. Tat Tvam Asi</h1>
  
 

<p>Thou art the Silence-Smile-Transcendence. Thou art the Sound-Cry-Immanence.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074271" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9. Yato Dharmastato Jayah</h1>
  
 

<p><em>Dharma</em> is God-invocation and God-acceptance in God’s own Way. Victory is life-perfection and self-transcendence.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074272" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10. Paramahamsa</h1>
  
 

<p><em>Paramahamsa</em> is a liberated soul. He is liberated from the meshes of ignorance.</p>
<p><em>Paramahamsa</em> is a realised soul. He has discovered and realised his conscious and constant oneness with the Absolute Supreme.</p>
<p><em>Paramahamsa</em> is a peerless Yogi. He is the supreme instrument of God.</p>
<p><em>Paramahamsa</em> is an Avatar. He is God’s highest and most powerful representative on earth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074273" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11. Avidya-Vidya</h1>
  
 

<p><em>Avidya</em> is ignorance-desire-world.</p>
<p><em>Vidya</em> is knowledge-aspiration-world.</p>
<p><em>Avidya</em> tells us what we are: death’s dole. <em>Vidya</em> tells us what we are: Immortality’s Life-Flow, Infinity’s Love-Light, Eternity’s Silence-Height.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074274" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12. Purusha</h1>
  
 

<p><em>Purusha</em> is the dweller in the body, the form. <em>Purusha</em> is the dweller in the soul, the spirit.</p>
<p>From <em>Purusha</em> in the body we discover the Universal Life. From <em>Purusha</em> in the soul we discover the Transcendental Breath.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074275" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13. Prakrti</h1>
  
 

<p><em>Prakrti</em> is Mother-Nature. <em>Prakrti</em> is God the Mother.</p>
<p><em>Prakrti’s</em> Love-Light is humanity’s emancipation-perfection and Divinity’s Satisfaction-Manifestation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074276" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14. Sat-Chit-Ananda</h1>
  
 

<p>Existence is Eternity. Consciousness is Infinity. Bliss is Immortality.</p>
<p>Eternity is the Compassion-Face of the Supreme. Infinity is the Perfection-Smile of the Supreme. Immortality is the Oneness-Light of the Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074277" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15. Abhava</h1>
  
 

<p>Yesterday I saw God going out of my existence. Today I see ignorance going out of my existence. Tomorrow I shall see God alone in my awakened existence. The day after tomorrow I shall without fail see my unconditionally surrendered presence in God’s immortalising Delight-Existence.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074278" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16. Abhayam</h1>
  
 

<p>Man has no fear of the true truth that his body-reality is of God-Consciousness. He has fear because he is not aware of the true truth that his vital-incapacity wants to stay without God-Consciousness. He has fear because he is not aware of the true truth that his mind-concentration is not on God-Consciousness. He has fear because he is not aware of the true truth that his heart-love is not for God-Reality.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074279" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17. Achala</h1>
  
 

<p>If we really need God’s infinite Love, Peace, Light and Delight, then an inner motionless life we must embody and an outer life of dynamic motion we must reveal. How can we do that? We can do it only by meditating on God in divinity and by serving God in humanity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074280" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18. Acharya</h1>
  
 

<p>An ordinary teacher gives to his students what he has: knowledge. A spiritual Teacher gives to his disciples not only what he has but also what God has and what God is. What the Teacher has for his disciples is concern. What God has for his disciples is Compassion-Light. What God is for his disciples is Perfection-Delight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074281" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19. Achynta</h1>
  
 

<p>We want always to remain unfallen from our divine and supreme nature which is God-Oneness in God-Perfection; therefore, we must always remember that we are the hero-warriors of the Supreme for the Supreme. <em>Achyuta</em> is also an epithet of Vishnu or Krishna.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074282" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20. Adesa</h1>
  
 

<p>God’s inner Command to a supremely sincere seeker is: “My child, declare to the world at large that you are not only of My Transcendental Reality and for My Universal Reality but you are also My eternal partner, a co-sharer of our cosmic Dream-Reality.”</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074283" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">21. Abheda</h1>
  
 

<p>The absence of difference is the presence of satisfaction-sun in perfection-sky.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074284" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">22. Adharma</h1>
  
 

<p>If the seeker can live in his oneness-heart, then he can easily avoid the snare of lawlessness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074285" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23. Abhinaya</h1>
  
 

<p>In God’s cosmic Play, each individual soul takes a God-revealing and God-manifesting part.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074286" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24. Abhokta</h1>
  
 

<p>A non-enjoyer of earth’s body-consciousness is the supreme enjoyer of Heaven’s soul-consciousness. From body-consciousness we learn how to possess. Something more: how to regress. From the soul-consciousness we learn how to proceed. Something more: we satisfy God in God’s own Way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074287" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25. Abbyasa</h1>
  
 

<p>Practice is at once life-perfection in us and God-Satisfaction in us.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074288" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">26. Adhikari</h1>
  
 

<p>In the spiritual life a qualified and God-manifesting instrument is he who at once learns the instructions given by the Inner Pilot and unlearns the instructions offered by ignorance-night.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074289" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">27. Advaita</h1>
  
 

<p>When we look up, the non-duality-Lord blesses us. When we look forward, the duality-God embraces us.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074290" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">28. Advitiya</h1>
  
 

<p>God the Compassion-Light is without a second. Man the gratitude-heart is without a second.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074291" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">29. Agadha</h1>
  
 

<p>O human mind, you have been swimming in the unfathomable ignorance-sea since I saw you for the first time. Do you not feel like changing the game? Try to swim in the unfathomable wisdom sea. See what happens.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074292" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">30. Agni</h1>
  
 

<p>Consciousness-fire we need to illumine our mind. Consciousness-fire we need to immortalise our heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074293" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">31. Ahaituka</h1>
  
 

<p>The human in us never does anything unconditionally. The divine in us at times does a few things unconditionally. The Absolute Supreme in us does everything unconditionally. As a matter of fact, He knows no other way to act.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074294" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">32. Aham</h1>
  
 

<p>Only I love God. Here my ego dances. God loves me only. Here too my ego dances. God and I love each other. Here my ego fails to dance. Here both of us together sing our oneness-song.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074295" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">33. Aja</h1>
  
 

<p>One reality yet unborn alone can expedite humanity’s progress, and that is reality’s and humanity’s offering of their gratitude-heart to God’s unconditional Compassion-Light.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074296" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">34. Ajapa</h1>
  
 

<p>The best conscious, constant, spontaneous and effortless mantra is: “On earth I see Infinity; in Heaven I have Eternity; and in God-Immortality I am.”</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074297" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">35. Akhanda</h1>
  
 

<p>The one indivisible Reality is at once Eternity’s hunger on earth and Infinity’s feast in Heaven.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074298" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">36. Akrodha</h1>
  
 

<p>Your absence of anger proves that you see God-Reality all around you. This is an achievement which cannot be elucidated. It cannot even be properly felt. It can only be loved spontaneously.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074299" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">37. Akshara</h1>
  
 

<p>When I live on earth, my imperishable Reality is hope. When I am in Heaven, my imperishable Reality is promise.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074300" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">38. Akshaya</h1>
  
 

<p>It seems that a constant battle is going on between man’s everlasting ignorance and God’s ever-illumining Compassion-Light.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074301" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">39. Alpa</h1>
  
 

<p>A small portion of man’s cheerfulness-heart is more than enough to bind God, the Enjoyer of divine Freedom.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074302" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">40. Amala</h1>
  
 

<p>The absence of impurity is not enough. The presence of purity not only can solve all inner problems but also can expedite teeming success in man’s outer life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074303" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">41. Amara</h1>
  
 

<p>What we need is not an immortal body but a constantly God-receiving body and God-manifesting heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074304" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">42. Ambara</h1>
  
 

<p>Why do we forget that we have two skies: the mind’s sky and the heart’s sky? Why do we forget the true truth that we are two skies: the mind-sky and the heart-sky? When we see that our mind-sky is overcast with teeming doubt-clouds, we should try to look at our heart-sky, which is flooded with man’s perfection-cry and God’s Satisfaction-Smile.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074305" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">43. Amrta</h1>
  
 

<p>An act of forgiveness grants us nectar-delight noticeably.</p>
<p>An act of gratitude grants us nectar-delight profusely.</p>
<p>An act of unconditional surrender to God’s Will grants us nectar-delight immeasurably and supremely.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074306" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">44. Amsa</h1>
  
 

<p>The animal part in us needs God the Compassion.</p>
<p>The human part in us needs God the Illumination.</p>
<p>The divine part in us needs God the Perfection.</p>
<p>The Supreme part in us needs God the Satisfaction.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074307" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">45. Anadi</h1>
  
 

<p>As Divinity’s Satisfaction is beginningless and endless, even so humanity’s frustration is also beginningless and endless.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074308" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">46. Anahata Nada</h1>
  
 

<p>To hear the soundless sound in the aspiring heart is not only to feel boundless delight but also to offer boundless delight to God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074309" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">47. Ananta</h1>
  
 

<p>A chosen instrument of God is he who transforms life’s infinite possibilities into infinite fulfilling realities.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074310" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">48. Anasakti</h1>
  
 

<p>Non-attachment is spontaneous fulfilment of God the One in God the many.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074311" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">49. Anima</h1>
  
 

<p>True, subtlety is not perfection, but subtlety paves the way to an illumining perfection.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074312" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">50. Anisa</h1>
  
 

<p>Since you are not the master of your life, how can you drink nectar-delight? Impossible!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074313" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">51. Anitya</h1>
  
 

<p>The feeling of the earth-bound reality’s impermanence awakens the aspiring heart and purifies the searching mind.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074314" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">52. Anrta</h1>
  
 

<p>Falsehood wants to show us how far we are away from God. Truth tells us not only how close we are to God but also that we are in the process of becoming God the Transcendental Reality.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074315" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">53. Anugraha</h1>
  
 

<p>Only the vision-eye of the heart can see God’s miracle-power: Grace.</p>

  </div>
<div id="node-1074317" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">55. Anusmarana</h1>
  
 

<p>Our constant remembrance of God makes us see the present capacity of Heaven and the future possibility of earth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074318" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">56. Anutapa</h1>
  
 

<p>Not to feel remorse after you have done something wrong is to go back to your previous life: the animal kingdom.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074319" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">57. Apah</h1>
  
 

<p>Water is consciousness. Consciousness is the connecting link between Heaven and earth. Heaven tells the seeker where God is. Earth tells the seeker how he can become another God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074320" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">58. Apamana</h1>
  
 

<p>If there is no oneness within, then the elephant of disrespect will move around and destroy earth’s aspiring and illumining beauty.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074321" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">59. Apara</h1>
  
 

<p>Lower life in a human being is not only a kind of frustration and failure, but also a total negation of the satisfaction which we have in the inner world. This satisfaction is founded on our devoted surrender to God’s illumining Vision and fulfilling Reality.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1074322" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">60. Aparadha</h1>
  
 

<p>We offend others; others offend us. But the worst possible offense is when we treasure our little “I”. It binds us inside the body-cage, strangles us inside the vital-den and kills us inside the mind-prison.</p>
