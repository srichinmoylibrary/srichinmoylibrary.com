    <title>Question: It is said that when twins are born, it is because they were enemies in a past incarnation and they had to be joined together in that way, I mean as Siamese twins. Then neither one can kill the other since he will be killed as well.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is true. Sometimes they come to punish each other. In a past life, they could not tolerate each other, as it happens sometimes, and they were intense enemies. They come back to work out their mutual hatred. If one takes incarnation in a certain family, the other one says, "I, too, will take incarnation there so I can make your life miserable." So they come together, sometimes as identical twins to torture each other and all their lives they quarrel and fight. We often see that identical twins are not happy or harmonious. They were enemies in their past life and by getting the opportunity to be twins they may be able to transform their hatred into love. At least they get a chance to express their enmity. In any case, they don't bother with each other, usually, in the following lifetime.</p>  </div>
