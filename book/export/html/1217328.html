<p>There is a difference. The voice of Silence will give you a particular piece of knowledge, a particular truth. When you enter into your inner being, into the inner realm where Silence really exists, if you need a particular message you will get it.</p>
<p>But Yoga encompasses everything; it is the whole field. In Yoga you will get Silence; you will also get Peace, Light and Power. You will get everything. The voice of Yoga is for all seekers and especially for those who have seriously entered into the spiritual life. The voice of Silence is meant for a particular seeker at a particular time. During your meditation, for example, you can go deep within and you will hear the voice of Silence. But the voice of Yoga you can have all the time. During your outer as well as your inner movements, you can hear the voice of Yoga. Since you have entered into the spiritual life, you will get spiritual vibrations, thoughts, ideas and messages. All these divine things will be coming to you from the voice of Yoga.</p>  </div>
