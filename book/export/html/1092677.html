<p>On 4 July 1943 in Singapore, Netaji became the President of the Indian Independence League. His powerful oratory and life-illumining vision captivated the entire audience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Comrades! You have voluntarily accepted a mission that is the noblest that the human mind can conceive of. For the fulfilment of such a mission no sacrifice is too great, not even the sacrifice of one's life. You are today the custodians of India's national honour and the embodiment of India's hopes and aspirations."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three and a half months later, on 21 October 1943, Netaji first announced the formation of the Provisional Government of Free India:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the name of God, in the name of by-gone generations who have welded the Indian people into one nation and in the name of the dead heroes who have bequeathed to us a tradition of heroism and self-sacrifice, we call upon the Indian people to rally around our banner and to strike for India's freedom."</p>
