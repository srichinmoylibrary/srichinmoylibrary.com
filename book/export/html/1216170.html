<p>When I offered my feeble gratitude to God,<br /> He immediately said,<br /> "Ah, what is it? I have never seen<br /> Such a beautiful thing in all My life<br /> Either in Heaven or on earth.<br /> Can I use it for a purpose divine?"<br /> I smilingly said,<br /> "Certainly You can.<br /> It is for Your daily and constant use."</p>
<p>When I offered my powerful gratitude to man,<br /> He immediately blurted out,<br /> "You know your deception<br /> Has touched the topmost bough of the earth-tree.<br /> I have given you my silver advice, my golden promise<br /> And my diamond assurance.<br /> Although they were the products<br /> Of the world of fury,<br /> I certainly deserve infinitely more<br /> Living and fulfilling gratitude<br /> Than what you have given me today.<br /> Take it back,<br /> Take it back,<br /> You rogue, you beggar-woman!<br /> From now on my life of compassion<br /> Shall barter nothing<br /> With the bones of a beggar-woman."</p>
