<p>Confidence is good. Self-confidence is better. Confidence in God is by far the best. Again, the human instrument must have faith both in his sincere efforts and in the Grace from above. In the case of Zatopek, higher reality and higher divinity descended on him precisely because he had confidence in his own capacities and also an implicit faith in the vision and satisfaction of the higher worlds. On the strength of his unparalleled confidence in himself and confidence in God, he not only conquered the runners' world but also illumined the consciousness of the runners' world.</p>  </div>
