<h2>Question: Do drug experiences have any validity at all?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Drug experiences are like a false coin. It is as though you are a little child who has no money. Then you see a wonderful coin. You know it is a coin because you see the shape, and you are delighted that you have got some money so easily. But it is a false coin. If you bring it to a shopkeeper he will beat you or throw you out of the store. He will not accept it. You will find that your coin is worthless and you cannot buy anything with it.</p>  </div>
