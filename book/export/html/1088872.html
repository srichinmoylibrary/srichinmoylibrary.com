    <title>&lt;em&gt;Donna Halper:&lt;/em&gt; Now you are raising a question. I can hear people out there saying, &amp;quot;That&#039;s great, to sit there and think good thoughts and things like that. But what about when you are in the middle of the material life and everything is going wrong and it has been a bad day at the office and your boss just yelled at you and so forth and so on. How do you get the good thoughts in your mind at a time like that?&amp;quot;</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Morning shows the day in most cases. In the morning, before we enter into the hustle and bustle of life, before we go out of our house and enter into the day's activities, if we meditate soulfully for a few minutes, then definitely we will get some inner peace. This peace we shall carry inside our hearts when we go to the office or enter into the multifarious activities and confusion of our daily life. Then we can bring to the fore this inner peace when we need it. In this way we will definitely be able to control the situation.</p>  </div>
