<p>“God, what is Your real name?”</p>
<p>“My real name is Max.”</p>
<p>“That’s my name. I won’t give You my name.”</p>
<p>“Then what name do you want Me to have?”</p>
<p>“I want You to have the name Water.”</p>
<p>“Water! That’s a fine name. From now on, if you can call Me by that name, I shall respond.”</p>
<p>“God, I'll tell You a secret. My mother has taught me that the other name of Water is Life.”</p>
<p>“Now My child, I'll tell you another secret. The other name of Life is God.”</p>
<p>“Can I tell my mother Your secret?”</p>
<p>“Certainly you can.”</p>
<p>“God, I really thank You for telling me a top secret.”</p>  </div>
