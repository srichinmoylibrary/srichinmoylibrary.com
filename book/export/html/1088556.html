<h2>To my Indian brothers and sisters</h2>

<p>My Indian brothers and sisters, may my heart grow into an ever-blossoming gratitude-flower so that I can place it most devotedly at the compassionate feet of our Bharat Mata, Mother India. We are all chosen instruments of our Bharat Mata. It is our bounden duty to bring to the fore Her divinity and manifest it throughout the length and breadth of the world.</p>
<p>As we all know, India is not a piece of land. India is the living Breath of the Absolute Supreme. At every moment, devotedly and self-givingly, let us proclaim Her divine Victory. On the strength of Her inspiration, aspiration and dedication, India dreams. And it is in India's dream that the Reality of the Absolute Supreme blossoms.</p>
<p><em>Bharat amar,</em> India, my India, to your Eternity's Silence-Heart my aspiration-heart bows and bows.</p>
<p>India, my India, to your Infinity's Sound-Life my dedication-life bows and bows.</p>
<p>God created me as a Bengali seed. Then He made me an Indian plant. Next He made me an American tree. And now He has made me a universal flower, to love Him, to serve Him, to worship Him and to manifest Him throughout the length and breadth of the world.</p>
<p>My Indian friends, my Indian brothers and sisters, my Indian hearts, my Indian home, I am a seeker and I shall remain so throughout the length and breadth of Eternity. For to be a seeker is to remain a continuous lover of God and server of God, always at His Feet. Him to please in His own Way is my sole goal.</p>  </div>
