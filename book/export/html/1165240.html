<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This has happened only four or five times in Godâ€™s creation. In very rare cases a spiritual Master can change the gender, or a new soul he can bring into the person while the person is still on earth. One soul can be put to sleep: It will not function. But this has happened only a few times.</p>  </div>
