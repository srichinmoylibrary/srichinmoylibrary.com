<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For a seeker one quality is enough, and that quality is gratitude. And in God's Life one quality is also enough, and that quality is Compassion. Inside your gratitude you can feel the presence of all your divine qualities, and inside God's Compassion you can easily feel all the divine qualities of God. If you want to see all God's good qualities or all your own good qualities individually, you can easily do that too. But if you want to see one good quality that embodies all the good qualities, then in God's case it is His Compassion and in man's case it is his gratitude.</p>
