<p>"My Lord, which religion is by far the best?"</p>
<p>"The religion that says, 'Man above all, Truth above all.'"</p>
<p>"Which religion is really the worst?"</p>
<p>"The religion that proclaims that it has the only road and it is the only door to humanity's salvation."</p>
<p>"My Lord, which yoga is by far the best?"</p>
<p>"The yoga that carries Me down on its widest shoulders and places Me in the heart of the seeker."</p>
<p>"My Lord, these shoulders, do they have any names?"</p>
<p>"Yes, My child, they do have names. The left shoulder is called loving devotion, and the right shoulder is called devoted surrender."</p>
<p>"Now, my Lord, which is the worst yoga?"</p>
<p>"The yoga that constantly sings the song of man's personal efforts and not the song of God's constant Dance of unconditional Grace."</p>
