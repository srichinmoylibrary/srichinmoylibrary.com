<p>Now we come to the last song, Phire Chalo.</p>
<p>By singing this song, a great singer of India, K. C. Dey, became immortal overnight. God had denied him sight; he was stone blind. But God sang through him in such soul-stirring grandeur as he performed this song for the famous film “Chandidasa” that his name became immortal in India.</p>
<p>In this song, Home is beckoning us. According to the Vedas, Home is Heaven on Earth, for it is by abiding in the soul here on earth that we achieve spiritual Bliss. In the Rig Veda, the seers sing: “Madhumat Punarayanam” which means “Sweet be my return [home].”</p>

<p><em>Phire Chalo, apana Ghare ...</em></p>
<p>Let us return Home, let us go back,<br /> Useless is this reckoning of seeking and getting,<br /> Delight permeates all of today.<br /> From the blue ocean of death<br /> Life is flowing like nectar.<br /> In life there is death; in death there is life.<br /> So where is fear, where is fear?<br /> The birds in the sky are singing “No death, no death!”<br /> Day and night the tide of Immortality<br /> Is descending here on earth.</p>
