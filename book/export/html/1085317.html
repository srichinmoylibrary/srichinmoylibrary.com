<p>Balarama and his wife had two sons, Nisatha and Ulmuka. Like her husband, Revati was indulgent in wine. They used to drink together, but they never lost their senses.</p>
<p>One day Revati asked her husband, "Do you love me more than wine?"</p>
<p>Balarama said, "Yes, I love you more than wine. Otherwise, I would not have married you. I would have remained satisfied with my wine, my first wife. You are my second wife."</p>
<p>Revati said, "Oh no, if you were married to your wine before me, I will go back to my parents' house. I won't stay with you."</p>
<p>Balarama said, "Where are your parents? Am I not your all?"</p>
<p>"Certainly you are my all," Revati replied.</p>
<p>"Stay with your parents here. I shall never hurt you. You are my only wife â€” my first, last and only wife."</p>
<p>"My Lord, let us be wise. We must not allow our sons to drink."</p>
<p>"That is an excellent idea. We must not allow them to drink. When they grow up like us, at that time they can drink if they wish. Now, let them study and become wise. Let them practise sports and become strong. Let them pray and meditate. Let them be physically, mentally and spiritually strong. Our children will be strong in every way," said Balarama.</p>
<p>"Yes, my Lord, I am sure your wish will be fulfilled. What you envision is coming from your third eye and I have implicit faith in what you say."</p>
<p>Balarama said, "Our children will be good and they will please us. For that I will give you all credit, for it is you who will do everything for them. Because of you, they will become great and good. I know what I am. I am always preoccupied in my own world, so I know I will do next to nothing for them. It is you who will do everything for them. And for that I am and I shall always remain grateful to you."</p>
<p>"No, my Lord," said Revati, "your inner blessings and inner guidance will guide the three of us always."</p>
