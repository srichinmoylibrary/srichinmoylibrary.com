  <h1 class="book-heading">&amp;quot;The ideal of communism&amp;quot;</h1>
  
 
<p>The ideal of communism is to work according to your capacity and to receive according to your necessity. Can this theory have any equal? The Vedic seers of the hoary past had this kind of unparalleled vision for world-harmony, world-peace and world-fulfilment.</p>
<p>Theory is one thing, but practice can be completely different. It is the practice that affects human life. Alas, alas, Stalin's practices destroyed the beauty and fragrance of the communism-flower. But President Gorbachev reminds us with his direct and to-the-point statement that the very idea of communism is not something to be feared or hated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am a communist. I'm sure that answer doesn't make you too enthusiastic, but it shouldn't make you panic either. It's quite normal."</p>
