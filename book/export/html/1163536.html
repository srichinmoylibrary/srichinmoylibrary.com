<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Even if you realise the Highest Consciousness, still gratitude will always remain. Gratitude is sweetness and delight. Delight we experience no matter on which plane of consciousness we are. Gratitude is earth's greatest delight and Heaven's greatest delight. When the cosmic gods get something from the Supreme, they offer delight and gratitude.</p>
<p>When you have delight and gratitude, at that time you reach the Highest. Just because you have reached the Highest you are happy. If you remain on the highest plane, then you become one with the Vision and one with the Reality. Vision gives capacity to Reality. If this moment Vision is giving something to Reality, although they are one, Reality will naturally feel grateful. When you are on the highest level, Vision and Reality are one. But if you want to play the cosmic Game and you separate the Vision from Reality, then when you have given, naturally the one to whom you give will express gratitude. But on the highest plane, he who gives and he who receives are one.</p>
<p>Gratitude is in both realisation and manifestation. If you remain in the highest realisation you will be grateful, and if you remain in manifestation you will be grateful. Gratitude has to be constant. Even on the highest plane you have to be grateful.</p>  </div>
