<p>I was begging them to keep my sister in the nursing home. Lately for ten days Lily remains in the nursing home, and then for five days or so she goes home. Over the last few months, five or six times she has done this. I begged the doctors, only if she is much better should they allow her to go home. The problem is that as soon as she feels a little better, she fights with the doctors, and then she goes home. At home her condition gets worse. Then they bring her back to the nursing home.</p>
<p>Some days my sister and I would be talking together in a normal way. All of a sudden she would say, "Ah, it is so beautiful, I can see such a beautiful room with flowers, and Hriday and Ahana are there." She would say that my brother and sister, who are no longer alive, were already talking to her.</p>
<p>I would say, "No, they are not here. I do not want that place, I do not like that place."</p>
<p>One moment she is all right, and suddenly she will see my brother Hriday and sister Ahana and a beautiful house filled with flowers. She is having a glimpse of the other world. Otherwise, she is quite normal, but weak.</p>  </div>
