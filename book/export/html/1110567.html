<p>After my mother passed away in 1944, for three or four months I studied in a school in Chittagong that was founded by one of my eldest brother’s friends. Once they had a function, and there I recited this particular poem of Tagore’s. I was eleven years old. Still I like it. It is a short poem. The meaning is:</p>

<p>Like a madcap I roam,<br /> as a deer looks for the fragrance.<br /> The fragrance is inside the deer, but the deer cannot find it.<br /> Similarly, I am also searching for my own fragrance.<br /> Whatever I ask for, it is all by mistake.<br /> And whatever I get, I am never satisfied.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
