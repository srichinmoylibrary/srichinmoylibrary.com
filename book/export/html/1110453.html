<p>It is music that, being the universal language, has no need to learn any particular language of the world.</p>
<p>Tagore’s life and his multifarious activities are founded on an intuitive music. Tagore says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Music is the purest form of art, and therefore the most direct expression of beauty, with a form and spirit which is one and simple, and least encumbered with anything extraneous. We seem to feel that the manifestation of the infinite in the finite forms of creation is music itself, silent and visible.”</p>
