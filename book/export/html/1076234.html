<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is possible. It is not only possible; it is inevitable. It is only a matter of time. As we said before, God-realisation cannot be achieved overnight. Similarly, perfection cannot be achieved overnight. In order to achieve something, it takes quite a few years. Perfection we will have in the world just because God wants it. Without making us perfect, God will not be satisfied, because He wants us to be exactly like Him. He is perfect. So how will He be satisfied when He sees that His children are imperfect? He does not want us to all the time quarrel and fight and kill one another. No. His message is the message of perfection, the message of oneness. Just because He wants universal oneness and perfect Perfection from us, we are bound to achieve this. It is a matter of time in the process of evolution of consciousness.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Very interesting, the idea of a perfect universe. Are there many people these days whom you admire â€” religious leaders or political leaders, or anybody in the world who you think is on the path?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Believe me, I admire everyone because, according to my philosophy, everyone has something special, unique. God always wants to express Himself and reveal Himself in a unique fashion. When we look at a flower, we see that one petal is a little smaller, one is a little larger. When we see a beautiful building, at one particular place it has one shape and at another place it is totally different. But we admire the building because each place where we focus our attention gives us a feeling of inner joy, inner faith. Like a magnet, it pulls us or we pull it. God wants to fulfil Himself in a unique fashion in each individual. That is why I admire each individual, because God wants to do something in a specific way in each individual. Therefore, each individual really deserves my appreciation and admiration.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> I'm very happy you came. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am so happy that you have given me the opportunity to be of service to thousands of people. Nothing gives me greater joy than to be of service to mankind, because that is the only thing that I can do. If I am employed to do the thing that I can do, then naturally I am most grateful.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Thank you, Sri Chinmoy.</p>  </div>
