<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to raise your consciousness is through inner cry. Then, in order to maintain your consciousness there on the highest level, you have to establish considerable purity in the vital. First, with you inner cry, your aspiration, you go up; then, through purity in the vital you will be able to stay there for good.</p>  </div>
