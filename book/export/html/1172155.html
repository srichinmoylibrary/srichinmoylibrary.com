<p>The main doctor took me from one patient to another, introducing me. One fellow was the funniest. He is now an old man, but in his youth he was very, very strong. The doctor said to him, "This is Chinmoy-da."</p>
<p>"Who is it?" the old man asked.</p>
<p>"Hriday's youngest brother," the doctor replied. Then the old man said to me, "How are you, Hriday? And how is Chinmoy? Oh, I am sorry. Chinmoy is long dead!"</p>  </div>
