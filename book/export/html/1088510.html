<p>Poet, patriot, savant, awakener of Tamil Nad â€” Bharati is all these. There is a magic spell of intimacy and national feeling woven around the very name of Bharati. For it is true, as it was yesterday and will forever be, that his songs have an astonishing power to quicken the tempo of the patriotic fervour of his countrymen.</p>
<p>What an irony of Fate! Bharati had hardly reached the age of 39 when death snatched him away. But he has left an imperishable imprint on Rajagopalachari: "Agastya incarnate who has given us Tamil afresh."</p>  </div>
