<p>He is a fool<br /> Because<br /> He has not read any books.<br /> Perhaps so he is.</p>
<p>He is a wise man<br /> Because<br /> He has read ten thousand books.<br /> Perhaps so he is.</p>
<p>He is a wiser man<br /> Because<br /> He has read fifteen thousand books.<br /> Perhaps so he is.</p>
<p>He is the wisest man,<br /> By far<br /> The wisest man,<br /> Who has read only two special books:<br /> Aspiration-height<br /> And<br /> Surrender-light.</p>
