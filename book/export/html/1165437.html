<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Weightlifting twice a week is more than enough for a long-distance runner. Also, I do not advise any student of mine running long distances to practise lifting more than 30 pounds. Short-distance runners, sprinters, can go up to 50 pounds. For the girls, 20 pounds is more than enough.</p>  </div>
