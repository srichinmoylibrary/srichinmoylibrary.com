<p>God is the Divine Beloved and we are the Divine Lovers. That is the only difference. The Divine Lover smiles; the Divine Beloved cries. The moment the Divine Beloved cries, the Divine Lover smiles because the Beloved is won. The Beloved cries because the game between the Lover and the Beloved has at last ended and the two have become inseparably one.</p>  </div>
