<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To be perfectly sincere, there are only two or three more individuals whom I want to lift. I am only waiting for those two or three individuals. I am not going to lift one hundred, two hundred or three hundred more people — far from it. But inwardly, definitely, definitely, as long as I live, until I breathe my last, even in the soul's world, I will continue to lift human beings. That I will never stop. As long as God keeps my connection with Him intact, no matter where I am — in Heaven or somewhere else — I will definitely lift up the consciousness of humanity.</p>  </div>
