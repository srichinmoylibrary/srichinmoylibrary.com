<p>Tagore had such generosity. He wrote an immortal poem about Sri Ramakrishna: “How beloved is your compassion. You have realised God in every way, entering into each and every friend. The spiritual wealth of centuries you embody and all the religions you have synthesised. From everywhere, salutation is coming to you, and I am joining mine.”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Each line is so beautiful and powerful. Tagore wrote it in Bengali. Then he translated it into English. It is famous, famous. I set the Bengali words to music.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>In the evening of his life<br /> Tagore, in vain, tried extremely hard<br /> For the reconciliation of all<br /> Of Mother India’s freedom-lovers.<br /> Tagore wanted to bring together<br /> The diverse, contrary and contradictory ideas<br /> Of Netaji, Gandhi-ji and other front-rank political leaders.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
