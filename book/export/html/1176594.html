<p>An insincere seeker demands<br /> That others think of him<br /> As sincerity incarnate.<br /> A sincere seeker pays no attention<br /> To what others think of him.<br /> Even when others say that<br /> He is false,<br /> He is treacherous,<br /> He will not succeed,<br /> He thinks it is all a joke.<br /> He feels that God is playing<br /> His transcendental Music<br /> In a new way<br /> So that he can make himself ready<br /> For a new game.</p>
