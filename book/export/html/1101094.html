<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I always say that when you really have something to offer to the world, then you can become truly humble. A tree, when it has no fruit to offer, remains erect. But when the tree is laden with fruit, it bends down. When you have genuine humility, it is a sign that you have something to offer to mankind. If you are all pride and ego, then nobody will be able to get anything worthwhile from you.</p>
<p><em>Lord Mayor:</em> That is a very wonderful parable. Great men through the ages have been quietly preaching parables to other people. I'm so glad you have met the Dean. He's new here. He seems a nice man.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He has been very kind and generous. One lady berated him on the phone for giving me the opportunity to speak in a Christian cathedral. This is why I find it difficult to accept the barriers of religion. Our Indian spirituality far transcends these barriers of religion. It feels that Truth is nobody's monopoly. Truth is your birthright, my birthright, everybody's birthright. When we think of Truth and cry for Truth, all problems are solved. But when we think of a particular religion, each religion claims to be by far the best. "My religion is far better than yours," people will say. There is no end to this silly, fruitless controversy.</p>
<p><em>Lord Mayor:</em> Man's inhumanity to man through different sects of religion is incredible! When you think of the French, for instance, tying people upside down on stakes and burning them because there was a slight difference in their Christianity. And the Spanish inquisition, the Moslem and Christian war in Lebanon, the war in Ireland. It's awful, isn't it? What happens all around the world is unbelievable! In the name of Truth and God, people are led by their religions to this absolutely ridiculous bigotry.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What does it prove? It proves that the animal in us is not yet fully transformed. It is only waiting for the opportunity to come to the fore and devour the rest of the world. Only when we practise real spirituality, when we sincerely cry for God and the highest Truth through our prayer and meditation, is the animal in us transformed into a divine child. Then slowly, steadily and unerringly the divine child becomes absolutely perfect. This perfection is everybody's ultimate aim and goal. Unfortunately, right now, the animal is still hiding in us like a hungry wolf. It is only waiting for the opportunity to devour us and the rest of the world.</p>  </div>
