<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can best serve the Supreme in the children when you feel extremely grateful to Him for giving you the opportunity to teach children. When you teach children, you are given the opportunity to become a child yourself. You may be twenty-two or twenty-three, but your aim is to become a child, an eternal child in the spiritual life, so that you can make constant progress. If you are constantly grateful to the Supreme, and if the children remind you of your eternal childhood, then you will make the fastest progress.</p>
<p>When you teach children, do not think that the school authorities are paying you and that is why you are serving. No, you are serving the children because you want to become another child. If the children offer you a smile, feel that that smile comes from the Supreme. Each time a child smiles, it is the expansion of Godâ€™s Dream-Reality on earth. If you remember that, then you will be able to serve the Supreme most soulfully and constantly.</p>  </div>
