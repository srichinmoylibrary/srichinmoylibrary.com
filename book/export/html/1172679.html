<p>If the mind is not one with the light of the soul or the soul’s will, then surrender cannot be called unconditional. The body, vital, mind and heart, all that an aspirant has and is, must individually and collectively become one with the soul’s light, the soul’s will. The soul’s will is the Will of the Supreme; the soul’s light is the Light of the Supreme. There can be unconditional surrender only when these parts of the being feel that what the soul is doing for them comes directly from God.</p>
<p>If they feel that they have their own separate wisdom, although less than the soul’s wisdom, they are making a great mistake. Only when the mind surrenders totally to the light of the soul can the mind have infinite light, which is called wisdom. The moment the mind is separated from the soul, it has no inner wisdom; it has only outer capacities, mental information. Only the soul has eternal wisdom.</p>
<p>Unconditional surrender comes only when the body, vital, mind and heart have offered their limited capacities, all that they have and all that they are, to the Will of the Supreme. In order for the seeker to have infinite capacities and to grow into the Infinite, his unconditional surrender has to be constant.</p>
<p>The ordinary person becomes unconditionally surrendered when the emotional and vital being comes forward. When people are living in emotional love, romantic love, then in an outburst of emotion they jump into a kind of surrender. The girl immediately jumps into the uncertainty of the boy’s life or the boy enters into the uncertainty of the girl’s life. They neither look forward nor backward, right nor left.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, when the Master or the Supreme makes the decision for the aspirant to be unconditionally surrendered to God, to the Divine, to the Master, this means that the strength has already been given to the aspirant to make his surrender unconditional and constant.</p>
<p>When we approach God with the surrender of our body, vital, mind, heart and soul, we shall see God standing right in front of us with all that He is and all that He has. He is compelled to become verily the slave of our absolute, unreserved surrender. His very existence is to please us in every possible way. It is only through our surrender, our constant self-offering that we grow in the Lap of God, in the Heart of God and in the heart of humanity.</p>  </div>
