<p>I went to God with all my credentials.<br /> God laughed and laughed and laughed.<br /> He said to me,<br /> "Come back in a few years' time<br /> With your new achievements."</p>
<p>I went back to God for the second time,<br /> This time with an empty heart.<br /> As soon as my Lord Supreme<br /> Saw my empty heart,<br /> He became excited and delighted.<br /> He said to me,<br /> "Ah, that is Mine!<br /> Where did you get it?<br /> Who gave it to you?<br /> Your empty heart is absolutely<br /> My own Wealth.<br /> My child, I am so grateful to you<br /> And so proud of you<br /> Because you have returned to Me<br /> My own Possession, My own Wealth,<br /> My own Achievement."</p>
