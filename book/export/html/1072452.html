<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If Jesus Christ is the answer for you, then you don’t need any other spiritual Master. If he is your Master, then you don’t need any other spiritual Master. If he is your Master, then you can just see me as another Master. Who is better of the two is not the important question. The main thing is that you have a Master who will be able to take you to the Highest. Each spiritual Master, whether he has left the physical sheath or is still on earth, has a boat of his own. If you have a boatman and you are satisfied with his boat, then you do not need another boatman or another boat. You have only to consider me and other spiritual Masters as boatmen who are carrying other aspirants to the Supreme Father.</p>  </div>
