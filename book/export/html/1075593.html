<p>The Mother Divine is the Divine in its feminine aspect. Very often we say that it is easier to please our mother than our father in the physical world. This truth is also applicable in the spiritual world. True, the Mother and the Father do everything in consultation with each other. But it is easier for an aspirant to please the Mother Divine or an aspect of the Mother Divine than to please Purusha, the masculine aspect of the Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>There are four major aspects of the Mother Divine. From one point of view, just as we cannot separate our right arm from our left arm, we cannot separate the different aspects of the Mother Divine, or separate one goddess from another. But from another point of view, we can say that these different aspects of the transcendental Mother perform different functions.</p>  </div>
