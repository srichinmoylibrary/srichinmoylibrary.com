<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I give up on you, then what am I and what do I have? If I give up all of you who are composed of me, then what do I have to call my own? There is no good or bad in my life. If you people are bad, then I am bad. If you people are culprits, then I am the first and worst culprit. If you are good, then I also am good. Anything that you people are is only an expansion or projection of my own reality. So how can I get rid of my own reality? I am the source. How can the root leave the branches and leaves? You have accepted me. If it is stupidity, then it is my stupidity. I have accepted all my disciples in the inner world long before you have accepted me on the physical plane.</p>
<p>How can I give up? If I give up, then I myself do not exist. I am only what you have for me and what you are with me. My existence is composed of what you people have and what you people are. It is not a matter of putting up with you: it is only an act of wisdom. Since I want to exist, I have to be with you all. It is like an onion. The layers of an onion grow one on top of another. Each layer is part of the rest. If you start peeling the onion, to separate the layer, you will peel right down to nothing. Again, when the onion grows, one layer grows on top of the next. It is all oneness, oneness, oneness. So let us try to grow a small onion into a big onion. Only then will the disciple and the Guru be fulfilled.</p>  </div>
