<p>While some of the slower runners were still running, the organisers started taking down the equipment.</p>
<p>Many years ago I had that experience when I was running the New York City Marathon. What an insult! The first insult was not enough — that Chameli went ahead of me! Then came the second insult: I saw the police taking down the wooden barricades while I was still running.</p>
