<p>A bad disciple will try<br /> To please his Master in one way,<br /> Hoping his Master<br /> Will please him in nine ways.</p>
<p>A clever disciple will try<br /> To please his Master in nine ways,<br /> Hoping his Master will forgive him<br /> For not pleasing him in the tenth way.</p>
<p>A good disciple will prepare himself<br /> To please his Master in every way,<br /> And he will succeed!</p>
