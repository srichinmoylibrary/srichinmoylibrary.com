<p>AFTER HE HAD CONQUERED</p>
<p>After he had conquered earth,<br /> He discovered<br /> That he had conquered nothing.<br /> After he had conquered Heaven,<br /> He discovered<br /> That he had conquered something.<br /> After he had conquered himself,<br /> He discovered<br /> That he had conquered not only much,<br /> But everything,<br /> Even the monstrous things that he thought<br /> He would never be able to conquer.</p>
