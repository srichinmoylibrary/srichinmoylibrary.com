<p>Sometimes Joe Michaels folds his hands when he sees me. But Dan Coffey likes to shake hands with me. He is the happiest of runners, as cheerful as a butterfly.</p>
<p>Dan comes from England, but he acts like an Indian; his soul is all joy. He is like a Heavenly angel. His smile, his movements, everything about him is angelic. Each time you see him, it is like seeing a continuously blossoming flower.</p>
<p>Dan is so nice. How many times he has come up to me to shake hands! Sometimes I am in a serious mood, but his smiling face immediately takes away my seriousness.</p>
<p>Alan Fairbrother is all British. He is measured and very strict and disciplined. But he smiled at me quite a few times; he also is very nice.</p>
