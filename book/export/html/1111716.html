<p>While I was in Scotland recently, Janaka, Janani and I went running. David was following us in his car. After each mile David would honk. After three or four miles Janani surrendered. She started going very slowly.</p>
<p>I was proud that Janani was far behind us, because I still remember how she defeated me in Antigua. Altogether Janaka and I ran seven miles. Then we drove back to get Janani. She was so happy to stop running!</p>
<p>Afterwards, we went to an Indian restaurant, but unfortunately the food was very bad.</p>
