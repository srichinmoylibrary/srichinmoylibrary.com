<p>Sri Chinmoy has written hundreds of aphorisms and meditations. Some of them were recently placed inside fortune cookies, which the Master handed out to his disciples. On two occasions, Sri Chinmoy asked his disciples to read out the meditation in their cookie, and then proceeded to elaborate on each one. This book is a record of those two meetings -â€“ the 1 September 1974 meeting of the New York Centre (aphorism 1 to 74) and the 14 September 1974 meeting of the Manhattan Centre (aphorism 75 to 168).</p>  </div>
