<p>One day I went out sight-seeing with my hostess, Ida Patterson. On the trolley, a husband was asking his wife to sit in front of me. They were talking in Bengali. I asked the husband where they came from. He said, “My wife comes from Chittagong. I come from Dhaka, but I was brought up in Chittagong.” And he started talking with me in proper Bengali.</p>
<p>They lived in Saudi Arabia. On the same day, at the same hour, we had to catch a trolley in Minneapolis! This world is so small. There were many, many passengers on that trolley, but he had to sit near us.</p>  </div>
