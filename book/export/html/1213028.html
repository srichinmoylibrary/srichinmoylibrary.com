<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, do you concur with me when I say that all religions are <em>moribund</em>?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, I do not agree with you. Religions and the leaders of all religions are quite alive. It is our human faith in religion that is <em>dying</em>, and we are already seeing the results of this deplorable state. But Yoga will come to the rescue of all people, whether they have faith in religion or not. Yoga will show them a most significant road that will lead them directly to God-realisation, even if they do not care for any specific religion or even for religion itself.</p>  </div>
