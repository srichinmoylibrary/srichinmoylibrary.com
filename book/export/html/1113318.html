<p>For some special reason Nirmala-di wanted to be photographed with Nolini-da. So she asked me to bring my photographer-friend Gopal. Gopal came about three-thirty in the afternoon to take pictures. Robi-da was taking his usual refreshment in Nolini-da's room. Nolini-da asked me to call Robi-da to be in the picture. Robi-da was exceedingly delighted that he was able to be in the photograph with his father. Gopal took two pictures of Nolini-da, Nirmala-di, Robi-da and me together. Afterwards, Nolini-da said to Nirmala-di: "So, Nirmala, I have-fulfilled your demands, as I always do."</p>  </div>
