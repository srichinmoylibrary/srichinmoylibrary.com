<p>Yesterday when I was finishing a six-mile run on 150th Street, a young boy came up to me and said, "Nice style, but you need longer strides."</p>
<p>He began demonstrating, saying that after each stride I should pause and press the ground with my toes. "In this way your stride becomes longer."</p>
<p>He was very nice and demonstrated this for two minutes or so. I did not tell him that I know all the different stride techniques.</p>
