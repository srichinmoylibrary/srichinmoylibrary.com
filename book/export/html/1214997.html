<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We eat and overeat. But in Godâ€™s case, there is no such thing as overfed or underfed or unfed. Whatever God does, He does according to His necessity, and His necessity is always supported by His capacity. His necessity and His capacity always go together. What He eats most is our ignorance-sea. Anything that He wants, no matter how large the quantity is, He eats; for He knows that He has boundless capacity. So, in His case, it is not a problem; it is a necessity. If He does not devour our ignorance, then our ignorance will devour us. But God does not suffer from overeating, for He is all capacity and all willingness.</p>  </div>
