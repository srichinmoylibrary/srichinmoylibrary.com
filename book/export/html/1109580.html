<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is all through unconditional divine Grace. My human mind will not believe it. I will be the first one to doubt it and suspect it. But it is the unconditional Grace that acts in and through me. I am not the doer. Had I been the doer, I would not have accomplished so many things. But I constantly try to be a simple, devoted instrument of my Beloved Supreme. On the strength of my receptivity, my Beloved Supreme acts in and through me.</p>  </div>
