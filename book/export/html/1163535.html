<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Gratitude is the most precious thing that a human being can have. If someone has a million dollars and if someone else has only an iota of gratitude, in the Eyes of the Supreme he who has an iota of gratitude to God is far superior. Gratitude is the purest thing that we can have. It is immortal in us. If we can offer to God whatever is immortal, soulful and significant, then that is most meaningful.</p>
<p>Someone can have outer wealth, but if he has spiritual wealth — simplicity, purity, humility — that is far better. Again, somebody can be pure, devoted and sincere, but if he does not have any gratitude to God, then his purity is not perfect. On the other hand, if somebody is of bad character but is grateful to God for not yet having been caught or punished, and if he offers gratitude to God and wants to change his life, then God is pleased.</p>
<p>Every morning you should offer gratitude to God for your existence. You should offer gratitude because God has kept you on earth to manifest Him. So gratitude is the most important thing in our life. Nothing is more important in God's Eyes than gratitude.</p>  </div>
