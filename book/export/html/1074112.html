    <title>&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; When I am back at home working, I try to imagine you in person as often as possible, but sometimes because there is so much happening, it is difficult. And yet, when I concentrate on my heart, I often feel it is full of light and full of joy. I was wondering if that is enough?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is quite enough. If you are finding it difficult to concentrate, breathe in a few times. Take very, very deep breaths and remember me, specially my smile. You can remember how many times I have smiled at you. If that is also difficult, immediately look at my Transcendental Picture. All my disciples carry the Transcendental either in their wallet or on a chain. The Transcendental will do everything for you. You may not see the Transcendental smiling, but if you look at the Transcendental and remember one of my pictures where I am smiling, the Transcendental will be able to show you my smiling face. The Transcendental is my highest, but when you need a smile, if you concentrate on my smiling aspect, I assure you, the Transcendental will be able to show you my smiling aspect. In spite of maintaining all the time my highest height, it will be able to show you my smiling face. The Transcendental has everything and it is everything. If I have given something to the world that the world will forever and forever cherish, then that is my Transcendental Picture. Again, it is not a picture. It represents the Transcendental Consciousness. When you look at the picture, you are definitely concentrating on my Transcendental Consciousness, not just a picture on a piece of paper.</p>  </div>
