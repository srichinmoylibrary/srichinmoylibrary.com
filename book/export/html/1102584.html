<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you feel that you are hopeless, then you are worse than hopeless. And if you feel that you are helpless, then I wish to say that you are really helpless. At that time, I cannot help you and no one else can help you. But you are not hopeless and you are not helpless either. You are God's child. The ancient Vedic seers told us, "From Delight we came into existence, in Delight we grow and, at the end of our journey's close, into Delight we will retire." This is what you must feel.</p>
