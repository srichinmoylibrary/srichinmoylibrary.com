<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not intellectual knowledge that we get from meditation; what we get is inner knowledge, and inner knowledge means illumination. Last week there was no light in this Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Auditorium. But now the switch has been turned on and the hall is fully lit. Similarly, for millennia we have been in darkness. If we want to illumine the darkness that covers our body, vital, mind, heart and central being, then we need meditation. Meditation is the light switch that will illumine our existence; only it takes a little time. If we meditate soulfully for a few months or a few years, then gradually we will see illumination taking place. In the beginning, or even for a couple of years, we may not see a flood of illumination. But if we can meditate soulfully and devotedly for many, many years on a regular, daily basis, then most assuredly we will be blessed with real and abiding illumination.</p>
