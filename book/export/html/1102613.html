  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Is patience always necessary?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, patience is always necessary. But we have to know the difference between patience and tolerance. Sometimes when we surrender to something or tolerate something, we mistakenly think that we are showing patience. But we have tolerance only because we feel there is no other way for us. This tolerance is not patience at all.</p>
<p>In real patience there is always satisfaction, because patience sees some progression towards the goal. The progress may be very slow, but definitely there is movement. Real patience will wait for Eternity while the individual progresses. But if it is only tolerance that is playing the role of patience, then there will be no real satisfaction.</p>
