<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> July 1st. Hint!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> July is very significant for us because it is the seventh month. The number seven is very, very significant in the occult world. So you chose July 1st. Now perhaps you would like to answer a few questions from my students.</p>  </div>
