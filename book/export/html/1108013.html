<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, please keep the same time; then you can go back to sleep after your meditation. You should meditate even if you have gone to visit friends and come home at four o'clock. You can sleep two hours and get up at six o'clock, then re-set the alarm and go back to sleep. Please feel that your divine Friend is supposed to come and knock at your door at six o'clock. Which is more important: God the Friend or your human friends? You have gone to see other friends the night before and you have spent hours there. Now you have a previous appointment with your divine Friend. You can't say, "I will be late." Who is more important, God or a human being?</p>  </div>
