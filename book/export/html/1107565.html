<p>God’s universal Push awakens us. God’s transcendental Pull liberates us.</p>
<p>We worship God because we think that He is far, very far. We love God because we feel that He is near, very near.</p>
<p>Sincerity we need; purity we need. With our sincerity we strengthen our aspiration-heart. With our purity we enlighten our dedication-life.</p>
<p>In our life of aspiration, in our life of dedication, we wish to make fast, faster and fastest progress. How do we achieve this goal? We achieve it on the strength of our faithfulness, cheerfulness and soulfulness. Faithfulness we need in our physical consciousness. Cheerfulness we need in our vital consciousness. Soulfulness we need in our psychic consciousness.</p>
<p>We all wish to make progress, continuous and constant. How is it that we do not make satisfactory progress? We do not make satisfactory progress precisely because we live in the world of complaints. We complain and because we complain, we do not make any progress. Because we do not love God, we complain and because we complain, we do not love God. And because we think of the world too much, we make no progress.</p>
<p>There are two lives: the aspiration-life and the desire-life. We started our journey with the desire-life. Then we gave up the desire-life and entered into the aspiration-life. At God’s choice Hour, we shall enter into the realisation-life, where satisfaction will be ours within and without. </p>
