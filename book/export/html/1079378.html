    <title>Question: Sometimes during my meditation something shows me some imperfection in my human nature. Some event that occurred portrays this imperfection and I have this in my mind during my meditation. I am confused about what to do with it then. Should I hold it and destroy it or push it aside and try to concentrate on something divine?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When your mind brings to the fore some imperfection in your nature, in your outer life, immediately try to throw that imperfection into the universal Consciousness. Do not try to fight it, do not try to exercise your will-power and destroy it. Just throw it into the infinite ocean of consciousness from where you will not be able to get it back. But do not try to fight it during your meditation. You can't do two things properly at the same time. If you have to fight against something during your meditation, it will not be possible for you to maintain your highest meditation at the same time. Just empty yourself. Once you empty yourself, it becomes the duty of the Supreme to fill you with light and perfection.</p>  </div>
