<p><em>Yogi:</em> Outer information, no. It is not necessary, either. Inner information, yes. This inner information is called the soul's glorious preparation. The outer school does not know what aspiration is. The inner school does not know what information is. Information is possessed and cherished by the mind. Aspiration is offered by God and utilised by man.</p>  </div>
