SCA 879-881. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions from some of his Puerto Rican disciples on 27 November 1999 in New York.</p>
<h2>Question: How can we erase the past?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we use the word 'erase', we think of a blackboard. It is as if you have drawn something very poorly and nobody is appreciating your artwork, so you want to erase it. But we do not have to erase the past. We have only to forget about the past and go forward.</p>  </div>
