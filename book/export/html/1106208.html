<p>At one of the weightlifting stores there was a big 600-pound dumbbell. I asked the owner, “Why do you keep a 600-pound dumbbell here?”</p>
<p>He explained about a contest he was holding. He said it started a few months ago when he declared that whoever could lift up a 300-pound dumbbell would get it free. About three months ago somebody accepted the challenge and lifted it a little with two hands.</p>
<p>Then he put a 400-pound dumbbell on display. He thought the same fellow would come back, but somebody else came. The man struggled and finally lifted it up.</p>
<p>After that he put out a 500-pound dumbbell. Just yesterday somebody from California who had come to enter the weightlifting competition lifted up the 500-pound dumbbell, so now he had put out a 600-pound one.</p>
<p>The people in the store begged me to try to lift the 600-pound dumbbell. “You try,” the owner said.</p>
<p>I said, “I am trying 600 over my head, but I do not want to try lifting this from the ground with two hands.” I didn’t want to be embarrassed.</p>
<p>So Savyasachi tried. When Savyasachi tried it, it didn’t move to this side or that side. The man said, “No way for him!”</p>
