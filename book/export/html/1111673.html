<p>I started my running-journey this morning at three-thirty. Then I ran again at five o'clock, doing hill work. A lady who was out with her dog said, "Good morning, good morning, Sir!"</p>
<p>Early in the morning is the best time for running. There is no car problem. You can run in the middle of the street.</p>
