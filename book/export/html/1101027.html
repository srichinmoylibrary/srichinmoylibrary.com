    <title>Question: In China I saw the Chinese goddess Quan Yin, and I really felt something in her. I am wondering, if I feel inspired to sit in front of Quan Yin, is that a good thing?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is nothing wrong if you look at this Chinese goddess. Four or five times she came to me before I went to China. If you feel inspired by her, I will not be jealous of her! She is a goddess. Similarly, if you meditate on Mother Kali, I will not be jealous, because Mother Kali is my Mother. If you want to do it sometimes, then do it. I will be the last person to prevent you, because when you become one with God, you become one with all Cosmic Gods and Goddesses. But in your heart of hearts, you have to know always that this Indian Guru is enough for you.</p>  </div>
