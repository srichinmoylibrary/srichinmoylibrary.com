<p><em>(Several years later. Night. George Washington's elder half-brother, Lawrence, who died many years before, appears before his younger brother in a dream.)</em></p>
<p>Lawrence: George, I am sorry to ruin your sleep. I am sure you went to bed at nine o'clock as usual. You have hardly slept two hours. George, I am so proud of you. I am so proud of you. I am so proud of you. I salute the indomitable spirit of the General in you. I bow to the peerless wisdom of the President in you. I take endless pride in the Father of the Nation in you. George, I have come to you to cheer you up. Don't be sad. While I was on earth, you and I were extremely fond of each other. On the strength of our mutual fondness, I have come to tell you something special. I have known you from your very birth, George. You have always been a true lover of peace. You have always valued peace infinitely more than anything else. Our country needed you to fight for her. Our country needed you to liberate her from bondage-night. You surrendered your own will to our country's will; therefore, my pride in you knows no bounds. Under your supreme leadership our country has won the war. For many long years you have struggled far beyond any human imagination; therefore, I know how richly you deserve some rest. But our country needs you again. This time it needs you desperately to build an undivided nation. Our country needs your guidance inimitable. I assure you, George, that you will be the first and last president to be everybody's choice. Many will succeed you, but you, with your lofty ideals, will be their pole star. You will be their guiding hand. George, your dear brother Lawrence urges you to accept the presidency. Heed not your will, brother, but our country's will.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> O brother of my heart and soul, it is true that I commanded the whole American army, but today I gladly take your wish as a supreme command. Brother Lawrence, to please you is to please the real in me. I am definitely willing to become the President of America.</p>
<p><em>Lawrence:</em> I am most grateful to you. The entire nation will be grateful to you. I am truly proud of you, as the entire nation will be proud of you, George. Let me tell you something really sweet. Your young friend and greatest admirer, Henry Lee, will say something to the whole nation after you have left the body. His loftiest message will be echoed and re-echoed from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Nay, the whole world will admire his supreme discovery. Don't get excited, George. Of course, it is very easy to give advice; my own excitement is running riot. But this young friend of yours will declare, five days after paying his last respects to your deceased body, that you were first in war, first in peace and first in the hearts of your countrymen.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> How do you know that?</p>
<p><em>Lawrence:</em> Brother George, I live in Heaven. One can see and know everything from here. I am like someone who is at the top of the tree, who clearly sees and knows what is happening or what is going to happen all around the foot of the tree. Brother, Heaven is all vision, and I am enjoying this divine vision. Earth, where you are, is all mission. You are struggling, sometimes consciously and sometimes unconsciously, and you will be struggling surprisingly hard to fulfil your God-ordained supreme mission. George, you know perfectly well that I have never been a singer. But, to my genuine surprise, and no doubt yours, I have set a tune to Henry Lee's transcendental utterance.</p>
<p><em>(Lawrence sings, "First in war, first an peace, first in the hearts of his countrymen.")</em></p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> Excellent, Lawrence! You are an excellent singer.</p>
<p><em>Lawrence:</em> Thanks a lot, George. But it is getting rather late. I must go back to Heaven now.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> Oh no, please stay with me a little longer.</p>
<p><em>Lawrence:</em> George, I always get the greatest joy by pleasing you.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> And I, by pleasing you. Tell me, when are you going to come back again to encourage me, inspire me and elevate me?</p>
<p><em>Lawrence.</em> I shall definitely come as soon as I can. I shall definitely come as often as I can. But I tell you one thing, a top secret. Don't disclose it to anyone. I shall come to you for the last time on December 14, 1799. At that time I shall come to you to bring you to my home, where I am living now.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> Really? Lawrence, don't forget that significant day. I shall be eagerly expecting you. I tell you, Lawrence, I don't have the slightest desire to be thought of as the Father of the Nation. My grateful life and my soulful heart desire only to remain your eternal brother.</p>
<p><em>Lawrence:</em> I, too, want that. I, too, want to remain your eternal brother. I am sure the Almighty will grant our prayer.</p>  </div>
