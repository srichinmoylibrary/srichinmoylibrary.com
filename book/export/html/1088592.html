<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It can be changed only if the Indian souls again dive deep within and enter into the wisdom-light of the ancient Vedic seers and value their inner sight and inner visions. If they do this, then India will regain its tolerance, its compassion, its sympathy, its forgiveness and its God-surrendering life.</p>  </div>
