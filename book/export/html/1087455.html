<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> My Beloved Supreme,<br /> Once again I am diving deep<br /> Into Your Heart-Eternity's Compassion-Sea.<br /> I shall be attempting 300 pounds. After a week of rest while I was in Europe, now I am back. There also, I totally banked upon Your Compassion. You have granted me and my disciples three Peace Miles-in Berlin, Zurich and Geneva. I do not deserve Peace Miles, my students do not deserve them, but Your eternal and unconditional Compassion is with us in these illumining and fulfilling achievements for earth and for mankind.</p>
