<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I came to London just the other day. I do not know anybody here. I can only suggest to all of you here that, if some of you are really interested in the spiritual life, meditation and so forth, then you must form a small group, like a family, where three or four persons can meditate together. This will help you to some extent in your spiritual life. Unfortunately I do not know any spiritual Master here, otherwise I would immediately have mentioned someone you could try.</p>  </div>
