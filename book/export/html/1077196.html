<p>Joy is of paramount importance: joy within, joy without, joy in all spheres of life. How does one derive joy? One derives joy from a supreme art which a teacher possesses. When this supreme art the teacher offers to an individual, that particular individual becomes the possessor of joy. This offering is made through an awakening — the awakening in the student of a self-expressing creativity. Momentous is the prophetic utterance of the emperor-scientist: <em>“It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.”</em></p>  </div>
