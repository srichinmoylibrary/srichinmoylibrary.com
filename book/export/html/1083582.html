<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God did not ignore you before you met your Guru. He just prepared you silently, inwardly, lovingly, steadily, unerringly and unconditionally to meet your Guru at His choice Hour so that you could offer Him your soul's treasure: promise, and your heart's treasure: surrender.</p>  </div>
