<p>Today in the bakery I bought a loaf of bread. I don't appreciate bread at all, but some of my disciples like it. The sign said "honeybread," so I asked the girl behind the counter, "Is there honey inside, or is it just a name?"</p>
<p>The girl said, "I don't know." So she went to her boss, an elderly lady.</p>
<p>The boss said, "It has honey inside."</p>
<p>How they put honey inside the bread, God knows!</p>
