<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, that is true, true. Avatars are like doctors. When there is a doctor, the patients come and challenge the doctor. They say, "Let us see what kind of doctor you are. Either you can cure us or you are just pretending."</p>
<p>The Avatar-doctors accept the challenge. They say to the patients, "Then come here if you really mean to be cured."</p>  </div>
