<p>While I was in Japan, I was running in a park. At one point I saw ten or twelve American boys about to run short distances. The coach, a Japanese, said to me, "Come along. Run with us."</p>
<p>I said, "No, I can't run with you. You will run fast. I am running long-distance."</p>
<p>So I watched them. They were starting with one hundred or two hundred metre dashes. It was their morning run. Every day they run and many people in the park watch them. Their strides are quite good.</p>
