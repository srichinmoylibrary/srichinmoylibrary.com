<p>Advanced seekers are like tall trees;<br /> Beginning seekers are like small plants.<br /> Overnight a plant cannot become<br /> As tall, powerful and beautiful<br /> As the trees<br /> That have been ascending heavenward<br /> For many years,<br /> With roots firmly in the ground<br /> And branches aiming at the highest height.<br /> The trees can give the plants inspiration<br /> And aspiration.<br /> The trees can give the plants protection<br /> So they will not be blown away<br /> By doubt, suspicion and other negative forces.<br /> But only patience-light<br /> Can turn the aspiration-plants<br /> Into realisation-trees<br /> In God's Forest.</p>
