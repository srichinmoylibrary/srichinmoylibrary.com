<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. Within your activity if you can feel God's Presence, then whatever you are doing is with God and for God. Whether it is eating, or cooking, or working, if you are conscious of God, then you have to feel that God has entered into your activity. Sometimes you may be sitting quietly and trying to meditate, but you may be thinking of everything else in the world. So it is very possible that in the midst of activity you can feel the Presence of God more so than during your meditation.</p>
<p>Again, God comes to visit some people only when they are asleep. Before going to sleep they may meditate, but God will enter into their consciousness only when their mind and body are quiet, and this may happen only while they are sleeping.</p>  </div>
