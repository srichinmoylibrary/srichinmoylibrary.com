<p>One day Sri Ramakrishna said to Girish, "I see what kind of life you are leading, but do not worry. You just give me your power of attorney."</p>
<p>"What is this?" asked Girish. "What do you mean by 'power of attorney'?"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna said to him, "Whatever you are doing, you can continue doing, only say that I am responsible."</p>
<p>"How can I do that?" cried Girish.</p>
<p>"I am telling you to do it," said Sri Ramakrishna. "I am ready to take all your so-called sins."</p>
<p>So Girish gave Sri Ramakrishna his power of attorney. Then Girish found that he could no longer lead his old life. He was trying desperately to continue drinking, mixing with women and so forth, but he was unable to fully enter into those activities because he could not bear to bring Sri Ramakrishna into those situations. He was hesitating and hesitating with regard to his old habits because he did not want to cause Sri Ramakrishna any suffering.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna had assured him, "I will not suffer. You do whatever you want to do. Do not give up anything."</p>
<p>This is how Girish came to accept Sri Ramakrishna and develop such faith in him. Eventually, it came to the point where Girish was so devoted and surrendered to Sri Ramakrishna that he would challenge anybody who dared to say that Sri Ramakrishna was not God-realised.</p>
<p>They say that Girish was the first to declare that Sri Ramakrishna was an Avatar. The pandits were arguing and he presented such strong proof in favour of his Master.</p>  </div>
