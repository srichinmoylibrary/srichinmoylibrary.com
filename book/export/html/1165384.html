<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have to be very frank with you. In my case I had this realisation or self-discovery in a previous incarnation. I carried it with me to this incarnation. Once upon a time I studied the book and knew it perfectly. But in this incarnation it took me twenty years, from the age of twelve right up to thirty-two, to revise the old book.</p>  </div>
