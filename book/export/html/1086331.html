<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Think of yourself as a runner in a race. When the starter says, "Get on your mark; get set," at that time you feel all your body weight, your whole existence, on your fingertips. The fingertips take the weight but the actual power is coming from your heart, from your soul. The determination is coming from your inner existence, and this determination itself is power. Similarly, in the spiritual life, when you are concentrating and meditating, you are running toward your goal; inwardly you are a spiritual runner.</p>
<p>Our physical body is composed of various parts: our head, arms, legs and so on. Although the body is one unit, you will see that the hands do not always cooperate with the legs or the eyes do not always co-operate with the nose. Everything seems disoriented. One limb has nothing to do with another. Then, besides the physical sheath, we have a vital sheath, mental sheath and psychic sheath. All of these also seem to act independently. But you also have to feel that there is a specific place where you receive all your strength, energy and determination so that you can run the fastest inwardly. Once again, that place is your heart and your soul.</p>
<p>Try to feel that all your strength, all your determination and will-power is in one particular place, here inside your heart. Feel that you don't exist at all except in this tiny place. You don't have eyes, you don't have a nose, you don't have anything. Intensity will come only when you feel that your entire existence is concentrated at one particular place and not scattered.</p>  </div>
