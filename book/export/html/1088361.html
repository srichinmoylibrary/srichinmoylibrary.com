<p>Once Bijoykrishna went to visit Ramdas Kathiya Baba while he was holding a meeting. His disciples were asking their Master questions, but Bijoykrishna remained silent. When he was about to go away, the disciples of Kathiya Baba said to him, "You came all the way from a distant village to meet with our Master. Do you not have anything to ask?"</p>
<p>Bijoykrishna said, "I have already asked him many, many questions. He has answered all my questions inwardly."</p>
<p>Ramdas smiled and said, "It is absolutely true."</p>
<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>When silence asks a question and silence answers, both the question and the answer are most powerful, for the question and answer start their journey in the silence-heart and end in the silence-heart. When the question and answer are not from the silence world and are not in the silence world, the mind wants to add something to the question and to the answer. What the mind adds is nothing but a doubtful, hesitant and discouraging existence-reality. When the mind is involved, the reality-experience is not and cannot be spontaneous; therefore, it is infinitely inferior to the reality-experience which lives in the heart, with the heart and for the heart. In the heart spontaneity always reigns supreme.</p>  </div>
