<p>Today is a very good and special day for me to think of God. Today is a very good and special day for me to pray to God. Today is a very good and special day for me to meditate on God. Today is a very good and special day for me to love God. Today is a very good and special day for me to speak to God.</p>
<p>Why? Why? Why? Because today nature is extra peaceful and extra soulful. Today nature is lovingly and unreservedly helping me both inwardly and outwardly in my life of aspiration and dedication.</p>
<p>Today, while I am thinking of God, I feel that there is no necessity on my part to think of anything or anybody else. I feel that from now on I shall be thinking of God alone. Indeed, it is a great accomplishment.</p>
<p>Today, while I am praying to God, I no longer feel attached to the possession-life, but lovingly drawn to the illumination-life. Today, while I am meditating on God, I clearly see that my self-giving is nothing short of my God-becoming.</p>
<p>Today, while I am loving God, I feel that there is nobody on earth who knows what love truly is. I don't blame anybody, for in order to love others one must become love itself. It is God alone who has that capacity and who knows what love is. Therefore, I have decided from today to love only God. He is at once the Love divine, the Lover eternal and the Beloved immortal.</p>
<p>Today, while I am speaking to God, I feel and see clearly that each individual human being is in the process of evolution; I feel and see clearly that each individual human being is an evolving God, a realising God, a manifesting God and a fulfilling God. Each individual human being is another living and perfect God of tomorrow.</p>
