  <h1 class="book-heading">1937</h1>
  
 

<p>You know perfectly well<br /> That you cannot govern your life<br /> Even for a single day.<br /> Then why do you not vote for God?<br /> Once He becomes the Ruler<br /> Of your life,<br /> You will see that He can easily<br /> And unconditionally<br /> Govern your life.</p>

<p>Do not expect others,<br /> Who are in so many ways<br /> As weak as you are,<br /> If not worse,<br /> To stop you from doing<br /> The wrong thing.<br /> It is only your prayer to God<br /> That can eventually help you<br /> Overcome your weaknesses.</p>

<div id="node-1187604" class="section-2">

<div id="node-1187605" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1950</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1187612" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1957</h1>
  
 

<p>Because I was raised<br /> On God's Compassion,<br /> I can easily and inseparably<br /> Become one<br /> With humanity's imperfection<br /> And inspire humanity<br /> To look upward, to dive inward<br /> And not to lose hope.</p>

<p>Oneness is the perfect expansion<br /> Of our inner reality.<br /> Let our heart's oneness only increase<br /> To make us feel<br /> That we belong to a universal world-family,<br /> And this world-family<br /> Is a fulfilled Dream of God.</p>
