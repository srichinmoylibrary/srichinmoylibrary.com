<blockquote>
<p>"Music is not illusion, but revelation."</p>
<p><em> â€” Peter Ilyicb Tchaikovsky</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One does not have to be a musician of the highest order in order to see eye-to-eye with you. Any man, as long as he is a music-lover, knows and feels that the supreme utterance by the supreme musician in you is absolutely true.</p>  </div>
