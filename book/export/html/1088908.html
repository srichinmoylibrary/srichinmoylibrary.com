<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to acquire harmony, one needs peace of mind in order to have peace of mind, one needs to pray and meditate most soulfully on the Inner Pilot, who has created the necessity for inner harmony; one prays properly, then peace of mind and harmony will be reflected in all one's outer movements. When the mind has peace, then there is always harmony in all the activities which take place in one's being.</p>  </div>
