<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you realise God, He will not ask you, "What did he think of you?" or "What did she think of you?" God will immediately ask you, "What did you think of yourself?" or "What did you think of Me?" God will not ask you what others thought of you. As soon as you stand in front of God, He is not going to give you a pass-mark according to others' opinions of you. He is not going to look to see whether others appreciated or admired you. No, He is the boss; He doesn't need others' recommendation. When You go to the Supreme, at that time He will not ask what the world thought of you: He will ask if you paid attention to your spiritual life of aspiration and dedication. And you will have to prove that you have done this and you have done that for Him.</p>
<p>Suppose someone speaks highly of you. Do you think that person is lifting you up to the top of the Himalayas? Similarly, by depreciating you, by speaking ill of you, that person can't bring you down. No! His opinion has no value. You are to God what you actually are: what you think of yourself and what you think of God in yourself. Your assessment is your own value. Again, our assessment may not always he right. Sometimes we think we are pure, but we are impure; but no harm. When we make a wrong assessment, God is there to show us compassion and kindness. But God doesn't want us to waste a single minute worrying about what others think of us. Your life is God's Life. God's Life and your life are inseparable and God doesn't need the opinion of the world to assess what you are doing. If you are praying and meditating, you are an excellent seeker. Your action is your certificate; your action is everything in God's eye.</p>  </div>
