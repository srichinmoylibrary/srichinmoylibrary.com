<p>Each of his spiritual children<br /> Was convinced that he saw<br /> No one but him,<br /> No one but her;<br /> Loved no one but him,<br /> No one but her;<br /> Blessed no one but her,<br /> No one but him;<br /> Admired no one but her,<br /> No one but him.<br /> He lost his existence<br /> Between their blind ego-publicity,<br /> And his giant frustration-futility.</p>
