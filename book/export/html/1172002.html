<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best thing is not to do these things. You are in a different boat, one that will only encourage you to love God and devote your existence to serving God. The best thing is to try our path wholeheartedly. I don't want to say the others are wrong, but you will have more success on this path if you try it wholeheartedly.</p>  </div>
