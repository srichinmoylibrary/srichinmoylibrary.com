<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This means that I want you to give more importance to your inner life than to your outer life. If you do not pay more attention to the inner life, no matter what you achieve in the outer life, you will not be satisfied. So in order to be satisfied, truly satisfied and fulfilled, I want you to meditate more. What I told you was not just to meditate, but to meditate more than you have been doing.</p>  </div>
