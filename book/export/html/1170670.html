<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I am cutting jokes, it is all right to do anything. But when I am meditating or even answering spiritual questions, then you should sit properly. Otherwise, if you put your legs up and are very relaxed, then you receive next to nothing from me. Even worse, you will ruin the aspiration of those around you who are sincerely trying to receive. I am asking all my disciples to show proper respect when I am doing something spiritual. Those who are sitting in the front row have to be particularly careful. By your physical movements you can cause all kinds of problems, not only for yourselves but also for those who are sitting behind you.</p>  </div>
