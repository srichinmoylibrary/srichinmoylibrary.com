<p>Troilanga Swami once went into a Kali temple. He was followed into the temple by a young, highly advanced seeker named Bijoykrishna Goswami. To Bijoykrishna's wide surprise, Troilanga Swami passed water and sprinkled the whole statue of Kali. Bijoykrishna was frightened and horrified that a man could do this. "What are you doing?" he demanded.</p>
<p>Troilanga Swami replied, "This is all Ganges water. I am worshipping the Mother Kali."</p>
<p>When the people who were in charge of the temple came in, Bijoykrishna told them what the Master had done. The people in charge were not at all shocked. "Oh, Troilanga Swami has done it," they said. "He is one with Lord Shiva. If it had been somebody else, we would have taken him to task. We would have been furious and we would have punished him. But Troilanga Swami is always in Lord Shiva-Consciousness. Shiva and Kali are one, so we don't have to worry at all."</p>
<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>The Source is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. It is Reality omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent. The lover of the Source, the knower of the Source, the dweller in the Source and the possessor of the Source are all the same. Troilanga Swami as the lover of Kali and the beloved of Kali is the self-same reality.</p>  </div>
