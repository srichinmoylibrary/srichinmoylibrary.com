<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You use the term ‘intelligence’. But in the spiritual world we call it ‘consciousness’ or ‘intuition’. Intelligence can never be infinite. Intelligence comes from the brain; it is in the mind. Whatever is inside the brain, inside the mind, can never be infinite; whereas intuition can be infinite, consciousness can be infinite, and here we find different levels. Although intuition is infinite, there are layers upon layers or degrees of intuition. So when somebody says that he did something through intuition, it doesn’t necessarily mean that he was acting from the same level of intuition as somebody else.</p>  </div>
