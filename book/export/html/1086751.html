<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can see God if you cry for God the way you cry for a toy or for a fruit or for clothes. There are many things on earth which you cry for because you feel you need them. But if you really cry and feel the same kind of necessity for God as you have for the many things on earth, if not more, then you will easily be able to see God.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>I am telling you a great secret: you are a fantastic Dream of God</em>, Agni Press, 1974<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/gsdg-41</p></small>    </div>  </body>
