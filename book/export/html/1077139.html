<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have to become angry, then become angry with me, because I have the capacity to throw your anger into the Universal Consciousness. But if you become angry with another disciple, then it is like a blind man attacking a poor fellow. This will be a very sad story. A blind man and a poor man will not be able to get any illumination from life. So it is better always to throw your anger into me.</p>
<p>When you maintain anger towards someone else, it becomes a serious problem. A disciple of a spiritual Master was once consumed with animal anger. He wrote to his Master and said, “If you say that you are going to grant liberation to this man, then I don’t need your liberation.” Then the disciple left the Master. So you can see the capacity of anger.</p>  </div>
