<p>Constant aspiration tells you that God is both finite and infinite. You can see God, clasp God and become God precisely because He appears before you as a divinely finite reality. God stands before you, loves you, illumines you and fulfils you precisely because He is infinite in His universal self-giving Reality and also He is infinite in His self-transcending transcendental Reality.</p>
