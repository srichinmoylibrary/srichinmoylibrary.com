<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The whole thing is contradictory. Perfection is God in manifestation. If you use the term perfection, then you have to know you are speaking of God-manifestation in and through humanity. We are imperfect, but there is someone who is perfect and that is God. Just because God is eternally perfect, you and I are crying for God-realisation. We are crying to see perfection in our life by invoking God's Presence or by bringing to the fore God's Presence. If someone doesn't believe in the Goal, why would he try to realise it?</p>  </div>
