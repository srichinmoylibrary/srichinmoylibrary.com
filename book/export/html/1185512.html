<p>The son asked his father: “Father, please tell me if there is any difference between you and my mother?”</p>
<p>The father replied: “Son, there is a great difference between your mother and me. As you know, your mother is an unrecognised incapacity, and I am an unmanifested capacity.”</p>
<p>Then the son asked his mother: “Mother, is there any difference between you and my father?”</p>
<p>“My son, certainly, there is. Your father is in love with himself and I am in love with God. This is the difference.”</p>
<p>The boy then said: “Mother, you are in love with God and Father is in love with himself, and I am in love with Judy. We are all lovers.”</p>  </div>
