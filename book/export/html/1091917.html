<p><em>SUDHA:</em> By accepting life as it is, we are transforming our ignorance. Life as it is, is the workshop where we can work out our limitations and enter into the path of love, devotion and surrender. Illumined by our spiritual Master, we will be guided to the Feet of the Supreme. AUM.</p>
<p><em>AGNI:</em> Sri Chinmoy's philosophy is that God can be felt, can be realised, nay, has to be realised by every person on earth. All of us are God's chosen children, but the time it takes for a person to realise God depends on his aspiration and the help of a competent spiritual Master or Guru. The wisest and safest way to realise God is the path of love, devotion and surrender. Life has to be accepted fully and then transformed, so that God's Qualities of Light, Peace, Love, Bliss and Power, which are our divine heritage, are manifested on earth with the help of our Guru's grace.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy's philosophy for me is love, devotion and surrender. He is the one who is carrying me to the Supreme. I have no fear. For me, he is light, love and everything in this life.</p>
<p>The key concepts of Sri Chinmoy's philosophy to me are purity and absolute faith. In these two words, in this two marvellous ideas, all the divine qualities are comprehended. He has affected such a wonderful influence in my inner soul, in the innermost recesses of my heart, and in myself, that really I have been turned inside out. He offers, with his philosophy, the most beautiful panoramas, the most beautiful vistas of happiness, felicity, bliss and consciousness of unity with the whole world, that we feel that our fellow men, all nations, the whole universe, along with God Himself, are ours. So I am more than pleased and honoured and grateful to Sri Chinmoy Kumar Ghose for all he has done for me. Thank you.</p>  </div>
