<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The universe can never be destroyed. Let us use the term 'world'. The world is such a vast place. No matter how many bombs are dropped, total destruction cannot take place. But if someone has dropped a bomb and destroyed my house, then in my mind my whole world is gone. We use the term 'world' according to our mental conception.</p>
<p>As long as God wants to keep His creation, the whole universe will not be destroyed. A portion may be destroyed, but if we see that portion with our inner eye, we will see that it is an infinitesimal portion of the entire reality, which we call the universe. A few mischievous boys may play with fireworks and destroy their own house or a few houses around them, but there are millions and billions of houses, and they cannot destroy all of them. In Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed, but Japan is not the whole world. Again, Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been reborn. They have now become sacred peace shrines.</p>
<p>This world will never end, because inside the world is God's own Vision, God's own Hope, God's own Promise. If a potter creates a few vessels, a mad animal may for no reason come and destroy some of the vessels. But the potter can easily create more. God is the Creator. At every second he can create a new world.</p>
<p>From the spiritual point of view, if people are not aspiring, if people are living only in the desire-world, then you can call it the destruction of our aspiration. But the physical universe cannot be destroyed at any particular time.</p>  </div>
