<h2><em>Professor Leonard Hudson:</em> Is God judgemental and, if so, is God judgemental of individuals or of society?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, God is not judgemental, far from it! He does not judge us; He loves us and loves us. We human beings use our minds to judge others. God has no time to judge us. He spends all His time loving us, for He has and is only the Heart.</p>
<p>When we judge others, we try to take an account of their good deeds and bad deeds, but when we love others, we go far beyond good deeds and bad deeds. The strength of our genuine love devours both their good deeds and their bad deeds at the same time.</p>
<p>The mother showers boundless affection on her child, even when the rest of the world says that he is a scoundrel of the worst dye. Her affection for her son far transcends her son's deeds. In this respect, God is like a mother.</p>
<p>You can also say that God is like a great grandfather. He indulgently feels that by judging someone, we in no way help the person to improve. On the contrary, his fear of us, his reaction to our judgement, only delays his Heaven-bound progress and his achievement of the supreme Reality. God is inwardly telling us and teaching us to pray to Him and to grow into His very Image. To sit on the seat of judgement is not the right thing to do. The right thing is to love the Absolute Lord Supreme and be loved by the Absolute Lord Supreme in His own Way. This is the only way humanity's tears and Divinity's Smiles can become one in the Oneness-Fulness-Heart of God the Beloved Supreme.</p>  </div>
