<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People often feel that anything that is new is good. But what is new can also be destructive. Some people feel that Communism is good because they are sick of corruption. Unfortunately, Communism will also give them that. In the theoretical world, Communism may be very idealistic. It says that whatever we have is for everyone to share. But this is only a play of words. In reality we see that Communism is not like that at all.</p>  </div>
