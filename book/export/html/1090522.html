<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you feel that your Master is an Avatar, it will help you in your spiritual progress. But if somebody else denies it, if somebody else does not subscribe to your view, he has every right to question your belief. At the same time, you have every right to believe in your own spiritual awakening, and have faith in your Master. You will gain much if you have faith in your Master. If you feel that he is an Avatar, that will not take away your aspiration; on the contrary, it will increase your aspiration. But if there is someone who follows some other Guru and does not want to believe your judgement, it does not matter. You will be helped if you have absolute faith in your own Master.</p>  </div>
