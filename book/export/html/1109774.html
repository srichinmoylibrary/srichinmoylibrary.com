<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has to create. While He is creating, He has to have a place of His own. When you go out and pitch a tent, that is your place. The world is very vast, but you feel that in this tent you will work, you will play, you will eat, you will sleep, you will do everything.</p>
<p>When you go to a workshop, what do you see? The workshop has walls, it has a floor and a ceiling. But inside the workshop people are working and making things. The boundaries mark their field of creation.</p>  </div>
