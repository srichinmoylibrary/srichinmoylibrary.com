<p>According to Ramanuja, the world is real, absolutely real. But it is wanting in perfection. At the same time, it does not care for perfection. It has no destined goal. The world was created by God's Inspiration, is sustained by His Concern, and will be dissolved by His Will. The world is God's playground. He performs His <em>Lila</em> here. This eternal Sport of His is His constant movement, spontaneous expression in endless repetition. Man is real. But he has to depend on God. The world is real. But it has to depend on God. Without God, both man and the world are meaningless futility. Man can be released and will be released from the meshes of ignorance one day and is bound to realise God. But there will always be some difference between man and God. Hence he always has to worship God. Ramanuja's path is mainly the path of devotion.</p>  </div>
