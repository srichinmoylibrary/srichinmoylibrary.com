  <h1 class="book-heading">Truth</h1>
  
 
<p>The doubting mind says that there is only one Truth: that the existence of God is a piece of colossal imagination. The aspiring heart says that there is only one Truth: God is, God exists. The all-offering and all-surrendering soul says that there is only one Truth: God-realisation is yours.</p>
<p>God has infinite names, but of these infinite names, Truth is His all-loving and all-fulfilling name.</p>  </div>
