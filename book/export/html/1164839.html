<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to meditate well immediately after we wake up, we must take a few deep breaths, and as we breathe, offer most soulful gratitude to the Supreme. But, before we actually sit down to meditate, we have to wash our face and clean ourselves thoroughly in order to chase away all drowsiness from our consciousness.</p>  </div>
