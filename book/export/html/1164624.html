<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Don't try to convince the mind that spirituality is the only thing worth having. Only try to pay all attention to the heart. The mind will become jealous and it will run after you. Now you are running after the mind as if it were a mischievous child. You are telling it you don't want it. But, like a mother, you should ignore the mischievous child and go to some other child. Then the mischievous child will come running. If you go to the right person, the heart, which is simple, humble, sweet and polite, immediately the mind will come racing after you because the mind also wants attention. Then when the mind comes to you, you will illumine the mind with your soul's light. No matter how many times you tell a naughty boy not to do something, he won't listen. But when he sees that somebody else is getting attention by doing something else, then he will start listening.</p>  </div>
