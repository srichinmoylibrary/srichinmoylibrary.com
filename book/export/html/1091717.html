<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They were not conscious of their real identity. When they came to earth, they forgot. All spiritual Masters forget when they come to earth. Even Avatars forget their previous realisations. Then again they start rediscovering their realisations and rewriting the book.</p>  </div>
