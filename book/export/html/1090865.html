    <title>Question: Sometimes during concentration at twilight, for instance, I hear a vibration which is like a murmur or a hum. Is that vibration from my own subtle body or is it the vibration of the earth, of the atmosphere?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The vibration comes from your subtle body. It does not come from outside, particularly in your case.</p>  </div>
