<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just think of your own children when they were infants and absolutely helpless without you. If you can have the feeling that you depend entirely on your soulâ€™s help the way they depended upon you, then you can have a sweeter and more intimate relationship with your soul.</p>  </div>
