<p>The Toledo Marathon in 1979 was my best marathon. I did it in 3:55. It was so cold that day! Sometimes I was running on the left side so I could pass people, but sometimes I ran in between people to keep warm. In the beginning, before the sun came out, it was twenty-four degrees, so I was running in between people. Even so, at one point my back was freezing.</p>
