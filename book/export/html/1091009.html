<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No harm. Why don't you put cold water on your eyes?</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> I take a shower, but still I fall asleep after about five minutes.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why don't you pinch yourself as hard as possible and feel that your roommate is pinching you? Then you will say, "Stop, stop, stop, stop!" When you are falling asleep, pinch yourself as hard as possible, and think that somebody else is pinching you. While you are pinching, it is actually your consciousness that is pinching your unconsciousness. But, at that time, you have to feel that a third person is doing the pinching.</p>  </div>
