<p>This morning when I was in front of my house walking, a funny thing happened with the neighbour who is on our right side. He is a young man whom I do not know very well. It is not like the neighbour across the street, whom I know so well.</p>
<p>I thought my right-side neighbour was in his car, so I said, "Good morning, good morning!" Then he said to me, "Good morning!"</p>
<p>Five minutes later the actual neighbour came out of his house and said "Good morning!" to me. Then he entered into the same car. So I said, "Good morning." The first one was my neighbour's brother perhaps, but I thought it was him.</p>
<p>His older daughter always looks at me with such respect. When little children are cycling on the street, bothering me like anything, she is always very nice to me.</p>
