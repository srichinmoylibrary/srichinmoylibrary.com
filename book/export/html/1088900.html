<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If a person feels that what the Bible says is absolutely true and has implicit faith in the Bible's teachings, then he should definitely continue in his life of faith. But if somebody says that there are a few things he cannot accept from the Bible, and if he wants to get some new clarification or new illumination in his life by studying something else or by diving deep within, then he is entitled to do so. God wants satisfaction in us. If someone gets satisfaction from absolute faith in the Bible, wonderful. But if he does not find satisfaction there, then let him study something else. Let him study his own life: let him dive deep within in order to find the truth which will satisfy him.</p>  </div>
