<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If a woman has to make a choice between weightlifting and bodybuilding, I feel that bodybuilding is the right choice. Beauty itself is strength. Inner beauty and even outer beauty carry strength in themselves. Since women care more for beauty than men do, then it is advisable for them to enter more into bodybuilding than weightlifting.</p>  </div>
