<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This dream has three possible meanings. When you fall, if you are frightened to death, it means that your consciousness has become totally one with your vital being. This kind of dream has actually taken place in the vital plane. If you are falling and enjoying the fall, like a child playing on a trampoline, it means you are becoming one with the aspiring reality that is below you and around you. This dream takes place in the psychic plane. If you see while falling, that many human beings are looking at you from below with an eager hunger, that means you are bringing down light from above to feed aspiring humanity. This dream is an unusual and, at the same time, most significant dream. It takes place only in the soulâ€™s plane proper.</p>  </div>
