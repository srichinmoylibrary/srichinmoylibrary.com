<p>Raisa Maximovna Gorbachev, O Sister of the Soviet Union, your momentous utterance runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am an atheist, but I know the church, and I respect all faiths. It is, after all, a personal matter. I believe in the natural goodness of people, and I firmly believe that no one wants war."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She who respects all faiths is a supreme seeker. To believe in the natural goodness of people is in itself a high attainment. Each human being has to have faith in something. Without faith one cannot exist. Your faith is in the goodness of human beings. For us that very thing is God, for God is all Goodness. Therefore, you do believe in God.</p>
<p>Now President Gorbachev comes to our assistance with a confident step forward, inward and upward to raise the consciousness of humanity. Compellingly, he declares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Let each live by his own convictions and worship his own God."</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
