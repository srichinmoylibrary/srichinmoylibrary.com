    <title>Question: When you speak of human life and divine life it sounds like they are two separate worlds. I find myself here in this world. Why must there be another world?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are already two worlds in us: the world of desire and the world of aspiration. Each day we enter into these two worlds. When we enter into the life of possession, we enter into the world of desire. When we enter into the life of transformation, we enter into the world of aspiration.</p>
<p>These two worlds — the world of human desire and the world of divine aspiration — are inside us, not around us. When we enter into the world of desire, we try to bind. But before we can bind anything, we discover that that thing has already bound us. When we enter into the world of aspiration, we try to liberate. Before liberating or while liberating the world, we discover that we ourselves are also being liberated.</p>
