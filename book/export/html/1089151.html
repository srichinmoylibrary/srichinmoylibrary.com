<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right, absolutely! The power of destruction is not the answer. Nobody has ever appreciated the power of destruction and nobody will ever appreciate it. It is the power of love, the power of oneness, that is of paramount importance. Peace comes from oneness. People will appreciate, admire and adore the lover of peace and not the destroyer of peace. Japan lost in the war. But the entire world sympathised with Japan's immeasurable loss after Hiroshima. You were fighting and fighting on one level and then somebody came with a most powerful weapon and changed the nature of the fighting. It is as if somebody pinches me and then I attack him with a big knife.</p>  </div>
