<p>One of the disciples had brought some gifts for Kanu and Sona. The gifts were inside bags on the porch, but I did not have to take them out. The dogs took the gifts out themselves.</p>
<p>Nirvik was massaging me at the time. He said, “Oh, Guru, how could they do it?”</p>
<p>But they knew the gifts were theirs.</p>
