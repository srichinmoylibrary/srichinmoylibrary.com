<p>The other day, when Kami was at Mridul’s Compassion-Height Animal Hospital getting an injection, he was crying so pitifully. I was in Chicago, but how his soul was coming to me! I felt miserable and phoned up New York. Sona is very brave, but not Kanu.</p>
<p>Kanu’s soul has come to me so many times. When Kanu was a month and a half old, his soul started talking to me. At that time, Kanu was lying on my chest, and then he began looking at me. It happened at two or three o’clock in the morning.</p>
