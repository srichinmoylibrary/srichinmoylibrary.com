<p>The genuine self-giving of the United Nations has already become a tangible reality in the inner world. Now slowly and steadily it is being manifested in the outer world. Before long there shall come a time when the entire humanity will fully realise the indispensable peace-contribution that the United Nations has been making right from its very birth. No awakened human being will fail to subscribe to the Secretary-General's self-evident utterance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All supporters of the United Nations have been greatly encouraged by the fact that many of the confrontations and conflicts in the world are giving way to dialogue. Their belief in the indispensability of the Organisation has been fully justified. Multilateral efforts towards peace as stimulated, directed or channelled by the United Nations have been seen to bring results."</p>
