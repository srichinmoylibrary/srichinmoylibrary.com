<p>One day Girish decided that he would not believe in Sri Ramakrishna anymore unless he received some special sign from Sri Ramakrishna. He was ready to give his life for his Master, but at the same time he was cursing his Master. This is all crazy Bengali emotional feeling. One moment we say that you are the best possible person; the next moment we say that you are the worst.</p>
<p>Anyway, on the very day that Girish made his decision, late at night, he heard a knock at his door. He opened it only to find his Master was standing there. Sri Ramakrishna had come to see Girish personally.</p>
<p>This kind of experience endowed Girish with tremendous faith in his Master.</p>  </div>
