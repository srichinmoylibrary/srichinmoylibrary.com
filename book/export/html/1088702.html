<p><em>On 20 April 2005 at Aspiration-Ground in New York, Sri Chinmoy honoured British marathon runner Paula Radcliffe who holds the women's marathon world record with a time of 2:15:25. This is an extract from Paula's comments after Sri Chinmoy had lifted her overhead and presented her with the "Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart" Award and Sri Chinmoy's subsequent remarks.</em></p>  </div>
