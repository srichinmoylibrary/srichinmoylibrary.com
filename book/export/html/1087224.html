<p>This morning I went shopping in a mall. X drove me there, and Y was the distinguished back-seater.</p>
<p>In one store I was browsing through a book called <em>How to Become a U.S. Citizen.</em> My soul was telling me not to waste my time because it does not want me to become a U.S. citizen. The book had so many facts that had to be learned if someone wanted to become a U.S. citizen: what was the capital of this state; how many members there are in the Senate and Congress; and so forth. How do people remember all these things?</p>
<p>An elderly woman about 70 years old asked me, "Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>I answered, "India."</p>
<p>She said, "Do you have a green card?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, I have a green card."</p>
<p>She asked, "Now you want to become a citizen?"</p>
<p>"No, no," I replied.</p>
<p>Then I turned around and started looking at books in the religion section. I bought some books about Socrates, Buddha and the Christ. I also saw a tiny booklet by Thomas Merton. Vidagdha had written her Masters' thesis on him. The lady was still watching me. I saw one of my booklets, <em>The Fountain-Heart of Wisdom.</em> The price sticker was over the word 'Wisdom', and I was trying to read the title behind the sticker. The lady saw me trying to read the title and she said, "Wisdom." Then she said, "By Sri Chinmoy â€” wise guy Sri Chinmoy."</p>
<p>I was quite amused and just smiled at her. I didn't have the heart to tell her I was that wise guy.</p>
