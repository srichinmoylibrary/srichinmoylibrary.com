<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The easiest and most effective way to conquer depression and all negative forces is to smile inwardly and outwardly with a sincere smile. Smile inwardly and outwardly at your enemy and say, “Oh, you have come. I am ready to conquer you.” If this smile is sincere and soulful, you cannot lose. The greatest strength you have is your inner joy, and this inner joy comes only from faith — faith that whatever is best for you will come from the Supreme. Now, what is best for you can be absolutely the worst thing for somebody else, and what is best for that person can be the worst thing for you. What you really need — not what you want but what you need — the Supreme is bound to give you.</p>  </div>
