<p>When I was running this morning, I passed by a very fat man about my age waiting for the bus. He was wearing a heavy coat and scarf. God knows how long he had been waiting, and I felt sorry for him.</p>
<p>I was making loud noises while I was running, huffing and puffing. The fat man said to me, "How old are you?"</p>
<p>I said, "Fifty."</p>
<p>"You are running like a hundred-year-old man," he said.</p>
<p>After I covered thirty metres more, a thought entered into my mind: "Let me invite him to run with me." But this was all in the mental world, not in the practical world, and I kept on running.</p>
