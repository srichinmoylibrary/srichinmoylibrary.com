  <h1 class="book-heading">Is aspiration the ultimate goal?</h1>
  
 
<p>For one individual, aspiration is the goal according to his vision or capacity or receptivity. He is absolutely right according to his own awareness, his soulâ€™s present development. But another person who has gone beyond this level of development will say, "No, aspiration is not the end." The first person is correct, but the second person has gone far, far beyond that goal.</p>
<p>When a child looks at a ladder, if he can reach the first rung, it is enough for him. That is his goal. But an expert climber, an adult, will see that this is only the first step. Similarly, when it is a matter of the inner life, the spiritual life, experience and realisation can better be explained by a seeker of the ultimate Truth than by a philosopher.</p>
<p>Many so-called philosophers in India do not have the authority to express the inner truth. They do not know what inner truth is. Very often philosophers enter into a sad controversy. Then they go to spiritual Masters who have not studied even one philosophical book or even one spiritual book. The philosophers explain their ideas in the most complicated philosophical jargon, but a spiritual Master can answer everything in one or two words. Then the philosophers go home in peace.</p>
<p>Six or seven years ago two eminent philosophers had a great debate over consciousness and infinity. For hours and hours they argued. Then they went to a very great spiritual teacher. She had read practically nothing but through her spiritual illumination, her inner illumination, she shed light on the problem of these two philosophers. She summed up everything in just a few words and then they went home.</p>
<p>If you enter into the deeper philosophy, you get inner vision. Philosophy means <em>darshan</em> and <em>darshan</em> also means vision. If you go still deeper, you come into the life of yoga. In yoga, you have not to see consciousness as something apart from you; you get consciousness as your very own.</p>
<p>Our vision of the goal entirely depends on our level of consciousness. According to the understanding and vision of some people, aspiration is the goal. But according to our understanding, the Goal is far beyond that.</p>  </div>
