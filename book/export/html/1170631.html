<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some spiritual Masters declared the date of their realisation, whereas others did not. Sri Aurobindo declared a specific date when the Krishna Consciousness fully descended into him, and he recognised that day as the day of his God-realisation. Buddha also declared his realisation on a specific day. Sri Ramakrishna, on the other hand, did not observe any date for his realisation. In my case, I do not want to declare it. Also, I achieved realisation in previous incarnations. Again, there is no end to our realisation, since God Himself is all the time transcending His own Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. So God-realisation, after it has been attained, can eternally be transcended, expanded and perfected.</p>  </div>
