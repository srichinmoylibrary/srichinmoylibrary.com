<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The athlete must sincerely <em>feel</em> that he has a soul and not just think so because someone has said it is true. Many people don't have direct access even to their heart, so how can they have access to their soul? It is through meditation, continuous and regular meditation, that we can feel the presence of the soul and eventually see the soul. But even if we do not see the soul, if we just feel the presence of the soul inside the depth of our heart, then gradually we can bring its light into the vital, mind and physical. But first we have to know that the soul exists. It must not be just mental belief but a real psychic experience.</p>  </div>
