<p>Today on the very first day and the very first attempt I lifted 220 pounds in each arm simulta- neously. All the advisers say to increase the increment by five pounds a month. It is such a big jump to add 40 pounds.</p>
<p>Yesterday at five oâ€™clock I had pizza. That is why I had strength. If I do not eat pizza or something else that is filling, then I do not have strength.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, I felt my body shaking. Then I realised that the whole house was shaking, plus I heard noises. Finally, I came to realise that somebody had left the dryer on upstairs.</p>
