<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I don't want to take the credit. Your consciousness is like a bird. You have the bird and you have the tree. The bird is flying up to sit on a higher branch; later it may come down. But it is true that every day I meditate on you. Very often I get vibrations from you and others and then spiritually I project my consciousness into your physical consciousness.</p>  </div>
