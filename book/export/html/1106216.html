<p>This morning when I was attempting to lift 800 pounds with one arm, Mother Kali was right in front of me, full of compassion and power. When I was about to make my fourth attempt, Mother Kali said to me, “My son, it is already done.” Then I did lift 800 pounds.</p>
<p>So for both 700 and 800 pounds, all credit goes to my dearest Mother Kali.</p>
