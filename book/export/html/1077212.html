<p>The scientist-sage had genuine love for India. He also had tremendous admiration for the Indian leaders who were the fate-makers of India, like Gandhi and Nehru. Einstein deeply appreciated and soulfully admired Gandhi’s non-violence movement. In his study he cherished a drawing of Gandhi, a striking reminder that the soul-power is infinitely superior to military power. To his family he read aloud Gandhi’s autobiography. The soul-power, which is inner freedom, eventually brings about outer freedom as well. Einstein’s heart and mind were fully convinced of this supreme truth.</p>
<p>India is the harbinger of inner peace. India is the pioneer of inner heart’s inner oneness. The scientist felt it in the very depth of his heart. He himself was a staunch supporter of peace. He himself cared for peace more than anything else, both in national life and in international life. His heart-door and his house-door were wide open to the Indians. This singular gesture was not meant for all other nationalities.</p>
<p>Once an interview took place between Einstein and India’s Ambassador to the United States, Gaganvihari Mehta. At the very outset the Ambassador said to the scientist, <em>“I have come to invite you to attend a science conference in India as an honoured guest of our country.”</em></p>
<p>Einstein’s immediate response was both sorrowful and soulful: <em>“Both because of my health and my age I must decline, but it is with regret, for I have a deep regard for the of people of India and for Prime Minister Nehru.”</em></p>
<p>During the interview at one point the Indian Ambassador struck a note of similarity between Gandhi and Einstein. Softly, humbly, unhesitatingly and sagaciously said the scientist, <em>“Don’t, please, compare me with Gandhi. He did so much for humanity. What have I done? There is nothing unusual about discovering a few scientific formulas.”</em></p>  </div>
