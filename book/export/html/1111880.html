<p>After two miles I felt as if I had run a whole marathon. The humidity was so bad, and also it was drizzling. I didn't mind the rain, but the humidity was so bad that after two miles I wanted to give up. With greatest difficulty I continued.</p>
<p>After four miles I started running and walking. After nine and a half miles, I was absolutely walking for four or five hundred metres at a time. Then whom did I see? Fred Lebow! He came from behind me. When I saw him, I said, "Oh, you were behind me?"</p>
<p>He started running with me. He asked me how many marathons I had run. I said, "This is my twentieth."</p>
<p>He said, "I am fifty years old and this is my fiftieth marathon."</p>
<p>I said, "I am congratulating you! For each year of your life you have run one marathon."</p>
<p>Then he said, "Look behind me. The man there has run a hundred and one marathons."</p>
<p>I was running with Fred Lebow for some time. I often complain about my stride. His stride is also short, but very quick. He was complaining about the humidity. Finally, he went ahead of me.</p>
