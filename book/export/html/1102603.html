<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Light of the Supreme is descending to earth in infinite measure. Each seeker is receiving this Light according to his capacity or receptivity. Earth embodies the seeker and, at the same time, the seeker represents Mother-Earth. When the seeker receives light, immediately this light enters into the earth-consciousness. Again, when Mother-Earth receives light, she immediately offers it to her children. When the soul of the earth receives light, she shares this light with her seeker-children. And when the children receive light, they share the light with their Mother-Earth.</p>
