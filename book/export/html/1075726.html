<p><em>(The Himalayas. A galaxy of Kuthumis. The ingress and egress of the aspirant souls.)</em></p>
<p>1ST KUTHUMI: The largesse of the mind is almost come to an end. Mind is the fount of problems. A permanent solution is not to be had there.</p>
<p>2ND KUTHUMI: True, mind is unable to solve all problems. Dangers weave their meshes around the human souls. But who or what can make the impossible possible?</p>
<p>3RD KUTHUMI: I know, I know. It is the pinnacled light of the Supermind which is utterly empty of all problems. It is a fount of harmony, of unity-in-multiplicity.</p>
<p>4TH KUTHUMI: The endless urge of the Supermind is to descend upon the earth and change her consciousness.</p>
<p>1ST KUTHUMI: To serve the purpose God's human birth is the supreme need.</p>
<p>2ND KUTHUMI: Many a time He has descended on the earth across the centuries. But earth seems to have made no satisfactory progress. He comes and goes at His chosen times. Each and every time His Mission appears to be thwarted by the wild ignorance of the earth. The wide hunger of Time devours all the spiritual wealth that He brings down. A ruthless oblivion lords it over the mortals.</p>
<p>3RD KUTHUMI: It is victory and not defeat that is the first and last word of God. Soon the Infinite shall alight on the throbbing heart of the soil.</p>
<p>4TH KUTHUMI: When, why, how, where?</p>
<p>3RD KUTHUMI: It is in India, it is in the land of the sages and the spiritual giants that He will see the light of day.</p>
<p>2ND KUTHUMI: And what is expected from us?</p>
<p>1ST KUTHUMI: Ours is to be a flower offering to Him, to His Mission.</p>  </div>
