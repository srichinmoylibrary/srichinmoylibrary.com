<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some souls come down together and move around together while they are on earth. A group of souls came down together around Sri Ramakrishna and became extremely close to each other. Outwardly they may have felt insecurity or jealousy towards one another and had all kinds of differences, but basically they were fond of each other.</p>  </div>
