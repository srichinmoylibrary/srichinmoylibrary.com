<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When someone meditates properly, divinely and unconditionally, he is bound to feel peace of mind and he is bound to feel that he has a very large heart, where he can house the entire world. When someone meditates properly, he feels spontaneous joy. Sometimes he may not know where this joy is coming from, but it actually comes from his own meditation. When a person meditates whole-heartedly, from the depths of his heart, he feels that every moment is an opportunity to do something great, to feel something divine, to grow into something supreme, something transcendental.</p>  </div>
