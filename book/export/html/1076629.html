<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am sure you always think of your ego. If you really want to get rid of your ego, then think of your soul always. Take the positive side. Try to have an inseparable oneness with the vast. When you concentrate on the limited consciousness, you will, without fail, be more bound here in the limited outer life. But with your eyes wide open, try to feel your own identity with the vast sky. Try to enter into the infinite Sky with eyes wide open. It is on the strength of your identification that you will be bound or freed. Vastness will free you, whereas the puny ego will bind you ruthlessly.</p>  </div>
