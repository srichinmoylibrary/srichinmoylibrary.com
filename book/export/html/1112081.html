<p>A few days ago in Connecticut a boy was running, when someone came up to him and smashed his head with a hammer and stole his wristwatch. The boy was admitted to the hospital in a coma. The doctors gave up hope even before the operation.</p>
<p>But after a day or two he came out of his coma, and the first thing he did was to write down "Sri Chinmoy" and then "Love and Serve."</p>
<p>His mother went to Love and Serve restaurant today and told the disciples how grateful she is to me. She felt that I had done something for her son inwardly. Her son had been to Love and Serve a few times, but he had never seen me.</p>
<p>â€” 27 June 1985</p>  </div>
