<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each inner sun has a divine quality. In general, the most important quality or capacity of the inner sun is all-illumining vision and all-fulfilling manifestation. The inner sun is all-illumining. It wants to illumine the entire world. Then it wants to fulfil the entire universe. If it is illumining, then only is it fulfilling. So its quality is all-illumination, all-fulfilment.</p>  </div>
