<p>On my trip to Australia and New Zealand I walked and ran every day, except one. Yesterday I ran in Australia. The date was December 3rd. Then, when we arrived in Los Angeles after so many hours in the plane, it became the 3rd once more. Again I ran. So on the 3rd I ran twice. Tomorrow, no matter what happens, even if it rains or snows, I will definitely run.</p>
