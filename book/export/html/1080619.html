<p>Leonard Bernstein passed away on 14 October 1990. A memorial tribute to him was held at the United Nations in New York on 6 November by <em>Sri Chinmoy: The Peace Meditation at the United Nations</em>.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy opened the programme with a period of silent meditation. A video was then shown of the choir performing Sri Chinmoy's song for Leonard Bernstein at the Maestro's apartment.</p>
<p>Following this, a number of delegates and staff members offered words of appreciation and gratitude for Leonard Bernstein's deeply significant offerings to humanity during the course of his life.</p>
<p>On 14 October 1993 Sri Chinmoy offered a Peace Concert at the Medical Association Hall in Miyazaki, Japan. He dedicated the concert to Leonard Bernstein on the third anniversary of his passing:</p>
<p>"Today's Peace Concert I am most lovingly and most gratefully dedicating to the immortal emperor-musician-conductor Leonard Bernstein, the third anniversary of whose passing takes place today. On two occasions he showered his blessings, compassion and encouragement upon me and my talented singers. His heart of compassion and love, encouragement, warmth and oneness my students and I shall forever cherish in the very depth of our gratitude-heart."</p>  </div>
