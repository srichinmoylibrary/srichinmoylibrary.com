<p>Alas, hostility reigns supreme<br /> In various parts of the world,<br /> Specially in his own country.<br /> When President Gorbachev wisely resigned<br /> From his Presidency post,<br /> It was mistakenly taken as his downfall.<br /> His arch-enemies,<br /> Stupidity-incarnate souls,<br /> Who ruthlessly applauded his downfall,<br /> Will before long be compelled<br /> From deep within<br /> To heartily and mightily applaud<br /> His world-illumining sunrise.<br /> Their mind will show the white flag<br /> To his blue heart.</p>
