<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have got a tremendous task ahead of you. Now you have to hoist your Teacher-Mentor-Father's banner and carry it all over the world. Nakamura was both your greatest friend and your dearest father. So now you have to carry his banner and spread his teachings and love not only in Japan but all over the world.</p>
<p>Please tell Mrs. Nakamura that my students and I are offering her our deepest gratitude. Our hearts' prayers are always there for her husband to bless not only her and the immediate members of his family but also all those who loved him, honoured him and treasured him. So on behalf of my students and myself, I offer our deepest gratitude to Mrs. Nakamura.</p>  </div>
