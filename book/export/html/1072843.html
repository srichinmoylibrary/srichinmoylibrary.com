<p>Alas, alas, alas!<br /> Grievances reign supreme in my life.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against my ignorance-night.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against my darkness-depth.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against my illusion-life.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against my frustration-body.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against my aggression-vital.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against my confusion-mind.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against my hesitation-heart.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against the idleness-promises<br /> Of my soul.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against the fruitlessness-dreams<br /> Of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, alas!<br /> O my Beloved Supreme,<br /> Do tell me how I can free myself<br /> From the tyranny of grievances.<br /> "My child,<br /> You can free yourself<br /> From the tyranny of grievances<br /> If you can once and for all feel<br /> That we all love you —<br /> Your body, vital, mind, heart, soul<br /> And I love you.<br /> It is your feeling of conscious oneness<br /> With us<br /> That can easily free you<br /> From your teeming grievances against us.<br /> Try, My child, try;<br /> You will succeed.<br /> Yours will be the abiding peace,<br /> Illumining light,<br /> Nourishing delight<br />     And<br /> Fulfilling satisfaction."</p>
