<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A demon is an undivine force within us. It is an undivine entity, or an undivine being in us that tries to devour our divine possibility and potentiality. Each time we consciously or unconsciously surrender to ignorance, we strengthen the power of the demon inside. And each time we surrender to Light, to our Inner Pilot, to the Will of God, then the demon is bound to starve. It gets frightened. When you aspire, the demon starves. But when you remain in the world of desire, then the demon is fed by your own conscious or unconscious choice.</p>  </div>
