<p>Everything has its own time. I have just told you about the significance of AUM, and the other day I told you about God. You have to know in which word you have more faith. When one person says God, all his love, faith and devotion come to the fore. In someone else, this may not be so. In your case, I told you to repeat the name of God, for you go to church and pray in the Christian way. In your culture, you are familiar with the term God.</p>
<p>In India, we repeat AUM or the name of a god or goddess, such as Shiva, Krishna or Kali. The most important thing is to know in whom or in which aspect of the Supreme you have absolute faith. When I told you about God, I had the feeling that all your life you had been trained to pray to God. But today AUM enters into you with its significance. One day I shall meditate with you and see whether God, AUM, Supreme, Infinite or some other aspect of the Absolute inspires you most. It is the inspiration that you get which is of the utmost importance.</p>  </div>
