<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ultimately, everything is the Grace of the Supreme. Some people have receptivity for this Grace while others do not. The sun is available to everyone. But if you leave all your doors and windows open, then naturally more light will enter into your room than into a room where all the doors and windows are closed.</p>
<p>The ultimate Reality is Grace. Some people are receptive to light, so naturally light can function in and through them much more powerfully. Each talent is only an opening of either the heart or the mind or some other part of our existence to the Highest.</p>
