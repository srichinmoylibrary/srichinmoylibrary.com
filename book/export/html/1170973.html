<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul has many activities which it carries out on a daily basis. Every day the soul sees the possibilities of the body, vital, mind and heart. The soul tries to inspire each member of its family and, while inspiring them, it fulfils the Will of the Supreme. But alas, very often the body, vital and mind vehemently resist the soul’s operation.</p>  </div>
