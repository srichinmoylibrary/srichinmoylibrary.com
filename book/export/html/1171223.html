<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Think of your heart as an aeroplane and do not think of yourself as a car. An aeroplane goes much faster, but it is not rushing, whereas a car goes much slower and it is always rushing. So always think of the heart that is flying infinitely faster than the mind. When the mind runs, it is rushing. When the heart flies, it is just singing.</p>  </div>
