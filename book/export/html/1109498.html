<blockquote>
<p>"We must ask of God only such gifts as are worthy of God, that is to say, such things as we cannot obtain from any except God."</p>
<p>â€” Porphyry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No sincere seeker of the highest Truth, the ultimate Truth, will be denied the higher worlds.</p>
<p>In order to enter into the higher worlds, what we need is sincerity, what we need is purity, what we need is peace, what we need is delight.</p>
<p>Sincerity: Inner beauty's other name is sincerity.</p>
<p>Purity: The name of God's first child is purity.</p>
<p>Peace: Peace is unity's sovereignty and multiplicity's divinity.</p>
<p>Delight: Delight is the name of God's permanent Home.</p>  </div>
