<p>As one man was passing me, he asked, "How old are you, Sri?"</p>
<p>When I said, "Fifty," he said, "Oh, you are great!" Then he went ahead of me.</p>
<p>At the awards ceremony I gave him the second prize in the over-fifty category. He was so happy to have defeated me! Perhaps I was third in that category.</p>
