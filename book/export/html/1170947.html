    <title>Question: I don’t think that money is really the problem. It’s just that sometimes I feel miserable when there are other projects that I cannot participate in. Because I’m concentrating on climbing, I don’t do some other things.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> True, there are many other activities. But climbing is something that others cannot do. How many people can even imagine climbing up the Himalayas? Will my “best disciple” dare, even if I give him the money?</p>
<p><em>“Best disciple”:</em> Guru, I don’t like the cold.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He does not like the cold, and somebody else will not like something else!</p>
<p><em>“Best disciple”:</em> I’m also scared of heights.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to see how many people are able to do this. Each thing has such significance in life, individually and collectively: swimming, climbing, running. Look at what a wonderful job our Peace Run has done! Thousands and millions of people know about us because of the Peace Run. In the Peace Run you can invite thousands of people to participate, and everyone will be all oneness-enthusiasm. That is one way, the collective way, and it is a tremendous manifestation. But for other types of manifestation, individually some people have to come forward. When it is a matter of climbing, even if some people have oneness, will they dare to make the attempt? Everything that we achieve is recorded in our minds and hearts.</p>
<p>If people are afraid, if they feel they will die, I will be the last person to ask them to take up climbing. I am praying to God that you people who do take up the challenge do not meet with any accident. To climb the Himalayas is extremely difficult; again, it is a great adventure. In an adventure, if you do not meet with immediate success, you have to feel that eventually you <em>will</em> succeed. In the beginning, the idea of swimming the English Channel seemed impossible. Now a number of our girl disciples are doing it, and one older man is defying age and conquering the Channel. So if somebody else fails, you should not give up. Either you will do it, or there will be somebody else to come who will succeed.</p>  </div>
