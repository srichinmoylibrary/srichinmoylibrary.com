<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is absolutely true. If you get these messages from above, they are bound to take place. But if we meditate, if we concentrate, we can consciously enter into the dream worlds. Right now, to us the dream world is something vague, uncertain and to some extent obscure. But if we study it, we will know many things about it. It is a matter of studying. If you study the inner life, naturally you will be inundated with the inner knowledge. Self-knowledge is self-cultivation, inner discovery. When you study you discover many things. Similarly, if you study inwardly, then you will discover the inner life. There everything is recorded; only we have to unfold it.</p>  </div>
