<p>Martin Luther King, beloved king of the heart-world, unhorizoned vision of the mind-world, hero-warrior of the vital-world, life-sacrificer of the body-world, to you my aspiration-dedication-life bows.</p>
<p>The Saviour-Son gave humanity the lesson of compassion and forgiveness. India's Mahatma Gandhi, with his message of non-violence, proved to be an excellent student. In America the Absolute Supreme chose you to be His unparalleled student, to love divinely the soul of His creation and to serve unreservedly the body of His creation.</p>
<p>We, the members of the United Nations Meditation Group, bow to you lovingly, devotedly and soulfully.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>29 November 1977</p>  </div>
