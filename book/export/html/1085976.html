<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To the musician, sound is his own child. It is like a flower to the garden: a garden without a flower is useless. Similarly, the musician is useless without his beautiful inner child. The musician and sound are like the Creator and the creation. They are inseparable and indispensable to each other.</p>  </div>
