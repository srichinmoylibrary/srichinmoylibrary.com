<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we go deep within, we see that it is the limited ‘I’, the ego, that suffers. The unlimited T does not suffer. He who wants to bind reality suffers. But he who wants to free and liberate the reality within himself will not suffer.</p>
<p>Again, we have to know that what we call suffering is not at all suffering in God’s Eye. It is an experience that He is having in and through us. If we live in God's Consciousness, then no matter what happens in our life, we will feel that it is only an experience that our Beloved Supreme is having in and through us.</p>  </div>
