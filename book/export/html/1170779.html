<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are driving the car, then I do not want you to take your hands off the wheel. You have to think of traffic and all kinds of things. And if you fold your hands while walking down the street, people will take you to the mental asylum. If you try to fold your hands while you are combing your hair, your hair will look peculiar! So, at these times, why do you have to sing out loud? You can sing in silence or you can chant "Supreme". But when you are in a proper place — at home in front of your shrine or in the meditation hall — then definitely you should fold your hands while singing <em>The Invocation.</em> You have to use your practical wisdom.</p>  </div>
