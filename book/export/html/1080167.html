<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The heart centre need not be an individual; it need not he the Security Council or the Secretary-General or the Economic and Social Council. These are all realities, but these realities need not remain as separate entities. They can be combined together or at least the essence and qualities of each of these realities can be unified. Then, when they are unified, there will be a feeling of oneness, and this feeling of oneness is nothing short of the heart centre.</p>  </div>
