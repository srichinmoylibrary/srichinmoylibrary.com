<p><em>Sister Patricia:</em> Do you do any work with Christians?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We say each religion is a house. You are a Christian, I am a Hindu, someone else is a Moslem. You stay in your house; I have my house. But if you say your religion is by far the best religion, people will disagree. The only thing we can say is that our own religion is perfect for us and that all religions lead us to the same Ultimate Truth. In spirit they are all one; all are branches of one Reality-Tree. I am on one branch, you are on one branch. The tree needs all its branches, or else it is not a tree. Again, the branches need the trunk and the roots; otherwise, they cannot exist.</p>
<p><em>Bishop Kennedy:</em> It was very kind of you. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Thank you, thank you.</p>  </div>
