<p>I also went to see another old man who was there. He said to me, "Ah, who are you?"</p>
<p>I said, "Chinmoy-da. Do you remember me? I came to the Ashram in 1944, and it was you who taught me how to ride a bicycle."</p>
<p>Then he said to me, "I taught you how to ride a bicycle. Now you are teaching the whole world how to run!"</p>
<p>So that incident he did remember, but when I first stood before him, he could not recognise me!</p>  </div>
