<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the ultimate analysis, there is no difference between training and education. Training is preparatory to a fulfilling achievement; education is also preparatory to a fulfilling achievement.</p>
<p>When we train ourselves, we see more light within us and without. When we educate ourselves, we see light within and without. Therefore, both training and education ultimately serve the same purpose.</p>  </div>
