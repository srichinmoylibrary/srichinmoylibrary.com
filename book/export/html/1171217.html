<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Restlessness goes away only when we feel the blessedness of God’s Feet inside our heart. Always try to imagine God’s Feet of Compassion, Feet of Protection, inside your heart. Then in anything that you want to do — whether it is singing or reading or meditating — you will be successful.</p>  </div>
