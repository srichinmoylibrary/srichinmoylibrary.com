<p>O Sun of India's sky,<br /> O World-Poet,<br /> O Moon of Bengal's heart,<br /> You were beautiful in your inner life,<br /> You were beautiful in your outer life,<br /> You were beauty incarnate in God's entire creation.<br /> Gloriously and triumphantly you secure your place<br /> In the world-assembly with your creative force,<br /> Supremely meaningful and fruitful in various walks of life.</p>

<p>Rabindranath was a Golden Song sung by the Divine Singer in him. He was, indeed, the World-Song, the golden chain that bound East and West. By his soul-awakening songs of transcendental beauty, Rabindranath charmed the world and seized the All-Blissful.</p>  </div>
