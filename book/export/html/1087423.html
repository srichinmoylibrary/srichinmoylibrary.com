<p>The destination likes you because it sees some good qualities in you, whereas it doesn't see those good qualities in me. If I am a bad person, let us say, and you are a good person, the destination may not want to be touched by me. But the destination may like you and want you to reach it. If I am spiritually awake, I will realise the reason the destination allows you to touch it but does not allow me. The next time I have to start the same journey, I will see that it is not my capacity that the destination wants from me but my good qualities. Then I will try to develop the same good qualities that you have. Outwardly I may not know what they are, but I can pray to God to give me the good qualities that allowed you to win.</p>  </div>
