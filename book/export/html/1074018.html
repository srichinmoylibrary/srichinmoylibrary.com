<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, not necessarily. Because the child does not have a developed mind, the loving consciousness of natureâ€™s spontaneous beauty can be seen in him. We love the child because of his loving and loveable consciousness, but that does not mean this consciousness is very high.</p>  </div>
