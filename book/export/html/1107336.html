<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have discovered it in my meditation and realisation. I see the world around me with love. Human love is all bondage. Before it binds someone, it is already bound. Divine love liberates and fulfil. First it liberates us, then it fulfils us. The love that I speak of is the divine love, the love we see and feel only in God. We bring it from God and offer it to those who are crying for that love.</p>  </div>
