<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is the other way around. If you have aspiration, the ego disappears automatically. But if you think that you will be able to kill your ego without having aspiration, then you are mistaken. In order to cure yourself, first you need the right medicine, and the right medicine is aspiration. Aspiration is the only medicine to cure you of the ego problem, the ego disease. So when you have aspiration, then only can you cure yourself of the ego disease. Otherwise, if you want to wait until your ego is dissolved to get aspiration, then you will have to wait through Eternity.</p>  </div>
