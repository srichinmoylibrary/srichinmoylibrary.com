SCA 1177-1182. These questions were asked on 9 August 1989 at Aspiration-Ground, New York.</p>
<h2>Question: You once said that there is a new consciousness growing in Austria. What is it?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Long live the Austrian consciousness! In the Austrian consciousness I am seeing both dynamism and eagerness. Some people are dynamic, but they have no eagerness. Still others are eager, but they have no dynamism. But the Austrian consciousness has both. I am very, very pleased with Austria.</p>  </div>
