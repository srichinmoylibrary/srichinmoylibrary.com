<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Twins need not and cannot learn the same way, precisely because they have different souls. Each soul has a special way of receiving Light from above and manifesting this Light on earth. Twins may enter into the earth-arena together, but the promises they made to the Absolute Supreme while they were in the soul's world may not be the same. Therefore, their ways of learning here on earth and their ways of sharing their knowledge may widely differ.</p>  </div>
