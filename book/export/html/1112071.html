<p>The other day I was running on Union Turnpike at my three-and-a-half-mile point when I saw Dhananjaya on his bicycle. How fast he was riding! He was so happy to see me that he called out to me, "Hello, Guru!" But before I could open my mouth, he was gone. With bullet speed he was riding although there were so many cars!</p>
