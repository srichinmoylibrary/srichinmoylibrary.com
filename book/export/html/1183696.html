<p>Some mornings when I am taking exercise, Mother Kali and the soul of my physical mother are there. These visions are more real to me than my own name, Chinmoy. Chinmoy is just a fleeting name, an earthly name. But my God-realisation-experiences, visions and illuminations, which come from my Beloved Supremeâ€™s infinite Compassion, are infallible and immortal.</p>
<p>When I see my mother and talk to her in the inner world, it is far more real to me than when I talk to my disciples. On the outer plane there is always a barrier, but in the inner world there is no barrier. The souls have a free access to each other.</p>  </div>
