<p>When I arrived at the Athens airport, I showed them my Greek visa, which was on page four of my passport. But they had to examine all the other pages as well. Then they asked me why I went to so many places.</p>
<p>Next they said, "How much money do you have? You have to show us."</p>
<p>My bag with most of my money was with Projjwal, so I simply emptied both of my pockets. Inside was all German currency.</p>
<p>They said, "Why do you have German money?"</p>
<p>I said, "Look at my ticket. I am coming from Munich."</p>
<p>They said, "No, you have to have American dollars!"</p>
<p>Then they called up another officer. Such a waste of time! For about half an hour they were harassing me.</p>
