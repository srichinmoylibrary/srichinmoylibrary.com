<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am not competing with anyone. But please forgive me for saying this. The inspiration and creativity in weightlifting, let us say, includes very few lifts — the jerk, clean and press and a few others. But the weightlifting world is a vast world. Today we are living in the world of science; we are producing so many different things — quantity as well as quality. How is it that they are not recognizing more lifts, different kinds of lifts, in the Olympics and elsewhere? Some people challenge me and say my one-arm lift is not a recognized lift because I lift it from a rack. But what is wrong with that? Are imagination and variety not appreciated in this world?</p>  </div>
