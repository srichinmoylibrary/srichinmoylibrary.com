<p>At long last I have come to realise<br /> That a resolute step is needed<br /> To please my Lord Beloved Supreme<br /> Always<br /> In His own Way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209070" class="section-2">

<p>The most appropriate use<br /> Of my human will<br /> Is to give it to God<br /> Immediately.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">23203</h1>
  
 

<p>O truth-seeker and God-lover,<br /> Never be afraid<br /> To open your earth-bound mind â€”<br /> Never!<br /> Nothing precious will ever fall out,<br /> But Divinity's Light<br /> Will enter into your life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209072" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23204</h1>
  
 

<p>My life's humility<br /> Is the only thing<br /> That inspires God<br /> To have faith in mankind.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209073" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23205</h1>
  
 

<p>O my stupid heart,<br /> I assure you once and for all<br /> That you will easily be able to survive<br /> The loss of your present dear friend,<br /> Insecurity,<br /> And his replacement by<br /> An ever-inspiring and illumining security.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209074" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23206</h1>
  
 

<p>O my Lord Supreme,<br /> Do take away my doubtful mind,<br /> For at every moment<br /> It is disappointing my hopeful soul.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209075" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23207</h1>
  
 

<p>Without meditation<br /> We see the body of things around us.<br /> With meditation<br /> We enter into the heart of everything<br /> That is within us and around us.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209076" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23208</h1>
  
 

<p>There is only one ultimate threat<br /> To your spiritual life,<br /> And that is your complete loss<br /> Of faith in yourself.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209077" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23209</h1>
  
 

<p>God does not want me to have<br /> A heart sullied by sadness,<br /> But a heart beautified by gladness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209078" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23210</h1>
  
 

<p>To accept the mind<br /> As the captain of your life,<br /> Is to plunge headlong<br /> Into darkest darkness-abyss.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209079" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23211</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord, I do not want to live<br /> In a world of ingratitude.<br /> I want to live in a world<br /> Of gratitude-forgiveness-delight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209080" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23212</h1>
  
 

<p>If you are indeed a God-warrior,<br /> Then you must have an unshakable faith,<br /> And that faith will be cherished<br /> By God Himself.</p>

<div id="node-1209082" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23214</h1>
  
 

<p>Today I have become<br /> A newborn aspiration-heart-rose<br /> To please the divine in me<br /> And fulfil my Lord Beloved Supreme in me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209083" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23215</h1>
  
 

<p>What I need is only<br /> God's Perfection-Glance<br /> To increase the beauty<br /> Of my aspiration<br /> And the fragrance<br /> Of my dedication.</p>

<p>A faithful slave of God<br /> Needs only one thing:<br /> Sleepless and breathless<br /> God-remembrance.</p>

<div id="node-1209087" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23219</h1>
  
 

<p>I do not need a caravan of dreams<br /> But just one single vision<br /> Of my Lord Supreme<br /> To manifest Him here on earth<br /> Lovingly and self-givingly.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209088" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23220</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1209090" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23222</h1>

<div id="node-1209091" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23223</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> I know You have many ways<br /> To protect my life and save my heart,<br /> But I would like<br /> Your Compassion-Eye-Smile<br /> To protect my life, save my heart<br /> And fulfil my dream<br /> Of Your total manifestation here on earth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209092" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23224</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> I know I am not right now<br /> On Your Satisfaction-List,<br /> But do keep me at least<br /> On Your Compassion-List<br /> Unconditionally.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209093" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23225</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1209094" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23226</h1>
  
 

<p>I shall always remain undaunted<br /> By my aspiration-failure,<br /> For God Himself has told me<br /> That I shall and I must succeed eventually<br /> In pleasing Him in His own Way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209095" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23227</h1>
  
 

<p>The world asks me what I do<br /> Day and night.<br /> I tell the world smilingly, lovingly<br /> And proudly:<br /> "I fly and fly and fly<br /> On the wings of my Master-Bird."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209096" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23228</h1>

<div id="node-1209097" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23229</h1>
  
 

<p>I have not come into the world<br /> To tax God's Patience.<br /> I have come into the world<br /> To pray to God to bless me<br /> With His Infinity's Patience-Light<br /> So that I can serve Him constantly<br /> In His own creation<br /> In His own Way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209098" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23230</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> I am not complaining to You<br /> About my mind,<br /> But I am praying to You to bless me<br /> With a new mind<br /> That will always remain a perfect stranger<br /> To self-doubt and insecurity.</p>

  </div>
<div id="node-1209100" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23232</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1209101" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23233</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1209103" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23235</h1>
  
 

<p>God never wants to be familiar<br /> With my mind's impurity,<br /> My heart's insecurity<br /> And my life's unwillingness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209104" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23236</h1>

<div id="node-1209105" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23237</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1209107" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23239</h1>
  
 

<p>It is high time for me<br /> To close my mind-door,<br /> And at the same time<br /> To unreservedly and unconditionally open<br /> My heart-door<br /> For God the Light to enter<br /> And start singing, running and playing.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1209108" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23240</h1>
  
 

<p>I may not know whether<br /> God's Compassion-Eye<br /> Permeates my entire life,<br /> But I do know that<br /> God's Forgiveness-Heart<br /> Permeates my entire life<br /> To help me rise high, higher, highest<br /> For His own Satisfaction-Delight.</p>

<div id="node-1209109" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23241</h1>
  
 

<p>God does not want me<br /> To waste even a fleeting second<br /> Trying to know the future<br /> Of the whole human race.<br /> He wants me to spend my time,<br /> Day and night,<br /> Only inspiring the human race<br /> With my own aspiration-heart.</p>

<div id="node-1209110" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23242</h1>
