<p>These stories are not my stories. They have been told and retold by countless people, and God alone knows who the first authors were. Each person tells these stories with his own colouring, in a slightly different way. Most of the stories involve the great Mogul Emperor Akbar and his minister and court jester, Birbal; or King Krishna Chandra and his minister and court jester, Gopal Bhanr.</p>
<p>I do hope that my Spiritual Comments will inspire sincere seekers of the eternal Truth to lead a better, higher and more inspiring life.</p>  </div>
