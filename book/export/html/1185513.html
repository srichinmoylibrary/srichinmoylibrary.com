<p>“Father, Father, I want to learn German.”</p>
<p>“Son, I don’t approve of it.”</p>
<p>“Why, Father?”</p>
<p>“Son, when I was your age, I tried to learn German. I studied for six months and then I gave up.”</p>
<p>“Why, Father?”</p>
<p>“I gave up because I didn’t want to lose my teeth! If you try to learn German, you will lose all your teeth. Then I will not be able to pay the exorbitant bills that the dentist will send us to give you a set of false teeth. So, son, don’t learn German. My advice is that, among the non-Germans, only the wealthy should learn German.”</p>  </div>
