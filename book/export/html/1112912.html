<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In some cases, it is almost impossible to make spiritual progress at the end of life. Usually people are brought up in such a way that they can't give up their old life, their old-fashioned, religion-bound ideas. But some people break these barriers. A very special Grace descends and they break their old foundations and old ties. But it is very rare.</p>  </div>
