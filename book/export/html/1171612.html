<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Oriental philosophy is based on the inner reality, whereas the Western philosophy is based on the outer structure. The Oriental philosophy is like the seed and the Western philosophy is like the tree. The tree cannot be fruitful unless the seed is productive. Again, the soil has to be very fertile. So the seed has to be good and also the outer soil has to be very fertile. Eastern philosophy and Western philosophy must go together. The Eastern philosophy is inner poise and the Western philosophy is outer power. Inner poise and outer power must go together in order to be fulfilled.</p>  </div>
