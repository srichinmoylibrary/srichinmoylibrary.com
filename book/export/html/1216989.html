<p>At the start of the television interview, they showed a video of the 100-metre dash in the Olympics, when Ben Johnson defeated Carl Lewis. But Carl Lewis was eventually declared the winner because Ben Johnson was disqualified. The announcer said Carl Lewis wins races because he prays and meditates. He said he was now going to introduce the man behind Carl Lewis' prayer and meditation. It was a very significant introduction.</p>
<p>Then they opened the side door where I had been waiting and I came out. On the television screen there was the title, "Carl Lewis' mental trainer," but I didn't see it. The disciples told me about it afterwards.</p>
