<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just before you start meditating, say four things: "Fear, get out of my life! Doubt, get out of my life! Jealousy, get out of my life! Insecurity, get out of my life! I don't need you and I will never need you."</p>
<p>Then they will all come out of you and ask, "Whom do you want?"</p>
<p>"I want only meditation; I want only God," you will say.</p>
<p>"Now where is the proof?"</p>
<p>"The proof is that I can live without you, but you can't live without me. Jealousy, you can't live without me; that's why you come and take shelter inside my vital. Doubt, you can't live without me; that's why you come and take shelter in my mind. Insecurity, you can't live without me; that's why you come and take shelter in my heart. Fear, you can't live without me; that's why you come and take shelter in my body."</p>
<p>When you challenge these four in a divine way, they say it is beneath their dignity to remain inside you.</p>
<p>"If you can live without us, how is it that we can't live without you?" they ask, and then they go away. At that time you will have your perfect meditation.</p>  </div>
