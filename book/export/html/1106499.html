<p>I was about to reach my cycle. I was in the middle of the doorway when Subarata’s soul begged me to allow her to give a special message to the disciples. So the prayer that I gave today is not actually my prayer. It is her warning to the disciples. The prayer is:</p>

<p>My Absolute Lord Supreme!<br /> It is a very rare privilege<br />     To feel and say<br /> That my Master is always right<br />     Not only for me,<br /> But also for the entire humanity.</p>

<p>From the soul’s world, she is saying, “For God’s sake, do not think that your Master is wrong. Do not criticise him.”</p>
<p>At least one person has to believe in me! Subarata’s love for me was absolutely sincere and genuine.</p>
