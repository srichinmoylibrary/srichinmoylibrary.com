<p>While I was in a bookstore in Florida, I saw an exercise book by "God," telling how you can live for 100 years. It was written by George Burns, who played God in several movies.</p>
<p>In the bookstore I read and read quite a few pages. Unfortunately, I was not able to agree with God's recommendations, so I could not buy the book. Otherwise, I really wanted to buy the book by God telling how to live for 100 years.</p>
