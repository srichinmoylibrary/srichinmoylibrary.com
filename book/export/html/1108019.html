<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The only disease you have is that you feel that I don't care for you. When that disease is cured, then you will be cured. When that disease is cured, there can be no sickness to bother you. A few other disciples also have this chronic disease. It is a powerful disease, the feeling that your Guru doesn't love you, he doesn't care for you.</p>
<p>I do care for you, but in my own way, in a divine way. My divine way nobody understands. Tension and pressure come from one thought: that your Guru does not care for you. If I did not care for you, then I would not have come to America. I <em>do</em> care; that is why I have come to the world, to the West and to America. Most of you suffer from only one disease, and that disease comes from one cause: the feeling that I don't care for you. Again I wish to say that I <em>do</em> care, but in my own way. Once you understand this, then these pressures will go away and everything will be relaxed. Once you feel that I do care, you will get tremendous joy.</p>  </div>
