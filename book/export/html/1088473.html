<p><em>Matsyendranath's ashram. Enter Matsyendranath and Gorakshanath.</em></p>
<p><em>Matsyendranath:</em> My son, you have now equalled me in spirituality. You have inner peace, light and bliss in boundless measure. I want you to leave my ashram and open one of your own.</p>
<p><em>Gorakshanath (bursting into tears):</em> Master, Master, this can never be! I can never leave you and I shall never leave you. You are my life.</p>
<p><em>Matsyendranath:</em> Son, two lions cannot stay in the same den. We should not stay together now. You should roam somewhere else. You have the capacity to guide world-souls as I am guiding them. Now you must use it. You are not getting the opportunity to flourish here. Now go, my son. This is my soulful demand and command. If you really love me, then you will obey my command.</p>
<p><em>Gorakshanath:</em> Master, I shall obey you although my heart is crying and bleeding within me. Please bless me once more before I depart.</p>
