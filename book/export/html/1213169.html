<p><em>Madal:</em></p>
<p>Chinmoy, no doubt, you are a musician. Unfortunately I cannot call you a good musician, for you have never sung a song or played a piece of music without making some serious error. Anyway, I want to ask you if <em>dissonance</em> bothers you?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>Madal, the pure and clear sincerity within me shakes hands with your proud assessment of the musician in me. I like and don't like <em>discord and unharmonious</em> effects in music. I like it because the child in me still likes restlessness and excitement. I donâ€™t like it because the old, traditional, austere Indian Yogi in me finds it difficult to appreciate anything that creates restlessness and excitement.</p>  </div>
