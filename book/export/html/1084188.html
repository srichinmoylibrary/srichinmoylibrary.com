<p>You have seen<br /> What was never kept concealed.<br /> You have found<br /> What was never kept hidden.<br /> You have found your God,<br /> Who has always been<br /> In the heart of your love-light.<br /> No matter how sincere you are,<br /> No matter how hard you work<br /> To disqualify yourself for God-realisation,<br /> You shall sadly fail.<br /> For God's Transcendental Dream is of you,<br /> And God's Universal Reality is for you.</p>
