<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People who are practising Yoga don't give much importance to astrology, because they have seen that when they pray and meditate, their fate is changed and guided by a higher force. Astrology is a science; we cannot deny it. But at the same time, there is a superior science and that is Yoga. If you have access to the superior science, you will be able to control the inferior science. If you have an atom bomb and if somebody else has a hand bomb, the hand bomb can play its role; but if the atom bomb starts functioning, naturally it will be superior.</p>  </div>
