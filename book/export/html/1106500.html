<p>When I went to use my pulley machine, Subarata’s soul said to me, “You are so strong. You are the strongest man in the world!” I was pulling a certain weight.</p>
<p>I said to her, “You can try it if you like.”</p>
<p>She said, “How can I? I am not in the body.”</p>
<p>I said, “Definitely you can do it. Just try.”</p>
<p>So she tried it and she was able to do it easily. The soul is part of the omnipotent God, so the soul can easily accomplish things that we find so difficult on the physical plane.</p>
<p>This is the funniest story.</p>
