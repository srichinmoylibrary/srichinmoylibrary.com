<p>In four days how many sad experiences you can get! I have forgotten to tell you about the Florida lady. She had bothered me so much on my previous trip. I was very happy that she did not come to see me when I arrived.</p>
<p>One day I went to my dearest boss Amrita's centenary exhibit. The 19th of September was his birthday, so they had an exhibition. It was smaller than the smallest. I was extremely happy that they observed his centenary, but I was so unhappy and sad that it was such a small exhibit. The exhibit was prepared by his youngest niece, Kumuda. If she had not insisted, there would have been nothing.</p>
<p>The exhibit was at the Ashram school. As I came out of the building, the Florida lady screamed: "Ah, Chinmoy, when did you come?"</p>
<p>She greeted me at the Ashram school gate. I said, "Enough, enough, enough!" Then I told the rickshaw-wallah, "Go away from here as fast as possible."</p>
<p>We drove to the nursing home, and I came home after two hours at least. The Florida lady was waiting in front of my house. I begged her, "I have come here only to see my sister, my dearest sister. Do not bother me."</p>
<p>This time I hoped she would listen to my prayer.</p>  </div>
