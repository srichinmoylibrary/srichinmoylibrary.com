<p>One day Sher Singh begged me to go with him to Mr. Mehrotra’s office. So I went with him. When we got to the room, he said, “Please stand at the door.” Then he entered into the room and sat on Mr. Mehrotra’s chair. He was so relaxed. He placed one of his legs on the desk and then he started giving orders to me. He became the Consul. At the same time, he was saying, “Please guard the door carefully. Otherwise, if Mr. Mehrotra comes…!”</p>
<p>When he begged me to go with him, I did not know that he was going to do that kind of thing. I thought it was for some purpose. O God! And he was just a guard at the Consulate!</p>
<p>I told the story to Mr. Mehrotra in 1989 when I went to eat at his residence in Sri Lanka. Mr. Mehrotra was then the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka. I said, “This is what Sher Singh and I did.” Mr. Mehrotra was deeply amused.</p>  </div>
