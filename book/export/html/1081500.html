<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. In your case it was true. He came to fill you with his love and light. He didn't vanish because of your ego. He left because his mission was completed. If he had stayed longer, your mind would have started saying, "Those are not his eyes, those are not his ears. That is not the colour of his hair."</p>
<p>This experience took place because you focused your devotion on the picture of the Christ that you have in your room. And perhaps the artist who painted it never even saw the Christ! This I have said as a joke, but it is very serious.</p>  </div>
