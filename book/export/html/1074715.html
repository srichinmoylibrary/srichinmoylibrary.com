<p>Are you a favourite daughter of God?<br />   If you think that your Father does everything for you,<br /> Then you are mistaken.</p>
<p>If you feel that your Father will do everything for you,<br />   Then you are mistaken.<br /> If you feel that He has already done everything for you,<br />   Then you are right, absolutely right.</p>
<p>Indeed, He had done everything for you<br />   Long before your soul came into the field of manifestation.<br />   You just become in the life of your heart<br /> What you eternally are in His Soul:<br />   His, only His.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">198. He is for God only</h1>
  
 

<p>There was a time<br /> When he was for God on earth only.</p>
<p>There was a time<br /> When he was for God in Heaven only.</p>
<p>There was a time<br /> When he was for God in his heart only.</p>
<p>But now he is for God only,<br />         For God only.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">199. Hell</h1>
  
 

<p>Hell is a thing like doubt.<br /> Hell is a thing like jealousy.</p>
<p>Hell is an animal like a panther.<br /> Hell is an animal like a tiger.</p>
<p>Hell is a man like the poorest beggar.<br /> Hell is a man like the fiercest brute.</p>
<p>Hell is a road paved with good intentions.<br /> Hell is a road that compels us to think of perfection.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">200. He barks but he bites not</h1>
  
 

<p>He barks and barks;<br /> That is what he knows.</p>
<p>He bites not, he bites not.<br /> How can he bite?<br /> Since he knows not,<br /> Since he knows not.</p>
<p>He barks and barks;<br /> That is his self-styled role.</p>
<p>He bites not and bites not,<br /> That is his God-ordained Goal.</p>
