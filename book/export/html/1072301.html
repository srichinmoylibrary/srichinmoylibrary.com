<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They are nothing. My biceps are not even 14 inches. That is why I am saying that my weightlifting achievements are all due to concentration and meditation. You may think that concentration, prayer and meditation are only for the inner life. But I wish to say no! We can use our inner strength for the outer life as well. From meditation and concentration we can get inner power, and this power can be used in the physical world as well. One way to lift up things is to develop large, strong muscles. But in my case, I have been training for only 15 months. So I entirely depend on the inner strength.</p>  </div>
