<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want aspiration to be paramount in your next incarnation, you can be sure to regain it at an early age only by concentrating and meditating on your next incarnation. But my advice to all of you is this: the present is more than enough to give you what you desperately need. Don’t brood on the past, which is dust. Again, don’t build castles in the air about the future. Aspiration tries and cries to achieve everything here and now. Don’t think of leaving anything for the next incarnation.</p>  </div>
