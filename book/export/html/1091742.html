<p>Once a merchant was passing through the mountains with his caravan to bring goods to another town. On the way, there was a terrible storm and lightning struck the caravan. The merchant and many other people were killed, and there was nobody to take responsibility for his wares.</p>
<p>When Babar heard of the tragedy, he asked his soldiers to collect all the goods and keep them in a safe place. Then he sent a message to the merchant's relatives to come to him immediately. When they arrived, Babar gave everything to them. The members of the merchant's family were overwhelmed by Babar's concern and kindness. They wanted to give the Emperor an expensive gift, but he would not accept it. They begged him at least to take some reimbursement for his trouble, but again Babar refused.</p>
<p>He said, "No, I cannot do that. You have lost your dearest one. Now I cannot take advantage of his death. His wealth and property belong to you; it is you who deserve it."</p>
<p>So Babar gave everything to the merchant's relatives without accepting any reward. The merchant's family was deeply moved.</p>  </div>
