<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us take God as the supreme Singer. In the morning He sings, in the afternoon He judges his musical talents and in the evening he makes His Song absolutely perfect. God is the Singer, God is the Judge and God is the Perfection-Lover. When God the Perfection-Lover has played His role, He likes everything that He does. God being everything and everybody, ultimately He is bound to like everything that everybody does.</p>  </div>
