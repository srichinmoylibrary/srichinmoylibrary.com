<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I need a picture because before I accept a disciple I have to contact his soul. I have to know the soul, and it is easier for me to contact the soul through a picture if I am not able to see that person on the physical plane. When I see the person’s picture, I can see his soul, his consciousness, and then I will know whether I should deal with his soul or not. I will see whether it is God’s Will that I should deal with that particular aspirant.</p>
<p>If you want to be accepted at college, you need an application and a resume stating your previous qualifications. I also have to see whether someone has any inner qualifications, inner sincerity — whether he has aspiration, or whether he is just curious. Curiosity-seekers are not accepted by me.</p>  </div>
