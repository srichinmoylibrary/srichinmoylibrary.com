<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A seeker can give himself to God by being constantly aware of his inner reality. If the seeker thinks of God and remembers that he has come from that Source, then he will be able to give himself back to that Source. Since we are conscious of the fact that he has given us what He has, let us give Him something in return: gratitude. When we feel that we have received something, it is the tendency of our human nature, unless we are absolutely ungrateful, to try to establish a reciprocal feeling. You give something to me and I give something to you. Let us begin to count our blessings. When we are consciously aware of the myriad blessings that He has given us, then it will be quite easy for us to give Him whatever we have and are.</p>  </div>
