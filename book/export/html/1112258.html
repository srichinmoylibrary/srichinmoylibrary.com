<p>This morning I took my tennis court guards to guard me while I was running. I was walking and running. The Mother Earth felt how happy I was! I saw one elderly gentleman running. He was wearing a headband. My guards were watching me with such compassion and he was observing everything. He came up to me and said, “It is so nice of you to take care of so many young men!”</p>
