<p><em>Madal:</em></p>
<p>Chinmoy, very often a seeker's mind is <em>regressive</em>, in spite of his heart being progressive. Is the seeker responsible for that?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>Madal, to some extent he is. His mind is <em>going backwards</em> because consciously or unconsciously he is cherishing doubt and jealousy. His heart is going forwards because consciously he is aspiring to increase divine love and divine dedication in his nature.</p>  </div>
