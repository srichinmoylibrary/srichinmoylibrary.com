<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is God's protection that is rotating in your head. It is causing the mind to come out of confusion and wrong forces. So God's protection is rotating around your head. It is protection.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>The silent mind</em>, Agni Press, 1977<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/smn-10</p></small>    </div>  </body>
