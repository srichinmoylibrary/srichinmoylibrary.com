<p>Over the course of his numerous university lecture tours and at his various spiritual Centres around the world, Sri Chinmoy has answered thousands of spiritual questions. But perhaps none are of such widespread interest as this series of questions on the subject of beauty, which he answered during a meeting of his Connecticut Centre on September 14, 1974.</p>
<p>What exactly is beauty? What is its meaning and spiritual significance? How does it reveal itself in different planes of consciousness?</p>
<p>Questions like these have fascinated philosophers and poets from the beginning of time, but it is rare indeed for a God-realised spiritual Master to discuss these matters. This volume reveals the quintessence of beauty as seen by the inner vision of a great Yogi. The revelations offered here represent a unique treasure which will always be cherished in the hearts of spiritual seekers and lovers of beauty the world over.</p>  </div>
