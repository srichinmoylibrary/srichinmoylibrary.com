<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am very glad you have asked this question. Normally while we are trying to help someone, we are not helping him at all. We are only creating more problems and more complications for him. Always, the greatest and the best spiritual disciples try to please God in God’s own way. Otherwise there is no benefit in helping others. You are using your own small will. You try to grab this and grab that and while you are trying to possess someone by helping him, you are yourself possessed.</p>
<p>Another thing that people think is, “Oh, if I do this for the Master, people will see how devoted I am. I will feel that I have really done more than others. Many people will say that I am very devoted.” But I must tell you people that the Master will not be pleased. He will be pleased only when the disciple pleases him in his own way. I often tell someone to do something and he immediately says, “Oh no, how can I do that? What will people think of me? What will society think of me? What will humanity think of me?” At that time, he is pleasing himself, he is pleasing society, but he is not pleasing the Divine within him, the Supreme within him. If you are going to please God, or the Master who represents God, everything has to go: society, morality, friends, relatives, members of the family. Everything has to go if you want to please your Master who represents God. You think, “I have pleased the Master because I have done this and that for him.” But the Master only smiles. Naturally if you give me a blade of grass or a flower, I will give you a smiling face. You have given me something, but it is something I didn’t want at that time. At that moment, I didn’t want a flower. Perhaps I asked you to cook for me or do something that seemed absolutely meaningless to you. Perhaps I asked you to read the newspaper to see what was happening in the world atmosphere. You thought that by bringing me a flower, you would make me happy. I say, “No, at this particular moment, I want you to read the newspaper and tell me what is happening in Rome or Germany.” So if you want to please me by doing what I asked, then naturally, as I am identified with God, I immediately say, “God, he has pleased me.” If you please the Highest with all love, all affection, all concern, how can the Highest, the Dearest and the Deepest create problems for you? Even in the ordinary life, when you please someone according to your capacity, that person comes to help you, comes to your aid. But if you please the person the way he wanted to be pleased, naturally he will give you much more, beyond your expectation. And when you please a spiritual Master, who is one with God, then naturally infinite joy, infinite peace, infinite bliss will be yours because he is dealing with Infinity. He is not dealing with society or friends or relatives. He deals with infinite peace, light and bliss.</p>
<p>If you want to remain in the Source, if you want the Eternal and the Infinite, then try to please the Master in his own way. To please the Master is to please God. Otherwise, to feel that the Master is someone and God is someone else is to make a terrible mistake. The disciples must always see inside the Master the living presence of God. If he fails to see God inside the Master, he is not a disciple. He is simply fooling himself; he is creating a barrier between himself and the Master and between himself and God. He is not fit to be a disciple. What more can I say?</p>  </div>
