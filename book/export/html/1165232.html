<h2>Question: When the soul comes back, does it take back the same vital sheath?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It may take either the same one or a vital that is more evolved. It is like buying things in a shop. You leave something in the shop and then you come back and get your own thing or you get something more beautiful. Instead of keeping your old wristwatch, you may buy a new one. And somebody else, who has less money, will like your old one.</p>  </div>
