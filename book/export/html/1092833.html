<p>The mutual affection between these two Bengali giants was most touchingly revealed whenever either of them succumbed to physical ailments. On 19 October 1930, in New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.A., Tagore fell seriously ill. Subhas came to learn the news from Reuters, and he immediately sent a wire to the Poet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"CITY OF CALCUTTA ANXIOUS ABOUT YOUR ILLNESS. ON BEHALF OF THE CITIZENS I WISH SPEEDY RECOVERY AND A SAFE RETURN HOME. WIRE HEALTH. SUBHAS"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tagore was extremely moved by Subhas Chandra's love and concern, and he wired back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"THANK YOU, SUBHAS, I FEEL MUCH BETTER. YOUR RABINDRANATH"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On his part also, Tagore used to write most affectionate letters enquiring about Subhas Chandra's health whenever word reached him that Subhas was suffering on the physical plane.</p>  </div>
