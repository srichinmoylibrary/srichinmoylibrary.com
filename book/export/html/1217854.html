<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the soul leaves the body, it first stays in the vital world for a short period. Some souls suffer there, while others do not. It is like visiting a strange, new country. Some are fortunate enough to mix freely with the people of the new country and understand its culture in almost no time, while others are not so fortunate.</p>
<p>No, it does not carry over any earthly limitations to the higher worlds. The soul, the psychic being, while leaving the body and going back to its own region, gathers together the quintessence of its earthly experiences. It stays for some time in its own region and then it comes back into this world with a new determination and new possibilities to realise and fulfil the Divine here on earth.</p>  </div>
