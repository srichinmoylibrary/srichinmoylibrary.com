<p>My Father tells me<br />   What to do.<br /> I ask Him,<br />   How can I do it?<br /> My Father shows me<br />   How to do it.<br /> I ask Him,<br />   Why does He not do it for me?<br /> My Father does it for me,<br />   He does everything for me.        Then<br /> What do I tell Him?<br />   I tell Him,<br /> Father, I am sorry,<br />   I could have done it far better;<br /> I could have done everything infinitely better.<br /> Anyway, I thank You, Father,<br />   Since Your intention was good.</p>
