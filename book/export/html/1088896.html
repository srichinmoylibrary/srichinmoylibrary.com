    <title>&lt;em&gt;Donna Halper:&lt;/em&gt; Can you also be an instrument of God in a relationship with another human being? Let&#039;s say there is a person who is addicted to drugs. Do you believe that God can perhaps bring someone — just an ordinary person — into the life of that person to make him better?</title>
