<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just for fun, God will play tricks on you â€” if you enjoy it. If you don't enjoy it, if you are a dry intellectual human being, God may come in front of you but you won't be interested. If you enjoy jokes, He enjoys jokes. But if you do not enjoy them, He won't bother us, for God is a perfect gentleman. If you enjoy jokes and want to play a trick, naturally He will play tit for tat. If you do something, He will do the same. If you offer love and devotion, then immediately He will become your slave. So if you enjoy tricks and want to play tricks, then He will want to play tricks.</p>  </div>
