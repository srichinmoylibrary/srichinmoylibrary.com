<p>Today my seated double-arm lift with 160 pounds on each side I have done the highest in this life. I did it twice. The second time, I could not believe what a sound it made. It went so high that it made a loud sound when it fell down again. On both sides, you can clearly see the gap when it goes up. I have never lifted 160 pounds so high. Paree was able to see it even without her glasses.</p>
