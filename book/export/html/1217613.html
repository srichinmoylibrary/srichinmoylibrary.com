  <h1 class="book-heading">The consciousness of history</h1>
  
 
<p>From time immemorial, History has been dealing with tyrants and liberators. Before long, it will have to deal seriously with peacemakers.</p>
<p>History is the fountain-head of man's moments of self-expression, drawn from his conscious or unconscious choice of forces in the world.</p>
<p>When man chooses the force of Truth, ever at play on earth's atmosphere, he aligns himself with evolution's greatest power. When he allows himself to become the instrument of the force of Darkness, he becomes the ally of evolution's greatest regressive agent.</p>
<p>Both the beauty of truth and the ugliness of falsehood have an ever-failing friend: History.</p>
<p>History ever drifts from the wind of an imponderable sigh to the sunshine of a stupendous smile.</p>
<p>Who has eyes that look backward even when they consciously look forward? The deep-penetrating dweller in the core of History.</p>
<p>What is History, after all? Is it not merely what man has chosen to regard as important? History has been until now a record of man's values. But the time will soon come when it will become a record of God's values, a study of man's growth from blind infancy to the full maturity of enlightened spirituality.</p>
