<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spirituality and art always go together to the same Goal. You can say spirituality is the road which leads to the destination, and art is a traveller walking along the road. If the road reaches the Goal without a traveller, then the road is not satisfied. Because it has not carried anybody, because nobody has walked along it, the road feels useless. Again, if there is no road, how will the traveller reach his destination?</p>
<p>Art is the earth-traveller, the pilgrim, and spirituality is the road. When both reach their common destination, both feel that they are satisfied. Both art and spirituality have one Goal, and that Goal is supreme Joy, supreme Delight.</p>  </div>
