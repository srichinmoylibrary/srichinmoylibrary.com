<p>About a month ago I was in a store on 148th Street. The Spanish-speaking owner of the shop was trying to sell me a clock, but the clock was not working. He was telling me, "It will work at home."</p>
<p>I said, "Here it does not work, but it will work at home?"</p>
<p>He said, "Here I have not tried to fix it. But you have many people who can fix it for you. Then it will work."</p>
<p>I said, "No, I won't buy it if it is not working."</p>
<p>He said, "Then don't come into my shop anymore!"</p>
<p>I said, "Fine, I will not come into your shop."</p>
<p>Four or five days ago I happened to pass him on the street. He invited me to come into his shop, but I said no.</p>
