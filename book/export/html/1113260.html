<p>Rajen-da brought a serious complaint against one of the Ashramites to Amrita-da. Rajen-da said: "Amrita-da, I know him, I know his parents, I know his grandparents, I even know his great-grandparents. Their nature will never be transformed. They are all rogues."</p>
<p>"Rajen, it seems to me that the transformation of nature is a little difficult. Otherwise, by this time my nature would have been totally transformed," Amrita-da replied.</p>  </div>
