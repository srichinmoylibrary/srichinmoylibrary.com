<p>After I left the spiritual bookstore, I went downstairs to a musical instrument store. I was playing on a violin when an elderly lady came up to me with folded hands. I asked her if she wanted anything.</p>
<p>She said, "I did not see you when you were upstairs. I am the owner of the bookstore. I came here from down the street to see you."</p>
<p>It was raining so heavily outside, but she had come into the music store just to see me. For her to go out in such weather was really something! She was standing in front of me so devotedly with folded hands.</p>
