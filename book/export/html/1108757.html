<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The day after tomorrow is our Peace Concert at the Manila Cathedral. I will play it then. I have many, many instruments from various countries. When I play an instrument from a particular country, I invoke the blessingful presence of the soul of that country. Then I get immense joy, for I feel that I am receiving the blessings from that particular country.</p>  </div>
