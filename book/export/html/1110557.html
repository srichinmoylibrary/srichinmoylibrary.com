<p>Mahatma Gandhi often fasted to get things done in his own way. He used to threaten to fast unto death if Nehru and others did not fulfil his desires. In 1932 Gandhi began a most serious fast to protest the British treatment of untouchables. For many days he did not eat anything. Tagore was shocked. He came all the way to Pune with folded hands and begged Gandhi to resume eating. Because it was Gurudev making the request, Gandhi listened to him and started eating.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
