<p>Netaji's visionary speeches lit a fire never to be forgotten in the hearts of his listeners:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Let us break with the past, destroy all the shackles which have bound us for ages, and like true pilgrims, let us march shoulder to shoulder towards the destined goal of freedom. Freedom means life, and death in the pursuit of freedom means glory imperishable....</p>
<p>"It is only freedom-intoxicated men and women who will be able to free humanity."</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
