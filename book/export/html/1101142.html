<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They are practically the same; they both arrive at the same Goal. When we pray to God, we talk to God; and when we meditate, God talks to us. It is a two-way conversation. At times you are talking, at times I am talking. When we pray, we talk and God listens to us. When we meditate, God talks to us and we listen to Him.</p>  </div>
