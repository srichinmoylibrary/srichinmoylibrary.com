<p>In the Vermont Inspiration Marathon, the first time I saw G., at sixteen miles, he was smiling. S. was behind him. The second time I saw them, S. was ahead of G.. S. was so happy that he was ahead and had taken the lead.</p>
<p>When I started running at the twenty-one mile mark, I saw S. again. He was very glad to see me and said, "Guru, Guru, Guru!" G. was nowhere near him. I was always waiting to see if I would hear G.'s footsteps, and I kept looking around. But the only footsteps I heard behind me were not a man's. It was P. G. was walking.</p>
<p>Then I saw that husband and wife were going together â€” Y. was inspiring him.</p>
<p>The first time I saw him at sixteen miles, he was quite happy. Then at twenty-one miles, he was not smiling, but S. was so happy.</p>
