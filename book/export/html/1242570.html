<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Jesus Christ was a direct descendant of God. For him, everything was destined.</p>
<p>Perhaps an ordinary person cannot get up because of his lethargy. If he gets one year more to live on earth, then the next day he may be inspired to get up early in the morning to pray and meditate. If ordinary people, or seekers, stay on earth for a longer time, then they get the opportunity to pray and meditate. But in the case of God-realised souls, it is all destined. Whatever God wanted to do in and through them was all destined. Jesus Christ lived for thirty-three years; Swami Vivekananda, for thirty-nine years; Sri Ramakrishna, for fifty years; Sri Aurobindo, seventy-eight years; and the Mother of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, ninety-five years.</p>  </div>
