<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all we have to feel that the soul is all beauty only for one reason: because the soul is consciously aware of God. The soul is consciously aware of God at every second, twenty-four hours a day. That is why the soul is all beauty. If we want to be all beauty like the soul, we also have to be aware of God's Presence at every second of our life. You want to identify yourself with your soul's beauty. That is an excellent idea, an excellent aspiration. If you can become fully aware of God's operation in and through you at every second of your life, then you will be identifying yourself with infinite Beauty. God is infinitely more beautiful than your soul or my soul or any individual soul. If you can have a free access to the infinite Beauty which is God, automatically you become one with the soul's beauty, because the soul is an infinitesimal fraction of the Beauty that God embodies. If you go to the Source, you get everything to your heart's content. If you want to be one with the soul's beauty, then think of perfect Beauty, God. Then if God wants, He can give you all His Beauty, or He can give you what you actually want â€” the identification with your soul's beauty.</p>  </div>
