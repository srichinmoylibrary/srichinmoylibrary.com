<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People who are not in the mind, who are weak in the upper storey, do not have a philosophy of life. Some people live their life as a daily routine, and they are not aware of the existence of philosophy. Again, there are countless people who do not know what philosophy is, but the way they maintain their life is a form of philosophy. Anything that one practises with faith or some inner conviction is a form of philosophy.</p>  </div>
