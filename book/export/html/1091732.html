<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The superconscious is the possessor of direct wisdom and clear truth. It is unthinkable to reduce everything to the so-called sex drive. When we enter into the spiritual life with our aspiration, we can see that we are bringing the light of consciousness into our being. Then we will see everything differently. At that time life's occurrences are handled consciously with the light of the soul, instead of looming large as problems constantly to be solved.</p>  </div>
