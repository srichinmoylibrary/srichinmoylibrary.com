<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything has a soul. If the time has come for the soul to evolve, then it will be replaced. Nothing remains without a soul. The soul is like the inhabitant of a house. Let us say this is your house. But you are outgrowing this place, or you have become very rich, so you want to live in a better house. You go to another house. Now, poor me, I need to have a house suitable for my own financial background. So I come here, because I cannot afford to go to a better place. Money here is like aspiration. If one soul is aspiring much more powerfully than another soul, then it will go higher. Then another soul, an absolutely raw, beginning soul, is coming to take its place. So all the houses have to be occupied by souls. Nothing remains unoccupied by a soul. When one soul progresses from the rock world, then that rock will not remain dead. Another soul will enter the rock. God every second is constantly creating millions of souls. So that particular rock will be inhabited by another soul.</p>  </div>
