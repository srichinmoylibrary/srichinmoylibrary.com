<p>In our two-mile race in Flushing Meadow Park, after a mile and a quarter I saw Madhuri. I got really puzzled. How could Madhuri be ahead of me? Then I said to myself, "Perhaps she is still completing one mile." Then a little farther on I saw Tanima and Mitali, so I knew they were all still completing one mile.</p>
