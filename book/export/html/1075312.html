<p>HE IS SURPRISED</p>
<p>He is surprised<br /> That his ignorance<br /> Is still alive.</p>
<p>He is surprised<br /> That his vital life<br /> Is still strong.</p>
<p>He is surprised<br /> That his inner cry<br /> Is still feeble.</p>
<p>He is surprised<br /> That his God<br /> Is still unfed.</p>
<p>He is surprised<br /> That his God<br /> Is still compassionate.</p>
