<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>On June 27th, 2003, at the kind invitation of the Provost, Sir Patrick Bateson, Sri Chinmoy visited King’s College at the University of Cambridge for a unique “Lifting Up the World With a Oneness-Heart” Award ceremony.</p>
<p>The ceremony took place in the beautiful setting of the Provost’s Lodge Garden. This was Sri Chinmoy’s ninth visit to the University of Cambridge. On November 12th, 1997, together with the Indian High Commissioner, Dr. L.M. Singhvi, Sri Chinmoy had planted a special “Dove Tree” to commemorate the two years that Sri Aurobindo spent at the University of Cambridge. On this occasion, Dr. Singhvi also unveiled a bronze bust of Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p>The connection between King’s College and Sri Aurobindo is deeply meaningful for Sri Chinmoy, who joined the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, India, in 1944, at the age of twelve, and remained there until 1964. Sri Chinmoy has written a number of books and composed many songs both in English and Bengali dedicated to the immortal Poet, Seer, Sage and Yogi Sri Aurobindo.</p>  </div>
