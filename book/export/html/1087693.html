  <h1 class="book-heading">The kind-hearted homeopath</h1>
  
 
<p>There was once a very good homeopath who wanted to live in a very simple manner. He had a big heart, so he used to help the poor without charging them any fee. Everybody was very deeply appreciative of his kind-heartedness, except his own father. His father used to scold him and insult him, even in front of his wife.</p>
<p>Once it happened that a very poor man developed a high fever and all kinds of ailments. The homeopath went to the man's house to help him and found that he was shivering violently. The homeopath took off his own shawl and gave it to the poor man, in addition to massaging his whole body and giving him medicine. He spent two or three hours there. His fee for house calls was only three rupees, but as happened quite often, he did not even ask the man to pay him.</p>
<p>When the homeopath went home, he was shivering because he no longer had his shawl. His father insulted him mercilessly for his impractical attitude. His wife shed bitter tears, for she too had a big heart, and she felt very sad when her father-in-law insulted her husband.</p>
<p>One day it happened that the richest man in the city developed a serious disease. Even the doctors in the hospital could not cure him. Finally the rich man's friends pointed out by way of joke that there was only one doctor in the city whom he had not consulted: the foolish quack homeopath. Although they were joking, the rich man said, "Since I am heading towards the other world, it cannot do any harm for me to try him."</p>
<p>So he sent for the homeopath, who came and gave him a remedy. In two or three days it became obvious that the patient was improving, and in a month's time he was completely cured. The rich man wanted to give the homeopath three hundred rupees. But the homeopath said, "You have already paid my fee of three rupees. Why should I take this?"</p>
<p>The rich man insisted, "Three hundred rupees is nothing for me."</p>
<p>The doctor's father began insulting him, as usual, and tried to force him to take the money.</p>
<p>Finally the homeopath started shedding tears in front of everyone. Looking up with folded hands, he prayed aloud: "O God, You have really forsaken me. If I become rich, then I will not think of You. This is just a tricky plan to test me. If I take the money, I will no longer think of You. Only if I remain poor will I be able to think of You at every moment. No, I will not accept this money under any circumstances." In spite of his father's unceasing insults, he remained firm in his refusal to accept the three hundred rupees.</p>
<p>This seeker happened to be one of the foremost disciples of Sri Ramakrishna. He was devotion incarnate. When his Master used to give prasad on a plantain leaf, he used to eat even the leaf, because he felt that the leaf was also a blessingful gift from the Master. No other disciple of Ramakrishna had his kind of devotion. You may call it fanatical devotion, but I call it true devotion.</p>
<p>There are many inspiring stories about this disciple of Sri Ramakrishna. Once some friends of his came to visit him. He was so poor that he didn't have fuel, so he cut off one of the beams that was holding up the ceiling and used it as fuel to cook for them.</p>
<p>When Sri Ramakrishna passed away, for two or three months this disciple was bedridden. He cried and cried, saying, "Now there is nothing to see or feel on earth â€” nothing, nothing."</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna told many, many people that this disciple was a householder who could truly be respected by all. He deserved admiration and adoration from even the purest and most spiritual seekers. This homeopath was a radiant example of purity, simplicity, sympathy and oneness-heart.</p>  </div>
