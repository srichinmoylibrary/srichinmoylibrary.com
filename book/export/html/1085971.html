<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can know silence only when you become silence. And how can you become silence? You can become silence only when you feel that the Creator in you has a special purpose. He is creating you for his own manifestation on earth.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>The height of silence and the might of sound</em>, Agni Press, 1974<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/hsms-29</p></small>    </div>  </body>
