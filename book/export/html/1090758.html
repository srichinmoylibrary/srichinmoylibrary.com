<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please feel that you are not the body, you are not the vital, you are not the mind, you are not the heart, you are only the soul. Think of the most beautiful child on earth. Imagine the most beautiful child you have ever seen. Then feel that your soul is infinitely more beautiful than this child. Those of you who have children know that parents always think that their own children are the most beautiful. There is nothing wrong in it; they are absolutely right. But think that your soul is infinitely more beautiful than your children. To some of you I have told your soul’s qualities. If you know, think of the qualities that your soul wants to manifest. Think of your soul in this way and then feel that you are the soul at this very moment. Feel that you are that — <em>Tat twam asi</em>. This is how to meditate on your soul.</p>  </div>
