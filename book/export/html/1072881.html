<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly there is. Sri Ramakrishna brought down another soul as powerful as Vivekananda’s, exactly of the same standard, but he never saw that person on earth. Such a great spiritual Master brought down two liberated souls — Vivekananda and another. But the other one fell. Ignorance covered him, and he never came to his Master. Ignorance enveloped that particular liberated soul to such an extent that Ramakrishna could not find him.</p>  </div>
