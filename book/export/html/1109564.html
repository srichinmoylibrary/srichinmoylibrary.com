<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Total humility comes first. Humility is the best thing, but even in humility there is a sense of two persons: "I am humble to somebody else." In real surrender, there is no superiority; each one is the other's own illumined part. Unconditional surrender is infinitely more important than divine humility. Many people who are humble may not aspire for the light that they will immediately get from unconditional surrender. Humility can have tremendous devotion, but the cheerfulness of oneness is not there. In unconditional surrender, whatever the Master says, the individual will do immediately and cheerfully. Surrender means real oneness.</p>  </div>
