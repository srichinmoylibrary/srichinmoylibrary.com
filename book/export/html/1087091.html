<p>Can you imagine! The Japanese have printed something totally incorrect on a T-shirt which is being sold in the stores. It says, "If you have freedom, then practical what you say."</p>
<p>Chidananda was reading it out, and he was automatically saying "practice." He did not realise that they had written "practical."</p>
