<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You see in front of you a person. Try to move very close to that person. If you can't actually hear his breathing, try to imagine his breathing. When he is breathing in, you will breathe in even though you may feel tired or exhausted. If three or six times in this way you can catch his breath, after you have identified with his breath, then immediately you know whether he is a good man or a bad man. Your answer will be one hundred percent correct. This process is very effective.</p>  </div>
