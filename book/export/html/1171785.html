<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have a thorn in your foot, then you use another thorn to take the first one out. Then afterwards you throw both out of your system. Similarly, you already have so many junk qualities in your system. So if you add more to your system, then perhaps this new junk will take all the old junk qualities out, like taking out a thorn with a thorn.</p>  </div>
