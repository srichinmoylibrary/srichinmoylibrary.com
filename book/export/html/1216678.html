<p>Dear God, sweet Lord, Beloved Supreme, my spiritual children and I have tried to serve You, please You and fulfil You in Your own way, soulfully, devotedly and unreservedly. It is You alone who know whether we have succeeded in our divine journey and, if we have succeeded, to what extent.</p>
<p>Capacity and receptivity You gave us to receive Your Silence-Light, Silence-Vision, Silence-Divinity and Silence-Reality. Capacity You gave us to spread Your Sound-Mission, Sound-Manifestation and Sound-Perfection on earth.</p>
<p>Every day You have fed us and nourished us with Your Compassion-Light and blessed us with Your Satisfaction-Delight. All this You have done out of Your unconditional boundless Bounty.</p>
<p>Your transcendental Greatness was our heart's soulful choice. Your universal Goodness was our heart's soulful choice. By serving You in the seeker-students of the universities, we have tried to elevate our own consciousness. By pleasing You according to our limited capacity, we have again tried to elevate our consciousness. We tried to serve You, please You and fulfil You on the physical plane. On the inner plane, it is You who have inspired us and aspired in and through us for Your own satisfaction and divine fulfilment.</p>
<p>Today, at the end of our journey's close, we wish to place our soulful choice at Your Feet. We wish to place our devoted service at Your Feet. We wish to place our success-glory at Your Feet. We wish to place our progress-story at Your Feet.</p>
