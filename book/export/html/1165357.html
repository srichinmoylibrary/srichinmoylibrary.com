<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Kindness, loving kindness, is a divine aspect of God. Kindness comes from God's Compassion. When God's Compassion operates in a sincere seeker, that sincere seeker runs towards God. Compassion is like a magnet. Here on earth we call a particular thing kindness or sympathy, but in the inner world we see that this very thing comes directly from God's Compassion, from the highest realm of Consciousness. So when God's Consciousness and God's Compassion reign supreme in an individual soul, then he is bound to run towards God, the destined Goal.</p>  </div>
