<p>O my mind,<br /> Do not tell others<br /> That they are suffering<br /> Because they have done something wrong.<br /> For God's sake,<br /> Do not add insult to injury!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107179" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Stop advising others.<br /> It is high time for you<br /> To be a better creation of God's<br /> Than what you think you are.</p>

<div id="node-1107183" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Do you know<br /> Why you are good for nothing?<br /> You are good for nothing<br /> Because you daydream too much<br /> About the uncertain future.</p>

<div id="node-1107184" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Your doubt-connection<br /> With your powerful vital<br /> Will end in an unhappy disaster.<br /> Try to develop<br /> A beautiful friendship<br /> With your prayerful and fruitful heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107185" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> When did God tell you<br /> That you are always destined<br /> To do something stupid?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107186" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9.</h1>

  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Your unhappy experiences<br /> From human beings<br /> Can never be an adequate excuse<br /> For you to remain shockingly imperfect.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107189" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>

  <h1 class="book-heading">13.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Since all your life<br /> You have been giving undue importance<br /> To what you know,<br /> Can you not now<br /> At least give due importance<br /> To what you do not know at all?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107191" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14.</h1>

<div id="node-1107192" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15.</h1>

<div id="node-1107193" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> What you need is cooperation<br /> With the other members of your family.<br /> Once you have that,<br /> Then anger and frustration<br /> Will run away from you<br /> Faster than the fastest.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107194" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Invoke God the<br /> Forgiveness first,<br /> And then invoke God the Compassion.<br /> Then God the Justice<br /> Will send you this message:<br /> "My child,<br /> I am glad to inform you<br /> That you can surely escape my visit."</p>

<div id="node-1107195" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18.</h1>

<div id="node-1107196" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19.</h1>

  <h1 class="book-heading">23.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> In your newly discovered<br /> Aspiration-life,<br /> Do not permit procrastination.<br /> What you call your procrastination,<br /> God calls His starvation-<br /> Starvation for reciprocal love,<br /> Oneness and satisfaction-delight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107201" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> You have been my teacher<br /> For a very, very long time.<br /> From today on I shall be your teacher.<br /> O my mind,<br /> You forced me to be your student,<br /> But I shall swiftly awaken you<br /> And unconditionally illumine you.</p>

  </div>
<div id="node-1107203" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">26.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Because you are utterly stupid,<br /> You think that you can overthrow<br /> My heart's joy-government.</p>

<div id="node-1107204" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">27.</h1>

<div id="node-1107205" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">28.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Before expecting world-perfection,<br /> You must prove to the world<br /> That you are perfectly faultless<br /> And that you are a genuine student of peace.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107206" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">29.</h1>

<div id="node-1107209" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">32.</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1107210" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">33.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Do you really want others<br /> To be happy,<br /> Or while others are suffering most deplorably<br /> In utter helplessness,<br /> Are you secretly enjoying<br /> Selfish gratification?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107211" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">34.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> If you allow yourself<br /> Always to be a victim<br /> To worries and anxieties,<br /> Then it is you who have made yourself<br /> A completely drunk driver<br /> On the highway of your own aspiration-life.</p>

<div id="node-1107212" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">35.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> When did God tell you<br /> That you are every day destined<br /> To do something great, very great?<br /> Never!<br /> But God did tell you<br /> That every day<br /> You have to be humility incarnate<br /> And purity incarnate.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107213" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">36.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> I shall no longer allow<br /> Your callous rigidity<br /> To overshadow<br /> My heart's beautiful spontaneity.</p>

<div id="node-1107214" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">37.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> I shall definitely enjoy<br /> The separation between your dark doubts<br /> And my heart's bright faith.<br /> Needless to say,<br /> I am all for my heart's faith.</p>

<div id="node-1107215" class="section-2">

<div id="node-1107216" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">39.</h1>

<div id="node-1107220" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">43.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> In case you do not know,<br /> I am telling you<br /> That your happiness is fragile<br /> But my heart's delight is everlasting.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107221" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">44.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Quite often you take vacations<br /> From the aspiration-school<br /> I am ashamed of you.<br /> Indeed,<br /> That is an understatement.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107222" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">45.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Your wild restlessness,<br /> My heart's calmness forgives.<br /> But I cannot and I do not.<br /> I do not even want to.</p>

<div id="node-1107223" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">46.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> At long last<br /> I have summoned the courage to tell you<br /> That you are a shameless rogue.<br /> My aspiration-heart and I<br /> Will have nothing more to do with you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107224" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">47.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Will you ever care for your perfection?<br /> Take your own time;<br /> I am not expecting<br /> An immediate answer.</p>

<div id="node-1107225" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">48.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> You exaggerate your strength<br /> Far beyond your imagination.<br /> Look!<br /> My heart does not even want to advertise<br /> Its God-given strength.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107226" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">49.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> You buy a round-trip ticket<br /> When you go to visit<br /> The cottage of truth.<br /> You quickly come back<br /> To your falsehood-apartment.<br /> My heart buys only a one-way ticket<br /> To go to Truth-Palace.<br /> Once it reaches Truth-Palace,<br /> It does not return.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107227" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">50.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> I am embarrassed<br /> To see your over-confidence.<br /> Your over-confidence ignores<br /> Not only God the creation<br /> But also God the Creator.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107228" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">51.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> You depend on doubt.<br /> Do you know that<br /> The real name of doubt is frustration?<br /> My heart depends on faith.<br /> The real name of faith<br /> Is satisfaction-jubilee.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107229" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">52.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> So often you are befriended<br /> By cynicism.<br /> My heart and I are befriended<br /> By the embrace of the universal man.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107230" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">53.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Because you do not have patience,<br /> You badly fail.<br /> Because my heart has patience,<br /> God and my heart<br /> Ultimately have each other<br /> And enjoy each other.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107231" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">54.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Sincerity is powerfully knocking<br /> At your door.<br /> How long will you and your false pride<br /> Ignore your unconditional well-wisher?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107232" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">55.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> You must realise<br /> That there is a vast difference<br /> Between your great intentions<br /> And my heart's good accomplishments.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107233" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">56.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Your life is nothing other<br /> Than volcano-suspicion.<br /> But my heart's aspiration-cry<br /> And my Lord's Compassion-Light<br /> Will never allow you to explode.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107234" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">57.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> God does not want you<br /> To make something great out of your suffering.<br /> God does not want you<br /> To idealise or idolise your suffering.<br /> God wants you to take suffering,<br /> When it comes,<br /> As a valuable lesson.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107235" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">58.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> No matter how often<br /> Or how hard you try<br /> To make others believe<br /> Your falsehood-propaganda,<br /> It will never pass for Truth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107236" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">59.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> If you deliberately remain<br /> A stranger to purity and humility,<br /> Then in God's Compassion-Heart-Home<br /> You will always remain<br /> Unexpected and uninvited.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107237" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">60.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Once more if you say<br /> That you are depressed<br /> And you need my sympathy,<br /> I shall not remain silent.<br /> I shall tell you the real reason.<br /> The real reason for your depression<br /> Is that you secretly and openly<br /> Enjoy the pleasures of lethargy.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107238" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">61.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> You are a constant trouble-maker,<br /> But I shall not surrender to you.<br /> I know that before long<br /> My Lord Supreme will come to me<br /> As my trouble-shooter.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107239" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">62.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Why are you so stupid?<br /> As soon as you are inspired,<br /> Why do you not go one step ahead,<br /> And aspire to expedite<br /> Your stupendous success-glory?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107240" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">63.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> You can never be as serious<br /> As you seem.<br /> You can never be as pure<br /> As you seem.<br /> But you can be,<br /> And you actually are,<br /> As much of a doubt-monster<br /> As you seem.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107241" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">64.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> When I enter into my heart-room,<br /> I clearly hear<br /> The sweet melody of a golden flute.<br /> But when you enter into my heart,<br /> You command confusion-din<br /> To accompany you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107242" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">65.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> When I think of your stupidity,<br /> I feel sad.<br /> When I think of your insincerity,<br /> I am mad.<br /> When I think of your imminent<br /> And permanent surrender<br /> To my truth-serving and God-loving heart,<br /> I become glad, supremely glad.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107243" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">66.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> I do not trust you.<br /> I am sure you know that.<br /> I shall trust you<br /> Only when you come to me alone,<br /> And not with your dangerous doubt-friend<br /> And useless uncertainty-friend.</p>

<div id="node-1107244" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">67.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> You and I have been together<br /> For a very long time.<br /> But now I want to leave you<br /> And go beyond you.<br /> Do you want to know why,<br /> After all these years,<br /> I want to discontinue our association?<br /> Only one reason:<br /> You do not have soulful confidence.<br /> What you have is either<br /> Ridiculous over-confidence<br /> Or confidence-famine.<br /> I simply don't want either of the two.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107245" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">68.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> You have made me ruthless.<br /> You and I have become<br /> Perfect strangers to sensitivity.<br /> When are we going to realise<br /> That kindness is the only key<br /> To our real satisfaction?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107246" class="section-2">

  </div>
<div id="node-1107247" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">70.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> It is simply useless to tell you<br /> That unlike you,<br /> Not only my heart<br /> But also others' hearts<br /> Are extremely beautiful and pure.<br /> You have taken an oath<br /> Not to listen to truth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107248" class="section-2">

<div id="node-1107251" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">74.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Are you blind?<br /> Are you deaf?<br /> Can you not see,<br /> Can you not hear,<br /> That the whole world is telling me<br /> That my heart is the mother<br /> Of Eternity's love<br /> And Immortality's affection?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1107252" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">75.</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> By defying my soul's authority<br /> And by turning a deaf ear<br /> To my heart's soulful requests,<br /> You have become an object of contempt<br /> And not of admiration.</p>

<div id="node-1107253" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">76.</h1>
