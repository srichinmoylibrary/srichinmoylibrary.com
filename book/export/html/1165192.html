  <h1 class="book-heading">My prayer</h1>
  
 
<p>My prayer can smile only twice. Once when I silence my outer senses, once when I open the portal of my soul.</p>
<p>My prayer lies in loving God for His own Sake. My prayer is the destroyer of errors, born and unborn.</p>
<p>Reality is determined only by one thing: prayer â€” prayer in its embodiment, prayer in its dynamic operation.</p>
<p>Prayer is best expressed in my day-to-day life when my prayer has become a spontaneous, self-giving surrender to the Will of God.</p>
<p>Seeking is the plane fare in the realm of spirituality. Striving is the ticket. When seeking and striving have played their respective roles, surrendering leads me to my seat in the plane.</p>
<p>Eldorado can no longer hide from me when my genuine prayer enables me to see my soul in life and my life in the soul.</p>
<p>Audible prayer is often a self-satisfying solemnity. Silent prayer in lone self-poise is the fulfilment of Eternity.</p>
<p>Prayer is struggle when I want to be an all-knowing mind. Prayer is nectar when I want to be an all-dedicating life.</p>
<p>They say that prayer is the daughter of suffering. But I say that prayer is the mother of delight.</p>  </div>
