<p>One day recently I was very, very sad. Sona’s soul appeared before me and told me that he would make me happy by bringing me happy news. He was on earth for fifteen years, so he would bring me fifteen pieces of good news.</p>
<p>I asked, “When? In how many years?”</p>
<p>He said, “No, by the end of this year.”</p>
<p>He has already brought two or three pieces of good news. When I have heard fifteen, by the end of this year, in Japan, I will declare the good news that Sona has brought me.</p>
