<p>"Chinmoy, Nirmala has been bothering me for the last few weeks. She wants me to give her my shoe measurements. I told her that right now I don't need any more shoes. If I had any more shoes, I think I could open up a shoe store. But you know Nirmala. When she wants something, she will not be satisfied until she gets it. So bring a piece of paper and let me place my foot on it. Then take the exact measurements of my foot. I believe size eight will fit me, but I may be wrong. But once you have taken the measurements, I am sure it will fit me. Now you can go and give it to Nirmala and tell her that at long last I have fulfilled her desire."</p>  </div>
