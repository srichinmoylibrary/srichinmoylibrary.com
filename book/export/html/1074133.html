<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The day I lifted the elephant — not the small one, but the big one — I saw solid strength. I always say that elephants symbolise strength. When I was lifting up the elephant, I saw that a new world is going to emerge. It will have solid strength, not only in the physical, but in the vital, in the mind, in the psychic. So while I was lifting the elephant, I saw a new world of solid strength and this new world will be in all planes of consciousness. In that way, it was a most significant experience for me.</p>  </div>
