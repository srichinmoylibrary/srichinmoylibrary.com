<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A simple life, a sincere life and a life that feels the necessity of an inner cry. Not name and fame, but a sincere cry to become a devoted instrument of God, to please God not in one's own way, but in God's Way. If one really wants to please God in God's Way, according to his inner capacity and receptivity, then I feel that he is entitled to try my path.</p>  </div>
