<p>“God, my father is a very big musician. Can I be as great as he is?”</p>
<p>“Certainly you can. You can be greater than your father.”</p>
<p>“God, You know my father has an Indian teacher. He calls his teacher ‘Guru’. I saw the Guru the other day here in England. He blessed me. He gave me an Indian name.”</p>
<p>“What is your Indian name, Julian?”</p>
<p>“My Indian name is Mahadeva.”</p>
<p>“It is a wonderful name. It means the Great Lord Shiva. Do you know that your father also has an Indian name?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t. Please tell me, what is my father’s name?”</p>
<p>“Your father’s name is Mahavishnu. It means the Great Lord Vishnu.”</p>
<p>“God, I have forgotten to ask You one thing.”</p>
<p>“What is it? Tell Me.”</p>
<p>“While Guru was blessing me, I saw a beautiful woman standing beside my father. Who was she?”</p>
<p>“She is your new mother. Her name is Mahalakshmi, the Great Mother Lakshmi, the Great Goddess Lakshmi. She is the Mother of Love, Concern, Joy, Beauty, and Harmony. Soon you will see and feel that she is all love and all concern, and all pride for you.”</p>
<p>“God, You have told me so many nice things, now I want to tell You one nice thing.”</p>
<p>“What is it? What is it, please tell Me?”</p>
<p>“God, I really want to go to America to stay with my father and my new mother and our Indian Guru.”</p>
<p>God sheds tears of joy.</p>  </div>
