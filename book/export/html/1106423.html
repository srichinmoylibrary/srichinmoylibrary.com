<p>Today I did not mean to lift 200 pounds in each arm, but I was tempted! Then I lifted it twice and I was more than satisfied. Nowadays I have to pull down two screen blinds before I lift so that the photo will turn out better. For some reason, the blinds were giving me so much trouble today. As soon as I pulled one down, the other would go up. They did not want to stay down.</p>
