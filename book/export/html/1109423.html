<p>"Blessed is he who has found his work; let him ask no other blessedness."</p>
<p>â€” Carlyle</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A spiritual person has found his work. His work is dedicated action. Indeed, he has no need of any other blessedness. His action is the divine acceptance of earthly existence. And for this he needs a perfect body, a strong mind, a soulful heart and a supremely inspired life of inner receptivity and outer capacity.</p>  </div>
