<p>I have asked my mind<br /> To take care of me,<br /> But my mind does not want<br /> To take care of me<br /> Because I am so stupid.</p>
<p>I have asked my heart<br /> To take care of me,<br /> But my heart does not want<br /> To take care of me<br /> Because I am so impure.</p>
<p>Finally, I have asked my Lord Supreme<br /> To take care of me.<br /> My Lord Supreme says,<br /> "My child,<br /> I shall definitely take care of you<br /> Because your entire life<br /> Is so sincere."</p>
