<p><em>(The forest. Surya is searching for Sanjna.)</em></p>
<p>SURYA <em>(seeing her at last)</em>: Forgive me, forgive me my beloved Sanjna. I did not know that I was hurting you. Now my brilliance has diminished, and you shall suffer no more.</p>
<p>SANJNA: I always loved you, I love you still. But the brilliance of your light was killing me. That was the only reason I left you. I forgive you, my dearest husband. With all my heart I forgive you.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Vayu, Vishwakarma and the six children.)</em></p>
<p>SANJNA: Father, Father, you have saved us. We really loved each other. Surya loved me, and I loved him wholeheartedly. Only I could not bear his fiery presence. But now that you have taken away a little bit of his brilliance, I can live with him again. You have all my heart’s joy and gratitude. It is you, Father, who have given us this boon — to remain together, eternally one.</p>
<p>SURYA AND SANJNA <em>(together)</em>: Father, we are all gratitude to you.</p>  </div>
