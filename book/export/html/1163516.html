<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can easily know whether or not the work we do is a selfless, dedicated service just by entering into the heart while we are working. If the heart is expanding, if the heart is being illumined, if the heart is running like a deer towards the Goal, then it is certainly dedicated service.</p>  </div>
