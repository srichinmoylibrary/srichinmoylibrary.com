<p>For he who is depressed or afflicted, life is a bed of thorns. He has realised this truth and cries for life's transformation. He wants to possess a bed of roses. Pain is his painful possession. He can successfully sing with Francis Thompson:</p>

<p>"Nothing begins, and nothing ends,<br /> That is not paid with moan;<br /> For we are born in other's pain,<br /> And perish in our own."</p>
