SCA 799-817. Excerpts from an interview with the <em>Indian Express</em> daily newspaper, which took place in Pondicherry, India, in June 1999.</p>
<h2>Interviewer: Sri Chinmoy, please tell me about yourself. Where were you born?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I was born in Chittagong in 1931. I came to Pondicherry at the age of twelve. Then I stayed here at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram for twenty years. I went to the Ashram school. At that time there was no degree course. I studied for a few years, but I did not complete high school.</p>  </div>
