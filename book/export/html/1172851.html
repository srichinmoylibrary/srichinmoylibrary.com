<p>Always in life you have to surrender to God’s Will, either happily or unhappily, willingly or unwillingly. If you do not do it willingly, God will compel you to do it unwillingly, because it is His Plan for you to do it. Again, if you surrender unwillingly, then you suffer, and problems will arise.</p>
<p>I have lifted 7,500 human beings — all and sundry. I have also lifted one thousand lambs and one hundred cows. Did I not do it willingly? If I had done it unwillingly, by this time my arms would have been broken into pieces. I do everything willingly, plus cheerfully. Cheerfully and willingly I do it. I cannot do it unwillingly, because my unconditional surrender became complete many, many, many, many, many years ago.</p>
<p>Even if we do something unwillingly, we may get the result, but we will never get the utmost satisfaction. How many times will we be able to exercise our unwillingness? Would I have been able to use unwillingness to lift 7,500 human beings? No! I had to be willing, willing, willing, willing, willing. Many Presidents, Prime Ministers and other important people I have lifted. Again, I have lifted people who are not so well known, including many children. Children are the future of the world. Who is known, and who is not known? In the Heart of God we are one.</p>
<p>Everything we have to do always willingly, willingly, willingly, willingly, plus self-givingly. Then there will be no problem. It will be all joy, all joy, all joy.</p>
