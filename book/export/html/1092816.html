<p>When the leaders of the nation disobeyed Mahatma, he felt compelled to issue his supreme ultimatum, namely a fast unto death.</p>
<p>At one time, according to Pakistan, India owed Pakistan a very large sum of money. Nehru and Patel did not want to give the money. They said, 'True, we owe them this sum, but we do not want to give it right now. Already we are at daggers drawn. If they get the money, they will only buy weapons to humiliate us. In the course of time, we shall give it to them, but the time has not come.'</p>
<p>Then Gandhi-ji said, 'Look, I am going to fast unto death if you do not give Pakistan the money which we are supposed to give.'</p>
<p>Helpless as he was in the face of Mahatma's vow, Sardar Patel lost his temper. He said, "Gandhi-ji is not prepared to listen to me. He seems determined to blacken the names of the Hindus before the whole world."</p>
<p>Patel was compelled to give the full amount to Pakistan.</p>  </div>
