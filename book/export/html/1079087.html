<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can see your Master always as the diamond of your heart just by aiming at constant, conscious, unconditional surrender to his will. There should be no individual will of yours, no personal will of yours. Him to please in his own way, at every moment, at every moment, should be your goal. When you do everything unconditionally, in his own way, constantly, unreservedly, cheerfully, then you can get the Master always as the diamond of your heart. On the strength of your constant surrender and constant willingness to please the Master in his own way, you will get the Master as the diamond of your heart.</p>  </div>
