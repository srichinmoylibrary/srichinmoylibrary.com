<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Anything that is created has a soul. An ant has a soul; material objects and gross physical objects have a soul. In God's creation everything has a soul. As an insect has a soul, as a drop has a soul, as an ocean has a soul, even so, angels have souls. The soul is a portion of divinity. Inside anything that exists, a spark of divinity has to be there. Existence itself embodies part of divinity, because existence did not come from a hostile force. Existence came from God.</p>
<p>Even inside a bad person — a thief, a drug addict — the soul is there. It is a question of how much the soul can manifest its divinity.</p>  </div>
