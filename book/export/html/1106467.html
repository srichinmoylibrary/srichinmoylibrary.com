<p>When I was about to lift 270 pounds in each arm for the second time this morning, all of a sudden the light went off. My exercise room became all dark. Then, after four or five minutes, the light came back on, but I forgot to turn on the video machine again to do my lift. It was my highest lift, but because I did not turn the machine back on when darkness disappeared, nothing came out. Alas, alas!</p>
