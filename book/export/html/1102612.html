<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you know what patience is, then it is very easy for you to have more of it. If you feel it takes a certain length of time to achieve a particular thing, then you will become impatient when the time is up. Suppose you have set a time limit for your God-realisation. After that time, if God is still hiding from you, you become impatient.</p>
<p>You have to feel that it is not your role to set a time for your self-mastery. You should say, "I shall realise God at His choice Hour." God has not asked you to set the time when He will come to visit you; that is for Him to do. You be responsible only for your prayer and meditation; let God be responsible for the Hour. Each one can take care of his own business. Prayer belongs to you, but the time belongs to the Supreme.</p>
