<p>After a marathon, almost everybody is happy. Only those who were fighting against time are miserable. But thousands and thousands of runners come only to finish. They come only to complete the race.</p>
<p>One fellow was dancing and jumping at the finish line. Another man was running back and forth at the end.</p>
<p>Sujataâ€™s strides are so short, but she finished in 4:30 or so. Whoever thought that seven or eight of my Japanese disciples would come to run the New York Marathon?</p>
