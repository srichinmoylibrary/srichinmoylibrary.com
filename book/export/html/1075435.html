<p>MODERN AND ANCIENT</p>
<p>Modern art<br /> Is not as bad as you think.<br /> Ancient art<br /> Was not as good as you think.</p>
<p>The modern world<br /> Is not as unaspiring as you feel.<br /> The ancient world<br /> Was not as aspiring as you feel.</p>
<p>Modern man<br /> Is not as undivine as you believe.<br /> Ancient man<br /> Was not as divine as you believe.</p>
<p>Like ancient art,<br /> Modern art embodies its beauty<br /> In its own way.</p>
<p>Like the ancient world,<br /> The modern world reveals its divinity<br /> In its own way.</p>
<p>Like ancient man,<br /> Modern man manifests his immortality<br /> In his own way.</p>
