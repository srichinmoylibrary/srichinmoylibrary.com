<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to assimilate what you receive from meditation. If you do not assimilate these qualities, then it is almost useless. Then the next day you have to go again and get the same amount of peace, light and bliss. Once something is assimilated, it becomes a solid realisation, an absolutely permanent experience. Then it is not only a conscious part of you, but also inseparably one with your existence. This is very important. There is a great difference between when we assimilate our meditation and when we do not.</p>
<p>If peace, light and bliss are not assimilated, then it is as if a friend came into your life for a few hours and then he just left you after a short time. He did not become your eternal friend or your lifelong friend.</p>
<p>If you don't establish an eternal friendship, you do not give your friend the opportunity to be with you, to inspire you, to guide you, to mould you and shape you, or to share any divine qualities or capacities with you.</p>  </div>
