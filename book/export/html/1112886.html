    <title>Question: Once I was in a lot of pain and you said that you were injecting peace into my body. I was wondering whether it is occult power or spiritual power that you use when you bring down a quality like that?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Peace is a spiritual power. Peace is not occult power. But you have to know that any kind of power — will power, spiritual power, occult power — can easily take away your pain. If you use your will power and make yourself feel that the pain is an experience of delight, then you will have no pain. At that time, the pain itself will bring you joy.</p>  </div>
