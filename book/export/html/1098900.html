<p>The Consul for Information was my esteemed friend Nirmaljit Singh. He was a Sikh. He used to brag to me that Sikhism is better than Hinduism, and I used to brag that Hinduism is better than Sikhism. It was all in a funny, joking mood. Very affectionately we used to talk. We used to get pleasure by saying, “My religion is better than yours.” He knew that I did not mean it, and I knew that he did not mean it. Ananda Mohan also used to join in. They used to send for me to go to their section. Otherwise, how could a junior clerk dare to go and talk with a Consul?</p>  </div>
