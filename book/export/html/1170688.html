<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> After children reach the age of thirteen, I shall never, never blame the parents if their children misbehave. Until children reach the age of thirteen, the parents are responsible for making sure that the children do the right thing. After that, I will never, never blame you if your children misbehave and want to leave the spiritual life.</p>  </div>
