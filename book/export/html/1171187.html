SCA 712-721. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 4 April 1994 at PS 86 in Jamaica, New York.</p>
<h2>Question: I want to throw my impurities into you, but I don’t know how.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you meditate, just think of a drop and the ocean. Then you have to feel that the ocean will not be ruined or polluted by the drop. Many times people feel that the ocean will become impure, so the best thing is to keep one’s own impurity. I am telling you to just throw everything into me. That is one way. There is also another way, and that way is to always feel inside your own heart a most beautiful flower, and to try to smell the fragrance. The beauty and fragrance of your own heart-flower will be able to purify your impure mind. These are the two ways. Either you can throw your impurity inside my universal consciousness with your conscious and concentrated will, or you can envision inside your own heart a most beautiful flower and smell the fragrance. Then your own heart’s purity will transform the impurity of your mind.</p>  </div>
