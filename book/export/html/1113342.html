<p>"Instead of today, I shall read out my plays on Wednesday. I have to do this because Priti and Tapati have their Italian class tonight. Go and tell them that I have cancelled my talk today. Why don't you learn Italian?"</p>
<p>"I tried German for six months but then I had to stop," I said.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"I found it too difficult to learn."</p>
<p>"Nothing is too difficult unless you have some special problem. You should try to learn several languages."</p>  </div>
