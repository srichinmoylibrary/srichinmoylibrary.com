  <h1 class="book-heading">Getting ahead</h1>
  
 
<p>Now when I run races, I see many people who start out ahead of me fall behind me after one mile. Of course, the really excellent runners have gone far, far ahead — God knows where. I can't even see their backs.</p>
<p>In today's five-mile race, towards the end I passed ten or twelve people. Then one girl went ahead of me. She looked at me to see if I was going to try to catch her, and in silence I said, "Go ahead." Later I caught her.</p>
<p>Another girl went ahead of me after four miles. She was taller than I am and so strong and muscular. Again in silence I said, "All right, go ahead."</p>
