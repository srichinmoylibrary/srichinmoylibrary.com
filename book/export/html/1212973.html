<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, very often humanity on the whole greets spiritual Masters with <em>derision</em>. Why?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, in general humanity greets only the self-styled and unrealised spiritual Masters with <em>ridicule and mockery</em>, not the genuine spiritual Masters. But I must admit that at times even the good and true spiritual Masters are greeted with ridicule. In such cases, it is because humanity is not ready to accept their divine light. I feel extremely sorry for both unaspiring humanity and the self-giving spiritual Masters.</p>  </div>
