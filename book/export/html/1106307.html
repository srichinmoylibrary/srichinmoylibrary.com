<p>Believe it or not, on alternate days I lift 70 pounds very nicely while seated in my chair. The first set I do 20 repetitions and the second set I do 10 repetitions. With 80 pounds, I lift 10 times and then 7 times. I have not yet started to lift 90 or 100 pounds. On even days I do 50 pounds 50 times. But unless I have shown it to you, you can take it with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>I am very proud of the three or four boys who could lift 70 pounds a few days ago. They are very strong. I am also very proud of the girlsâ€™ performance.</p>
<p>Another thing that I have been doing recently is two sets of 20 and 10 pressing 70 pounds while lying down. I do 80 pounds only 10 times, but 70 pounds I have been doing for the last two and a half months.</p>
