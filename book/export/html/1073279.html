<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The <em>soma</em> the Yogis use is the juice of the <em>soma</em> plant. Only the Vedic Seers knew how to use this herb. Here in the West people are experimenting with plants, but these have nothing to do with the <em>soma</em> plants which the ancient Seers used. Also, they do not know how the Seers used them. The process the Westerners are using now is absolutely wrong. The experiences they are having are totally counterfeit. They are ruining some of their subtle nerves. I have students who once upon a time were victims of these drugs. Now that they are living the spiritual life most sincerely, they can easily distinguish between real spiritual experiences and what they were having before.</p>  </div>
