<p>Yesterday it was raining during the six-day race, so I left the track and went inside the car. Cahit came running to shake hands with me. He said that I bring sunshine to him. Then he said he was sorry he was unshaven. Where can I find another Cahit?</p>
<p>Sue Medaglia was so happy to see me at the race. She said, "Because of you, because of your group, I am alive, I am running."</p>
<p>Today I saw divine Kim, with folded hands. She was smiling and smiling. Such a soulful consciousness she maintained throughout!</p>
