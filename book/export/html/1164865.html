<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It happened three times very recently. Once, after I dialled, I changed my mind. I wanted to do something infinitely more important. Another time I let the phone ring three times, but there was no answer, so I gave up. Usually you answer on the second ring. And once your consciousness was unimaginably low. After I dialled I got a very unpleasant vibration, inner resentment, so I didn't speak to you. It was the day you took vacation for four or five days. I didn't send you, but you decided yourself to take vacation.</p>  </div>
