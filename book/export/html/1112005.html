<p>At the six-day race, so many runners knew me. I smiled at them and they smiled at me. But my Cahit! He came off the track — he had to shake hands with me, talk to me and give me gifts. He couldn't believe that I gave him such a big gift. All the runners smiled at me, but he came off the track to see me.</p>
<p>Fred Lebow was all appreciation for our Marathon Team workers. He spoke to me most gratefully about our contribution.</p>
<p>The leader, a Greek named Yiannis Kouros, is something! Once he ran 200 miles at a seven-minute pace.</p>
