<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am not telling you to become a world champion in swimming. I am not telling you to become a world champion in marathon running. I am not asking anybody to swim the English Channel, far from it. Only I am saying if you feel that you have the capacity, try it! You have my blessings. I am certain you will do it. I like these kinds of achievements so much. I do not feel they are something bad. But at the same time, I do not want you to neglect your work at the Centre, and I do not want you to neglect your own aspiration. That I do not approve of.</p>  </div>
