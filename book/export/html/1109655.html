<p>If the body is the only thing that I can call my very own, then temptation, sense-pleasure, frustration and destruction also belong to me. But if I can say that the soul is what I am, if I can feel that I am one, inseparably one with the existence of my soul, only then will I see the purpose of my life, why I am on earth, what necessity God has for me and what work He will do through me here on earth. Each individual has something special to offer, and this message has to come directly from the soul and enter into the physical consciousness.</p>  </div>
