<p>Netaji's historic address to his army upon entering India in 1944 runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There, there in the distance-beyond that river, beyond those jungles, beyond those hills, lies the promised land, the soil from which we sprang, the land to which we shall now return. We shall carve our way through the enemy's ranks or, if God wills, we shall die a martyr's death and in our last sleep we shall kiss the road that will bring our army to Delhi. The road to Delhi is the road to freedom. Chalo Delhi!"</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
