<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The animal kingdom will not die out just because so many animals have evolved to a higher form of life. Similarly, when we all become divine beings in the course of spiritual evolution, human life will still go on; animal, plant and mineral life will still exist. Evolution starts right from the mineral world. As animals evolve into human beings, plants are evolving into animals and minerals are evolving into plants. In this way Godâ€™s creation is self-sustaining.</p>  </div>
