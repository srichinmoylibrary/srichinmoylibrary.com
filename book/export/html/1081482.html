<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, it is always better to be sincerely happy. Why should we give a chance to unhappiness? Let us be sincerely happy. That is the goal. Why should we even become falsely happy? Let us wait for happiness, cry for it. If we don't get pure, clear water to drink when we are thirsty, we don't drink filthy water; we wait for clear water. We look here and there until we get clean, pure water.</p>
<p>If you are sincerely unhappy, use the antidote. Cry more within. Be more spiritual. Increase your inner cry. Then your unhappiness will be illumined. Your inner cry will make your unhappiness go away. But do not stick to false happiness. Like a false coin it will be detected. Even you yourself will catch it. Again, if you are really happy, if you show off your happiness to others, they will only be jealous. If you are fortunate enough to realise God today, although others know they will get much benefit from your realisation, still they will become jealous. Your happiness does not matter to others.</p>
<p>The best thing is for you to be always happy, but not to show off your happiness. If you can't have real inner happiness, instead of displaying false happiness, try to use the medicine, which is your inner cry. That is the best. Instead of becoming insincere, the best thing is to immediately take medicine.</p>  </div>
