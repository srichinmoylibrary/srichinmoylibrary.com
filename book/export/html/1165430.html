<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because of an injury I have entered into the weightlifting world. But there are many people who are of the opinion that if you use very light weights and do lots of repetitions, then slowly and steadily you can strengthen your muscles and nerves and eventually get rid of an injury. Unfortunately, this is not my personal experience. I don't think my weightlifting will take away my pain. My physical pain, especially my knee pain, will go away only by the infinite Grace of my Beloved Supreme.</p>  </div>
