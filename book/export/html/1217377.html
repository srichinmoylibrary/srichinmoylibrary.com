<p>From the spiritual point of view, when one has acquired higher and deeper experiences from previous incarnations, one is called an old soul. The person who is wanting in such experiences is called a young soul. As you can see, it is not the number of incarnations that determines the "status" of the soul, but what one has learned and achieved in those lives.</p>  </div>
