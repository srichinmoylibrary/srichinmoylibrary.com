  <h1 class="book-heading">A reunion with Ida Patterson</h1>
  
 
<p>On 2 October 1987 I went to Minneapolis to give a concert and I saw Ida Patterson again. I said to her, “You are still very, very strong, energetic, dynamic. I am so happy to see you again. Twenty years ago I came to your place and you gave me shelter.”</p>
<p>She replied, “You were just a young man. You said you came into the lion’s mouth when you came to America.”</p>
<p>“Luckily, I was not devoured!” was my reply.</p>  </div>
