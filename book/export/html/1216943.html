<p>About five years ago I was giving a concert in Canada. About 500 or 700 people were in the audience. As I came off the stage, somebody came from behind me and fell at my feet. immediately I recognised Chander, who had been one of my sectional bosses when I worked at the Indian Consulate in New York.</p>
<p>I said, "O God, you are my boss!"</p>
<p>He said, "Inwardly I am not your boss!" He had felt something in me and had seen me in another consciousness.</p>
