<p>Sri Chinmoy is with us today to explain how he uses meditation to excel in athletics. Thank you, Guru, for coming again to “The First Estate.”</p>
<p>I want to know more about meditation first. What’s the first lesson that you would give me as I try to learn how to meditate and use these special powers?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we meditate, the first thing we have to do is to control our thoughts. We want to keep the mind as calm and as quiet as possible, so we will not allow any thought to enter into our mind.</p>  </div>
