<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul has no secret, only you do not understand the messages of the soul, so you feel that the soul has many secrets. Only because you do not understand God's and the soul's messages do you feel that they have kept something hidden from you. Because we are ignorant of God's Light and Compassion-Height, we feel that He has secrets.</p>  </div>
