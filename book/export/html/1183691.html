<p>Sri Aurobindo had two or three secretaries. One of the secretaries was a former doctor. His name was Nirod Baran. He was a great poet, author and supreme authority on Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. One day he said to Sri Aurobindo, “Hriday’s mother has been suffering for such a long time. Can you not cure her?”</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo said to him, “What can I do? Her time has come. It is God’s Will for her children to come here.”</p>
<p>My eldest sister, Arpita, was at that time a permanent member of the Ashram. On that same day, while she was enjoying her siesta, she had a dream. In the dream she saw that my mother had passed away.</p>
<p>That day, at the very hour when Sri Aurobindo said, “Her time has come,” my mother passed away in Chittagong.</p>  </div>
