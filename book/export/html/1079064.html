<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The difference between God’s Compassion and God’s Justice is this: When we remain in God’s Consciousness, we feel there is no such thing as Justice: It is all Compassion. But when we remain in our own consciousness, then we feel that there is no such thing as Compassion; it is all Justice. When we live in the human consciousness, we say God is very cruel, unkind. When we live in the divine Consciousness, we realise He is all Compassion. The difference lies in us. If we live in ourselves, God is all Justice. If we live in God, then He is all Compassion.</p>  </div>
