<p>He died for beauty.<br /> Alas! Beauty was not to be found.</p>
<p>He died for purity.<br /> Alas! Purity was not to be found.</p>
<p>He died for magnanimity.<br /> Alas! Magnanimity was not to be found.</p>
<p>He died for divinity's Reality<br /> and reality's Divinity.<br /> Lo! Nothing was missing.<br /> Everything shone perfectly<br /> In its God-ordained place.</p>
