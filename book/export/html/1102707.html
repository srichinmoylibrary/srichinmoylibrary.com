<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is true that sometimes life is a divine Game; the good and bad in everybody comes to the fore and finally the good is victorious. Again, there is something called an attack by the undivine forces within or around us. After you leave here, somebody may come and snatch away your wallet. Is it karma or some wrong action on your part that caused you to be robbed? Far from it! You have prayed, you have meditated, you have done everything right. But there are many undivine forces around us, and no matter how spiritual or divine we are, they attack us. So we have to pray to God for constant protection.</p>
<p>With regard to the present-day political situation, it is not the intention of the Divine to let the forces fight it out so that out of evil good will come. At times we say that the divine Game is being played; that the Divine and undivine play and finally the Divine wins. But right now, it is not like that. The present-day wars are not God's intention; they are the product of human weaknesses.</p>
