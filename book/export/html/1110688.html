<p>If there is anything in us that is going to make God truly happy and truly proud of us, then it is our discipline. In our daily life-activities if we have discipline, then we are bound to get a most powerful Smile from God. If we are disciplined during the entire day, then in the evening when we meditate and imagine God, we will feel and see Godâ€™s brightest and most powerful Smile. A life of discipline God takes as our greatest achievement.</p>  </div>
