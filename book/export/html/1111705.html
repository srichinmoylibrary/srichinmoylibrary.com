<p>At one point during the marathon I was walking for a few metres. There was one man who asked me if I was all right. He kept asking, "Are you really all right?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am all right."</p>
<p>Then he was telling the people who were helping me, "He is all right, don't worry."</p>
<p>Then I started running, but he was still walking.</p>
