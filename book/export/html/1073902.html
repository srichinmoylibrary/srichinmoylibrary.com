<p>Suren did not have the key to the safe, so the night of the robbery he brought over the locksmith. The locksmith knew Ganapati’s family and liked them so much. He knew that Suren used to live at the bank during the week with Ganapati’s father and he trusted Suren.</p>
<p>Suren told the locksmith that Ganapati’s father wanted him to return immediately to the village with some of the jewellery so he could give it to someone. But, unfortunately, Suren said, he had misplaced the key to the safe.</p>
<p>So the locksmith opened the safe and went away. He was completely innocent. When he found out afterwards what had happened, he struck his head and chest with his hands over and over again!</p>  </div>
