<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I would like to offer you another present.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Oh, no! <em>(Sri Chinmoy presents Leonard Bernstein with the banner of the Meditation Group that he leads at the United Nations.)</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This what we do at the United Nations.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I am very happy to have this. This I have read. <em>(Introducing his daughter, Nina)</em> This is Olivier Greif, who is conducting them and who made an arrangement of Sri Chinmoy's song. How can I explain it? Oh, I am so happy! Wouldn't you like some drinks? How about some ginger ale? How about some soft drinks? All right, all soft drinks!</p>
<p><em>(The Singers perform the song once more.)</em></p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> This should be the greatest ego trip anybody had. But it is not the way I feel at all. I am not even that impressed by the lyrics, but I am so impressed by you all. You have turned my heart over! You all read music? You are incredible! You sound like an absolutely A-1 professional choir. I don't know if this is the result of meditating or the result of practice. I guess it is a combination of both. Incredible! I don't know how you do it. I am baffled. Very good!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy (while leaving):</em> We wish to invite you to the United Nations to our Meditation Group. Whenever you are free, I will be so deeply honoured if you could come to our Meditation Group.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I would love to. Have somebody tell me, and we will make a time.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When is your birthday?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> August 25th. I will be in Europe then.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When will you be back?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Not until October.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Before your birthday?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> In July I am in Tanglewood. I am teaching and conducting the Boston Symphony and I am teaching students.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Will the first week of August be possible?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> The first week I think I will be here.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Before your birthday we would like to observe your birthday. If you will be in New York at that time, our Meditation Group can observe it at the United Nations.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> That would be wonderful. Thank you.</p>  </div>
