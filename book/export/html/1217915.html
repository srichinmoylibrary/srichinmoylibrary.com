  <h1 class="book-heading">The seeker</h1>
  
 
<p>What am I? I am a climbing cry. Who am I? God’s ever-expanding sky.</p>
<p>The life of the advanced aspirant is an epitome of the pilgrimage of the human soul in search of the Ultimate Truth in the universe and beyond.</p>
<p>If you seek God in God's own ways, you will meet God as fulfilment. If you seek God in other ways, you will meet God as frustration.</p>
<p>God says to a sincere seeker that ignorance, no doubt, is in him, but not of him. Alone you are to know what you truly are. Alone you are to realise that you are your only help. Alone you opened your eyes upon earth. Alone you are to work out your own salvation. But your very existence is flooded with His infinite Grace.</p>
<p>An ordinary man must think logically and act sensibly to prove himself worth living. A spiritual seeker must think intuitively and act divinely to prove himself worth living.</p>
<p>A bridge of steel spans a mighty river. And what is needed to build that bridge? A combination of a creative brain and a vast mathematical knowledge. A bridge of sacrifice spans Heaven and Earth. And what is needed to build that bridge? A combination of God's Compassion and the seeker's aspiration.</p>
<p>A sincere seeker of Truth has three inseparable friends: Peace, Faith and Receptivity. Peace says to him: “I shall show you that there is nothing but God.” Faith says: “I shall make you see God within you.” Receptivity says: “What else is God if not all your life?”</p>
<p>Daring and Achieving are the two inseparable blessings of Heaven for the seekers of Truth.</p>
<p>We want to hear a soul-stirring song, no matter if it is sung just for a minute. Likewise we need a godlike life to raise our consciousness into the Supreme, even if we do not see many winters on earth.</p>
<p>A spiritual seeker must know that austerity is an abnormality inasmuch as it is a disturbance of the natural balance of forces in the different parts of our consciousness. Austerity does not give self-mastery. In true detachment is the real self-mastery. Earth has temptations for an ordinary man. Heaven has temptations for an advanced seeker.</p>
<p>Experience is the open and conscious eye of a seeker. Realisation is the all-seeing eye of a Yogi. To have an experience of truth is to discover at long last an oasis in the desert of life.</p>
<p>“France has more need of me than I of France,” said Napoleon. Likewise the world has more need of a realised soul than he of the world.</p>
