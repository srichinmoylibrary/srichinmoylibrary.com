<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul is subtler than the subtlest, finer than the finest and, at the same time, larger than the largest. This is the description of the soul that you get in the <em>Gita</em> and also in our sacred Upanishads. This truth can be seen, felt and realised when we meditate.</p>
<p>The soul is the representative of God here on earth, a spark of God. God the Omniscient, the Omnipotent, the Omnipresent is one; but here in this world of multiplicity each soul represents a different aspect of God's multiplicity. When the soul takes human shape, it tries first to create possibilities and then inevitabilities. Then the soul tries to manifest the truth that it has already achieved. It sees the world of ignorance and tries to transform this ignorance into knowledge and wisdom.</p>
<p>There is an unmanifested Self, which we call <em>Purusha,</em> and again, there is a manifested Self. The Self that is going to manifest on earth through the soul is called <em>Prakriti</em>. <em>Purusha</em> is not indifferent, but it will always remain on the highest transcendental level of Consciousness. And the other Self <em>Prakriti,</em> will take part in the Cosmic Game through the individual soul.</p>
<p>When we become one with our soul, we enter into infinite Peace and Bliss â€” the highest Consciousness, which we call <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda</em>. This is the triple Consciousness, where Existence, Consciousness and Bliss come together. When we live in the soul, eventually we enter into this triple Consciousness.</p>  </div>
