<p>One day a great seeker was praying and meditating at the foot of a tree. All of a sudden, without any rhyme or reason, a hooligan came and struck him mercilessly, leaving him unconscious. In a few minutes' time, a friend of his happened to pass by. When he saw the seeker lying unconscious, he was simply shocked. Immediately he found a doctor, who brought the seeker back to his senses. They asked him who had struck him so badly, and he said, "He who struck me has cured me and is now nursing me."</p>
<p>His friend said, "Even at this hour you are cutting jokes! You were beaten mercilessly, you were unconscious. Why can't you tell the truth?"</p>
<p>But the seeker only said, "I know the person who struck me is the same one who cured me and is now nursing me."</p>
<p>In a few minutes' time, two policemen came dragging the hooligan in chains. They were positive that he was the one who had beaten the seeker. "This is the man. We are sure. You just confirm it," they said.</p>
<p>The seeker said, "What are you doing? Why are you torturing this poor man? The body is the temple of God. If you strike and smash the temple, how can God remain inside? Please, O policemen, let him go. I don't want God's temple to be tortured and destroyed by you. I will feel miserable if you do anything more to this temple.</p>
<p>"It was God who punished me through him and again it was God who cured me. It is also God who is crying through you for justice. But of all the Gods, I like best the compassionate God. Therefore, please let him go. I am happy in my forgiveness, so you be happy by becoming one with God's Will in me."</p>
