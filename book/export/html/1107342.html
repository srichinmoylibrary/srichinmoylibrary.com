<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Collection is forbidden at all my Centres. When I go to Britain, if I ask them first for food stamps and then I tell them I am going to give them Peace, Light and Bliss, they will just turn away. Fortunately, I do have sincere, devoted students who meet with my outer expenses and my outer needs. I meet with their inner needs. I help them in their meditation.</p>  </div>
