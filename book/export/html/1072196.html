<p>The role of art and creativity in human life has intrigued man from time immemorial. In this volume of questions and answers, Sri Chinmoy discusses art from the highest spiritual point of view. As an illumined Yogi with access to the highest artistic planes, Sri Chinmoy is able to offer a kind of light rarely found in discussions of the subject.</p>
<p>He takes the reader beyond all mental and philosophical formulations to a world seldom seen and rarely, if ever, described. He takes the reader on a journey into the inner world where creativity first begins. He takes the reader to the world where art exists in seed form before it is ever manifested in the physical. This, then, is not really a book at all. It is more like an opening to a deeper, more sublime reality ... to a higher, more subtle plane of consciousness.</p>  </div>
