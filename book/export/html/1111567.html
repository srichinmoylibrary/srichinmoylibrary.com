<p>Just before the four-mile run started, I was unfortunately standing beside a man who was very hostile. While Tarak was giving instructions to the runners, the man said, "Stop chirping!"</p>
<p>When Tarak asked for one minute of silence, the man said, "What nonsense!"</p>
<p>This same man finished far behind me in the race.</p>
