<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> When I devotedly pray<br /> and soulfully meditate,<br /> I can clearly see that my life is<br /> an open book to You.<br /> But alas, no matter how hard I try<br /> to know about<br /> Your earthly life and Heavenly life,<br /> I sadly fail.<br /> Therefore I am begging You to be kind to me<br /> And share some of Your secrets.<br /> My child,<br /> I shall comply with your request<br /> But I do not know whether My secrets<br /> Will make you happy or unhappy.<br /> Anyway, I leave it up to you.<br /> My secret number one:<br /> Each time your desiring mind<br /> Defeats your aspiring heart,<br /> I cry and cry.<br /> My secret number two:<br /> When you dine with your mind-doubts<br /> And starve your heart-faith,<br /> I cry and cry.<br /> My secret number three:<br /> Each time you do not allow your heart<br /> To fulfil its Heaven-climbing promises,<br /> I cry and cry.<br /> My secret number four:<br /> Each time you do not allow your soul to fulfil<br /> Its Heaven-manifesting promises on earth,<br /> I cry and cry.<br /> My secret number five:<br /> When your life-boat plies<br /> Between your depression-vital-shore<br /> And your frustration-mind-shore,<br /> I cry and cry.<br /> My secret number six:<br /> When you become the most intimate friend<br /> Of your body's idleness<br /> and your mind's unwillingness,<br /> I cry and cry.<br /> My Lord Supreme,<br /> I don't know why I suddenly feel so tired<br /> and sleepy.<br /> It seems that You have literally<br /> endless secrets.<br /> Yes, my child. I do.<br /> Then,<br /> My Lord, some other day<br /> I shall definitely hear more of Your secrets.<br /> My child, My child, wait, wait.<br /> Only one more secret I wish to share<br /> with you<br /> Before you fall asleep.<br /> This time, I am blessing you<br /> with My topmost secret:<br /> You are My Today's Self-Transcendence-Dream<br /> And My Tomorrow's Self-Perfection-Satisfaction-Reality.<br /> My Lord Supreme,<br /> I am fast asleep.<br /> I cannot hear You anymore.<br /> My child, I am still fully awake.<br /> I shall do everything for you.<br /> You enjoy your sweet sleep.</p>
