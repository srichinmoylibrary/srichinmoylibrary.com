<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not necessary to change the Member States in order to change the organisation or structure of the United Nations. One may call the Member States a closed circuit and, from a particular point of view, one may be justified in saying so. But if we see the situation from a different angle, then we can say that when there is a large body or group, within it there has to be a smaller body to organise everything. If all the countries were equal and everybody held the same status, then there would be no organisation. In a classroom there is one teacher and many students. This kind of hierarchy is not a matter of the strong lording it over the weak; it is only an organisational necessity. If we build a house, we need an architect and also a few workers. If everybody does the job of the architect, then there will be no workers to build the house.</p>
<p>In an organisation as big as the United Nations, some countries have to shoulder more responsibility than other countries, so naturally they will have a greater voice. If everybody became king, there would be no subjects. I am not saying that certain Member States are kings; only that some should come forward to show light to others. If everybody had light, then earth would be Heaven itself. But this is not the case. Some countries do have more light than others. Again, even the countries with more light should become more sympathetic and develop greater oneness with the countries that have less light. That would be the ideal situation.</p>  </div>
