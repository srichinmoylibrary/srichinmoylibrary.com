<p><em>During a function at P.S. 86 in Queens that evening, Sri Chinmoy offered the champion athlete his spiritual name: ‘Sudhahota.’ First he placed his hand on the athlete’s heart, chanting ‘Sudhahota’ four times, and then he gave the meaning of the Bengali name: “Unparalleled sacrificer of Immortality’s Nectar-Delight.” As part of the ceremony, Sri Chinmoy sang a song which he had written for Sudhahota, accompanying himself on the harmonium.</em></p>

<p>Sudhahota Sudhahota Sudhahota Sudhahota<br /> Dharanir ankhi nir samapti mahatrata<br /> Sutibra gati dhara pabitra hiya tara<br /> Ucchhas uttal he nabik taba pal<br /> Antare chira tare spriha bhanu durbar<br /> Jaya jaya nartan duniyar patakar</p>


<p>O unparalleled sacrificer of Immortality’s<br /> Nectar-Delight,<br /> O liberator supreme,<br /> In you is the complete halt of earth’s<br /> streaming tears.<br /> O fastest speed of the Beyond,<br /> Yours is the heart flooded with purity-stars.<br /> O divine pilot, your life-boat is sailing<br /> With Eternity’s Himalayan aspiration-height.<br /> Indomitable is the inspiration-sun<br /> of your inner world!<br /> Victory, victory, victory to you!<br /> You are the dance of the world’s victory-banner.</p>
