<p>"My child, then give Me a soulful promise."</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, I do not know what a soulful promise is. I promise in season and out of season, but never do I fulfil my promises. Such being the case, my Lord Supreme, please tell me what I can offer You instead of a soulful promise.</p>
<p>"My child, then tell Me that you will love Me divinely."</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, I do not know what divine Love is. How can I offer You divine Love when I do not know what divine Love feels like?</p>

<p>Alas, my Lord Supreme, I do not cry even for myself. How do You expect me to cry for You?</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">What is a miracle?</h1>
  
 
<p>What is a miracle? A miracle is an unusual incident. A miracle is either an illumining or an exciting experience. A miracle is either a happy smile or an unhappy cry of nature.</p>
<p>I am a seeker. I am a God-lover. I pray and meditate every day. That means I have chosen God to be my eternal Pilot, and God has chosen me to be eternally His own. That means I am part and parcel of divinity. Such being the case, how is it possible for me to become jealous? How is it possible for me to become insecure? How is it possible for me to become impure? To become jealous, insecure or impure — is this not an unhappy miracle, a deplorable miracle, that I perform every day?</p>
<p>I am an insignificant human being. For years and years I have cherished my friendship with teeming doubts. But now I have a new friend: a blossoming faith. For me to transform my life of doubt into a life of faith-is this not a miracle, a happy miracle?</p>
<p>Desire-life was my favourite reality. But now aspiration-life has become my favourite reality, my only reality. Is this not a miracle?</p>
<p>I am not even six feet tall. Yet I am praying to the Absolute Supreme to reach His infinite Height, which is far beyond even my imagination's flight. For me to long to grow into that Height — is this not a miracle?</p>
<p>I am mortal. My thoughts, my deeds, my experiences — everything that I have and everything that I am — represent mortality. Yet despite everything that I have and everything that I am, I am longing for Immortality. Is this not a miracle?</p>
<p>If I enter into friendship with ignorance, if I become a friend of jealousy, meanness, insecurity and impurity, then I must feel that I am performing deplorable miracles day in and day out.</p>
<p>Again, when I feel one with humanity, when I think of vastness, luminosity, oneness and God-Satisfaction in God's own Way, then at that time also I am performing miracles, supreme miracles.</p>
<p>It is up to me whether to play the role of an ignorant weakling or an all-knowing God-man, whether to perform deplorable miracles or divine miracles.</p>
<p>If I unreservedly and unconditionally love my Beloved Supreme, if I soulfully cry to realise Him, then there can be no greater miracle. As an unaspiring human being, I care for humanity's appreciation and admiration. But if I change my desire-life into aspiration-life and cry only for God — to please Him in His own Way, to manifest Him in His own Way sleeplessly — then in God's Eye I am the supremely chosen miracle-performer.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1072831" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">I shall no longer allow</h1>
  
 

<p>Body, my stupid body,<br /> I shall no longer allow you<br /> To have an inordinate hunger.</p>
<p>Vital, my shameless vital,<br /> I shall no longer allow you<br /> To have an insatiable thirst.</p>
<p>Mind, my clever mind,<br /> I shall no longer allow myself<br /> To fall under the sweep of your arguments.</p>
<p>Heart, my hopeless heart,<br /> I shall no longer allow you<br /> To remain timidity incarnate.</p>
<p>Soul, my former friend,<br /> I shall no longer allow you<br /> To remain indifferent towards me.</p>
<p>God, my bountiful God,<br /> I shall no longer allow myself<br /> To remain unconscious<br /> Of Your Compassion-Sky.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1072832" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Superiority</h1>
  
 
<p>Superiority, my superiority, why are you so cruel to me? Why do you make me always sad and mad? Do you not realise that because of you, at every moment I am assailed by the fear that someone is going to dethrone me and take away my crown?</p>
<p>Why do I have to be always in the world of darkening, threatening and killing fear? I want joy at every moment, and this joy I can never get from you. The fleeting joy that I get from sitting an inch higher than the rest of the world disappears when I see the arrows of jealousy, meanness, anger and frustration that others hurl at me. The joy I get by becoming a little bit superior to others is insignificant in comparison to the suffering I then go through. I need abiding happiness, and this happiness I can never get from you, O superiority.</p>
<p>I do not need and I do not want inferiority, either. Inferiority always kills me with sorrow, despondency, fear, doubt and meanness. In the battlefield of life inferiority sometimes gives way and surrenders helplessly to superiority, thinking that it is a hopeless case to fight against it any more. Willingly or unwillingly inferiority serves superiority. Inferiority unconsciously wants to remain where it is, while superiority never, never wants to come down to the level of inferiority or allow inferiority to be on the same footing. Superiority fights until the last moment to maintain its supremacy. It never wants to give up its pedestal.</p>
<p>O superiority, I do not need you and I do not want you. O inferiority, I do not need you and I do not want you. O equality, I need you and I want you desperately and sleeplessly. I will need you until the divine Hour dawns when I know consciously what God's Will is. Once I know precisely what God's Will is and once I can cheerfully and unconditionally execute God's Will, then in my life of aspiration and dedication there can be no such thing as superiority or inferiority. When I am all oneness with the universal and transcendental Will of my Beloved Supreme, happiness will reign supreme in my heart of aspiration and in my life of dedication.</p>
<p>O superiority, O inferiority, if I stay with you, far will I have to go. And even at the end of my journey, I will see that I have not gone anywhere, for with superiority and inferiority I have no real goal. But if I start with equality, there shall come a time when God's Oneness-Reality will come and lead me, guide me and take me to my destined goal. It is from equality that I will enter into God's Oneness-Reality, and there I will have constant peace, constant satisfaction and constant love for the poor earth and the rich Heaven.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">My advice to my Beloved Supreme</h1>
  
 
<p>My dear Supreme, my sweet Supreme, my Beloved Supreme, I talk too much, too much, too much. My Eternity's Supreme, how is it and why is it that You do not change my nature? How and why?</p>
<p>Not only do I talk too much; what is worse, I literally die for a listening ear. And as if that were not enough, I also want to give advice to each and every soul on earth, with no exception.</p>
<p>When I give advice, I expect appreciation and admiration from everybody. I expect everybody to extol me to the skies. Alas, nobody pays any heed to my advice. Nobody needs or appreciates my advice. Yet I go on talking and talking, giving advice to each and every human being on earth.</p>
<p>I also advise the members of my earthly existence — my body, vital, mind and heart. But they do not listen to me either. I even advise my soul. I advise my soul-bird not to leave this beautiful cage called the body, for if it leaves this cage, then I shall die. I want to be immortal. I want to remain on earth forever and forever.</p>
<p>I even dare to advise You, my Beloved Supreme. Lord, O my Eternity's Lord Supreme, I know You have many names, whereas I have but one name. Since it is not fair for You to have many names while I have only one, I beg of You to have only one name. If You cannot agree to my proposal, if You do not listen to my advice, then please have only two names. More than two names I do not want You to have, especially for me. Your two names will be Compassion-Sun and Forgiveness-Ocean. When I need compassion, I shall call You Compassion-Sun. When I need forgiveness, I shall can You Forgiveness-Ocean. These are the two names I would like You to have from now on. All Your other names will no longer be used by me.</p>
<p>O my dear Supreme, O my Lord Supreme, I have advised You time and again. Now is the time for me to beg You to grant me a most special boon. I do not want to remain an idle talker any more. I wish to become an active doer. Finally, I would like to become a selfless lover. Then I shall love You with my self-giving heart, with my self-giving life and with my self-giving oneness-existence.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Indifference</h1>
  
 
<p>Indifference reigns supreme in my life.</p>
<p>My body is indifferent to the dynamic urge of my vital. My vital is indifferent to the well-earned rest of my body.</p>
<p>My mind is indifferent to the soulful cry of my heart. My heart is indifferent to the inquisitive quest of my mind.</p>
<p>My soul is indifferent to the slow efforts, slower success and even slower progress of my life.</p>
<p>Even my Beloved Supreme, it seems, is indifferent to my supreme realisation. Had He flooded my entire being with His Concern supreme, I am sure I would not have been waiting for millennia for my realisation.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O my Beloved Supreme, do tell me why You are indifferent to me, and why the rest of the members of my family are indifferent to one another.</p>
<p>"My sweet child, I am not indifferent to you. Dive deep within and you will see that constant Concern is My only name.</p>
<p>"And about your body, vital, mind, heart and soul, I wish to tell you that they can be freed from the fatal disease of indifference only by using the medicine oneness-concern. When oneness-concern plays its role within and without, satisfaction at every moment shall loom large in your life. At that time the indifference-blow will be found nowhere. Only the oneness-flow will be found all-where."</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Independence</h1>
  
 
<p>Independence, independence, independence!</p>
<p>The human in me thinks that it is dependent on the persons it agrees with. It thinks that it loses its independence as soon as it sees eye to eye with others.</p>
<p>The divine in me thinks otherwise. It thinks that when it agrees with others, it enlarges its vision and establishes firmly its oneness with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The human in me feels that it loses its independence the moment it takes something from others or even expects something from others.</p>
<p>The divine in me feels otherwise. The divine in me feels that God's creation is for give and take. Give what you have and take what you need, for there is only one common Source, and that Source is God. This moment God is playing the role of the Giver through me, and the next moment He is playing the role of the Receiver through me. It is all oneness-game.</p>
<p>The human in me thinks that it loses its independence as soon as it starts thinking of others, whether they are good or bad. It feels the supreme necessity of thinking only of itself and not of anybody or anything else, because it feels that nothing belongs to it.</p>
<p>The divine in me feels otherwise. The divine in me thinks, feels and knows that the moment it thinks of God, it creates a thought-world that is the precursor of an action-world. Once we have established a reality in the thought-world, then the next step is to bring that reality into the action-world for manifestation. In our action-life only can we have true satisfaction.</p>
<p>The divine in me knows that there is and there can be no such thing as independence. It is all dependence, and inside dependence what looms large is the message of constant oneness. God gives us what He has-His Compassion. We give God what we have — our love. God gives us what He is — His Goodness. We give God what we truly are — our aspiration to become greater.</p>
<p>We depend on God for His Compassion. God depends on us for His Manifestation. This kind of dependence is actually mutual oneness playing different roles at different times, for constant satisfaction and constant perfection, for constant perfection and constant satisfaction.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Grievances</h1>
  
 

<p>Alas, alas, alas!<br /> Grievances reign supreme in my life.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against my ignorance-night.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against my darkness-depth.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against my illusion-life.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against my frustration-body.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against my aggression-vital.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against my confusion-mind.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against my hesitation-heart.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against the idleness-promises<br /> Of my soul.<br /> I have a grievance<br /> Against the fruitlessness-dreams<br /> Of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, alas!<br /> O my Beloved Supreme,<br /> Do tell me how I can free myself<br /> From the tyranny of grievances.<br /> "My child,<br /> You can free yourself<br /> From the tyranny of grievances<br /> If you can once and for all feel<br /> That we all love you —<br /> Your body, vital, mind, heart, soul<br /> And I love you.<br /> It is your feeling of conscious oneness<br /> With us<br /> That can easily free you<br /> From your teeming grievances against us.<br /> Try, My child, try;<br /> You will succeed.<br /> Yours will be the abiding peace,<br /> Illumining light,<br /> Nourishing delight<br />     And<br /> Fulfilling satisfaction."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Why am I so unhappy?</h1>
  
 

<p>My Supreme Lord,<br /> Why am I so unhappy?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> You are unhappy because<br /> Your body is afraid of everything.<br /> You are unhappy because<br /> Your vital complains about everything.<br /> You are unhappy because<br /> Your mind wants everything<br /> To be explained.<br /> You are unhappy because<br /> Your heart does not trust anything."</p>
<p>My Supreme Lord,<br /> How can I be happy?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> You can be happy easily,<br /> Effectively and permanently<br /> If you can think and feel<br /> That you are of<br /> The transcendentally beautiful Reality,<br /> God,<br /> And that you are for<br /> The universally fruitful Reality, God."</p>

<p>There was a time when my Lord Supreme<br /> Came to me with His Forgiveness<br /> In infinite measure.<br /> Alas, soon He came to realise<br /> That I did not deserve His Forgiveness.<br /> Therefore, He was compelled to withdraw<br /> His Forgiveness.</p>

<p>Now my Lord Supreme says to me,<br /> "O useless seeker,<br /> From now on I shall come to you<br /> With My Justice-Light,<br /> Which is, indeed, another way<br /> Of expressing My Concern for you.</p>
<p>"But if you fail even this time,<br /> Then I am going to use<br /> My most powerful weapon:<br /> My Indifference.<br /> Of all My weapons,<br /> My Indifference is by far<br /> The most destructive.<br /> Be careful, be careful, be careful,<br /> O useless seeker!"</p>
