<p>Poor God, unillumined men always take You amiss. They think that You are merciless. Yet when You fulfil their desires, they think that nobody on earth can surpass You in stupidity.</p>
<p>Now, poor man, look at your most deplorable fate! In the apt words of George Bernard Shaw, "There are two tragedies in life. One is not to get your heart's desire; the other is to get it."</p>
<p>Desire means anxiety. This anxiety finds satisfaction only when it is able to fulfil itself through solid attachment. Aspiration means calmness. This calmness finds satisfaction only when it is able to express itself through all-seeing and all-loving detachment.</p>  </div>
