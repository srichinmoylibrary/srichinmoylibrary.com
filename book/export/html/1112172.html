<p>When I was ready to go out walking the day before yesterday, it was quite dark. But I did not turn on the porch light when I put on my shoes. As a result, on my left foot I put a Nike shoe and on my right foot I put something else. Believe it or not, a shoe not only has a sole but also a soul. The soul of one shoe was telling me, "I will hurt you if you wear me." It was addressing me very devotedly.</p>
<p>I asked, "Why?"</p>
<p>The soul said, "Look at your shoes."</p>
<p>When I looked, I saw that I had two different kinds of shoes on. One was already starting to hurt because it was new. The right one was perfect, but the left one was the wrong shoe. So I went back and put on another shoe.</p>
<p>On that day I walked four miles, so definitely the shoe would have hurt me.</p>
