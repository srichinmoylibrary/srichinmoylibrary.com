<p>Dear Sri Chinmoy,<br /> My mother, my husband and I would like to thank you for the copies of “Meditation at the United Nations.” It was so beautiful, and we are deeply moved by the warmth and affection you have shown towards my father. We will always be grateful for your kind words and will always treasure these issues.</p>
<p>We also want you to know that daddy had great respect for your spiritual leadership, and we send our best wishes for your continued success in helping for a better mankind.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Aye Aye Myint-U</p>
<p>P S We would be very happy to receive a few more issues of the bulletin to send to friends in Burma. Thank you.</p>  </div>
