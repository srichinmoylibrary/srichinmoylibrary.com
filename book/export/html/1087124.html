<p>While I was shopping in Ft. Lauderdale, I saw a bookmark. It was a most ordinary-looking card that only said, "Dear God, I like you," but it cost $1.25. Then I saw another card that cost $2.25. It said, "Dear God, do You really care for me?"</p>
<p>I don't think even sincere God-seekers who believe in God will spend so much money for a bookmark, unless they live in the depression-world.</p>
