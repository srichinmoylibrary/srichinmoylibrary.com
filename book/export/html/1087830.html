<p>DATABIR: Nirvik, Nirvik, get up! Guru wants you to go to his place! And do you know what?</p>
<p>NIRVIK: No, what, Databir?</p>
<p>DATABIR: Guru said that since you have massaged his legs for so long, you are getting a promotion. You can now massage his head!</p>
<p>NIRVIK: Oh, really?</p>
<p>DATABIR: Yes! But Guru said that that you must start with his shoulders. You must shoulder his countless and deathless responsibilities before getting your promotion!</p>  </div>
