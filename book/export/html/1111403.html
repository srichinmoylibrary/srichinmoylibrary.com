<p>Today I compelled the members of my road crew to run with me at a ten-minute pace. I was barking at them when they went faster.</p>
<p>The other day we ran first a nine, then an eight and a half, then an eight, then a seven-forty-five and, finally, a seven-thirty pace. I tell them the pace, and they go on, go on.</p>
