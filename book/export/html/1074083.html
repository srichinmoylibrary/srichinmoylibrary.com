<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We must know that Lord Sri Krishna tried his very best to avert the war. He went three times to the Kauravas to plead with them not to have the war. The Battle of Kurukshetra was a last resort. Sri Krishna's message was love, universal love, but when the enemies are unwilling either to compromise or to have an amicable feeling, then what can one do?</p>  </div>
