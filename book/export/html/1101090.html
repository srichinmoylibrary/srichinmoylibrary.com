<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. Australia is bound to play a most significant role in the comity of nations, because Australia has not yet played its supreme role. Its soul is new; it has not yet got the opportunity to muster all its light for its manifestation. Australia's body is old, but the soul is new. The body is very strong, stout and solid, experienced. So when the soul musters all its divine potentialities, capacities, realities and divinities, the soul will manifest most powerfully. There definitely shall come time at God's Choice Hour when the soul of Australia will be able to manifest all its unique, unprecedented capacities through the body of Australia. Australia is bound to play a most significant role in the comity of nations; it is only a matter of time. Nobody can deny it, but until the Hour strikes everybody can deny it. Even one minute before the Hour strikes, the whole world can deny it. But when it is done, nobody can deny it.</p>  </div>
