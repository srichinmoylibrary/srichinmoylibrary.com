<p>My Japanese friend said:<br /> "Do you believe in God, Mr. Ghose?"</p>
<p>"I think I do."</p>
<p>"Mr. Ghose, I don't.<br /> But yesterday I believed in God.<br /> And today also, even now I am thinking of God.<br /> But tomorrow my mother comes back<br /> from the hospital, and then for me no God.<br /> I need no God!"</p>
<p>"My dear friend,<br /> God will never remain indebted to you.<br /> Two long days and nights you thought of God.<br /> No joke!<br /> Now it is God who needs must think of you.<br /> At least for two fleeting years,<br /> rest assured, He will."</p>
