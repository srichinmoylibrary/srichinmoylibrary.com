<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A teacher is not a slave-driver. A teacher is an ignorance-transformer, a knowledge-revealer and a wisdom-fulfiller. One can listen unconditionally to one's teacher if one can make oneself feel that the teacher has no ulterior motive. If we can feel that the teacher is teaching out of sheer joy, out of sheer love, out of sheer concern, then one can easily listen to him unconditionally.</p>  </div>
