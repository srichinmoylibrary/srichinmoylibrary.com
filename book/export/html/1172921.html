  <h1 class="book-heading">1. A new marathon</h1>
  
 

<p>Who am I?<br /> A completely long lost tornado-speed.<br /> Yesterday my supremely unco-operative body<br /> Ran the New York Marathon.<br /> The lightning-arrows of anxieties<br /> And worries did not attack me.<br /> I must say, they have<br /> Always<br /> Been very kind to me.<br /> They do not knock at my heart's door.<br /> No, not even by mistake!<br /> But cramps,<br /> My unfailing friends, came and<br /> Shook hands with me gently<br /> Even before I had covered eleven miles.<br /> Usually they come to befriend me<br /> At the eighteenth mile.<br /> But this time, after fifteen miles,<br /> They desired to lavish<br /> Infinitely more affection on me.<br /> So they embraced me most avidly<br /> And most powerfully.<br /> Alas, alas!<br /> From fifteen miles on,<br /> I dragged my ill-fated body,<br /> At times with my compassion-smiles,<br /> At times with my frustration-cries.<br /> To my great joy and sublime relief,<br /> The worst possible nightmare<br /> Finally ended<br /> At the end of twenty-six miles.</p>
<p>One marathon-world<br /> Leads me into another marathon-world.<br /> To satisfy this new marathon-world,<br /> Or to be satisfied by this new one, will be<br /> Infinitely — I really mean it —<br /> More difficult.<br /> For here it is not just twenty-six miles<br /> and 385 yards to run,<br /> But to sow the seeds<br /> Of ten thousand flaming flower-poems<br /> Which at long last I shall place<br /> Devotedly, unreservedly and unconditionally<br /> At the Compassion-Feet<br /> Of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
