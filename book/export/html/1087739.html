  <h1 class="book-heading">Receptivity</h1>
  
 
<p>It is through identification of one's will with the divine Will that receptivity automatically increases. Receptivity is something elastic. If you make yourself like an elastic band, then your spiritual Master can pull you, expand you. We know that the capacity of an elastic band is limited. But again, if someone pulls the band, it can be expanded.</p>
<p>If there is no receptivity, then we cannot give anything to mankind. I tell my disciples, "If you do not have the capacity to receive, then how can I give you Peace, Light, Bliss and other divine qualities?" How many people are really receptive when I concentrate and meditate on them? Out of four hundred persons, perhaps twenty will receive what I offer. And the same persons do not receive every day; today, this twenty may receive; tomorrow, another twenty; and so on. Before our realisation, when we do not know our Self, our problem is smaller. But when we discover our Self, when we understand our Self, when we know our Self, when we realise our highest Self, at that time the real problem starts: how shall we help mankind? At that time, if it is God's Will, we have to give, whether mankind accepts our offering or not.</p>  </div>
