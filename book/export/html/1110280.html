<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you hate these thoughts, you are feeding their desire for attention and importance and they will constantly come and bother you. Either you have to transform them or you have to feel that they are not part and parcel of your life. If ignorance and darkness are not totally transformed, they will always remain your enemies. But by hating ignorance or darkness, you can never transform them. If you do not have the capacity to transform them right now, you can save the situation by feeling that you don't belong to them and they don't belong to you. If you continually hate your enemy, your enemy will not leave you alone. He will constantly come and attack you.</p>
<p>Hating will never bring you nearer to your goal. You have to either transform or reject ignorance, the enemy. You can do it if you try!</p>  </div>
