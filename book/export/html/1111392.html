<p>In my latest racing adventure in Prospect Park — a two-mile race — I got the first prize because there was no competition in the Masters' category. There was a group of people who were excellent runners ahead of me. But not even one girl was ahead of me. Behind me were other runners.</p>
<p>Danny knows how to flatter me, and I am full of receptivity for his flattery. Recently, he videotaped a race for half an hour, but he taped only three seconds of my running. So I scolded him.</p>
<p>This time, he wanted to show more of me running, and less of others. So, at the finish line, he video-taped all the runners ahead of me. But, according to Danny, behind me nobody existed! Danny showed that I was the last runner!</p>
