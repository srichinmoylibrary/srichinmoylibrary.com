<p>Jan. 9, 1975</p>
<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>I want to thank you and your Guru for having me at the luncheon for the mothers and sons. I enjoyed very much being there with all the other mothers.</p>
<p>The talk by Sri Chinmoy was very inspiring.</p>
<p>One thing makes me extremely happy: that you are in good company; with good people, especially in the world of today.</p>
<p>I appreciated Sri Chinmoy's gift, but it is not the gift but the atmosphere in which it was given: the girls â€” everyone was nice.</p>
<p>I must say I missed A.</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>Mom</p>
<p>(Mrs. Paulette Neumann)</p>  </div>
