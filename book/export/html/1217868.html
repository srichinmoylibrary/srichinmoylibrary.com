  <h1 class="book-heading">Delight</h1>
  
 
<p>Delight is the source of existence. Delight is the meaning of existence. Delight is the language of infinity, eternity and immortality.</p>
<p>Delight was our inner past. Delight is our inner present. Delight shall be our inner future. No matter if our outer mind understands not, or cares not to understand this self-revealing truth.</p>
<p>Delight is not satisfaction of the mind, the vital and the body. It is something deeper, higher and purer. Delight needs no outer help for its existence. It is self-existent, self-revealing and self-fulfilling.</p>
<p>Delight is the divine bridge between Peace and Power, between Light and Truth, between God's unmanifested Dream and His manifested Reality.</p>
<p>The aggressive, dynamic and apparently conquering vital excitement is not Delight. Delight is surcharged with a creative consciousness which is at once energising, fulfilling and fulfilled.</p>
<p>High, higher and highest is the plane of Delight. With our illumined consciousness, we rise into that plane and become self-enraptured. We are now one with the Supreme, having crossed the corridors of sublime silence and trance.</p>
<p>In Delight alone can an aspirant be true to his inmost self. In Delight alone can he feel and understand what God is like. Men speak of God twenty-four hours a day, but not even for a fleeting second do they feel Him, not to speak of understanding Him. If the outer life of an individual can swim in the sea of his soul's Delight, then only will he feel God's Presence, and understand Him in His cosmic Vision and absolute Reality.</p>
<p>God and I are One when I reach Him through Delight in the plane of Delight. God is the whole, and I am a portion of His when I reach Him through my soul's Delight. God is the Boatman and I am the Boat when I reach God through Delight here on earth.</p>  </div>
