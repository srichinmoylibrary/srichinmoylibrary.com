<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First let us deal with the questioning mind. You may say, "I question because I don't understand. I want to understand." But you have to know that the questioning mind is the precursor of the doubting mind. You do not stop with the questioning mind. Today you question someone, tomorrow you doubt him. Again, just because you doubt, you question. So it is better not to have a questioning mind. You can have a searching mind. With the searching mind, you are searching for the reality. That is good. But in the other case, either the questioning mind is the harbinger of the doubting mind or they are most intimate friends, bosom friends. Therefore they are very bad.</p>
<p>The accepting heart is always good. The Reality you accept, but ignorance you do not accept. If you accept what you see, then the soul inside the heart will reject what is to be rejected and transform what is to be transformed. You yourself don't reject anything; you just accept the reality as you see it. Let the soul reject whatever is to be rejected. Let the soul transform what is to be transformed. That is the right way always.</p>  </div>
