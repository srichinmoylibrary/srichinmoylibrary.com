<p>One day the black man at Bloomingdale’s post office was asking me to take a vitamin pill. I used to say vitamin with a short “i”. He was saying vitamin with a long “i” and I could not understand him at all. Then, all of a sudden, I realised what he was saying. “You mean vitamin!” I said, using my own pronunciation.</p>
<p>“Oh, you Indian!” he exclaimed.</p>  </div>
