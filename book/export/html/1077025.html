<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly! Aspiration always increases one’s capacity to remember dreams. But here we have to know what the connection is between aspiration and purification. The connection between the two is very simple. Aspiration tells us that God is within. Purification tells us that God is all around. Just as we increase our purification through aspiration, through purification we also increase our aspiration. When we give ourselves totally to God, our aspiration increases. When we receive from God devotedly, our purification increases.</p>  </div>
