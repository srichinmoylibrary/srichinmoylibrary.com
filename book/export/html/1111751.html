<p>After about five miles I walked so many times. Before I would start running, I would decide how far I would go before I would start walking again. When I reached that particular place, I would walk for 50 or 100 metres. Afterwards, it came to the point where I was walking 20 metres and running 20 metres. Such pain I had! Two young black boys were joking with me and telling me to run. Of course, they themselves were not running in the race. They were only watching.</p>
