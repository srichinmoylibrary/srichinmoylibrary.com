<p><em>Sister Patricia:</em> Do you think people see you as different from some of the other spiritual teachers?</p>
<p><em>Syandan:</em> There have been controversial sects coming into Australia, causing a commotion, and unfortunately a lot of the public have got a distorted view of spirituality because of this. It is very rare for them to be able to see a sincere Indian spiritual Master and read his books.</p>
<p><em>Bishop Kennedy:</em> I think it must be the essential simplicity which seems to attract them.</p>  </div>
