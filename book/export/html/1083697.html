<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on God's Will and choice. If the angels care for the pin, then God will place countless angels on the pin. But if they do not care for the pin, then He will not place even one on the pin. Here the pin is poor earth. If the angels care for suffering and helpless earth, then God will definitely send countless angels to help and accelerate the consciousness of the earth. If the angels don't care for the earth, then He will allow them to remain self-contained in their angel world.</p>  </div>
