<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each individual here, unfortunately, is subject right now to suffering, sorrow and painful experiences. When an individual achieves liberation by virtue of his aspiration, Peace, Light and Bliss enter into him. At that time he is free from the world of suffering and excruciating pangs. Today he has become liberated; tomorrow he will inspire somebody else to come out of the net of suffering. Then the following day, he and the second person will inspire a third person. So someone has to start the game. You come out of the ignorance-sea, which is full of pain and suffering. Then your own illumination will inspire others to come out of the ignorance-sea.</p>  </div>
