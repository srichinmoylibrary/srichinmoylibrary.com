<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We cannot communicate with others. Why? Because we cannot communicate with our soul or with our Inner Pilot. It is not in speech that we commune with our soul's light. We can commune with our soul through meditation. When we live in the sea of Light or in our soul's concern, it is all God and there is no necessity for outer communication. In the full perspective, we will remain unsuccessful in our outer communication if we do not begin with God.</p>  </div>
