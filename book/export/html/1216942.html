<p>While Databir was driving me to an Indian store the other day, he was playing a musical tape. For about two minutes I listened to the music and inwardly I was so moved. I said to myself, "How I wish I could play like that!"</p>
<p>Then I asked Databir, "Do you know the name of the person who is playing?" I was being sincere. There was no mischief behind my question.</p>
<p>Databir said, "Guru, it's your synthesizer tape."</p>
<p>I had never dreamed that I was the one playing. It was far beyond my remotest imagination. I didn't even recognise the instrument!</p>
<p>For another ten minutes I soulfully and devotedly listened to the tape with genuine admiration and rapt attention.</p>
