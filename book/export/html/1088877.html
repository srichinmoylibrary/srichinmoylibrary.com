<p>In the meantime, Sri Chinmoy, you've had a number of musicians as your students. People in our audience would be interested in knowing why you think musicians who were so involved in what might be considered the material life — drugs and things like that — may seek a Guru.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The answer is very simple. The things that they did before did not help them find the true divinity within themselves. They did not find what they were looking for, so they wanted to find a spiritual Master to help them.</p>  </div>
