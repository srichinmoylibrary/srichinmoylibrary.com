<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please imagine that you are on a kind of journey. Feel that either I you are in a boat or you are somewhere with other pilgrims. Always feel a movement in the chanting. Either you are going upward, forward or inward. When you say "Supreme," please feel that you are reaching a particular destination. Each time you chant, feel that you are transcending your goal.</p>  </div>
