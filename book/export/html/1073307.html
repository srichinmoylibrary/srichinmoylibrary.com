<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> Is it true<br /> That you used only one weapon,<br /> I mean, your compassion-weapon,<br /> While you were on earth?<br /> "Brother C,<br /> It is true.<br /> But I tell you,<br /> If I had lived on earth<br /> A few years more,<br /> Father would definitely<br /> Have asked me to use another weapon:<br /> His divine Justice-Weapon."</p>
