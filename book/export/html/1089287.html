<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good! Krishna and Arjuna have the very closest connection with each other. They are spiritual brothers. Arjuna signifies the inner instrument, and Krishna himself represents the Highest. So Krishna wants you to be a real divine, detached and surrendered instrument of the Supreme. To be Arjuna means to be the dearest, most effective, most faithful and devoted chosen instrument of God. And the voice that came from within means you identified yourself with Arjuna's consciousness. That is to say, you wanted to be as powerful, as devoted, as surrendered to your own Master as Arjuna was to Krishna.</p>  </div>
