<p>I would like to express my deepest gratitude for an enjoyable Sunday. My chief aim in life has always been to raise my children to be good Christians and to make them happy.</p>
<p>My daughter, by following the spiritual teachings of Sri Chinmoy, is at peace with herself and with the world. Could a mother ask for more for someone who means all the world to her?</p>
