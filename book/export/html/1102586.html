<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life, nothing is totally destroyed for good. If you feel destruction means that something is gone forever and that never again will you see its face, then you are mistaken. From the spiritual point of view, you have to know that destruction means the transformation of the limited consciousness into something vaster.</p>
