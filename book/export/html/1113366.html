    <title>Question: Guru, when I feel an undivine thought lowering my consciousness and I offer it to you, sometimes I feel a shivering sensation at the top of my spine and back of my head and then the thought is gone. Is this the thought actually leaving my consciousness?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Offering these thoughts to me is a very successful way of conquering them. Always throw them into me, me alone. When you throw your undivine thoughts into me, sometimes they may not actually leave your consciousness. But even if they do not actually leave, they are unnerved. They are frightened to death. If you continue throwing these undivine forces into me, then definitely there shall come a time when they all will either leave you or become totally transformed while they are inside you. It is like the transformation of night into day.</p>
<p>The most important thing right now is to be alert, conscious, sincere, devoted and self-giving to the supreme Cause. Then the Supreme in me, the Supreme in you, will do the needful. He will either cast aside the wrong forces or transform them into good, illumining and fulfilling forces.</p>  </div>
