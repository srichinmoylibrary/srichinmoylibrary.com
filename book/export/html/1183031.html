<p>She was a middle-aged woman. She had a brother who was very unkind to her or, to use her own word, belligerent. He used to strike her mercilessly, in season and out of season. As a last resort she came to the Master for help. The Master went to her house and had a long talk with her brother, and her brother solemnly promised the Master that he would not strike her anymore. Lo and behold, he kept his promise. The woman found that it was no longer necessary for her to come to the Master, for she had no other need which she wanted the Master to fulfil. She did not need God. What she needed was her sympathetic brother.</p>  </div>
