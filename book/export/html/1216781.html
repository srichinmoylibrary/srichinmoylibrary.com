<p>In San Francisco's Chinatown a man recognised me in the street. He said, "It's Sri Chinmoy! I can't believe this! I went to your concert last night. It was so beautiful." He was so happy and excited to see me.</p>
<p>The man was with a friend. He asked me to bless a coin that he had. So I put the coin in my right palm and meditated on it — not for one second, but very seriously, very powerfully I blessed his coin. He was so moved and grateful.</p>
<p>When he saw me on the stage I was wearing my Indian clothes. In Chinatown I was wearing a track suit, but he still recognised me. This man was very nice. When people are nice to me, I try to be nice to them.</p>
