    <title>Question: I see reports quite often about serious problems with overpopulation. In terms of all the new souls that are coming to earth and all the other plants and animals that are gradually evolving into human beings, will there be enough room for all these souls to incarnate and evolve?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Have you forgotten that you and I will die one day? Souls are all the time coming and going. It is like a shuttle. Tomorrow you are going to Boston and a few days later you will come back. Like this, the soul is taking incarnation and then, after playing its role successfully or unsuccessfully, it is going back. Then new souls are coming.</p>  </div>
