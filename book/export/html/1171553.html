SCA 1066-1071. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 6 January 1988 at the Ambarrukmo Palace Hotel in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, during a television interview.</p>
<h2>Question: What brings you and your students to Indonesia, especially to Yogyakarta?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have come here to see the beautiful scenery of Yogyakarta, and also I have a very special feeling for Borobudur. Lord Buddha comes from India, and I have a very special admiration and adoration for him. He is for all mankind. So I would like to go and pay my homage to the Lord Buddha at Borobudur.</p>  </div>
