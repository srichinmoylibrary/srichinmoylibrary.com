<p>When I reached the turnaround point in our four-mile race, I saw that Kumuda was behind me. My ego became so big and my chest expanded. But Karabi, her sister-in-law, was no good. After eight hundred metres she and Savita went ahead of me. At least I was ahead of Sunanda and Nilima for five hundred metres.</p>
<p>Barada was so nice to so many people. She started the race five minutes late, so she did not defeat me or any of the others who were ahead of me.</p>
