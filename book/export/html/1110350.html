<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Physical purity is of paramount importance. Some spiritual people neglect physical cleanliness. They don't feel that it is important. But we care for the physical because we feel it is in the physical that the soul lives and because the fulfilment of the Divine Mission can only take place on earth in and through the physical body. Therefore, we have to keep the body pure. When we have established purity in all parts of our nature, only then can the divine power last permanently in us.</p>  </div>
