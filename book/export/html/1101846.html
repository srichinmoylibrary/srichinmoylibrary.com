<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Yesterday I was<br /> Your Compassion-birth.<br /> Today I am<br /> Your Perfection-flower.<br /> Tomorrow I shall be<br /> Your Satisfaction-flute.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101848" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Beloved Supreme,<br /> What is the thing<br /> That I need most from You<br /> At every hour<br /> Of the night and day?<br /> "My child,<br /> My blessingful Hand's<br /> Blessingful Touch."</p>

<p>My sweet Lord,<br /> I wish to make<br /> A most sincere confession.<br /> I have heard the words<br /> Eternity and Immortality<br /> Countless times.<br /> To my extreme sorrow,<br /> I do not know<br /> What they precisely mean.<br /> "My child,<br /> Eternity is<br /> My Heart's universal Hope.<br /> Immortality is<br /> My Eye's transcendental Promise."</p>

<div id="node-1101850" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 

<p>My dear Lord,<br /> We are Your children.<br /> How is it<br /> That You have not made us<br /> As happy as You are?<br /> "My child,<br /> Your way of happiness<br /> And My Way of happiness<br /> Are two totally different things."<br /> My dear Lord,<br /> When I say happiness,<br /> What I mean is<br /> My supremacy-declaration.<br /> "My child,<br /> When I say happiness,<br /> What I mean is<br /> My Oneness-Satisfaction.<br /> "You cannot and do not claim Me<br /> As your own, very own.<br /> Therefore you are unhappy.<br /> But I can and do claim you<br /> As My own, very own.<br /> Therefore I am happy."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Every day my life-boat<br /> Plies between<br /> Your two Compassion-Shores:<br /> Time and speed.<br /> I pray to You to grant me<br /> The lightning-speed<br /> While I am plying my boat<br /> To the speed-destination.<br /> And while I am plying my boat<br /> To the time-destination,<br /> Do bless me with<br /> Eternity's patience.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101852" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Beloved Supreme,<br /> Out of 100,<br /> What do You give me<br /> When I give You<br /> My mind's love, my heart's devotion<br /> And my life's surrender?<br /> "My child, I give you 9 1/4<br /> When you give Me your mind's love.<br /> "I give you 79 1/2<br /> When you give Me your heart's devotion.<br /> "I give you 99 3/4<br /> When you give Me your life's surrender."<br /> My Beloved Supreme,<br /> When can You give me<br /> 100 out of 100?<br /> "My child,<br /> Not until you are empty<br /> Of your curiosity-stupidity."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101853" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7.</h1>
  
 

<p>My sweet Lord,<br /> Can I ever be forgiven?<br /> "My child,<br /> Not until I am absolutely sure<br /> That you will not<br /> Deliberately repeat<br /> The same blunder."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101854" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 

<p>My sweet Lord,<br /> Please be sincere.<br /> Do You really care for me?<br /> "My child,<br /> I care for you<br /> Only when you want Me<br /> To guide you<br /> And not when you want<br /> To lead Me."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101855" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Beloved Supreme,<br /> Which church can and will<br /> Save me?<br /> "My child,<br /> Not the man-built church,<br /> But your own heart's inner<br /> Devotion-built church."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101856" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 

<p>My dear Lord,<br /> I am a staunch Catholic.<br /> Therefore, am I wrong if I say<br /> That I alone am entitled to Heaven?<br /> "My child,<br /> I am afraid if I tell you<br /> That you alone<br /> Are entitled to Heaven,<br /> Then your Protestant cousins<br /> Will sue Me."<br /> My dear Lord,<br /> Then who is entitled to Heaven?<br /> "My child,<br /> The human losing whose heart-cry<br /> Can fly up to Heaven,<br /> And whose soul-smile<br /> Can fly down to earth."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Supreme Lord,<br /> If I die,<br /> Will I be able to go<br /> To Heaven?<br /> "My child,<br /> If you live<br /> In your mind-confusion,<br /> No.<br /> "But if you live<br /> In your heart-devotion,<br /> Then definitely yes."</p>

<div id="node-1101858" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Beloved Supreme,<br /> Is there any right time for me<br /> To do the right thing?<br /> "My child,<br /> Not tomorrow,<br /> Not even today!<br /> "The right time for you<br /> To do the right thing<br /> Is now,<br /> At this very moment,<br /> Plus<br /> Here and nowhere else."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101859" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Are You displeased with me<br /> Because I have not<br /> Cheerfully surrendered myself<br /> To Your Will?<br /> "My child,<br /> I am not displeased with you,<br /> But the real reality in you<br /> Is your soul.<br /> "Each day when it sees<br /> That you are not making<br /> Your cheerful surrender<br /> To My Omniscience,<br /> Omnipresence<br /> And Omnipotence,<br /> Your soul carries unnecessarily<br /> An elephant-weight,<br /> A volcano-frustration<br /> And a tornado-destruction.<br /> "My child,<br /> Each second<br /> Either you surrender to My Will<br /> Or I surrender to your stupidity.<br /> "I can go on surrendering to you,<br /> But if you do not surrender<br /> To My Infinity's Compassion-Heart,<br /> Then each day<br /> Is a failure-cry of your soul,<br /> And I shed endless tears<br /> With your poor soul."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101860" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Why are You so unkind to me?<br /> You have given me no capacity.<br /> Whereas,<br /> You have given my soul the capacity,<br /> Out of Your infinite Bounty,<br /> To be in a self-absorbing trance,<br /> To enjoy Your Immortality's<br /> Infinite Compassion.<br /> "My child,<br /> In comparison to your soul,<br /> You are too young.<br /> When you become as mature<br /> As your soul,<br /> I shall give you<br /> The same kind of capacity<br /> To do My Work on earth."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101861" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15.</h1>
  
 

<p>My dear Lord,<br /> I have forgotten.<br /> Do tell me<br /> If You have given me<br /> Anything to bring down<br /> From Heaven to earth.<br /> "My child,<br /> I gave you My Vision-Eye<br /> To bring down<br /> From Heaven to earth."<br /> My dear Lord,<br /> What will You be giving me<br /> To carry from earth to Heaven?<br /> "My child,<br /> I shall give you<br /> My Manifestation-Feet<br /> To carry from earth to Heaven."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101862" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16.</h1>
  
 

<p>My sweet Lord,<br /> How many steps are there<br /> To reach God?<br /> "My child,<br /> There is only one step."<br /> Only one step!<br /> Please tell me<br /> The name of the step.<br /> "It is called<br /> Your life's union-surrender-step."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101863" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17.</h1>
  
 

<p>My dear Lord,<br /> Please tell me<br /> What is ahead of me.<br /> "My child,<br /> The beauty of<br /> My Compassion-Eye."<br /> And what is behind me?<br /> "The certainty<br /> Of My Forgiveness-Heart."</p>

<div id="node-1101864" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18.</h1>
  
 

<p>My sweet Lord<br /> Absolute Beloved Supreme,<br /> Do give me the capacity<br /> To worship You sleeplessly<br /> While admiring<br /> Your universal Mind,<br /> Adoring<br /> Your universal Life,<br /> And loving<br /> Your universal Heart-Breath,<br /> To fulfil You and please You<br /> In Your absolutely new<br /> And unprecedented creation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101865" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> What is the difference<br /> Between faith and love?<br /> "My child,<br /> There is no difference<br /> Between faith and love.<br /> "Faith and love<br /> Are two complementary souls.<br /> "Faith is the heart of love<br /> And love is the breath of faith."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101866" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> I do not want greatness.<br /> I do not want even goodness.<br /> I want only to be<br /> A speck of humility-dust<br /> To remind me<br /> Of my sleepless service-life.</p>
