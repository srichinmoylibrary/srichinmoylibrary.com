<p>This morning I started lifting just after three oâ€™clock. When it came to 120 pounds with both arms, I tried twice and failed. When I tried to lift the dumbbells separately, they went up, but I could not lift them simultaneously. I tried at least four more times.</p>
<p>I think we have made a mistake by putting a wooden plank under my feet. Now I am not getting the proper grip because I am higher. Let me ask Unmilan to take it away again.</p>
