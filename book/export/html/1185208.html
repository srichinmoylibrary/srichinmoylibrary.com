  <h1 class="book-heading">The choice of the two brothers</h1>
  
 
<p>There were two brothers who were born in Italy. They had tremendous love for their religion, Christianity, and both of them tirelessly performed countless services for the needy.</p>
<p>These two brothers happened to be extremely close to one another. The Bishop of their district made them priests and they began to preach devotedly and unreservedly to the poor and the rich alike.</p>
<p>Fear could not torment them, although their enemies tried to kill them. When the Emperor Hadrian came to hear about these two brothers, he put them into prison and asked his soldiers to torture them mercilessly.</p>
<p>Then the Emperor informed the brothers that either they would have to give up their Christian faith totally or they would have to suffer unspeakably until the end in the hands of the soldiers.</p>
<p>The brothers gladly chose torture and suffering and did not abandon Christianity. These two brothers were Saint Faustinus and Saint Jovita.</p>  </div>
