<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It has happened in many, many cases that for months, even years — and not just a few years but ten or twenty years — somebody has been miserable. People who were once aspiring, after they lose their aspiration, suffer unbearably. Then, all of a sudden the Grace descends at the moment when they are receptive, and their suffering is gone. It is like taking medicine. Sometimes it takes years and years before the medicine works. Then all of a sudden you are cured, and you think it is a miracle.</p>  </div>
