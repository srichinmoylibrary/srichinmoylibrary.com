<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, God is the only Reality. He is the only Reality here on earth and there in Heaven. But Reality has its children, which we call realities. In the field of manifestation, Reality becomes realities. But each individual reality embodies the absolute Reality. Reality is the root and seed, and realities are the millions of branches, leaves, flowers and fruits of the Reality-Tree. To our limited understanding the one Reality becomes infinite realities in infinite forms. But when it is a matter of the only Reality, God is the only Reality, the Reality-Seed, the Reality-Tree, the Reality-Branches and the Reality-Leaves. God is eternally the only Reality. We ourselves become the only Reality only when we realise God and serve Him in His own way.</p>  </div>
