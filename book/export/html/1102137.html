<p>"My Lord, I don't want to think with my mind anymore."</p>
<p>"Fine. Then give Me your mind back."</p>
<p>"My Lord, I don't want to see with my eyes anymore."</p>
<p>"Fine, wonderful! Then give Me your eyes back."</p>
<p>"My Lord, I don't want to feel with my heart anymore."</p>
<p>"Fine, wonderful, marvellous! Then give Me your heart back."</p>
<p>"My Lord, if I give You my mind, eyes and heart, how are You going to replace them?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry, My child, don't worry. I shall replace them with My endless and unconditional Concern."</p>
<p>"My Lord, then take them. From now on they are Yours."</p>
<p>"Thank you, My child."</p>
