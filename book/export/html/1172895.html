<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the members of a family have faith in rituals, then certainly rituals will be of benefit. But just because there are people who have faith in rituals, that doesnâ€™t mean that all couples should observe rituals. Rituals are preliminary stages in the spiritual life, like kindergarten. Some children study in kindergarten before they enter into primary school. Some students skip kindergarten. It depends on the individual case.</p>  </div>
