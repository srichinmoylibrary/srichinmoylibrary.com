<p>At the television studio in Germany, they put a little transmitter inside my ear so that I could get a simultaneous English translation of what the interviewer was saying.</p>
<p>It was very confusing because I could hear the interviewer talking in German, and at the same moment I was hearing the English translation.</p>
<p>So in one ear I was hearing German and in the other ear I was trying to listen to English. The English and German were coming together-one word from this side and one word from that side.</p>
<p>It was very difficult to understand!</p>
