  <h1 class="book-heading">Faith, love, devotion and surrender</h1>
  
 
<p>My Lord, my simple faith follows You. My Lord, my sincere love follows You. My Lord, my intense devotion follows You. My Lord, my unconditional surrender follows You.</p>
<p>My faith knows what You are. My love knows who You are. My devotion knows all about our closeness. My surrender knows all about our oneness. I know, my Lord, that when I do my best You do the rest for me compassionately, unreservedly and unconditionally.</p>
<p>Why was I created? I was created to love You. Why was I created? I was created to need You. Why was I created? I was created to manifest You here on earth. Why was I created? I was created to be a perfect instrument of Yours, to please You in Your own way.</p>
<p>I have a secret, a supreme secret. I am at my journey's start, and the goal is still a far cry. Indeed, this is my inner conviction.</p>
<p>My Beloved Lord Supreme also has a secret, and this sweet secret He shares with me. He tells me that I am not at my journey's start but that I am at my journey's close; I am at my destination. But this destination of mine, unlike other destinations, is ever-transcending, ever-illumining and ever-fulfilling. At the destination the journey actually does not come to a close, for each destination is the starting point for a new journey. Therefore, I am always walking, marching and running along Eternity's Road, in the process of a new, illumining and fulfilling journey.</p>
