<p>In Holland we went to a studio. There I lifted with my left arm and then with my right arm. The people were so nice, so kind, and the arrangements were absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>While I was lifting up the weight with my right arm, you cannot imagine how close the cameraman was to me! He was not even six inches away. His big lens was right at the tip of my nose!</p>
<p>Just before I was about to lift, the cameraman asked me, “Do you mind?” What could I say? I was concentrating most powerfully, so I did not want to speak to him. He took my silence as permission, so he came right in front of me. Then I had to prove that I was in my highest concentrative consciousness!</p>
