<p><em>(The sage's cottage. Evening has set in.</em> )</p>
<p>WIFE: Look, it is dark now, and poor Aruni is still in the fields. Let us go and see what he is doing. Poor boy, he is still working very hard. We have to do something for him. Let us go and help him. I am sure he has not been successful. That's why he is still there.</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: You stay home and make a meal for us. Let me go and bring him back. If he has not been successful, tomorrow we shall try to find somebody else to do the job.</p>
