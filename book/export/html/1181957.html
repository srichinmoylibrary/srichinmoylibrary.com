<p>I was late in almost everything.<br /> I did not mind.<br /> I am late in almost everything.<br /> I do not mind.<br /> I shall be late in almost everything.<br /> I shall not mind.<br /> But I was not late,<br /> I am not late<br /> And I shall never be late<br /> In one thing:<br /> My awareness of<br /> My Lord's Compassion infinite<br /> Since He began His Vision-Reality-Game<br /> In and through my Heaven-free soul<br /> And my earth-bound life.</p>
