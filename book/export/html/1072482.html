<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You will know easily if you are not attached to the result or elevated by the result. Before you do something, pray to God: “God, if it is Your Will, then please inspire me to do it well.” While working, tell God, “God, since I have accepted this work with the feeling that You wanted me to do it, please work in and through me so that I can do it well.” At the end of the work, whether the result comes as success or as failure, offer it at the Feet of God with the same joy. Then you have done what God wants you to do. But before you do anything, you will have to pray to God, in this way: “If it is Your Will please inspire me. From your inspiration I will be able to know that it is Your Will.”</p>  </div>
