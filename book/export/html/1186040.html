<p>My Lord,<br /> Your morning Smile<br /> Is my breath<br /> During the entire day.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186042" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">402</h1>
  
 

<p>I call it a sacred thought.<br /> My Beloved Supreme calls it<br /> A Satisfaction-Smile<br /> From His own Manifestation-Life.</p>

<p>As beauty's dawn does not last<br /> Longer than a few moments<br /> In man's ugly mind,<br /> Even so purity's evening<br /> Does not last<br /> More than a few fleeting seconds<br /> In man's impure heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186044" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">404</h1>
  
 

<p>In the inner world<br /> You are a spiritual failure<br /> Not because God has<br /> No special love for you<br /> But because you do not want<br /> To meet with God's Justice-Light.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186045" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">405</h1>
  
 

<p>When I hear<br /> The song of your eyes,<br /> I enter into<br /> The world of beauty.</p>
<p>When I hear<br /> The song of your heart,<br /> I enter into<br /> The world of purity.</p>
<p>When I hear<br /> The song of your soul,<br /> I enter into<br /> The world of sweetness unknowable.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186046" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">406</h1>
  
 

<p>There was a time<br /> When you used to feel<br /> God's loving Heart,<br /> But now you are only seeing<br /> God's ruling Hand.<br /> I tell you,<br /> Do not be confused or frightened.<br /> God's ruling Hand is only showing you<br /> How to return home<br /> Safely, soulfully and richly.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186047" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">407</h1>
  
 

<p>I am here, my Lord,<br /> Waiting for Your Compassion-Heart.<br /> I am here, my Lord,<br /> Waiting for the embrace<br /> Of Your infinite Freedom.<br /> I am here, my Lord,<br /> Waiting for You to come<br /> And take my broken heart<br /> To Your celestial Abode.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186048" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">408</h1>
  
 

<p>Give yourself only once<br /> An unconditional chance<br /> And then remain completely silent.<br /> Your Lord Supreme will sing<br /> His Immortality-Song<br /> Through your beauty's silence-perfection.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186049" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">409</h1>
  
 

<p>If you allow yourself<br /> To be fettered by the world's opinions,<br /> God will never grant you<br /> His Vision-Life-Pinions<br /> To carry you into His Eternity's<br /> Delight-flooded Sky.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186050" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">410</h1>
  
 

<p>Beauty and purity<br /> Are heavenly possessions.<br /> If you want to own them,<br /> Your mounting aspiration-heart<br /> Must increase its height<br /> And your growing dedication-life<br /> Must increase its length.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186051" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">411</h1>
  
 

<p>My heart and I<br /> May not be ready to say<br /> We owe everything to God's Love,<br /> But my life and I<br /> Are more than ready to say<br /> We owe everything<br /> To God's Forgiveness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186052" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">412</h1>
  
 

<p>A messenger from the morning-world<br /> Has given me<br /> A very special message:<br /> God will before long<br /> Capture my heart<br /> With His Soul's Smile<br /> And capture my life<br /> With His Heart's Cry.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186053" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">413</h1>
  
 

<p>In this lifetime of yours,<br /> Can you not become<br /> A dancing hope,<br /> A singing promise<br /> And a transcending perfection?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186054" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">414</h1>
  
 

<p>You will remain<br /> With your unborn dreams<br /> Because you always forget to smile<br /> At Heaven's wealth<br /> And always forget to cry<br /> With earth's poverty.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186055" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">415</h1>
  
 

<p>Do you not realise<br /> That you are your heart's<br /> Short-lived devotion?</p>
<p>Do you not realise<br /> That you are your mind's<br /> Completely forgotten inspiration?</p>
<p>Do you not realise<br /> That you are your life's<br /> Unconditionally accepted failure?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186056" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">416</h1>
  
 

<p>The latest news from God:<br /> His Compassion-Height<br /> Is not going to fight anymore<br /> Against His Justice-Light<br /> Because it is tired of fighting<br /> For the ever-ungrateful<br /> And ever-unreceptive humanity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186057" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">417</h1>
  
 

<p>Do not stop smiling<br /> If you want to become as beautiful<br /> As a child's heart.</p>
<p>Do not stop crying<br /> If you want to become as pure<br /> As a saint's life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186058" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">418</h1>
  
 

<p>My impurity-mind<br /> Does not surprise God.<br /> My insecurity-heart<br /> Does not puzzle God.<br /> But my unwillingness-life<br /> Definitely amazes God.</p>

<div id="node-1186059" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">419</h1>
  
 

<p>Since you are living inside<br /> Your doubting mind's hopes,<br /> How can you see<br /> Your faithful heart's promises<br /> Or feel the Oneness-Love<br /> Of God's bountiful Heart?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186060" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">420</h1>

<p>Everybody tells you<br /> That you will fail,<br /> But do they help you<br /> To succeed?<br /> Do they pray<br /> For your victory?<br /> Therefore, why do you need<br /> Their stupid and proud comments<br /> On your success-failure-life?</p>
