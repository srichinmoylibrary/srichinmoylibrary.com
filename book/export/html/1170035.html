<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, we have to know why a student becomes his teacher's pet. He becomes so by virtue of his hard work and true love of knowledge-light. If a teacher discovers that a particular student of his is consumed with the hunger to swim in the sea of wisdom-light, whereas other students are wanting in this hunger, then the teacher has every right to bring that particular student closest to his life-illumining mental aura. In this way, he will help the student accelerate his progress in the field of education, which is nothing other than life-recovery, self-mastery and God-discovery.</p>  </div>
