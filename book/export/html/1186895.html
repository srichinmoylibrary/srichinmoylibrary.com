<p>Are you trying to teach me something<br /> Or are you trying to learn something<br /> From me?<br /> If you are trying to teach me something,<br /> Then instead of teaching me,<br /> I would like you to teach<br /> My unruly, disobedient mind.<br /> If you are trying to learn something<br /> From me,<br /> Then instead of learning from me,<br /> I would like you to learn every day<br /> A purity-song from my heart.</p>
