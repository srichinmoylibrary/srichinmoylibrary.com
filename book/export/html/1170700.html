<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> According to my inner conviction, spirituality is not something theoretical; it is something practical. Who can be more practical than God Himself? He created the world to give Himself joy and fulfilment. Spirituality is definitely practical; likewise, prayer and meditation are definitely practical. For prayer and meditation to be effective, we need only one thing: the indomitable, heroic spirit that can conquer the pride of impossibility.</p>  </div>
