<p>Dear seekers, you love God and I love God. Therefore, we are true friends. We are one. You need God and I need God. Therefore, we are true friends. We are one.</p>
<p>Out of His infinite Bounty, God has made us one. Our oneness is founded upon God’s unconditional Compassion. This Compassion is God’s supreme gift to mankind.</p>
<p>How shall we utilise this supreme gift? We shall utilise this supreme gift soulfully. How often shall we utilise this supreme gift? We shall utilise this supreme gift constantly in our day-to-day, multifarious activities.</p>
<p>Our oneness is soulful. Our oneness is constant. In our soulful oneness, we shall try to discover a new life and see the real Face of the real God. In our constant oneness, we shall try to discover a new surrendered heart and embody the true perfection of the true God, our Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Together we shall achieve. Our divine achievement will be to help aspiring mankind realise God here, there, all-where. Together, on the strength of our soulful prayer and fruitful meditation, we shall try to unite the world — the confusing and the confused world.</p>
<p>Prayer is our inner cry for the highest Transcendental Reality. Meditation is our inner smile while we are manifesting a Transcendental Reality.</p>
<p>When we pray to God, we converse with Him, we talk to Him. We ask God for Peace, Light and Bliss in abundant measure, in infinite measure. When we meditate, God speaks to us. He tells us, “My children, manifest Me here on earth.”</p>
<p>The Saviour Christ blessed us with the supreme prayer: “Father, let Thy Will be done.” The Vedic Seers of the hoary past blessed us with the supreme meditation. It is called the Gayatri Mantra, which is the mother of all Indian mantras.</p>

<p><em>Aum bhur bhuvah svah</em><br /><em>Tat savitur varenyam</em><br /><em>Bhargo devasya dimahi</em><br /><em>Dhiyo yo nah pracodayat</em></p>

<p>We meditate on the transcendental glory of the Deity Supreme, who is inside the heart of the earth, inside the life of the sky and inside the soul of the Heaven. May He stimulate and illumine our minds. </p>
