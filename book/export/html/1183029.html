<p>She asked her Master one day to open up her third eye. The Master said to her that he could not do it since it was not God’s Will. She did not believe the Master. She told the Master that it was his own insecurity that made him refuse to open her third eye. If her third eye were opened up, naturally she would be as great as her Master; and how could the Master have somebody at his own level? Therefore, she left the Master and tried to open her third eye without anybody’s help. What she did was to make a big hole in her forehead by striking her head against one of the kitchen utensils. The Master felt miserable but he was helpless because she was no longer in his Centre.</p>  </div>
