<p>The story of Suren did not end with the bank robbery.</p>
<p>After Suren disappeared with the money, his wife stayed at Ganapati’s house for about a month. She was so sad, embarrassed and miserable at what her husband had done.</p>
<p>But Ganapati’s family was not at all against her. On the contrary, they showered her with affection and concern. Ganapati’s parents treated her as part of the family, like another daughter.</p>
<p>And neither Ganapati’s father nor his mother held anything against the culprit.</p>  </div>
