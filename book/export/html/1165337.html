<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a combination of ignorance and the karma of previous incarnations that is responsible. It is not God’s Will to destroy. God’s Will is to love us and to fulfil us. Our will, instead of fulfilling God, is to try to destroy each other and, at the same time, to destroy God’s Plan. God’s Plan cannot be destroyed, but we do not know how it operates. Since God is all-forgiving, He will wait and wait for us to learn. He has infinite Patience eternal Patience.</p>  </div>
