<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to get in touch with the source. Right now you see your brothers, black people, at the foot of the tree. They do not know how to climb. So you climb to the top of the tree and pick some mangoes, and then come down and distribute them. The people at the foot of the tree you have accepted as your brothers and sisters. They are hungry also. And because of your heart, you will not allow your little brothers to remain unfed. Now, if you just stay with your brothers at the foot of the tree, then there will not be any mangoes for anyone. So you have to go up the tree and give to others who don't have. And for this you have to go to a higher level.</p>  </div>
