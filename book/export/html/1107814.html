<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible to realise God in one incarnation. But you have to know how sincere you are and how close you have become to the Master inwardly. On the strength of our inner cry, aspiration and oneness, we realise God. If our inner vessel is large enough, then naturally we can receive God's Love, Blessings, Divinity and everything in boundless measure. But if our receptivity is not large enough, we cannot receive in boundless measure. It entirely depends on the strength of the disciple's inner cry and on the receptivity which he has cultivated during his meditation and prayer.</p>  </div>
