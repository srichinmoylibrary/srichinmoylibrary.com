<p>During the five-mile race, I was running behind Durga. She saw me and went to the other side, but I was so tired that I stayed behind her. Then we came to a hill. I said, "Where is she? Where is she?"</p>
<p>I used to do hill work every day, and while I was running I was thinking of my hill work. I was running and she was running too, but because I was thinking of my hill work I went ahead of her. Only by thinking of it was I able to go ahead of her, or perhaps she deliberately showed me compassion.</p>
