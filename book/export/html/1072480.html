<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I say “Father,” I don’t exclude the Mother. God is both masculine and feminine. It is only that the term “Father” is more familiar in the Western world. In the West, the Christ taught us, “I and my Father are one,” and “Our Father, who art in Heaven.” He always said, “Father, Father.” So here I use the term “Father” because it is familiar.</p>
<p>In the East we use the term “Goddess” quite often — we think of the Supreme Goddess, of the Mother. We have so many goddesses: Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati. So in our case, it is very easy to think of God in feminine terms. But when I am with you, I have to use a term which is quite familiar to you, for I feel that it will become easier for me to share my experiences with you. In truth, God is both masculine and feminine. And again, He transcends both: He is neither masculine nor feminine. He is what He is, eternally is: He is His Vision, and He is His Reality. This Reality transcends both masculine and feminine form; and at the same time it embodies both masculine and feminine.</p>  </div>
