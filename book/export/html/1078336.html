<p>I AM CAUGHT</p>
<p>I am caught by an animal.<br /> Therefore<br /> I am ruthlessly commanded to surrender.</p>
<p>I am caught by man.<br /> Therefore<br /> I am unconditionally forced to offer.</p>
<p>I am caught by God.<br /> Therefore<br /> I am lovingly asked to love.<br /> Why?<br /> Because God wants me to become another God.<br /> Why?<br /> Because He wants me to be<br /> His main partner<br /> In His cosmic Game.</p>
