<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You should always pray for purification of the mind. All the negative forces will attack you unless and until you are purified. When you pray and meditate, consciously pray or meditate on purity inside the heart first. When purity is well established there, then all your wrong forces are bound to disappear. Eventually, the undivine forces will not even be able to enter into you.</p>  </div>
