    <title>Question: You say that God&#039;s Divinity meditated and created man. Isn&#039;t it also true that man meditated and created God&#039;s Divinity?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God created man's divinity. Again, when man meditates, man realises God's Divinity and becomes one with God's Divinity. When man consciously becomes inseparably one with God's Divinity, his own divinity and God's Divinity become absolutely one at that point. And at that time man feels that he and God have always been inseparably one.</p>
<p>Everything started with God's own Unity. He was One, but He felt that He wanted to be fulfilled in and through the many. God was One, but He wanted to hear the message of multiplicity in Unity. So He meditated and created man's divinity. Man wants to grow into the very image of God and hear the message of unity in multiplicity. So man meditates on God's Divinity. This is how man meditates on God's Divinity and how God meditates on man's divinity.</p>  </div>
