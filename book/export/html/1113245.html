<p>There was an envelope on Nolini-da's table. Nolini-da opened it and found that it was a story by Maupassant translated by Manju-da (Nolini's second son). He had sent it to some magazine and they had returned it. Nolini-da said. "Poor Manju. I read his translation before. It is a very good translation. He should have sent it to <em>Uttara.</em> They would have accepted it."</p>
<p>A few minutes later Wilfy (Wilfred) brought a few pictures of Nolini-da which he had taken at the tennis court. When Wilfy showed them to Nolini-da, Nolini-da said: "Wilfy you are really a good photographer."</p>  </div>
