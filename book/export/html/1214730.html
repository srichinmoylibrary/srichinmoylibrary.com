<p>The devout U Thant, like his Lord Buddha, discovered that the world is full of suffering. Like the Father, the Son’s heart cried with humanity’s heart and suffered for humanity’s life.</p>
<p>Momentous are the words of Leopoldo Benites, the Ambassador of Ecuador to the United Nations: “It maywell be that for U Thant, a Buddhist, the world was a painful illusion, as Prince Siddhartha Gautama discovered under the fig tree before he became the Buddha, and that a life of goodness, peace and justice led him to ultimate liberation.”</p>  </div>
