<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you walk through the city, you can elbow people, you can push this way and that and you can strike someone. Then you will feel that you are very smart. This is aggression. But dynamism does not mean that you will elbow your way through a crowd. On the contrary, dynamism means only that you will be very wise and you will not lose any opportunity to manifest the Supreme. Aggression comes from the physical vital, but dynamism comes from the illumined vital.</p>  </div>
