<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has not one but three oldest friends. Their names are Sat-Chit-Ananda: Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. This is a triune Consciousness. If you want to separate them, you can call them Existence, Consciousness and Bliss in three different planes. Here is one thing — Existence; here is one thing — Consciousness; here is one thing — Bliss. In this case you can say that God has three dearest friends, three oldest friends, and they are Sat, Chit and Ananda. Again, these three friends of His are eternally inseparable. They are bosom friends, or you can say, they are only one friend called by three different names by different individuals. The father is called by his children in one way, by his friends in another way and by his wife in another. In the same way, if one wants to see Existence-Consciousness-Bliss as three different entities or realities, one can. But if one wants to see Existence-Consciousness-Bliss in one form, one reality and one vision, then God's only friend is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss.</p>  </div>
