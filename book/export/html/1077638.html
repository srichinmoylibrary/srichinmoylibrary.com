<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The same souls do return, but the Supreme also creates new souls. For various reasons many souls have asked to take rest before completing their part in the cosmic game. Those who strictly followed the Lord Buddhaâ€™s path and entered into Nirvana have not come back. So the Supreme sends new souls into the world to take their place.</p>  </div>
