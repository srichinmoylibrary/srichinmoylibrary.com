<p>I think people run on alternate days. The day before yesterday, many people ran. Then again today, there were many people. Some disciples run so fast.</p>
<p>One lady looked from a distance like Ila. She really looked like Ila and I was about to call, "Ila!" But then I saw it was somebody else.</p>  </div>
