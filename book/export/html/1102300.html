<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> According to my inner aspiration, I wish to say that the ideal Secretary-General is he who has a free access to both the inner realities and the outer realities of life. The inner realities are heart's cry and heart's oneness. The outer realities are life's total and consecrated dedication. The ideal Secretary-General is he who dives deep within in order to quench his own inner thirst, and then shares with the rest of the world the nectar-bliss that he has discovered and drunk profusely in his inner life.</p>
<p>The ideal Secretary-General is he who at once fulfils his inner vision and outer mission. His inner vision is love of humanity for humanity's sake and his outer mission is service to humanity for humanity's sake. His inner life is a continuous progress-journey to reach the acme of illumination-perfection. His outer life is dedicated to spreading his illumination-perfection throughout the length and breadth of the world.</p>  </div>
