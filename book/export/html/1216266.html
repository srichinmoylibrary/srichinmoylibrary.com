<p>When I was a rock,<br /> God was proud of my adamantine will.</p>
<p>When I was a tree,<br /> God was proud of my untiring compassion.</p>
<p>When I was an animal,<br /> God was proud of my unyielding striving.</p>
<p>When I was a human being,<br /> God was proud of my heart's crying.</p>
<p>When I was a divine being,<br /> God was proud of my accepting and rejecting,<br /> And my becoming and being.</p>
