<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It means God in His Three aspects: God as the Creator, God as the Preserver and God as the Transformer. He who transforms our ignorance into light. He who transforms our limitations into plenitude. It is a Sanskrit word that is used in all our spiritual disciplines and in our spiritual philosophy.</p>  </div>
