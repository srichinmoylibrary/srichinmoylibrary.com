<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If this is the case, you have to go to a spiritual Master in whom you have implicit faith. He will be able to tell you what you are doing wrong. I see occultly that the visions you are receiving are not always coming from the plane of truth. It is mixed up. Your experiences are from the vital world, and you have to come out of this vital world. You have to remain in the truth consciousness itself; then only will you get inner strength and not feel weaker day by day. Unfortunately, a doctor will not be able to help you here. This is an inner problem, a psychological problem, and you have to go to a real spiritual Master.</p>  </div>
