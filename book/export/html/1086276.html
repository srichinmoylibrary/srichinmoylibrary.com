<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, this time is important because that is the hour that you have fixed. If your time to meditate is 4:30 in the morning, at that hour your soul will knock at your door — like a punctual newspaper boy — so you had better be prepared. Choose the time that you feel is best and stick to it. The best time for you people is some time after 4:30 am. Yesterday you may have meditated at four o'clock, another day at two o'clock, another day at five o'clock, some days even at nine o'clock — but is it real meditation? At two o'clock in the morning or any time before 4:30, it is not possible for you to meditate well, because you will be tired. So disciples should get up and meditate between the hours of 4:30 am and 6:45 am. After seven o'clock I know the consciousness of America: it is in a hustle and bustle mood.</p>
<p>Please meditate at the time you are supposed to. If you change your time every day or if you have not meditated, I will catch you people in the inner worlds, because I have realised God and you have not. So please become like an Indian farmer and plough your fields, your meditation fields, every day at the same hour.</p>  </div>
