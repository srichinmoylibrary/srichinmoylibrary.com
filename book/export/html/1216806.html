<p>Nakamura, the great Japanese running coach, has a big heart. He is like a grandfather. Anything that a grandfather says is philosophy. Whatever he says seems good. He says that Buddha's philosophy is the same as Krishna's philosophy.</p>
<p>His students have such faith in him and such admiration for him! They take him as a real friend, even a real father. Other university teachers often don't have any kind of oneness-feeling for their students. They teach what they want to teach, and the students learn what they want to learn. But Nakamura exercises his power of love, and his teaching success comes from his concern. It is not just strict military discipline. So his students really believe in him and believe that what he says is absolutely right.</p>
