<p>Transformation is a house. It becomes a home only when there is peace, joy, harmony and love. Before that, the house is there — an amalgam of bricks, sand, wood and other material objects; but these things are useless and meaningless unless there is peace, love, joy and oneness inside the house. When these qualities or these capacities are visible, then the house becomes a home.</p>
<p>Human life is totally meaningless unless there is love in it. It is a life, a creation of God, but this creation of God is of no avail unless and until there is love in it. When love fills life, then only life is meaningful and fruitful. The transformation of house into home is what we need, the transformation of life into love is what we need.</p>
<p>The human mind we consider as the highest achievement on earth. But this mind is of no avail unless and until vastness becomes its other name. Unless and until the mind becomes synonymous with vastness, the mind is of no use. The mind always tries to maintain its superiority. It finds faults with others and suspects others. It gets pleasure only in exercising its individuality. Who needs that mind? But when vastness enters into the mind, the mind is illumined and fulfilled.</p>
<p>The creation as such we do not need, for it is helpless, hopeless, useless. But when we see God inside the creation, what we see is not helplessness but hope. What we see is not uselessness but usefulness. What we see is not mere promise but a faultless assurance of the fulfilment of that promise. So inside the creation, if we can see the Creator, then only is the creation meaningful and fruitful. Otherwise, earthly creation is of no avail.</p>
<p>A life of aspiration, a life of dedication, a life of concentration, meditation and contemplation cannot lead us far, very far unless it can make us feel that we came into the world only to please God and serve God in His own way. Otherwise, we will have aspiration, we will have dedication, we will have concentration-power, meditation-power and contemplation-power, and these things will undoubtedly take us to a destination. But this destination need not be and cannot be the real destination which our God has kept for us. Inside each prayer, inside each concentration, meditation and contemplation there has to be a remembrance of our promise to God, that Him to please in His own way we came into the world. Each time we pray, each time we meditate, each time we contemplate, each time we do anything, if there is no remembrance of our promise to God and if there is no self-assurance that we can keep this promise, then it is useless. No matter how many hours we pray, no matter how many hours we concentrate and meditate, everything will eventually end in bitter frustration. The results we shall get without fail from our prayer, concentration, meditation and contemplation, but these results will be far from our satisfaction.</p>
<p>We have set up a goal according to our own inner perception, and this goal we will reach. But just because we have set our goal according to our own inner image, we will not be satisfied; we will be frustrated. But at every moment when we pray, when we concentrate, when we meditate, when we contemplate, if we can keep in the forefront our soulful promise to our Beloved Supreme, and if we can keep our inner assurance, then we can and will fulfil this promise — that Him to please in His own way, we saw the light of day. Then only will our prayer, concentration, meditation and contemplation have true value, true meaning, true fulfilment.</p>
<p>Life has to become love. Mind has to become vastness. Creation has to become God. Prayer and meditation have to embody self-assurance and remembrance of our promise to God. Then only satisfaction, complete satisfaction, everlasting satisfaction, will dawn.</p>
