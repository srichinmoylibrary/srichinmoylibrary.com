<p><em>Madal:</em></p>
<p>Chinmoy, I shall be extremely happy if you can learn how to play on the flute. Your harmonium does not have <em>mellifluous</em> tones at all.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>Madal, I don't disagree with you. True, my harmonium does not offer any <em>sweetly flowing</em> tones, but it has been my most faithful friend. I don't want to have a new friend at this old age. My childhood friend is dearer than the dearest and sweeter than the sweetest.</p>  </div>
