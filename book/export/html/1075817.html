<p><em>(Residence of the Tagores, Calcutta. Seated Dwijendranath, the eldest brother of Rabindranath, in his study. He sends for his personal secretary, Anilkumar Mitra.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter Anil)</em></p>
<p>DWIJENDRANATH: Have you received the latest issue of the <em>Arya</em>?</p>
<p>ANIL: Yes, Sir. It has just come. I am bringing it. Anything else?</p>
<p>DWIJENDRANATH: Do you read it as regularly as I?</p>
<p>ANIL: No, Sir. I tried for a time but found it brain-racking, too high, too deep for my intellect.</p>
<p>DWIJENDRANATH: Ah, my friend, that's a wrong approach. It's no intellectual pabulum. It's for the soul. From my study of the whole range of philosophy, Eastern and Western, I can freely declare that what Aurobindo Ghosh says in his articles has never been said by anybody else anywhere. <em>(After a pause)</em> Go deeper than your intellect when you read the <em>Arya</em> next and you'll find it clearer.</p>  </div>
