<p>From time to time, George V of England used to enjoy walking along the street incognito. He especially liked to go to the villages. Once he was supposed to go to a particular village to meet with the local people and give them advice. Everybody went to that particular village to get advice and blessings from the King, but the King did not come. Instead, he went to another village and was moving around in disguise. He saw a lady working in the field and asked, "You are working all by yourself. Do you not have dear ones to help you?"</p>
<p>She said, "Yes, I have dear ones, but today they have all gone to see the King."</p>
<p>He said, "The King?"</p>
<p>She said, "Yes, are you such a fool that you do not know? The King is speaking in a nearby village, but I have five children. If I go to see the King and do not work, then tomorrow we will not have any food to eat. Who wants to see the King? For me, duty comes first."</p>
<p>When George V heard this, he immediately gave her a large sum of money. He told her, "When your friends come back, you tell them that since you could not go to the King, the King came and talked to you."</p>
<p>She was dumbfounded!</p>  </div>
