<p>For one week before the race, the New York Marathon creates such a sensation in New York City. Everybody knows that sixteen thousand people will run. There will be a sea of people flooding the streets.</p>
<p>Of course, since we are not the organisers, we are full of joy and excitement instead of suffering from headaches. Someday we should have sixteen thousand people in one of our races!</p>
