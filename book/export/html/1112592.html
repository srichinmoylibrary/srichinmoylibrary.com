<p>Kailash was using my camera to take pictures at the athletic meet. It seemed that the camera was on exposure number eight, so Kailash took nine, ten and all the way up to thirty-six pictures. Then for some reason suspicion arose. He opened the camera and there was no film in it.</p>
<p>But there were three other photographers, so there was no problem. Marco and others were taking pictures; so it was not necessary for Kailash to take pictures also.</p>  </div>
