<p>Tagore had a contemporary, Kaji Najrul Islam. From time to time, Tagore’s admirers would say unkind things about Najrul Islam’s poems. But Tagore himself was very kind to Najrul Islam. He encouraged him and inspired him in so many ways. They were on very good terms. Even right before he passed away, Tagore showered blessings and affection on Najrul Islam. And then Najrul Islam wrote a few songs on Tagore which were so beautiful, so soulful and so meaningful.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
