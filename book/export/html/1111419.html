<p>I went out to run after seven o'clock this morning, and I saw a girl running alone. I thought it was Hladini. It was on the tip of my tongue to bark at her, because here in Tobago the girl disciples are not supposed to run alone. But when I came nearer, I saw that the girl was uncivilised. Since her uniform was immodest, I said, "No, no, it cannot be a disciple."</p>
