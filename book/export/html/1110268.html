<p><em>Question:</em> When you ask us to come up and meditate in front of the other disciples, 1 become very nervous and can't meditate well.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have felt that my consciousness has reached the Highest. That is why you have come to me for spiritual guidance. I gave away all my nervousness during my youth when I was a champion athlete. Now if you enter into me, you will find only Peace, Light and Bliss in boundless measure. Where these qualities are there can be no nervousness. When I ask you to come up and meditate, just try to identify with me. Identification doesn't mean imitation; far from it. I don't want your life to be a carbon copy of mine. You are crying for the Highest. If you accept your inner feeling as something true, then just throw yourself, body and soul, into me, into my consciousness. You will see that nervousness or a self-conscious feeling cannot exist there. Inside my consciousness is all certainty and a flood of reality.</p>  </div>
