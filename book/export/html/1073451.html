<p>Although I have an insincere mind,<br /> I frequently think of You, my Captain.<br /> Although I have an impure heart,<br /> I fearfully love You, my Captain.<br /> Although I have a complicated life,<br /> I hesitantly need You, my Captain.<br /> Please tell me what You actually think<br /> Of my insincere mind, impure heart<br /> And complicated life.<br /> "My child, when you use your insincere mind,<br /> Impure heart and complicated life,<br /> It is like taking one step towards Me.<br /> While you are taking one step towards Me,<br /> I go one step farther away.<br /> But if you ever use your sincere mind,<br /> Pure heart and simple life,<br /> Then I tell you,<br /> When you take one step towards Me,<br /> I take ninety-nine steps forward to meet you<br /> And give to your mind<br /> A beautiful Sincerity-Smile,<br /> To your heart,<br /> A powerful Purity-Embrace<br /> And to your life,<br /> A fruitful Simplicity-Oneness."</p>
