  <h1 class="book-heading">Nations must work together</h1>
  
 
<p>United we must see the reality. United we must feel the reality. United we must grow into the reality. There is no other way-none. Little brothers and big brothers in strong harmony and perfect peace must live. If not, danger shall threaten and devour the world. The divine words of the Secretary-General are indeed of supreme value:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is in the equal interest of all nations, large or small, to work towards a world where nations, like individuals, will operate within a complete, coherent and viable system of law, impartially administered and enforced. Any movement away from this goal holds equal danger for all."</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
