<p>There is a great difference between the outer life and the inner life. There is one player whose tongue is absolutely fouler than the foulest. He behaves so badly that everybody who sees him is ashamed. But that is only on the physical and vital plane. His soul is very, very progressive, but the soul is not able to offer its divine qualities to the outer being. The outer being is dominating him. In his case, there is no bridge between the inner and the outer.</p>  </div>
