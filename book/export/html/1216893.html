<p>Sitting in front of me on the plane was an elderly couple; they were both over 60.</p>
<p>Before the plane took off, another old man came up to the lady and said, "Hi!" She also said something to him.</p>
<p>Then the man said to the husband, "Harold, how are you?" But the husband didn't answer.</p>
<p>When the man went away, the husband got so mad! For ten minutes or more he was insulting and scolding his wife.</p>
<p>When the plane landed, the other old man again had to come very close to the lady, and the lady again said something to him.</p>
<p>Her husband was holding two small bags. He got so furious that he just dropped them on the seat.</p>
<p>I was dying to get off the plane before he struck his wife. I saw his anger and wanted to disappear immediately.</p>
