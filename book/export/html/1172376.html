<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not all lost. It is scattered over the earth. It enters into the earth-atmosphere and becomes the earthâ€™s possession. When spiritual Masters bring down divine qualities from above, Mother Earth embodies them as her own. Then, when someone in the street or elsewhere aspires, he will get this peace and light from the earth-consciousness, but he will not know where it is coming from.</p>  </div>
