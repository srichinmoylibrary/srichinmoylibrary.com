<p>You are telling me that since God does everything in and through you, even if you do not think of Him, pray to Him or meditate on Him, you are not to be blamed. After all, you are not the doer; God is the only Doer.</p>
<p>I am telling you, if you really believe what you say, how can you remain on earth even for a fleeting second without remembering God consciously, praying to Him devotedly and meditating on Him soulfully? For is God not part and parcel of your consciousness?</p>  </div>
