<p>We were at the Springfield Diner celebrating the birthday of one of the disciples. I went to the counter and asked them to bring a cake to the table and to put candles on the cake. The lady looked puzzled, so again I said, "I would like candles on the cake."</p>
<p>Finally the waitress brought the cake to the table, along with half a cantaloup. She was about to put the cantaloup on top of the cake when everybody started laughing. They asked her what she was doing.</p>
<p>She said, "You asked me to put cantaloup on the cake."</p>
<p>I said, "No, I asked you to put candles on the cake."</p>
<p>So this is how she understood my English!</p>
