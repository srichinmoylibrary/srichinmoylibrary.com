<p>How consciousness ascends and descends! This morning I forgot to take a towel for myself when I went out to walk. I desperately needed one, so one of the boys went out and bought me two small towels. Then I appreciated him and extolled him to the skies. He was very happy.</p>
<p>The next moment, his consciousness descended! I asked him to go and bring prasad. I looked at his face and I saw such hesitation on his face. Here I was appreciating and admiring him and the next moment he was showing such hesitation. I thought that perhaps he had no money, but I know that you all believe in credit cards. So I asked him what was wrong. He said that in his mind he wanted to go out for a run, and that is why he felt sad that he had to go to the store.</p>
<p>Previously, he developed such sympathetic oneness with me that he literally ran to get towels. Then when I appreciated him, his consciousness descended. His oneness only lasted for a few fleeting seconds.</p>
<p>Like this, everybody goes up and down, up and down.</p>
