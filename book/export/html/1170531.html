SCA 73-77. Interview by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. On 6 January 1994 Sri Chinmoy was interviewed live by telephone on the radio programme <em>As it Happens</em>, for broadcast over CBC Canada. This is a transcript of that interview.</p>
<h2>Interviewer: Sri Chinmoy is not your ordinary, everyday Guru. He and his disciples are known for completing tasks of amazing magnitude. Record-setting feats of endurance are among the ways Sri Chinmoy and his followers pursue inner calm. The latest feat was just finished: one million sketches, and every one a bird â€” a million birds of peace. Sri Chinmoy himself has completed the sketches to celebrate the birthday today of Raisa Gorbachev. We have reached international artist and peace ambassador, Sri Chinmoy, in Suva, Fiji. Sri Chinmoy, you must be very pleased that you successfully drew one million birds. You must be glad that it is over.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I am extremely glad that it is all over. Each bird reminds me of freedom, and I feel that freedom lives in peace and nowhere else.</p>  </div>
