<p><em>Yogi:</em> Perhaps you do not know the real reason. You know, long, long ago, long before my full realisation, there was a time when God listened to me more than I listened to him, so now God is paying me back through my disciples. On achieving my highest realisation, I have really become a good boy. I always listen to Him in my life of aspiration, realisation, revelation and manifestation.</p>  </div>
