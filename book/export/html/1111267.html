  <h1 class="book-heading">The race</h1>
  
 
<p>This morning at 4:30, when I made a turn off 150th Street onto the Grand Central service road at the half-mile mark, I passed a very thin, old man who was half drunk and very dirty.</p>
<p>He said to me, "I can beat you walking." I smiled at him. Then he started walking very fast for forty metres, but I was still a little ahead of him.</p>
<p>Then I told him, "<em>You</em> run. I can beat you walking."</p>
<p>So he started running and I started walking. I stayed behind him deliberately; otherwise, I could have easily defeated him.</p>
<p>He said, "Oh, now we are even." He could not defeat me when he was walking and I could not beat him when I was walking.</p>
