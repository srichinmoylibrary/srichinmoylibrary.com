<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I see that the United Nations has a definite role to play in enlightening the life of mankind. But it is not the outer music that will do the needful. It will be the inner music, the heart's music, which continuously feels and makes others feel that we are of the One and for the many. The inner music makes us feel that the many are only our own extended and expanded reality. So it will not be instrumental music or vocal music but the psychic music of the United Nations that can and will enlighten mankind.</p>
