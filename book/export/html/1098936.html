<p>Since 1964 I have had the greatest fondness for Woodstock. I started going there in May 1964 and every time I go there, I strengthen my desire to have a very soulful and peaceful place there where many, many seekers can come and meditate. But, alas, my desire has still not been fulfilled.</p>
<p>On Friday evenings, after finishing work at the Consulate, I used to catch the Greyhound bus to Woodstock from Grand Central Station. A few times I got lost. In front of the bus, it said Woodstock, but for some reason I would enter into another bus by mistake.</p>
<p>One Friday it was snowing. Even in that weather I went to catch the bus to Woodstock after work. When I got off the bus, I had to walk half a mile. There was no light, nothing, and it was snowing so heavily.</p>
<p>I had many, many spiritual experiences in Woodstock. I used to meditate on the top of a particular hill. I had a special spotâ€”a dry, arid piece of woods. I was very fond of that place and I used to go there early in the morning to meditate. I felt such joy meditating there on the top of the hill.</p>
<p>Then one of my sponsors, Mrs. Ann Harrison, would come and ask me a volley of questions about spirituality. I answered endless questions of hers. If all the questions and answers had been recorded, I would have had at least twenty extra books. Luckily or unluckily she was not a stenographer.</p>  </div>
