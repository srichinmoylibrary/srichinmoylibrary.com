<p>Today, while I was cycling, the soul of Durdam’s dog Boomer came to watch me. Boomer died just recently.</p>
<p>Usually, the bell on my stationary bike rings after ten minutes and I stop cycling, but this morning when it rang I had not finished the specific meditation that I wanted to do, so I had to continue.</p>
