<p>When Subhas escaped his Bengal home for Kabul,<br /> What did he see?<br /> He saw Mother India's proudest smile<br /> Inside his heart-tears<br /> Along with the three material possessions he carried:<br /> A picture of Mother Kali,<br /> A string of tulsi beads<br /> And a copy of the Bhagavad Gita.<br /> This is indeed Subhas, the seeker immortal,<br /> In every sense of the term.</p>
