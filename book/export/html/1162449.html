<p><em>The poems in this final volume of</em> Seventy-Seven Thousand Service-Trees <em>were mostly written by Sri Chinmoy while he was visiting Malaysia, in January and February 2006, and Bulgaria and Thailand, in January and February 2007 — a few months before he left this world on 11 October 2007.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy embarked upon this marathon poetic odyssey on 24 January 1998 at 4:30 a.m., just three hours after completing his series</em> Twenty-Seven Thousand Aspiration-Plants, <em>which had taken him fourteen and a half years to write. By contrast, he wrote the fifty thousand poems completed of the</em> Service-Trees <em>series in just over nine years — a truly remarkable achievement.</em></p>
<p><em>On the day he began that creative journey, while he was visiting Cancun, Mexico, with a group of his students, he recounted the experience in the following chapter.</em></p>  </div>
