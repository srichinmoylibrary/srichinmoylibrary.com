<p>Last nightâ€™s weightlifting performance went extremely well. It lasted for so many hours. When I came home, my body was aching all over. I could not go upstairs except by crawling. This morning I did not come down until half past twelve. I am unable to walk still. The disciples place a chair in front of me and I lean on it to take a step. Then they move the chair and I take another step. Tonight at midnight we are leaving for Canada by bus.</p>
