<p>In London I went shopping in the Indian district. When I was finished, the store owner called a taxi company to send a taxi for me. The taxi came and I saw that the driver was a real rogue. He and his friend, who was another rogue, were sitting in the front seat. I told the driver where I was going, and then I said, "It has to be a flat rate," because they looked like such rogues.</p>
<p>Immediately they said, "Five and a half pounds."</p>
<p>I said, "When I came to this store from the hotel with an English taxi driver, it said seven pounds on the meter. Why are you asking for only five and a half pounds?"</p>
<p>The driver said, "Because you are an Indian and you look like a saintly person. Otherwise if you had not been an Indian, we would have asked for twelve pounds and driven here, there, everywhere."</p>
<p>I said, "I will give you seven pounds. But definitely you are going to take me to the right place? Are you sure you know the place?"</p>
<p>They said, "Yes, we know the place. We have been driving for so many years."</p>
<p>The whole way there they were talking about their relatives in America. They did bring me to the right hotel and let me off at the right place. I had told them that I would give them seven pounds, but when they stopped in front of the hotel I gave them eight pounds.</p>
<p>I said, "You people can be nice and I can also be nice." Then I told them, "Don't deceive people anymore!"</p>
<p>They said they would try, and they will.</p>
<p>Sarada Devi had this kind of experience with a dacoit [robber] once. When she called him "Father," the dacoit became like her father. The following day he let her go.</p>
