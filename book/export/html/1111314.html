<p>When I was in Madras, I ran twelve miles in the Madras heat. Afterwards, I went to a store to get some soda.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four, five, six sodas I drank one by one. The owner laughed and laughed.</p>
<p>I said to him, "Why are you laughing? You go and run twelve miles!"</p>
<p>He said, "I won't be able to run even half a mile."</p>
