<p>Unlike others<br /> He has only two<br /> Theoretical problems:<br /> Nobody cares for him;<br /> God does not love him.</p>
<p>Unlike others<br /> He has only two<br /> Practical problems:<br /> Since he does not<br /> Belong either to this world<br /> Or to any world,<br /> He needs a world created by himself<br /> And not those<br /> Already created by God.</p>
