<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind <em>can</em> be self-giving like the heart. But right now the mind that we use is the limited mind. When we live in the mind, we feel that we have only five cents and if we give it away, then we will have nothing. But there is also an unlimited mind. If we become one with the unlimited mind, then there is no question of becoming empty-handed in life. If the mind comes to feel that it is limitless, then no matter how much it gives of its own, it remains infinite.</p>  </div>
