<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, I am not a seeker. To be quite frank, I am a realised soul. At my will I can, at any moment, enter into my highest trance where I am totally one with the Transcendental Consciousness.</p>
<p>But God the Infinite is constantly transcending His own Transcendental Consciousness and creating new worlds of Infinite Peace, Joy and Delight. So although I am fully God-realised, I am still a seeker in the sense that I seek with God His ever-transcending and ever-unfolding Creation. In this sense, I am an eternal seeker.</p>  </div>
