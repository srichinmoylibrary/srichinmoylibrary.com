<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First we have to know whether intellectual activities have given us what we want. If we feel that intellectual activities have not given us abiding satisfaction, then we value the heart more than the mind. Unfortunately, we feel that the reason we are not discovering the truth through the intellect is because we are not properly illumined or not properly dealing with the intellect. We donâ€™t realise that there is no chance of finding the ultimate Truth or Reality in the intellect. Right now we have the feeling that the intellect can give us as adequate an answer as the heart. But a day will come when we will feel that it is only the heart that can give us the real answer. Once the heart brings us that answer, we shall then bring it into the intellect. The physical mind and the intellect will not always remain unillumined. Everything has to be illumined eventually. But we have to get illumination from where it is available, and then bring it where it is not yet available.</p>  </div>
