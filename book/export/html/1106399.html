<p>I am lifting today after so many days. I have not been feeling well for many days. I do my weightlifting one day and then I am compelled to take rest for four or five days, all because of weakness of the body. My body absolutely revolts.</p>
<p>I am so dissatisfied with my 300 pounds. That is why I did not put it on the video. It is a waste of expensive tape. My left hand is going, but my right hand is horrible, horrible, horrible. It is too discouraging!</p>
