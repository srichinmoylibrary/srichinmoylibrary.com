<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Heaven’s philosophy for ordinary people is that there is no vacancy in Heaven unless you become very good! Heaven will say, “There is no vacancy in my hotel!” And hell’s philosophy is, “Come, come, there is plenty of room here. If you do not want to pay, no harm. Just come so that I can have a huge army to fight against Heaven.” Heaven is very careful in choosing whom it will admit. Heaven will see whether we have done good things. If there is no merit, no virtue in our life on earth, then Heaven will say: “There is no vacancy here, sorry.”</p>  </div>
