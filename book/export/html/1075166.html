<p>THEY FORGET</p>
<p>The old forget<br /> That they have an unpardonable past.</p>
<p>The young do not know<br /> That they have an insurmountable future.</p>
<p>The old do not know<br /> That God has decided to forgive them,<br /> Their sordid past.<br /> Today, this very day.</p>
<p>The young forget<br /> That God is eager to help them<br /> Surmount the heights of their future.<br /> Today, this very day.</p>
