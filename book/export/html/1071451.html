<p>A divinely inspired dream,<br /> daring and desperate;<br /> A surprise that made history:<br /> A farmer’s son founds the New World.<br /> “Inferior endowment from nature,”<br /> he thought of himself.<br /> But the Divine made him<br /> His efficient instrument.<br /> High character and majestic will<br /> Powerfully blended with courage<br /> and capacity:<br /> Thus stood forth the Man of the Hour,<br /> The Man of Destiny, the Man of God.<br /> And from his mighty dream<br /> mightily executed<br /> Burst forth a new free world,<br /> Destined to be the hope and defence<br /> Of more free worlds to be.<br /> Victory in the War of independence:<br /> England lost to her own offspring.<br /> England won for herself a mightier friend.<br /> A new era heralded,<br /> A new shattering blow<br /> Struck at man’s domination over man:<br /> Independence the first step to unity,<br /> And unity, one Truth of God.<br /> George Washington, first to embody<br /> America’s hope,<br /> First in inspiration, first in confidence,<br /> First in war, first in victory,<br /> First in conquering the heart of his Nation,<br /> First to envisage a federation of states,<br /> Single, powerful, united, whole.</p>
