<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why not? While you are discussing something with someone, you just imagine or envision that you are becoming one with the person's breath. These are occult powers of the lowest class- lowest, but most effective, because children also can play with occult power. Gradually, gradually you will become an expert and at that time you can compel the other person to breathe with you, instead of waiting to see when he breathes in. So when you breathe in, if you identify with him, then his breath and your breath are becoming one.</p>  </div>
