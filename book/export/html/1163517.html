<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you remain in the highest consciousness, totally identified with me, then on the strength of your identification and your oneness with me, you have all the capacities. But when the connection is cut off and oneness is not complete, at that time you belong to yourself. You maintain your own individuality and personality. Because of that limited individuality and personality, you cannot manifest the capacity within you.</p>
<p>At the highest level, there is no examination; reality in its entirety is there. But when you are even one rung below the highest, you feel that a kind of examination starts, because with limited capacities you are trying to accomplish the unlimited. That is why a kind of examination is going on. Again, when you are in the highest, at that time everything is unlimited. You claim the highest as your own, so there is no test. The Infinite remains with the Infinite. There is no incapacity as such in the highest. It is complete. In my highest, I am absolutely complete. When I am absolutely in the Highest itself, then Eternity, Infinity and Immortality are not vague terms; they are reality, absolute reality.</p>  </div>
