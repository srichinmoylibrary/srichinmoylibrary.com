<p><em>Florida International University</em></p>
<p><em>April 21, 1998</em></p>
<p>Dear Sri Chinmoy:</p>
<p>It gives me great pleasure to invite you to speak at Florida International University in the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, on May 26, 1998 as a visiting philosopher.</p>
<p>I have had the privilege of meeting you before, and I am sure your audience at FIU will be delighted to hear your words, your music, and your presence. The Department of Religious Studies is working with the local Sri Chinmoy Centre on all arrangements, and we look forward to seeing you in Miami next month, and to presenting you with a plaque honoring you as "India's Peace-Service-Tree" to mark this auspicious occasion.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Nathan Katz</p>
<p>Professor and Chair<br />Department of Religious Studies<br />University Park, Miami, Florida 33199<br />Equal Opportunity/Equal Access Employer and Institution<br />Wertheim Performing Arts Center<br /> Florida International University<br />Miami</p>
