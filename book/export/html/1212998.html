<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, you have delivered hundreds of speeches. Have your talks ever had a <em>forensic</em> quality?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> No, Madal, my talks have never had a <em>legal, debating</em> quality. Since I am very clever and lucky, I do not instigate unhealthy arguments and silly disputes. My talks offer peace and light, and my kind audiences receive sincerely, devotedly and graciously the peace and light that I offer to them.</p>  </div>
