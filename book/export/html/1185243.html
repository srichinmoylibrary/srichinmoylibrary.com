<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you can offer all your actions, good and bad, to God, then the problems that you are seeing all around you will no longer be problems. You will see that they are only experiences that the Inner Pilot is having in and through you. He is the Doer, He is the experiences and, at the same time, He is the Observer. The moment you can surrender the action and the fruit of your action, your part is over. Then you will see that the way you see the truth is not the way that God sees the truth. He sees the truth from a different angle, from a very high plane of Consciousness. When you become one with Him, you will see that each action has a purpose. Now, nothing seems to have a purpose; everything, everyone seems like a mad elephant trampling here and there. But a day will come when if you budge even an inch, you will understand the reason for it. Outwardly, we see that the Game is very painful; but when we are able to enter into the soul, we find that there is a purpose which only the soul can tell us. The heart is convinced that there is a purpose, but what the actual purpose is, only the soul can say.</p>  </div>
