<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“When you start singing, I wish to tell you that I am compelled to leave the house because you don’t sing at all. You just weep and scream. And what do my neighbours and friends think?

This is the first time I have seen a restaurant that has that kind of sincere and bold policy.”</p>
<p>The waitress said: “Yes, tips are forbidden. No tips here. True! But where is here? You read the sign at the door, at the entrance, but here on your table you don’t see that kind of notice. So you may revise your opinion. Tips are not required at the entrance, but since America is the land of freedom, you may exercise your freedom wherever you can.”</p>  </div>

<p>Then the wife said: “Since, Your Honour, you have fulfilled his wish, will you also fulfil my wish?”</p>
<p>The judge said, “First of all, I have to hear it.”</p>

<p>Two friends following two different spiritual paths met in the subway. One of them put his hand into the other’s pocket. His friend said: “What are you doing?”</p>

<p>“What is your Master’s message?”</p>
<p>“My Master’s message is that we are all one, inseparably and eternally one. Therefore, when I put my hand into your pocket, I clearly felt that I was putting my hand into my own pocket.”</p>

<p>“What is your Master’s message?”</p>

<p>A spiritual Master was once asked by another spiritual Master a very simple question: “Tell me, who are your good disciples?”</p>
<p>The second spiritual Master said: “My good disciples are those who are very jealous.”</p>
<p>“Your jealous disciples are your good disciples? Then who are your best disciples?”</p>
<p>“My best disciples are those persons who are most jealous.”</p>
<p>The first spiritual Master said: “I don’t understand you. How can your most devoted, your best disciples be those who have the most jealousy?”</p>
<p>The Master replied: “Look, the disciples who are the most jealous are helping me kick the bucket, helping me to withdraw from the earth scene as soon as possible in utter disgust.”</p>  </div>
