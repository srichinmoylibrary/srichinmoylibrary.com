<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From meditation. From my concentration, meditation and contemplation. I was in a spiritual institution for twenty years, from the age of twelve up to thirty-two. You study in the school, college and university and get your Master’s degree. Similarly, if you spend say, fourteen, sixteen, twenty years in spiritual practices, naturally you will also get inner knowledge in abundant measure. From the age of twelve right up to thirty-two, I went through rigorous spiritual discipline — concentration, meditation and so on. It took me ten hours, twelve hours, fourteen hours daily to achieve what little I have right now in the inner life. When you enter into deep spiritual life, one day you know, you discover your own hidden truth. The truth is within you, within everyone, but unfortunately it is inside a box, a treasure box. The wealth is inside the box. Now, as here your professors are teaching you, they are offering you knowledge and you are gaining knowledge and wisdom; so also when one concentrates, meditates and contemplates, one enters into the world of inner Wisdom, inner light. From there he can bring to the fore at his sweet will the light, the bliss and power that he has achieved.</p>  </div>
