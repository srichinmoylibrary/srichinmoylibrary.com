<p>Right from the beginning I had confidence that I would lift 2,000 pounds in the calf raise. So I said, “Today is the day to show off my muscles.”</p>
<p>I wanted to put oil on my calves to show off, but there was no oil downstairs. I was so lazy; I didn’t want to go upstairs to get the oil. I found some “body-bath” yellow lotion, but it seems it had no oil in it. As soon as I put it on, it disappeared. If it had had a little oil in it, it would have remained on the skin, but it did not last.</p>
