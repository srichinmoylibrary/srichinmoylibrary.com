<p>When I said to God,<br /> "God, I shall leave You,"<br /> A look of pain crossed His beautiful Face.</p>
<p>When I said to God,<br /> "God, I shall stay with You<br /> No matter what You do to me,"<br /> God jumped up out of His Throne,<br />   Gave me His Throne,<br />   Gave me His Crown,<br />   Gave me His Heart,<br />   Gave me His All<br />        And said<br />   I was not only a son of His<br />        And<br />   A vision-fulfilling reality of His<br />        But<br />   His Eternity's All.</p>
