<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A sincere Master will always say that he and the seeker have to work together. The Master says he will not be able to grant the seeker realisation overnight. If the Master says he will grant the seeker realisation if the seeker gives him millions of dollars, then that Master is false. The true teacher says to the seeker, "You show me your aspiration and I shall show you God's Compassion. I shall unite both God's Compassion and your aspiration. When they come together, then you become perfect." The real Master will always tell the seeker that there is something called God's Hour. It is then that God grants the seeker realisation. There is an hour for preparation and an hour for realisation. When we sow a seed, it takes time to germinate; then gradually it becomes a sapling and finally a tree. Until it becomes a tree, until it offers fruit, it is in the process of preparation. But when the tree bears fruit, it completes its journey. It is no longer preparation; it is realisation.</p>  </div>
