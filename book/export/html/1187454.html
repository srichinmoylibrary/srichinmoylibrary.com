<p>Each soulful thought<br /> Enjoys a weightless flight<br /> To its unparalleled destination:<br /> God-Silence.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187456" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1802</h1>
  
 

<p>Indomitable will power,<br /> Universal oneness-love,<br /> Sacrifice of peace, light and joy<br /> In boundless measure for humanity:<br /> These are his soul's qualities<br /> That are being manifested<br /> In and through his life on earth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187457" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1803</h1>
  
 

<p>When your soul's qualities<br /> Come forward and start manifesting,<br /> Then not only your world<br /> Of outer running<br /> But also your world<br /> Of inner running<br /> Will acquire a very special significance.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187458" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1804</h1>
  
 

<p>In the outer consciousness<br /> You have already established<br /> Something immortal.<br /> Now you must do the same<br /> In the inner consciousness<br /> With your heart's cry for mankind<br /> And your life's love for mankind.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187459" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1805</h1>
  
 

<p>The loving and soothing zephyr<br /> Of my Lord's Compassion-Sea<br /> Has time and again saved my life<br /> From its hidden destruction-imperfections.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187460" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1806</h1>
  
 

<p>Everybody is appreciating,<br /> Admiring and adoring<br /> Your outer achievements.<br /> But you have to know<br /> That this outer glory<br /> Lasts only for a fleeting moment.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187461" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1807</h1>
  
 

<p>When we think of the outer man,<br /> We are fascinated<br /> Because he has shown something great<br /> To mankind.<br /> But when we think of the inner man,<br /> We are illumined<br /> Because he has done something good<br /> For God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187462" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1808</h1>
  
 

<p>When the outer man does something,<br /> The world immediately gets<br /> Tremendous joy and ecstasy.<br /> Then the outer achievement<br /> Fades into oblivion.<br /> But when the inner man does something,<br /> It forever and forever lasts.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187463" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1809</h1>
  
 

<p>Why do you dwell<br /> On the past?<br /> The past does not determine<br /> The future.<br /> Only your prayer and meditation<br /> Will determine your future.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187464" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1810</h1>
  
 

<p>Like your fellow seekers,<br /> Can you not also try<br /> To become good?<br /> Just try.<br /> You will undoubtedly succeed.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187465" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1811</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Do allow my present<br /> To pay the penalty<br /> For my undivine past.<br /> I do hope in the future<br /> I will have the capacity<br /> To march along the road of sainthood.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187466" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1812</h1>
  
 

<p>Are you in life's prison cell?<br /> Then can you not take God's Help?<br /> He will purify and illumine your nature<br /> So that you can enjoy<br /> Your soul's freedom.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187467" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1813</h1>
  
 

<p>It may take the outer man<br /> Many, many centuries,<br /> But finally<br /> At God's choice Hour<br /> The outer man<br /> Will definitely<br /> Grow into the inner man.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187468" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1814</h1>
  
 

<p>The outer man<br /> Collects the quintessence<br /> Of countless experiences<br /> During his earthly sojourn.<br /> But the inner man<br /> Already has the infinite wealth,<br /> The inner wealth.<br /> In fact,<br /> The inner man eternally is<br /> What the outer man<br /> Is so desperately longing for.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187469" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1815</h1>
  
 

<p>Each time the mind<br /> Goes beyond the confusion-barrier,<br /> It sees immediately<br /> The perpetual dawn of the heart's awakening.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187470" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1816</h1>
  
 

<p>Outwardly<br /> He is the greatest champion<br /> Of the world.<br /> But inwardly<br /> He is something<br /> Infinitely more powerful<br /> And infinitely more beautiful:<br /> The supreme hero-warrior<br /> To fight against humanity's ignorance.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187471" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1817</h1>
  
 

<p>He has proved<br /> Something unprecedented:<br /> The outer man<br /> Of unparalleled name and fame<br /> Can soulfully bow<br /> To the inner man,<br /> Who is eternally the ambassador<br /> Of the Absolute Supreme on earth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187472" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1818</h1>
  
 

<p>The outer man<br /> Says to the inner man:<br /> "What I have<br /> Is all for you."</p>
<p>The inner man<br /> Says to the outer man:<br /> "What I am<br /> Is and will forever be<br /> All yours."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187473" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1819</h1>
  
 

<p>In his highest meditation<br /> He became what his outer life<br /> At times consciously,<br /> At times unconsciously,<br /> Had been searching for.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187474" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1820</h1>
  
 

<p>If you want to discover<br /> Your inner life,<br /> You have to walk along<br /> The path of the heart,<br /> Where there is<br /> Universal Love, universal Peace<br /> And universal Light and Delight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187475" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1821</h1>
  
 

<p>Achieve something great outwardly.<br /> Many on earth will admire you<br /> And even adore you<br /> For what you have done.</p>
<p>Achieve something good inwardly.<br /> Countless people will get<br /> A tremendous inner uplift<br /> From your very presence on earth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187476" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1822</h1>
  
 

<p>There are two roads:<br /> The road of the mind<br /> And the road of the heart.<br /> By God's infinite Grace<br /> Right from the start<br /> You have chosen the correct road:<br /> The road of the heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187477" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1823</h1>
  
 

<p>I am grateful to God,<br /> For His world-family<br /> Is quite happy<br /> To receive my affection, concern,<br /> Love and oneness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187478" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1824</h1>
  
 

<p>Like the offering of a world Saviour,<br /> The self-offering of the inner man<br /> Elevates the consciousness<br /> Of each individual on earth<br /> And of each soul yet to come<br /> Into the world.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187479" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1825</h1>
  
 

<p>Why do you need to search<br /> For outer beauty?<br /> The beauty of your soul's colour<br /> Permeates the entire world.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187480" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1826</h1>
  
 

<p>When you become the inner man<br /> You establish a constant<br /> And sleepless reality<br /> That lasts for Eternity.<br /> You build something immortal<br /> For the earth-consciousness,<br /> Something for its permanent use.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187481" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1827</h1>
  
 

<p>Each human life will eventually<br /> Be perfected and fulfilled<br /> By a world of bitter and sweet dreams.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187482" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1828</h1>
  
 

<p>You are approaching the spiritual life.<br /> Do you know what you want?<br /> You want to be<br /> The dearest, closest and most perfect<br /> Instrument of God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187483" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1829</h1>
  
 

<p>When are you going to believe<br /> That God is using you<br /> As a supreme instrument of His?<br /> I can clearly see that in and through<br /> Your outer existence<br /> God is offering a new Vision<br /> To the world.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187484" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1830</h1>
  
 

<p>Undoubtedly you are a good soul.<br /> But in the heat of the moment<br /> Even a good soul<br /> Can do something very bad.<br /> So, be careful!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187485" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1831</h1>
  
 

<p>Why do you feel<br /> That you are very bad by nature?<br /> Unless you feel<br /> That you have come into the world<br /> To do something good,<br /> You may go from bad to worse,<br /> And then finally<br /> You will be washed away<br /> Both in the inner world<br /> And in the outer world.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187486" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1832</h1>
  
 

<p>There was a time<br /> When you had many divine qualities.<br /> But now what has happened?<br /> The undivine forces have caught you<br /> And made you their instrument.<br /> You have yourself become<br /> Nothing other than<br /> An undivine force.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187487" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1833</h1>
  
 

<p>If you want to make<br /> Illumining and fulfilling progress<br /> Constantly,<br /> Then do not cherish yesterday's dreams.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187488" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1834</h1>
  
 

<p>Even if you have done something<br /> Very wrong,<br /> Do not give up hope.<br /> Your inner divinity<br /> Can once again come to the fore.<br /> Just consciously become<br /> A student of God.<br /> You and God will cheerfully<br /> Be able to claim each other.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187489" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1835</h1>
  
 

<p>Inside me there is Someone<br /> Eternal, infinite and immortal.<br /> Who is that Person?<br /> God, and nobody else.<br /> Now you want to know<br /> Who my God is.<br /> My God is my own<br /> Transcendental Self.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187490" class="section-2">

<div id="node-1187493" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1839</h1>
  
 

<p>Concentration gives us victory,<br /> But we need meditation<br /> To maintain our victory-joy<br /> When fear and doubt<br /> Threaten to take it away.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187494" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1840</h1>
  
 

<p>Some seekers do not yet have<br /> Any inner wealth.<br /> They have just started<br /> Acquiring it.<br /> But you have a great advantage,<br /> For inwardly you already have<br /> Something very special:<br /> Your selfless oneness-heart with God.<br /> Now you only have to become<br /> Fully aware of it.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187495" class="section-2">

<p>Concentration<br /> Is the midday sun-power.<br /> As soon as you see this sun,<br /> Your entire being is flooded with strength.</p>

<p>His mind was not accustomed<br /> To the Eastern meditation-philosophy.<br /> But his beautiful and soulful heart<br /> Of love, good will, fondness and oneness<br /> Was fully prepared<br /> To follow the already familiar<br /> Meditation-path.</p>

<p>God has told me<br /> That He grants me special Blessings<br /> When I compose soulful songs.<br /> He has also told me<br /> That He then stays beside me,<br /> Not ninety-nine per cent<br /> For me<br /> But absolutely one hundred per cent<br /> For me, for me.</p>
