<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why did He create you? Why did He create me? For the sake of spontaneous joy. When astronomers look at the stars, they get joy. In this world you may find that flowers give you joy. Others will like the stars, and still others will like something else. God created everything for His own Joy, and the different parts of His creation get joy from each other. I get joy by seeing something; you get joy by seeing something else. God gets Joy from all of His creation.</p>  </div>
