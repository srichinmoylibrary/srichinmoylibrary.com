<p>Amrita-da gave me a new job in the evening. He said to me: "Chinmoy, beginning tomorrow you will help me work on the cheques that the Mother receives every day. Let me tell you what to do." Nolini-da came into the room and Amrita-da said to him: "Beginning tomorrow, Chinmoy will help me in my work."</p>
<p>"I do hope that my work will not suffer," Nolini-da said.</p>
<p>Amrita-da said: "I assure you that will never be." Then both of them exchanged amused and soulful smiles.</p>  </div>
