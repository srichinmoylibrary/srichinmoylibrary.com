    <title>Question: You said that a spiritual Master is a practical man because he wants to bring God to men. But is it practical for someone involved in the world to aspire?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The problem is that we have no conception of spirituality. We think that a spiritual man has to leave the world and live in a cave; otherwise, how can he be spiritual? But in real spirituality, man has not to leave the world in order to realise God. Where is God? God is inside your heart, inside everybodyâ€™s heart.</p>
<p>A spiritual man should be a normal man, a sound man. God Himself is normal; He is not insane. In order to reach God, a spiritual person has to be divinely practical in his day-to-day activities. Spirituality does not negate the outer life. But we have to know that the outer life does not mean the animal life. The outer life should be the manifestation of the divine life within us.</p>  </div>
