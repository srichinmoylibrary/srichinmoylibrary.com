<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He had confidence that he would find them. Ramakrishna was so strict in accepting disciples. First he used to see occultly, then he used to read the palm and the forehead, and then he used to look into their eyes. He used to accept disciples only after examining them in so many ways. He was not satisfied with seeing only their souls. I scold my disciples when they enjoy ignorance, but I don’t insult them in public. Ramakrishna used to insult people in front of everyone.</p>  </div>
