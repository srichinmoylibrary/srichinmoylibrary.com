<p>Action need not be wisdom, but wisdom is not only action but the fruitful fulfilment of action.</p>
<p>The sense of responsibility is the beginning of action. The sense of willingness is the speed of action. The sense of selflessness is the grand culmination of action.</p>
<p>Hesitation is a bad enemy of action. Procrastination is a worse one. Readiness is a good friend of action. Devotedness is a better one.</p>
<p>Silence is the God-action of God for His entire creation. Sound is the man-action of man for man himself. When a noisy action proceeds, the goal quickly recedes. When a soundless action proceeds, the goal itself approaches the seeker's onward speed.</p>
<p>Actions reveal thoughts. Thoughts reveal the mind. The mind reveals the greedy man in us.</p>
<p>Action is the harbinger of earth's perfection. Perfection is the harbinger of the manifesting man's satisfaction and the evolving God's Satisfaction.</p>
<p>A great action makes us feel that the world needs us. A good action reminds us always of its source: God the Author of all good.</p>  </div>
