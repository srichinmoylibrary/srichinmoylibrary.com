<p>When I was lifting at the tennis court this morning, Dhananjaya took so many pictures. But when I was lifting with the heaviest people — Amayik, Byron, Sahishnu and others — at that time he was so amazed that he didn’t take any pictures. Can you imagine?</p>
<p>He came up to me and said, “Can you forgive me?”</p>
<p>But he had taken so many other excellent pictures before that.</p>
