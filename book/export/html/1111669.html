<p>During a two-mile race in Alley Pond Park, I saw a husband and wife who were also running. After twelve hundred metres the wife was unable to keep pace with the husband, and she wanted to give up. But the husband was encouraging her to continue. He was saying, "This is discipline. If you don't have discipline, you can't accomplish anything."</p>
<p>I thought, "This mantra that he is saying is absolutely descending from Heaven. God is speaking to her through her husband." I was so moved.</p>
