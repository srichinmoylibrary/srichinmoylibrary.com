SPOP 3-9. Questions following the talk <em>Spiritual power, occult power and will power</em>.</p>
<h2>Question: Can you speak about your spiritual teachings?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My teachings are that we do not neglect the body and we do not neglect the soul. We need the soul to realise the highest absolute Truth; and we need the body for the manifestation of the highest absolute Truth. The body is the temple and the soul is the shrine. In the spiritual life we give importance to physical fitness and also we give importance to the soul. We need both for complete realisation and for complete manifestation: the soul for complete realisation and the body for complete manifestation.</p>  </div>
