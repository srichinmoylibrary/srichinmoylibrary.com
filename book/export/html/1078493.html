<p>MY PRESENT WISDOM-LIGHT</p>
<p>I developed my first fear<br /> By thinking that God did not care for me.<br /> I developed my second fear<br /> By thinking that God did not need me.<br /> I developed my third and last fear<br /> By thinking that God did not create me.</p>
<p>But now I know<br /> How stupid I was.<br /> And now I do something<br /> Really significant and wise:<br /> I do not allow my present wisdom-light<br /> To mix with my ex-stupidity-night.</p>
