<p>I was coming back home around twelve-thirty. About three hundred metres from my apartment was a small hospital, with windows facing the street. One fellow was standing on the street drinking and calling for his girlfriend: "Sally! Open the window. I want to see you. I have not seen you for a long time. " He was screaming up to the second or third floor for the patient, Sally, to open the window and talk to him.</p>
<p>But she was not opening the window. Another man from upstairs started screaming at the drunk fellow: "What are you doing at this hour?" He used all American slang, screaming at him from the third floor.</p>  </div>
