<p>Once a Brahmin met a scholar walking in the street. The Brahmin was holding a copy of the Gita, and his eyes were swimming in a sea of tears. The scholar thought that the Brahmin was unable to understand some of the teachings of the Gita. He came to the Brahmin and said, “Don’t cry, I have come here to help you. Tell me, where do you find it difficult, which particular sloka don’t you understand? I shall explain it to you.”</p>
<p>The Brahmin replied, “I am weeping because I see the Lord Krishna right in front of me. No matter what page I turn to, I see Arjuna’s chariot. I see Arjuna’s charioteer, Krishna. These are my psychic tears. I see my Lord in all the pages, I see Sri Krishna in his chariot. That is why I am shedding tears. It is not that I do not understand the teachings of the Gita.”</p>
<p>The scholar came to his senses.</p>  </div>
