<p><em>(The Master is with two male disciples, Insincerity and Impurity, and two female disciples, Jealousy and Insecurity.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Insincerity, you are killing me. Impurity, you are killing me. Jealousy, you are killing me. Insecurity, you are killing me.</p>
<p>INSINCERITY: Master, I know that I am insincere, but please tell me how I can become sincere.</p>
<p>MASTER: Fast for one day. Fast today for the whole day, and tomorrow come and see me.</p>
<p>IMPURITY: Master, I know I am impure, but please tell me how I can be pure.</p>
<p>MASTER: Fast today. Don't eat anything. Come back tomorrow.</p>
<p>JEALOUSY: Master, I know I am jealous. But how can I get rid of my jealousy? Please tell me.</p>
<p>MASTER: Fast today. Eat nothing at all. Tomorrow come and see me.</p>
<p>INSECURITY: Master, I know I am insecure. At every moment I am insecure. Please tell me how I can be secure, how I can have confidence in my life.</p>
<p>MASTER: Don't eat anything today. Fast. Don't have even a glass of water. Come back tomorrow and I shall tell you how you can have a life of security. All of you go home and come back to me tomorrow. I shall tell you <em>(to the boys)</em> how you can be sincere and pure, and how you <em>(to the girls)</em> can get rid of jealousy and insecurity.</p>  </div>
