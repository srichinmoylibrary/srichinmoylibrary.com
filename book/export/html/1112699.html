<p>Before I left for Puerto Rico, my dentist said that my teeth were in "top shape." But while I was in Puerto Rico, I had such tooth pain! My gums were badly swollen and I had an abscess. So I had to take penicillin, this drug and that drug. What an experience!</p>
<p>I went to one dentist, a young man, who said to me, "I have seen you many times, not in this capacity, but in another capacity." He had seen me many times on television in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>The following day when I went back, he said, "It is a great pleasure to serve you. You are a man of insight." Then he said, "But I am sorry, I can't help you."</p>
<p>He refused to take money for the x-rays he had taken.</p>  </div>
