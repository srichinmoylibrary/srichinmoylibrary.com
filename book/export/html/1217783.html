<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible. We think we must have a plan first and then we can achieve success in the future, that we are progressing and we are going to fulfil our plan. But in God's case, it is not like that. God sees the past, the present and the future at a glance. So an aspirant; by constant aspiration, identifies himself with God's consciousness. Whatever he does, he does it spontaneously. It becomes an act of intuition.</p>
<p>Now we are labouring with our minds. The mind says, "I have to achieve something. I have to think about how I can execute the plan." This is how the mind acts. But when you are one with God, you do not utilise the mind. You always act from your own inner consciousness, with an intuitive faculty. And. when we develop that intuitive faculty, we can easily act without having a plan.</p>
<p>At each moment, the possibility of the total manifestation that is going to take place will come right in front of you and materialise. Now you are thinking that within, let us say, ten or twenty days, some possibility may materialise concerning your hopes and aspirations. But when you are one with God's Consciousness, it is more than a possibility. It is an inevitability, an immediate achievement. The vision and the fulfilment go together. In the ordinary human consciousness, the vision is something and the fulfilment is something else. But when you are one with God's consciousness, the vision and the fulfilment are inseparable.</p>
<p>About the vision and its fulfilment, how do you know that you are having the right "vision"?</p>
<p>You can easily know it. Are you referring to yourself or someone else? If it is yourself, I can tell you easily. I know that in your meditation, there are times when you go very deep, and your inner voice tells you, on the spur of the moment, that something has already been done. The mind does not come and impose its ideas on that voice, saying, "If you do this, perhaps it will be a mistake; don't do that, what will happen in the future; if I do it... and if I don't do it... etc." The mind does not come in. You can rest assured that when you get this vision in your deep meditation, it is correct and it will spontaneously bring in the fulfilment.</p>  </div>
