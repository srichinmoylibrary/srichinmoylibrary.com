<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fear comes from a sense of separativity; you are afraid of someone or something only because you have not established your oneness. To the little child, his father is a giant; but he is not afraid because he is all love and all affection for his father. He is not afraid to grab his father, for he knows that his father is not going to slap him.</p>
<p>You have to take meditation as your dearest friend, who is taking you to God. Prayer is your friend and meditation is your friend. These friends will do only the right thing for you. They will take you to your Highest. Meditation is not something to be afraid of; it is something to love, cherish and treasure. So if you think about meditation in a positive way, if you take it as somebody who is full of affection, love and concern for you, then you cannot be afraid of it.</p>  </div>
