<p>Unfortunately, Dhanuâ€™s automatic camera was not working today when I went to lift 350 pounds in each arm. It started clicking as soon as I touched the dumbbell. Then, while I was still taking deep breaths before lifting, the film ran out. By the second lift, all my joy had gone away. So much discouragement I get from these cameras!</p>
