<p><em>In an interview in</em> The Saturday Evening Post <em>of 21 September 1963, David Sureck asked U Thant:</em></p>
<p>“The first United Nations Secretary-General, Trygve Lie has described your job as ‘the most impossible job in the world.’ What did you think about it on the day you were sworn in?”</p>
<p>U Thant’s answer was: “A feeling of humility and an overwhelming sense of responsibility, to which was added a dawning hope that the unanimous support which has so generously been accorded to me would make ‘the most impossible job in the world’ a little less impossible.”</p>  </div>
