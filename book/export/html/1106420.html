<p>This evening, when I was lifting 200 pounds with alternate arms, it was as if I were lifting 145 pounds! It was going so high. I shall have to grow taller if I have to lift higher! When you see my arm action, it is like Muhammad Aliâ€™s jab.</p>
<p>There were two witnesses: one was God and one was Parvati the great.</p>
