<p>Today at Sports Day I tried to walk a few laps but too much cold air has entered into my right knee. On the other side of the track, beside the long jump pit, each time I went there, I suffered. On the side where we held the sprints, there was no wind, but as soon as I went to the other side, there was so much wind!</p>
