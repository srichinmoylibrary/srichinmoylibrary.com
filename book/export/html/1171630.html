<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I get tremendous joy from my music and that joy I try to offer to the listeners. While I am offering the joy that I receive from playing, I feel that the listeners are also offering me their inner joy. I am giving you something from my heart, the joy that I feel, and you are giving me what you are feeling deep within your heart. So this is how we become a oneness-soul, a oneness-family.</p>  </div>
