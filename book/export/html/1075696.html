<p>There are two oceans in front of me:<br /> The ocean of night<br /> And<br /> The ocean of delight.<br /> The ocean of night tells me,<br /> "Child, I shall give you<br /> What you need.<br /> Come and take it from me."<br /> The ocean of delight tells me,<br /> "Child, I shall give you<br /> What I am.<br /> Even if you do not care for<br /> What I am,<br /> I care for you.<br /> I shall always care for you<br /> And wait for you,<br /> For your God-Hour,<br /> For it is I who have to make you feel<br /> That you are of the Source<br /> Which is Delight<br /> And<br /> You are for the Goal<br /> Which is equally Delight."</p>
