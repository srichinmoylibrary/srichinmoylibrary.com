<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They should continue because the life-energy is not totally extinct; it is still operating. Even if the machine is pumping, if the soul is not there, the machine cannot keep the body alive for more than a few hours. When the vibration of the soul remains, even if somebody has left the house, you will feel his lingering presence. Similarly, the heart keeps pumping because the vibration of the soul still remains. Some members of the family may want her to die just so that they do not have to go through so much trouble and expense.</p>  </div>
