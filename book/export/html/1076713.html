<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you study you know many things, many, many things, and you know the difference between this and that. So also when you meditate you will come to recognise the difference. When you meditate, immediately you will be able to enter into these worlds, but this takes time. How many years have you been studying in order to get your Master's degree? Similarly, in the spiritual world I spent twenty years studying, practising the spiritual life. For twenty years I was at a particular spiritual institution. Twenty years right from my childhood I spent practising and that is why I am in this position. If you study something for twenty years I am sure you will also be an authority on that particular subject.</p>  </div>
