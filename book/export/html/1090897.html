<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want specific divine qualities — peace, power, joy, etc. — then you should meditate at those particular hours I mentioned. But if you want divine power, the power that will give you inner strength to fight against ignorance, and you cannot meditate at noon, no harm. You can knock at God's Door at any hour of the day or night, and He will give you whatever you want. But at those particular hours that I mentioned, it is easier to knock at the Door. Everything has its own time. Early in the morning you eat a meal that you call breakfast. But if you prefer to eat breakfast food early in the evening, you can easily do so. It is nourishing food and you can eat it whenever you want.</p>  </div>
