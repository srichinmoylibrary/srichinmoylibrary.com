<p><em>(Sri Aurobindo's chamber. Sri Aurobindo and Barin.)</em></p>
<p>BARIN: Sejda, to-day you must tell me when I should begin my revolutionary work.</p>
<p>AURO: Bari, to-morrow you may start for Calcutta. You will help Jatin Banerjee there in his work. I have asked him to work among the grown-ups and the educated. You and Abinash Bhattacharya will work amongst students.</p>
<p>BARIN: Sejda, if there be any disagreement between Jatin and me ...</p>
<p>AURO: No, Bari, you must never think of that disheartening thing. I am there behind you all. Don't fear. I, too, will be coming to join you all.</p>
<p>BARIN: Sejda, there is only one leader in India to whom I can bow. You know who he is. It is you who are at once my guide and India's only hope.</p>  </div>
