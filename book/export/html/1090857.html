<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to have transcendental experiences, you need a special meditation, as well as inner discipline. Just by doing something intensively you will not necessarily get what you are seeking. Suppose you dig at a place where there is no water. You may dig and dig, but if there is no water, what will you do? But, if you dig at a proper spot where there is water, you will get it. Similarly if you have the proper meditation, proper guidance and proper self-discipline then certainly you will have the transcendental experience.</p>  </div>
