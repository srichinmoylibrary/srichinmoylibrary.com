<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Creator Himself is all Beauty. Because the Creator is all Beauty, He wants His creation also to be beautiful. Whatever comes out of Him is an expression of His own Dream and His own Reality, so naturally He wants everything to be all Beauty like He is. When the father is a musician, he wishes his son to be a musician. If he is good, he wants his children to be good. Here the Father, God, is all Beauty, so He wants to see beauty all around Him. What He is within, He wants to see without. Like that, the Source always wants its creation to be like itself.</p>  </div>
