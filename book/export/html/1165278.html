<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. Suppose that a spiritual Master is having a special function outside and then suddenly it starts to rain. Let us say that a wrong element has attacked. Now, what are the cosmic gods doing? They are sleeping. The cosmic gods who have power over these elements, over these forces, are not controlling them. So what does the Master do? He challenges the cosmic gods. They are not doing their duty, so he has to speak to them. Then, in two or three minutes, the rain will stop. Many times this happens. If the Master doesnâ€™t have this kind of connection or, you can say, superior power or capacity, do you think that the rain will stop?</p>  </div>
