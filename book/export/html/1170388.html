<p><em>(At Apollo Bunder — Bombay — February 1893)</em></p>

<p>The days have run into weeks, and weeks<br />   Into months: for twice seven years<br /> Abroad he remained, a far-off star.<br />   Mother India with tears<br /> Of joy and love garlands her son,<br />   Wishing him life's true bliss.<br /> With the first step on Indian soil<br />   Infinitude's abyss<br /> Captures his mind: earth's lures are gone.<br />   His inner Spirit's Light<br /> Shall guide his tranquil feet; he views<br />   His Motherland's first might.</p>
