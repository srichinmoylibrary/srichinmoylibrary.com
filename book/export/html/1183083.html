<p>He was a musician. He felt that his music would give him realisation. The Master said to him, “If you play soulful music, naturally it will help you in your self-realisation; but music as such will not be able to give you self-realisation. And your present vital music will never give you realisation.”</p>
<p>He was deeply hurt. He said to the Master, “If my music and I can’t go together to God, then I don’t want God-realisation. ”</p>
<p>The Master said, “Certainly, you and your music can go together, but you have to know what kind of music you are speaking of: vital music or soulful music?”</p>
<p>He said, “There is no such thing as vital or soulful music. Any music that gives us joy we must play.”</p>
<p>The Master said, “You have used the wrong word. The right word is pleasure.”</p>
<p>He said, “You are only juggling the words. Joy is pleasure, pleasure is joy. These are synonymous.”</p>
<p>The Master said, “My dictionary unfortunately has two different meanings for these two words.”</p>
<p>He said, “Master, let us not argue.”</p>
<p>The Master said, “Far from it! Let us not do it. Let us each follow our own path.”</p>
<p>So the disciple left the Master.</p>  </div>
