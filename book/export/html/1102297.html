<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, the United Nations can and should aspire for a higher goal than what the Member States that compose it represent. The Member States are like strong pillars, but many more things are required to build an edifice. When all those other things are in their proper place and everything is combined to achieve a specific goal, at that time the achievement-reality-body of the United Nations can become divinely integral and supremely perfect.</p>  </div>
