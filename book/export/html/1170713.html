<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul comes from a plane infinitely higher than the reach of the planets. It is not that the soul has meetings with the stars and planets to decide how they will work together. No! Before descending to earth, the soul will have an interview with the Supreme, with the Highest, concerning how much it will achieve in its next incarnation. The Supreme tells the soul what He expects it to do in its next incarnation. At this time, the soul is guided either by the Supreme Himself or by one of His messengers. The soul promises that it will do such and such for the Supreme while it is on earth, and the Supreme says, "I hope that you will do it. I have faith in you." So the soul makes a promise to the Supreme, and the Supreme's Hope lies in the soul's promise.</p>  </div>
