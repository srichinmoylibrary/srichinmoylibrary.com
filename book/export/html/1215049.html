  <h1 class="book-heading">God’s Dream and God’s Reality</h1>
  
 
<p>God’s Dream-Boat is man: man the aspiration, man the experience, man the realisation, man the oneness, total oneness with God the Omniscient and Omnipotent, God the all-loving Father.</p>
<p>Man’s Life-Boat is God. Man’s life is God; man’s very existence is God. Man realises God, man embodies God and man finally will manifest God here on earth.</p>
<p>God’s Dream is man. His Dream is His Reality within and without and this Reality is also man. God fulfils Himself in man, with man, through man and for man. Unfortunately, the ordinary human beings are not aware of the truth that they have infinitely more divine and fruitful qualities than they can imagine. That is to say, they have infinitely more latent truth within than they are now capable of manifesting in their day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>Now, what does it mean when we say that man is a Dream of God? First, we have to know that God’s Dream is not like a human dream. There is a great difference between human dreams and God’s divine Dream. Earth’s dream is mental fantasy; God’s Dream divine is the precursor of Reality. Each second God’s Dreams are immediately being transformed into Reality. Human dreams are only pensive thoughts and ideas which we sometimes try to become. Very often when we dream, we feel miserable because our sweet dreams are never fulfilled. Sometimes we become victims of hostile forces which make us dream about all kinds of horrible incidents taking place in our life. Again, sometimes we create our own fantasies during the day and they come out at night in the form of a dream.</p>
<p>In God’s case He does not have these kinds of dreams. His Dream is more like a lid on a box. If you just lift the lid, there is the world, there is the Goal. So in God’s Drama, today’s Dream is tomorrow’s Reality. When you become one with God, you see that everything in God’s Dream already embodies the Reality itself. That is to say, when the Divine dreams in the seeker, then Reality is going to be manifested immediately in his life.</p>  </div>
