<p>X and I are two rivals. God is not satisfied with punishing me alone; He has to punish X also. I can't run; God has blessed me. Now I see that X can't run either. Usually one rival wins. In our case God has demolished both of us. For the last few weeks neither one of us has been running.</p>
<p>One day we shall be able to fight against our fate. This year in the New York Marathon we have to do well.</p>
