  <h1 class="book-heading">Hriday’s cats</h1>
  
 
<p>Yesterday Madhuri asked me why I do not have any cats. In Chittagong and Pondicherry my brother took care of so many cats. Hriday had fifteen or twenty cats that he fed every day. He renounced the whole world, but innocent cats he had to remain attached to!</p>
<p>God created the animals. Different people will be fond of different animals. Some you will like; others somebody else will like. Otherwise, there would be no fun for us in the animal world. It is better if there is some specialty!</p>
<p>There are many animals which I do not have, but it is not that they are hopeless or useless. No, no! Only I cannot have all the animals at my house.</p>
<p>Next week I shall invite the disciples to come to my house to see the animals and birds. Their cages will all be decorated.</p>
<p>3 April 1981</p>
