<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When your soul comes to me, it only takes a minute to communicate a message to me and receive a reply. In one second in soul's time one can accomplish what would take two or three hours in earth time. When your soul comes to me, there is no question but that it will go back. But in the case when someone has practically died, the soul is only watching; it is deciding. Like a bird it has left the cage, and it is thinking, "Shall I go back?" Sometimes the bird comes out of the cage and is reluctant to return. However, some birds are determined to come back. It is a matter of aspiration and manifestation.</p>  </div>
