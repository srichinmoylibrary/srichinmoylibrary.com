<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know that every day will not be the same. Some days are rainy; others are sunny. When the inner weather is bright and clear, naturally on that day we can get more inspiration. The soul's day is like that. But if we are not aware of it or if we are not paying attention to it, then it is like any other day. So we cannot categorically say that we will make the most progress on our birthday.</p>
<p>Some people feel miserable on their birthday because every moment they are occupied with earthly, mundane things. They feel miserable the whole day because early in the morning they could not meditate, during the day they could not meditate and in the evening they could not meditate. The birthday is the anniversary of the day the soul entered into the world, making a very special promise to the Supreme. Especially on our birthday, we have the golden opportunity to renew that promise and offer our surrender and gratitude to the Supreme. The opportunity is there; only we have to avail ourselves of it.</p>  </div>
