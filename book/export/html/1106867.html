<p><em>David:</em> I want to be God's friend because I love Him.</p>
<p><em>Joshua:</em> I would want to be God's slave because if I was God's slave I would always be serving Him and I couldn't make a mistake.</p>
<p><em>Ashley:</em> I would like to be God's friend because I like to think of God as my friend. Then I would always be with Him as his friend.</p>
<p><em>Amanda</em>: I would like to be God's slave because then I would be serving Him eternally and by being His slave I think I would also be His friend.</p>
<p><em>Samantha:</em> I'd like to be His slave because I know I would be serving Him. Maybe a friend might not see God too often but His slave would always be with Him.</p>
<p><em>Sarah:</em> I would like to be God's slave because then I would never think of my own will but only of God's Will. But if I was His friend, I would always try to compromise between my will and His Will.</p>
<p><em>Elizabeth:</em> I would rather be God's slave because, whenever I did anything wrong, He would be able to correct me.</p>
<p><em>Justin:</em> I would rather be God's friend than His slave because I feel that I could love Him more.</p>
<p><em>Heather:</em> I would rather be God's friend than a slave because as a friend I would be able to do the same things but feel better towards Him and love Him more.</p>
<p><em>Daniel:</em> I would like to be God's slave so I could serve Him and obey Him and not develop a big ego.</p>
<p><em>Robert:</em> I would rather be God's slave because He would always remind me that I would have to serve Him at every moment.</p>
<p><em>Matthew:</em> I prefer to be God's slave because I'd be at His beck and call. If there were something which I didn't really want to do but He wanted me to do, I would do it. I know that it would be for the best because whatever He would tell me to do would be right. Also, as a slave I think I would see more of God than as a friend.</p>
<p><em>John:</em> I would rather be God's slave because that way I would be doing what God wanted me to do and make more progress for God.</p>
<p><em>Megan:</em> I would rather be God's slave so that I could please Him and make Him happy while serving Him.</p>
<p><em>Stephanie:</em> I would rather be God's slave because then I'd be with Him more and longer.</p>
<p><em>Christine:</em> I would rather be His slave because I would be closer to Him and in the meantime I could still be His friend.</p>
<p><em>Andrew:</em> I would rather be God's friend because a true friend would still do anything that God asked him.</p>
<p><em>Jennifer:</em> I prefer to be God's friend because I'd love Him more and I know He'd love me. I just prefer to be His friend a lot more.</p>
<p><em>Christopher:</em> I'd prefer to be God's slave because only then can I serve God in His own Way and really please God.</p>
<p><em>James:</em> I'd rather be His friend because slaves and friends are just about the same to God, so they'd both do the same thing.</p>
<p><em>Joseph:</em> I'd rather be God's slave because I can make progress and prove myself worthy to Him.</p>
<p><em>Nicole:</em> I would rather be God's slave because I would never have to leave God for any reason and I could always be at His side serving Him.</p>
<p><em>Brittany:</em> I would rather be God's slave because if I did something wrong God would tell me and I would correct it. But if I were His friend, it might be harder for Him to be more honest with me.</p>
<p><em>Ryan:</em> We've come into this world to serve God and please Him in His own Way. You could say I want to be God's friend so I could serve Him, but only God's eternal slave is His true friend.</p>
<p><em>Brandon:</em> I would prefer to be God's slave. A slave is always on call 24 hours a day to serve the Supreme and always has the opportunity to serve unconditionally and with one-pointed devotedness.</p>
<p><em>William:</em> I choose God as my friend because God is my eternal Friend, my only Friend.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em>: As Madal I will try to be God's slave so that I can keep my humility all the time. If I have humility, then at every moment God will be able to act in and through me most satisfactorily. That is why I want to be God's slave â€” so that I can be His unparalleled instrument. As Chinmoy, I shall try to become His oneness-friend. If I can be His oneness-friend and feel that He is my only Friend, my Eternity's Friend, then I know that I will be able to defeat ignorance. In a tug-of-war, if there are two people pulling on one side, easily they will defeat one person who is pulling on the other side. So if God and I are on one side and ignorance is on the other side, my Friend and I shall win.</p>  </div>
