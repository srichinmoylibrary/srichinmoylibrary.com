<p>Music is the Vedic bird in us. This bird is called <em>Suparna</em>. This bird divine flies in the welkin of Infinity, through Eternity, with the message of Immortality.</p>
<p>Here on earth, we do notice that birds have the capacity to sing in endless measure, whereas we human beings try to create or develop this capacity. Tagore defends us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To the birds you gave songs, the birds gave you songs in return. You gave me only a voice, yet asked for more, and I sing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poet-bird in Keats, divinely intoxicated, flies in front of me, before my ken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Was it a vision, or a waking dream? Fled is that music: — Do I wake or sleep?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The music-bird is within us to stay, to give us love. The music-bird is without us to fly, to give us joy.</p>
<p>Since music is a universal language, it has no need to express itself in any particular language of the world. Rabindranath Tagore says:</p>
<p>“Music is the purest form of art and, therefore, the most direct expression of beauty, with form and spirit which is one and simple, and least encumbered with anything extraneous. We seem to feel that the manifestation of the Infinite in the finite forms of creation is music itself, silent and visible.”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
