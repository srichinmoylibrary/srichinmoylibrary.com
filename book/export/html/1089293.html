<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You were unconsciously taking the responsibility of someone else and bringing it to me, and I was telling you that it is the wrong thing to do because that person does not want to give you his responsibility.</p>
<p>You feel that it is your bounden duty to bring me the load, which here means some person who is involved in your life. So you wanted to bring that person to me, and I was saying it is not at all necessary, that the hour has not come for that person to follow our path. For him it is only a bother and nothing else, for he is not ready for the spiritual life, especially for our path. If you go deep within, you will know who the person is.</p>  </div>
