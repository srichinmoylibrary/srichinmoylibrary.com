<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything depends on the standard of the particular society. If a certain society is more advanced, infinitely more advanced, than other societies — inwardly, outwardly and in every possible way — then we can safely say that the Supreme has a special set of laws for that society. These laws are composed of Self-giving Reality and Oneness-Divinity, and they seek to bring about perfection of the individual and the collective, both within and without. The higher the standard of a particular society, the greater is the satisfaction of the Supreme when that society fulfils its duties. The seeker in us must try to discover that kind of society here on earth.</p>  </div>
