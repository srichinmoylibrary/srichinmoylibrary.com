<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because man has not yet understood the real meaning of spiritual surrender. Human surrender we know, and it shocks us. But human and divine surrender are two totally different things. In ordinary surrender, we see that we lose our individuality and personality. But in the spiritual life, it is totally different. In the spiritual life we see an ocean and a tiny drop. When the drop merges with the ocean, with our third eye we see that the drop has become the ocean itself.</p>  </div>
