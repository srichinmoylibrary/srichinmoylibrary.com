<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is your physical weakness. You must drink more juice, more milk; you are physically not strong. If the house is not in good condition, then the inhabitant cannot stay there. The inhabitant is the soul. Your soul is praying inside you. If your body is not strong, then how will you have good meditation? If the house is not in good condition, inside the house the inhabitant will not feel well. The inmate will always feel uneasy, upset, sick. So here also, in your case, please make the body strong.</p>  </div>
