<p>When I came outside with the bundle of saris, my rickshaw was missing. The driver was supposed to be right across the street. Where had he gone? It is my eternal rickshaw fate. There I saw only twenty or thirty bicycles. I was looking this side and that side, but there was no trace of my driver. I said, "What is happening?"</p>
<p>He did not tell me that he would be going somewhere. I had to stay in the store for another ten minutes until the driver came back.</p>
<p>I asked him, "Where did you go?"</p>
<p>He said, "I was hungry." He had gone to eat. At last, he brought me back home safely. This is India!</p>  </div>
