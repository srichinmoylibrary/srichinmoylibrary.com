<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> Can a person be an instrument of God and also be an instrument in a relationship with somebody, where God is acting through them to help another person? For example, do you believe people in the material world can become instruments of God?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Easily. We are all instruments of God. But if we are too much involved in the material life, then we will not be able to be chosen instruments of God. Chosen instruments of God are those who are constantly self-giving. They are not for themselves only but for the entire world. The chosen instruments have a wide heart. They don't try to confine themselves to their own reality. They try to offer their lives to the world at large.</p>  </div>
