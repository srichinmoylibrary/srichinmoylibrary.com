<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> So you are carrying us into the lore of the Katha Upanishad! Wonderful. That was not the fault of the King of Death. If I come to your house without making a previous appointment or without your knowledge and do not find at home. I can't blame you, can I? Nachiketas' father, Vajasravasa, said, "Thee I give to Death." But the King of Death did not say, "O Nachiketa, I am waiting for thee, for thee alone."</p>  </div>
