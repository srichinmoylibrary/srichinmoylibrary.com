<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly a thick skin is an asset in the spiritual life, especially when you have a Master who scolds in season and out of season. His biting tongue cannot penetrate a thick skin. So having a thick skin is a great protection.</p>
<p>Your name means Mother-Earth, Mother of Compassion. With your compassion-skin you can also easily absorb the scolding-arrows, criticism-arrows, of your Master. They will not be able to torture you in the least. So you are doubly protected because you have both a thick skin and a compassion-skin.</p>  </div>
