<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I was bringing your soul forward. Your soul wants to come to the fore so it can manifest its divine qualities. Right now it is unable to manifest its divine qualities because you are not aspiring. When you pray and meditate, when you aspire, the soul comes to the fore and its divine qualities get an opportunity to be manifested on earth. Once the divine qualities of the soul are manifested, we get true satisfaction from life. When I was meditating on you and the other seekers here tonight, I was actually trying to bring the souls to the fore.</p>  </div>
