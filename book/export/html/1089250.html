<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One hundred percent optimistic. God, I know, will not allow us to ruin His creation. We are His creations; nobody likes to destroy his own creations. We are God's children. We may do everything wrong, but out of His infinite Bounty, God will give us eternal time to turn over a new leaf.</p>  </div>
