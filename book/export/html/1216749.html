<p>At the airport in the Philippines, I had three pieces of luggage - two suitcases and a carry-on. Three boys took them away, but they were not going in the same direction. I told a policeman and he laughed, but he made the boys come back. I said that I needed only one fellow. Afterwards I found out that when you give the porters money, it goes to the police.</p>
