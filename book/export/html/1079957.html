<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life good character is of paramount importance. Good character means that life-energy — soulful, boundless energy — is operating in and through the seeker. If the seeker does not see the boundless Energy, Peace, Light and Bliss, then how can he remain in his highest consciousness?</p>
<p>If one is a seeker, then he has to be a man of character otherwise, his life will be contradictory. God is all purity. It is through purity that one realises God. If one wants to realise God as fast as possible, then purity must come first. To make real, solid, tangible progress, purity is indispensable. Now, if one does not have a good character, then how can that person have purity? And if one does not have purity inside the heart and inside the physical then how can he make progress?</p>
<p>Purity and character come simultaneously. If someone has inner purity, then he also has good character. And if there is somebody with good character then he is maintaining in his inner life tremendous purity. Purity is the ladder we climb up in order to reach God's Abode. If there is no ladder, then how can we climb up?</p>  </div>
