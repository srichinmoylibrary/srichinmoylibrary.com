<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Both are equally important. If East and West are not united, if they do not see eye to eye with each other, then there will be a disaster not only on the mental plane but also on the vital and physical plane. So political relations between East and West are of paramount importance. Again, of equal importance are the economic relations between North and South. If North and South do not share their economic achievements, then there will also be a terrible disaster on the mental, vital and physical plane.</p>
<p>In both cases, what we need is a feeling of sympathetic concern, love and oneness. Between East and West the political reality is of paramount importance. Between North and South the economic reality is of paramount importance. The political reality of one hemisphere should not try to dominate the political reality of another hemisphere. Again, the countries of the North and South have to realise that they can have satisfaction only when the rich countries offer their wealth to the poorer ones and when the poor accept this wealth with gratitude and not with a demanding attitude.</p>  </div>
