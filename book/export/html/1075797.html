<p><em>(Aurobindo's boat touches at Chandernagore.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Biren, go to Charu Chandra Roy and ask him if he agrees to my stay in his house.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Biren)</em></p>
<p><em>(Biren comes to the residence of Charu Bhandra Boy.)</em></p>
<p>CHARU: Yes, please?</p>
<p>BIREN. Aurobindo Babu wants to know if you can agree to his stay in your house without letting anybody know. He is at the Ghat, waiting in a boat for your word.</p>
<p>CHARU: Please ask him to excuse my inability. With a heavy heart I tell you this. My connection with the Government you know ...</p>
<p><em>(Biren comes out. Sisir Ghosh follows him.)</em></p>
<p>SISIR: My young friend, do not lose heart. I shall take you to somebody who will gladly receive him.</p>
<p>BIREN: <em>(Delighted)</em> Who, who is he?</p>
<p>SISIR: He is Motilal Roy.</p>
<p><em>(They now reach Motilal Roy's residence.)</em></p>
<p>SISIR: Aurobindo Babu whom you regard so highly is at the Ghat. Can you arrange for his secret stay in our town?</p>
<p>MOTILAL: Why this question of secrecy?</p>
<p>BIREN: The Government were planning to arrest and deport him. A timely warning came and, after a little concentration, he has got the commend from above to come here and remain in secret.</p>
<p><em>(Motilal hastens to the Ghat and asks the boatmen to take the boat near his house.)</em></p>  </div>
