<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you live in your soul you see God all the time. When you live in your heart you feel God all the time. But when you live in the mind, in the vital and in the physical, you neither see nor feel God. You want to know when you will see God. I wish to tell you that you will be able to see God with your naked eyes only when you have become an unconditionally surrendered seeker of the Supreme and when you have made this unconditional surrender of yours a permanent reality.</p>  </div>
