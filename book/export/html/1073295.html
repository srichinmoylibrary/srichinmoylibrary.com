<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> How many churches<br /> Have you already visited tonight?<br /> "Brother C,<br /> Since two thousand years ago<br /> I left the earth-scene<br /> I have completely forgotten<br /> Earth-calculation.<br /> Will you condescend<br /> To count on my behalf?"<br /> Certainly I shall do it for you.<br /> But are you going to understand<br /> My earth-figures<br /> When I take the trouble<br /> Of counting the places<br /> You have visited<br /> Or are going to visit today?<br /> "Brother C,<br /> You will fail,<br /> You are bound to fail.<br /> But for our Father's sake<br /> Keep it a top secret.<br /> Only let <em>me</em> know, please."<br /> Why only you, dearest brother?<br /> "Because."<br /> Why? Why?<br /> "Because, because."<br /> Why? Why? Why?<br /> "Because. Because. Because."</p>
