  <h1 class="book-heading">69. Time</h1>
  
 
<p>Who has time? God. God has time to love me.</p>
<p>Who has time? I. I have time to perfect myself.</p>
<p>Time is the colleague of happiness and the fever of laziness.</p>
<p>The laziness in man usually hates the promptness of time. The divine in man sleeplessly loves the readiness, steadiness and promptness of time.</p>
<p>My failure-life is not the fault of my lack of time. My failure-life is the fault of my mind's lack of awareness, my heart's lack of wakefulness and my life's lack of soulfulness.</p>
<p>Every day time sings for me only one song- the same song-"pull and push." Time inspires me to pull Heaven down gently and push earth up powerfully.</p>
<p>While doing a little thing I smile at time. While doing a great thing I cry for time. While doing the right thing I love the unconditional arrival of time.</p>
<p>The heart of time embodies ceaseless industry. The eye of time reveals soundless eloquence.</p>
<p>Time touches the God-lover in me to inspire my slow body, my weak vital, my unconscious mind and my uncertain heart all at once.</p>  </div>
