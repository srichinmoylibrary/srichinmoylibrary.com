<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They can all go together. Determination is on the physical plane, vital plane and mental plane. People may think that will power is in the mind, and to some extent this is true. But real will power comes from the soul, the God-representative on earth. Spiritual aspiration encompasses both determination and will power. On the one hand, we get determination and will power as a result of aspiration. On the other hand, birthless and deathless aspiration itself actually embodies the will power of the soul as well as the determination of the physical, mind and vital.</p>  </div>
