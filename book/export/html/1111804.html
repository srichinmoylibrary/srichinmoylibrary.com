<p>The other day while I was running in Flushing Meadow Park, a gentleman came up to me and inquired whether our marathon would be held in Flushing Meadow.</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>Then he said, "In October?"</p>
<p>I said, "On the third of October."</p>
<p>He was very happy. So there are people like me who like to run on a flat course. We have problems going up. Of course, in the inner world if you have problems going up, then you are lost.</p>
