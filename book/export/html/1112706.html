<p>I went to the airport, but I had a two-hour wait, so I went to Georgetown. There I was watching the water and wondering how I was going to kill time. Right in front of me there were twenty elderly women in a park. All of a sudden, some kind of music came from a house and they all started dancing!</p>
<p>Then I went to a restaurant and waited, waited, waited. Instead of being at the airport, at least I was near some hotels.</p>  </div>
