<p>Today I was thinking of one unfortunate experience I had in Fort Lauderdale many years ago. One night I had run quite a few miles and I became very hungry. Luckily I had money with me, so I stopped at a restaurant. Because I was wearing running shorts, they would not allow me to enter. So I decided to try another restaurant. Again, the same story: my clothing was not suitable. They told me to go home and change. Then I tried another restaurant and again I was turned away. I was so hungry. By then it was only a matter of half a mile to go home and change and come back, but I did not do it. My pride was hurt.</p>
