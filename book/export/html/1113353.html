<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You do not have to create and then intensify your desire to meditate. Just try to recollect one of the sweet experiences that you have had over the years during your meditation. Bring the experience to the fore and then try to live inside the sweetness, soulfulness and fruitfulness of that experience. If you can do this, automatically you will be in a higher state of consciousness. Reaching a higher state of consciousness is undoubtedly a more fulfilling way of meditation.</p>  </div>
