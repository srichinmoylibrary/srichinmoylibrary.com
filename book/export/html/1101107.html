<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the soul goes into manifestation, it touches the vital and at times it may become one with the suffering of the vital, with the suffering of the mind, with ignorance. The soul in its own right will not cry because it has established its oneness, its inseparable oneness, with the Supreme. But when it becomes one with the weaknesses and shortcomings of the vital or the mind, then it feels sorry because the vital and mind are starving their own possibilities. But the soul in its true birthright, the soul in its divinity, will not cry.</p>  </div>
