<p>This year, after the Long Island Marathon, I couldn't believe the way Pulak surrendered to one of the helpers at the finish line. It was absolutely unconditional surrender! After finishing he was so helpless.</p>
<p>Pulak's running style is unique! Then comes Saurya's style — he wants to touch the ceiling with his head while running.</p>
<p>The other day I saw Sudhir running early in the morning. His hands were stretched straight out.</p>
<p>Once, while race-walking, Baoul looked as if he was doing archery with his arms.</p>
