<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you practise Jnana and Karma Yoga as well as Bhakti Yoga, this will help your progress rather than hinder it. If you have a family you have to do your family duties. By serving your children and the rest of your family, you are also serving God. At the same time, you also have to have knowledge in order to understand how God is operating within your family or within the world. So if you can combine these three things: the attitude of service, the attitude of devotion, and the attitude of knowledge, then you can make wonderful progress.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you have to know which path inspires you the most. Each soul has its own way of working and each person is inspired to do something according to the propensities of his own nature. If we accept all the paths — service, devotion and knowledge — it is a great help; but at the same time, we have to choose the path that gives us the most joy and give the most importance to that.</p>  </div>
