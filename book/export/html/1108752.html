<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly your country will be inundated with peace, but at God's choice Hour. This world of ours is composed of brothers and sisters. Brothers and sisters do quarrel and fight from time to time, but they know that they belong to one family. So eventually they stop quarrelling and fighting. They become one, inseparably one, in their inner feelings and in their outer activities.</p>  </div>
