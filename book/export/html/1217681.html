  <h1 class="book-heading">III. Ambition</h1>
  
 
<p>Our very life is an ambition to fight out obscurity and ignorance.</p>
<p>The more we inwardly obey, the better we outwardly rule.</p>
<p>Life is an ever-progressing reality. This is the firm conviction of ambition.</p>
<p>Ambition is the fond embrace of possession and expression.</p>
<p>If your ambition is to achieve perfection, then do not destroy imperfection. The destruction of imperfection can never be the way to perfection.</p>
<p>Perfection is the conscious annihilation of one's egocentric self.</p>
<p>Ambition is an attempt at self-expression and self-extension. When it is based on the ego's enlargement, we call it self-aggrandisement. When it is based on the soul's illumination, it ceases to be ambition and becomes a divine Mission.</p>  </div>
