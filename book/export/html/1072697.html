<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Forgive me for saying that you are not advanced enough to taste the nectar of delight right now. First pray and meditate. Please God in His own way. Then He will bless you with delight; at that time you can taste delight to your heartâ€™s content. But right now try only to please God in His own way.</p>  </div>
