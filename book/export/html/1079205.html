<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the ordinary life, on the superficial plane, we always feel that the unreal is more charming. Here on earth, if we can get something by hook or by crook, if we can achieve something in the twinkling of an eye, we are pleased. To discipline our lives for five minutes seems most difficult. Anything that is difficult for us we immediately shun; while that which is within our immediate reach we try to grasp. That is why we do not get the real. The real is always there, but to achieve it we have to work very hard. Nevertheless, we have to know that true satisfaction, abiding satisfaction, can come only from the attainment of the real.</p>  </div>
