<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want peace, then you have to meditate on peace. If you want love, then you have to meditate on love. If you want joy or any other divine quality, the best thing is to meditate on it. That is the only way you can get these qualities. Each individual will have a different way of meditating because his mind or his heart will want different qualities. You will be knocking at a particular door and somebody else will be knocking at another door. I advise seekers to knock at their heart-door. The heart is the central room of the being. Once the heart-door is open, from there you can go into the mind or any other room.</p>
