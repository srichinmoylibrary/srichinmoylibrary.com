<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The term “mystic” is very vague and complicated. All of the Spanish mystics were not realised. Many of them just entered into the mystical world for a period of time and wrote poetry and so on. But why ask about only the Spanish mystics? There were many mystics, but very few were realised. Again, when they became real God-lovers, real aspirants, at that time they were no longer mystics. From that point of view, I can say that a Yogi is infinitely superior to a mystic.</p>  </div>
