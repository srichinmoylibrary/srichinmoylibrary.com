<p>There was a great sage and philosopher named Gautama. Gautama was able to conquer everything except his pride. Nevertheless, he was a great sage and philosopher.</p>
<p>Once, Vyasa, another sage, spoke contemptuously about a book Gautama had written on logic. He said the book was useless.</p>
<p>On hearing this, Gautama became very, very angry and said that he would never look at Vyasa's face again.</p>
<p>Vyasa came to realise he had made a deplorable mistake, so he pleaded with Gautama to forgive him. He begged, "I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. It was a joke when I said that your book was useless. You are never useless, never. I appreciate you and admire you."</p>
<p>Gautama said, "If you criticise my book it is as good as criticising me. How can you separate my book, my creation, from me?"</p>
<p>Vyasa said, "I understand, I understand. Please forgive me. Please forgive me."</p>
<p>Gautama agreed to forgive him. But he said, "If I see you in a normal way with my eyes, then I will not be fulfilling my promise. In the sacred books, it is said that it is a great sin to break one's promise. I have promised that I will not look at you. How can I break my promise? All right, let me put my vision in my feet. Let me put a new eye on my foot, and with that eye I shall see you."</p>
<p>Vyasa said, "No matter where your eyes are, as long as you see me, I will be very happy."</p>
<p>So Gautama created a new eye and placed it on his right foot, and from there he looked at the sage, Vyasa. Vyasa was very, very happy that Gautama had forgiven him.</p>
<p>When the period of forgiveness was finished, Gautama removed the eye from his right foot and once more in a normal way he saw and talked with Vyasa.</p>
