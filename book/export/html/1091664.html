<p>One day a tourist was walking along the streets of Calcutta. The street he was walking on was dirty and filthy. The tourist saw a leper who was in severe pain. Because of the many infected sores all over his body, the leper had a putrid smell. A nun was dressing his wounds with utmost love and affection.</p>
<p>Disgusted, the tourist said to the nun, "Sister, I would not do this kind of thing even if someone gave me ten million dollars!"</p>
<p>The nun replied, "Yes, I believe you. You would not do this for ten million dollars. I also would not do this for ten million dollars. I am doing this only for a little Smile from my Beloved Lord Supreme."</p>  </div>
