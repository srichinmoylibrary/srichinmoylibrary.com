<p><em>[Gorakshanath is meditating in his room. Enter Matsyendranath.]</em></p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: My son, now see, the worst calamity is about to take place. Has your curiosity been fed? Are you satisfied now? I am sure you have heard that all the strong young men in the Kingdom are to be brought before the King. The King will select the strongest and have him hanged. He feels that the man who has escaped from his prison has insulted him, and he cannot brook that kind of insult. You are a very strong man. I do not know what may happen to you. Let us try to escape.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, I am at your feet. You are also strong. They may catch you as well. Although you are mature you are not yet old. I am afraid you are also in danger. Since I made the mistake, if the King sentences me to death, I am prepared. But if something happens to you, Master, I shall never forgive myself.</p>
