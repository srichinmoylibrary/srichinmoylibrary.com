<p>After four miles I had absolutely the funniest experience. I saw a crazy girl about seventeen or eighteen years old running. She was very tall and had on a fancy dress. She came up to me and said, "I love your gloves." After four or five steps she added, "But I love you, too." Then she left the street and entered into the crowd and started dancing. After a while she again came back and started running. Whenever she saw elderly people she would go and shake hands with them or embrace them. She was really crazy, but she had good speed.</p>
