<p>In Seoul, Korea, I went into a 24-hour restaurant and ordered a milkshake. I asked how long it would take. The man behind the counter said, "Twenty-five minutes."</p>
<p>I said, "It will take such a long time?"</p>
<p>He corrected my English and said, "It is not too far, not too far."</p>
<p>I was thinking, "What will happen if I fall asleep? Let me see how much time it will take."</p>
<p>I set my watch and saw that it took not even 11 minutes. Such a language barrier!</p>
