<p>Why don't you care for God?<br /> "Why should I?"</p>
<p>The reason is quite obvious.<br /> "Did God ever care for me?"</p>
<p>How do you know<br /> That God did not care for you?</p>
<p>"I know it,<br /> And I tell you<br /> From my own personal experience,<br /> Had God cared for me<br /> By this time I would have<br /> At least<br /> Become a demigod."</p>
