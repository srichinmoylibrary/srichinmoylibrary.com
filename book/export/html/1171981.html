<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every form in your vital life, emotional life, mental life â€” everything that prevents you from going deeper and higher. Anything wrong that you do on the physical, vital or mental plane, anything that you cherish that lowers your consciousness and does not permit you to concentrate most powerfully on the Supreme is self-indulgence and must be transformed.</p>  </div>
