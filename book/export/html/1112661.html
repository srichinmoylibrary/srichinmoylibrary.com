<p>Another time I was running on a very cold day. Florida also can be quite cold in the winter. A newspaper boy saw me around five o'clock in the morning. He said to me, "Don't keep running. Go home. You will get frozen."</p>
<p>He advised me not to run, but on that day I ran thirteen miles.</p>
<p>On that cold day I ran by a girl waiting for the bus. Half an hour later, when I was returning, she was still waiting in that cold weather.</p>  </div>
