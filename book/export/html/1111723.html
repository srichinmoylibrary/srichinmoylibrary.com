<p>Devashishu is going to be an excellent runner. He ran a seven-minute pace in the five-mile race, and a six-thirteen in a two-mile race. His father was so far behind him!</p>
<p>Everybody thought that Devashishu's little brother, Aaron, had got lost, but he was running at an eleven or twelve-minute pace. When the father finished, he ran back to find Aaron, and then he started running with him. They were coming towards the finish line together so I said, "Now let us have the physical father and the spiritual father run together with the son." So I was on one side and his father was on the other. Aaron was killing himself to beat us. I stopped deliberately to let him go ahead, and he was so delighted that he could defeat me. But his father didn't stop.</p>
