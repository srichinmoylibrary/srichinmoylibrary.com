<p>Birbal was not only a Minister but also the court jester. He used to amuse Akbar with his wit, his talent and his earthly wisdom. As a result, Akbar was very fond of Birbal.</p>
<p>One day the Emperor was a bit upset. Birbal happened to displease him while he was in this mood, and he burst out, "You are the son of an ass!"</p>
<p>Birbal immediately replied, "You are perfectly right in your statement. That is why I consider you to be my true father."</p>  </div>
