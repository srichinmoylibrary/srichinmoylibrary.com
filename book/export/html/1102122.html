<p>"My Lord, I am sure You feel sad when I am angry with You. I am sure that when I speak ill of You, You get angry with me."</p>
<p>"My child, you are My eternal pride. When you are angry with Me, instead of feeling sad I allow My astonishment to capture Me, My Heart and Soul. For then I see in you an unusual, unimaginable aspect of yours.</p>
<p>"Now, when you speak ill of Me, I don't get angry with you in the least. On the contrary, I smile and dance. For I know that since you and I are one, eternally one, inseparable, you have to share half of your kind offering with Me.</p>
<p>"Also I am glad, My fondest child, when you speak ill of Me, because at that time I get the opportunity to sharpen My weapon of self-defence. You know well that on very rare occasions you give Me the chance to use My indomitable weapon, self-defence.</p>
<p>"Dearest child of My Heart, you fight with Me because your heart needs Me. I fight with you because My Soul loves you. When you fight, you give Me what you always want to give: strength. When I fight, I give you what I always am: Concern, eternal Concern."</p>
