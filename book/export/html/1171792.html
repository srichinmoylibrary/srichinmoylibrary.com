<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is a spiritual question, so I can't cut jokes. You can talk to the flowers in your garden if you constantly smell the fragrance of your heart-flower in your own soul's garden. You can talk to the flowers in your garden if you take the flowers as the members of your body"your eyes, nose, hands and limbs. If you take the flowers in this way, as the members of your own body, your own reality, then you can easily communicate with them. They have to become part and parcel of your conscious awareness. Then easily you will be able to talk to the flowers in your garden.</p>  </div>
