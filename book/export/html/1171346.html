<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Once I have placed you at the Feet of the Supreme, I am also unnecessary. I am like the guard who opens the door for you to come into the room where the boss is. Then if you are at the feet of the boss and you become a favourite of the boss, at that time why do you need the guard? The boss will tell the guard, "Whenever he wants to go out, he can go out, and whenever he wants to come in, he can come in."</p>  </div>
