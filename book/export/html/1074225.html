<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Many were witches. One day I went to the supermarket in Manhattan. You can’t imagine what I saw: five witches! They didn’t know each other. How will a witch know another witch? In the past they were witches, and in this incarnation they were also absolutely undivine.</p>  </div>
