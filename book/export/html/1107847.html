  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Is it true that for everything positive there is something negative?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why do we have to take everything as positive and negative? We can take them as counterparts. Everything has different forms, shapes or consciousness on different planes, but we do not have to call them positive and negative. Only we see that fulfilment is coming through them in different ways. The One is becoming many; it is enjoying itself in infinite forms. In anything that has come from the One and is trying to complete the One in a very high, spiritual, illumined way, there will be two aspects of the Reality: the unmanifested aspect and the revealed and manifested aspect. The one that we can see is the reality being manifested, and the one that we cannot see is the unmanifested reality.</p>
<p>We can say that in some cases the one that comes out for manifestation is a negative, hostile aspect, and the one that does not come out is divine. But both things are really only one reality that is fulfilling itself in different ways. The reality that is coming forward we can call night, and the reality that is remaining behind we can call day, but they are both part and parcel of the selfsame reality. We call them positive and negative when we deal with separativity, but actually the so-called night and the so-called day both exist inside each other.</p>  </div>
