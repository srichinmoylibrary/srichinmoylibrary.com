<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your aspiration is your inner illumination-flame. If you are sincerely aspiring, if you are carrying an inner flame, you have to know that this flame will illumine any darkness you see. Then you will see light everywhere, and this light is nothing other than God Himself. What else is God but constant illumination? When you carry light inside you, you will no longer see darkness; you will see only your own light, your own illumination.</p>
