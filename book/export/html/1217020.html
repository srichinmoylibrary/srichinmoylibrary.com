<p>The abbots of the temples we visited in Chiang Mai had such depth. I also liked the little children who are practising spiritual life there. Such strict discipline they have to observe! They have genuine aspiration.</p>
<p>Still, children are children, and these were no exception. Everywhere children have to learn how to behave. Definitely I talk to the Lord Buddha when I visit temples, but these children were not aware of it. Perhaps they show more respect to the Buddhist monks when they come there.</p>
