  <h1 class="book-heading">Faith</h1>
  
 
<p>Faith is the eye that sees the future manifestation of the Divine on earth.</p>
<p>Faith lives in the domain of the soul. This domain is a far cry from that of the intellect.</p>
<p>Faith is no wishful imagination. It is the soul's pre-vision.</p>
<p>Faith spontaneously feels God, senses that God's protection and His guidance are indivisible. Belief thinks "Maybe. I am not quite sure."</p>
<p>Faith says, "All obstacles, inner or outer, can be surmounted." Belief says, "Not so easy."</p>
<p>The real strength of faith can be neither measured nor experienced.</p>
<p>Faith and Will are the two invaluable eyes of an aspirant.</p>
<p>Doubt sleeps with our human nature. Faith lives with its self-offering.</p>
<p>Mere mental knowledge is a real stranger to faith which is itself the knowledge of the soul.</p>
<p>Faith and perfect equanimity are not only inseparable, but indispensable to each other.</p>
<p>Faith can kill fear in season and out of season, and not vice-versa.</p>
<p>Courage is the arrow. Faith is the bow.</p>
<p>The worst enemy of ignorance and failure is faith.</p>
<p>To say that the outer intellect is stone blind is not an error. To say that faith has one thousand eyes is to state the immaculate truth.</p>
<p>To be a successful believer, one has only to be a child. To be a successful disbeliever, one has only to listen to his own pre-conceived ideas.</p>
<p>It is not your mental belief but your faith that is the ever-loyal support to your surrender in the process of your self-fulfilment.</p>  </div>
