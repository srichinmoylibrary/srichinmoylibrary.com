<h2>Question: Do you teach any mantra or any meditation techniques to your disciples?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have a path of our own, but we do not teach any outer technique as such. Our path is the path of love, devotion and surrender. We feel that this, approach can lead us to our destined Goal. Outwardly, I do not give any specific mantra to my disciples. But inwardly I do help them when they meditate. When my disciples meditate with me, or when they invoke me in their meditation, I bring down Peace, Light and Bliss from above, and in silence they learn how to meditate properly from within. This technique cannot be demonstrated outwardly or taught by means of words. Our technique is the practice of conscious surrender to God's Will, divine love for God, and constant self-dedication to the Supreme within us. This is the technique which my disciples follow.</p>  </div>
