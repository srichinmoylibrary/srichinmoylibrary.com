<p>The human in me wants success.<br /> The divine in me wants progress.<br /> The human in me wants success-might.<br /> The divine in me wants progress-light.<br /> The human in me wants<br /> Success-might-supremacy.<br /> The divine in me wants<br /> Progress-light-ecstasy.</p>

<p>My success wants to subjugate the whole world. My progress wants to liberate the world from its limitations, imperfections, bondage and ignorance-night.</p>
<p>My success wants to challenge the world. My progress wants to illumine the world.</p>
<p>My success-life has a fleeting breath. My progress-life is an enduring reality.</p>
<p>My success life has an all-conquering thirst. My progress-life is an all-loving thirst.</p>
<p>My success-life has a world-devouring hunger. My progress-life is a world-illumining hunger.</p>
<p>The moment I enjoy success, I proudly shake hands with greedy division-superiority. The moment I make progress, I am embraced by the world's oneness-longing divinity.</p>
<p>My Lord, I am never happy with my success-life. No matter how many ways I am successful, I always see a beggar in myself. And this beggar in me cries and cries because he feels that there is insufficient reality in him.</p>
<p>But when I make progress, my Lord, I see in myself a king, an emperor. At that time I see the whole world as my own, very own, for I claim the entire world and the entire world claims me.</p>
<p>O my Lord, do make my success-life and progress-life inseparably one. Do give me the capacity to see my success-life as the divine beauty of my heart-rose and to feel my progress-life as the celestial fragrance of my heart-rose.</p>
<p>May the beauty and the fragrance of my heart-rose please You, my Lord Supreme, in Your own Way at every moment.</p>
