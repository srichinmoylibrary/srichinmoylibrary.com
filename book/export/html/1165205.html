<p>My God, how old are You?</p>
<p>My child, I shall tell you. But first tell Me how old you are.</p>
<p>I am just a year old.</p>
<p>My child, if you are a year old, I am one day younger than you and one day older than you; one day younger than you in imperfection and one day older than you in perfection. Give Me half the imperfection that you have and take from Me half the perfection that I have. Let us be fully equal.</p>
<p>What will happen, my God, if You and I become fully equal?</p>
<p>My child, when we two become fully equal, you will be known as another God and I will be known as another man.</p>  </div>
