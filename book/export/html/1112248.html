<p>Databir is wonderful! He was absolutely sure that the man he saw working out was the same man with whom we spoke a few days ago, whose tennis coach is Ronnie, my coach. So he went to him with the press release and other material. But the man could not recognise Databir. He said, “I am not the right person.”</p>
<p>Then Databir was insisting that he was the person! Can you imagine? The funniest thing was that that man knew nothing about us.</p>
<p>I said, “Let me go and see him for myself.” I walked about twenty metres so that I could see the man properly and I discovered that it was a totally different person! His hair was different, the structure of the face, everything was different.</p>
<p>Today Databir was really in trance, super-trance!</p>
