<h2>Question: What role does music play in religion?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Music plays a considerable role in religion. Music is a most convincing instrument to help religion play its role. A great musician can add to the inner cry of the person who practises a religious life. And if the musician himself believes in God wholeheartedly, then his music can be of tremendous help to his own religious practice.</p>
<p>Again, from the core of religion, one can bring illumining spirituality to add the living reality of God to his music. So a musician can help religion with his own search for higher beauty, the all-pervading Beauty and Light. And again, religion can come and help the musician who wants to play devotional, spiritual, illumining and God-manifesting music on earth.</p>  </div>
