<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is very bad. I admire your confession, but I wish to say that the Invocation is most important. With your meditation, you have not reached the goal. You have not touched the tape. You feel that you have come very near the goal, but unless you touch the tape, you have not completed the race. If you don't touch the goal, then it is as good as not starting. You have left the starting block and covered 80 or 90 metres, but if you don't finish, then it is all useless.</p>
<p>Many times while singing the Supreme, people think of the most absurd things. Apart from vital and emotional thoughts, they think of what they are going to eat and all kinds of absurd things. Everybody does it. This is very bad. Please feel that the Invocation is something most significant and most important in your spiritual life, and take it seriously.</p>  </div>
