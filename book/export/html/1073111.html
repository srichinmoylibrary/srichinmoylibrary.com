<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Previously a soulful promise reigned supreme; now a fruitful hope reigns supreme. The spirit at that time was promise; now it has become hope. The spirit of the past was the discovery of inner adamantine will to fight against bondage. The present spirit is the aspiration for God-manifestation plus the aspiration to become humanity’s brother, humanity’s selfless lover and divinity’s constant server.</p>  </div>
