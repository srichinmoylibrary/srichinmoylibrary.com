<p>Alas, why did I fall<br /> In love with ignorance-night?<br /> I should have known long before<br /> What it was really like.</p>
<p>Now God is unmistakably<br /> Charmed by me.<br /> Alas, will I be able to give Him<br /> All my attention<br />     And<br /> Pay Him His absolute due?</p>
<p>I hope it is not too late —<br />     Alas, alas!</p>
