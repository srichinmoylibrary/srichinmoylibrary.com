<p>When he was a man of non-possession,<br /> He became the marvellous blend<br /> Of love and action.<br /> His religion was not noisy,<br /> His philosophy was not showy.<br /> He advanced and achieved,<br /> He achieved and advanced.<br /> He knew that he was a descendent of God.<br /> He knew that he was on a footing of equality with God.<br /> Heaven gave him Heaven's possession:<br />            Delight.<br /> Earth gave him earth's possession:<br />            Perfection.</p>
