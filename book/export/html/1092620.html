 <p></p>
<h2>World-poets</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>"Love seeketh not itself to please, Nor for itself hath any care, But for another gives its ease And builds a heaven in hell's despair."</p>
<p>— Blake</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Love so beautifully idealised can be materialised if it springs from its Highest Source and has no link with anything inferior here below.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was angry with my friend. I told my wrath, my wrath did end. I was angry with my foe; I told it not, my wrath did grow."</p>
<p>— Blake</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wrath is a weakness worth getting over. Again it cannot disturb the inner equilibrium, which is worth everything.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Good to forgive. Best to forget."</p>
<p>— Browning</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Better than best is to remain unaffected by the shocks of the world.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nor ear can hear nor tongue can tell The torture of that inward hell!"</p>
<p>— Byron</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To nurse an inward hell and escape the penalty is to ask for too much.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"I awoke one morning and found myself famous. "</p>
<p>— Byron</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the greater glory to the Source which has given the fame!</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are never deceived; we deceive ourselves."</p>
<p>— Goethe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May the world realise this truth!</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Light-more light."</p>
<p>— Goethe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Infinite is the thirst for the Infinite.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"A thing of beauty is a joy forever."</p>
<p>— Keats</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because it is the reflection of the All-Beautiful.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Beauty is truth, truth beauty.</p>
<p>— Keats</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because our great origin is both Truth and Beauty.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others judge us by what we have already done."</p>
<p>— Longfellow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence says the Seer-Poet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And belief shall not be till the thing is done."</p>
<p>— Sri Aurobindo, <em>Savitri</em></p>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tell me not in mournful numbers, Life is but an empty dream."</p>
<p>— Longfellow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather, life, the great gift of God, is a splendid field for self-realisation.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven."</p>
<p>— Milton</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is the sign of a great spirit perverted.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"To be weak is miserable, doing or suffering."</p>
<p>— Milton</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weakness is an implied denial of one's true self.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"What is done can't be undone."</p>
<p>— Shakespeare</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True in a limited context, never an absolute truth.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Brevity is the soul of wit."</p>
<p>— Shakespeare</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And silence can tell even more than brevity.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our sweetest songs are those that tell us of sweetest thought."</p>
<p>— Shelley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Shelleys of the future will hear sweetest songs inspired by all-blissful thoughts.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"The desire of the moth for the star, Of the night for the morrow, The devotion to something afar From the sphere of our sorrow."</p>
<p>— Shelley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Shelleys of the New Age will be singing of the transformation of the sphere of our sorrow into the sphere of our Delight!</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"My strength is as the strength of ten, Because my heart is pure."</p>
<p>— Tennyson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us look forward to the New World that is manifesting in the old-to the New World that will be full of Sir Galahads but with their hearts absolutely true to none and nothing else than the Divine and His Influence.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"'Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all."</p>
<p>— Tennyson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True, perhaps on the human plane. But true love is Love divine that knows no loss.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for religion's sake."</p>
<p>— Whitman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The true seer-eye of the poet foresaw the possibility that is now on the point of realising itself.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"If anything is sacred, the human body is sacred."</p>
<p>— Whitman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the human body is the very temple of God.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Minds that have nothing to confer find little to receive."</p>
<p>— Wordsworth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it may well be added: Minds that have little to perceive have nothing to confer.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"The gods approve the depth, and not the tumult of the soul."</p>
<p>— Wordsworth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a portion of the Infinite, the soul can have depth, height and breadth without measure, but tumult can never belong to the soul. It is a play of the inferior vital.</p>  </div>
