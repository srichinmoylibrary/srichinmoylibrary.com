<p>Yesterday I saw you. Today I am seeing you for the second time. That means you are no longer new to me, no longer a stranger to me. You have become an old friend of mine; you and I have become old friends. Your age has increased and mine has too. You have aged and I also have aged.</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw something for the first time. Today I am seeing it for the second time. That means that thing has become old. Yesterday I felt something for the first time; today I am feeling the same thing. Yesterday I ate something; today I am eating the same thing. That means my food has become old. It is no longer a new experience.</p>
<p>Anything that I see for the second time, anything that I do for the second time, anything that I feel for the second time is automatically aged. Age has descended upon him or upon it.</p>
<p>Similarly that very thing, that very person, will feel the same about me — that I have become old. Is there anything that can never be old? Yes, there is something and that thing is my heart’s inner cry. This inner cry is ever new. Every day it assumes a new prayer-form, a new concentration-form, a new meditation-form. Every day it achieves something new from God. You may say that every day you can pray, but how can your prayer or meditation be new? But I wish to say that it is not only possible and practical, but inevitable.</p>
<p>You may think Peace, Light, Bliss, Power and a few other attributes of God are enough for you. But I wish to say it is not true. God is infinite, and His attributes are infinite. So easily you can have an infinite variety of prayer, concentration and meditation. Each prayer can easily be new. Each concentration can easily be new. Each meditation can easily be new.</p>
<p>Prayer defies age. Concentration defies age. Meditation defies age. Our inner cry is the mother and father of our prayer, concentration and meditation. So let us make friends with this inner cry. Let our body, vital, mind and heart make friends with this inner cry. With the inner cry our entire existence, outer and inner, will become an ever new existence-reality, an ever new, ever fulfilling Dream of God in and through us.</p>
