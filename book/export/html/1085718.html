<p><em>(Ayodadhommya comes near the paddy-field. It is dark. He cannot see anything. He shouts aloud.)</em></p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: Aruni, Aruni, where are you?</p>
<p>ARUNI: Father, I am here.</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: Where are you? I can't see you. What are you doing there? Come here, I can't see you.</p>
<p>ARUNI: Father, please tell me which command of yours I should follow: the morning command or the evening command?</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: What do you mean?</p>
<p>ARUNI: In the morning you commanded me, Father, to come and fix the levee, so that the water would not run out of the paddy-field. I tried my best in every way, but I failed. Then, as a last resort, I lay down on the levee, and thus I prevented water from flowing out of the paddy-field. I have been lying here most of the day. If I get up from this place according to your second command, then the water will flow out again.</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: Aruni, listen to my second command. Come here. <em>(Aruni leaves the bank and comes. He stands in front of his Master. His whole body is soaked and covered with mud. He is shivering all over.)</em></p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA <em>(blessing him):</em> Aruni, you have pleased me beyond your imagination. You have pleased me beyond my expectation. I write down this deed of yours in my heart, with my joy, with my love, with my gratitude. Also, I write down in gold letters on the tablet of your heart, my joy, my pride, my gratitude. Aruni, today I give you a new name, a name which will do justice to your sacrifice for me, your love for me, your devotion to me, your service to me. Your name will be Uddalak. <em>(Chants.)</em> Aum. Uddalak. U-D-D-A-L-A-K. Today you were a human dike, protecting my field with your body. Tomorrow you will be Uddalak, the divine dike, protecting humanity with your unparalleled devotion and sacrifice.</p>  </div>
