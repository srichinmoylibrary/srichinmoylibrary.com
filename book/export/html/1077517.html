<p>This is another song by Tagore.</p>

<p><em>Amar hiyar lukiye...</em></p>
<p>Lord, You have been hiding<br /> In the inmost recesses of my heart.<br /> I have not been able to see You.<br /> To the world without, I have opened my eyes,<br /> Not to the world within.<br /> You were in all my loves and in all my pangs,<br /> And in all my hopes;<br /> You were beside me,<br /> But I did not see You, I did not.</p>
