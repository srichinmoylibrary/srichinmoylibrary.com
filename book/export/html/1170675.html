<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The two main qualities you need are gratitude and forgiveness. You have to feel grateful to the Supreme in yourself and in your Guru that you are still on the path, leading a spiritual life. And you have to have forgiveness-power for all your spiritual brothers and sisters, no matter how much they criticise you or speak ill of you. From these two divine realities you will get real happiness, and in your happiness is your progress.</p>  </div>
