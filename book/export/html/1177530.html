<p>O my mind,<br /> Now you are in the world<br /> Of confusion and delusion,<br /> And I am in my Lord's Heart-World.<br /> My Lord Supreme has granted me<br /> An inner life inside His own Heart.<br /> I have started blossoming<br /> In His own immortal and inimitable Way<br /> Only to please Him,<br /> His own Life of Hunger,<br /> His own Life of Feast,<br /> In His own inscrutable Way.</p>
