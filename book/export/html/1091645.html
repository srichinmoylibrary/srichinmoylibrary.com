<p>A policeman was guarding the church in a very special way. Only very rich people or very well-educated people were allowed to go inside. Others were turned away. The priest would interview each new person who wanted to enter the church to be certain that they were qualified to go inside.</p>
<p>One day an ordinary man came there and spoke to the priest. The priest asked, "Are you rich?"</p>
<p>"No," answered the man.</p>
<p>"Are you well-educated?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then this is not the place for you. You have to go away. You have to be either very rich or very well-educated to enter into our church."</p>
<p>The next day the man borrowed quite a lot of money. A few days later, he came back to the church.</p>
<p>The priest asked him, "Do you qualify? Are you either rich or well-educated?"</p>
<p>The man replied, "How can I be well-educated in just a few days time? But because I borrowed a lot of money, I am now quite rich." The man showed the priest all his money.</p>
<p>"You have borrowed money and now you say you are rich," said the priest. "But this is not enough."</p>
<p>The man said, "I do not believe it! Here I have thousands of dollars and still you will not allow me to go in?"</p>
<p>The priest answered, "I am sorry, no. By the way, tell me what you did to get this money. Did you pray to God to be able to borrow the money?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I did."</p>
<p>"What did the Almighty say?" asked the priest.</p>
<p>The man replied, "The Almighty told me that even though I was bringing so much money to show you, you might not allow me to enter. The Almighty also said something more. He said, 'I have been trying to enter that church for forty-five years, and I have never been allowed in.'</p>
<p>"I was so shocked. I asked, 'How can You not be allowed in?'</p>
<p>"The Almighty explained to me, 'I am neither rich nor well-educated, so they do not allow me to enter the church. Do not be surprised if they do not allow you to enter either. You have no money of your own, plus you are not well-educated.'"</p>
<p>Alas, even God was not allowed to enter the church, His own rightful Home.</p>  </div>
