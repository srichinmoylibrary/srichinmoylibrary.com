<p>We are always apt to say that it is not too late to do anything, but do we ever say that it is not too early to do anything? It is not too early to do anything in life. It is not too early to pray in the small hours of the morning. It is not too early to realise God. It is not too early to reveal God. It is not too early to manifest God. The sooner we realise God, the sooner we reveal God, the sooner we manifest God, the sooner we will start with a new beginning, aiming at a higher, more illumining, more fulfilling goal.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life there is no such thing as early. This moment, the eternal Now is the only saviour, only liberator, only fulfiller. To get up early in the morning at three o’clock to meditate is a difficult task. But if you say it is too early, then I will say you are mistaken. You are mistaken because what you call early or late is decided by your mind. It is the discovery of your mind that three o’clock is early, six o’clock is late. It is the mind that tells you three o’clock is too early, eight o’clock is too late.</p>
<p>If you go beyond the mind, there is no such thing as an early hour or late hour. There is only one hour, that is God’s Hour. And where is God’s Hour? It is inside the Now. What is the Now? The Now is God the Preparation, God the Aspiration, God the Evolution and God the ever-transcending Perfection.</p>
