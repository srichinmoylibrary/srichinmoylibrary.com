<p>A devout astrology-believer is he. Astrology unmistakably leads him and guides him to his destined goal. He loves the vision-eyes of the stars and planets. They touch him, bless him and smile through him powerfully and triumphantly. Astrology brings to the fore his heart's past aspiration-cries. He and his sleepless dedication-life multiply Heaven's star-planet-wealth. Greatness, astrology grants him; goodness, he adds.</p>
<p>Although he has quite a few times played the expectation-disappointment-game, he never was an invalid crippled by depression. His is the indomitable will that comes to the fore when necessity demands, and God places the victory-crown upon his devoted head.</p>  </div>
