<p>We ran twelve and a half miles. Nathan was ahead of me and Casey was behind me.</p>
<p>Casey was breathing so heavily: "Huh! Huh!"</p>
<p>And Nathan, was he walking or running? God alone knows.</p>
<p>After we ran five and a half miles, all of a sudden I saw Jesse Owens' soul around my head, looking at me. It was full of love, softness and tenderness, and I stopped to help it.</p>
<p>When I came back from running, one of the disciples gave the news that Jesse Owens had died.</p>
