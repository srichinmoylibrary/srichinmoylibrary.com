<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation is conscious awareness of God. Here we are all seekers. If we believe in God, then naturally we feel that God exists. But, unfortunately, this feeling does not last twenty-four hours a day. When we meditate, we come to feel and realise twenty-four hours a day that we are of God and we are for God. To become constantly and consciously aware of God — His Truth, Light and Bliss — is the purpose of meditation.</p>
