<p>"My Lord, I have told millions of lies. Which one do You hate the most? Which one do You hate the least?"</p>
<p>"My child, when you tell Me that you are as good as Me, that lie I hate the least. When you tell Me that you are not going to mix with your ignorance-friend anymore, that lie I hate the most."</p>  </div>
