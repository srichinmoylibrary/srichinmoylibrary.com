<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> She and President Gorbachev are very close friends of mine. I do not understand politics at all; I am just a truth-seeker and God-lover. But I feel that President Gorbachev is also a genuine truth-seeker and a true man of peace. That is why I have utmost admiration and love for him. I have met with him five or six times. My first meeting with him, strangely enough, took place in Ottawa four years ago.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> What is your next project? Do you have anything else in mind now?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now, I have nothing in mind. Only I will do my regular prayers and meditations and, if it is the Will of God, I will embark on something else.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Sri Chinmoy, thank you very much. Sri Chinmoy is a New York-based spiritual leader and international peace ambassador. He spoke to us from Suva, Fiji.</p>  </div>
