<p>A Priest asked a Rabbi: “Please tell me, Rabbi, how can I distinguish between a girl and a boy who has long hair? For, as you know, nowadays boys are also growing their hair long like the girls.”</p>
<p>The Rabbi said: “It is very simple. Ask them both to walk along the street. The one who walks in a more feminine way is the boy, and the one who walks in a more masculine way is the girl.”</p>  </div>
