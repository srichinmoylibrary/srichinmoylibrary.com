<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you do not get enough joy from running, then bring some variety into your running. Do not run at the same speed or for the same distance every day. One day run one mile, the next day two miles and the third day seven miles. Every day change the distance or change the speed. If you normally run a mile in seven or eight minutes, then one day deliberately run at a nine-minute pace. Then do something completely different: 100 metres walk, 100 metres run, 100 metres walk, 200 metres run. That way you will develop a different kind of joy and confidence. I used to do that whenever I did not feel like running. In one mile if you have all kinds of variation, then you may get more joy. I used to get joy that way. Otherwise, if I had to run one mile non-stop, sometimes I found it so boring. One day you may decide to be spontaneous. You will say, "When I want to run depends on my mood." You may run for 20 metres and walk for 200 metres. You will let your heart or mind decide. You will not have a fixed pattern â€” that you will run 50 metres and walk 50 metres. No. As your mind carries your body, you will just surrender to your mind's will, or you can say, your mind's whims. Then afterwards you will get joy that you have covered so much distance.</p>  </div>
