<p>One day, in a particular disciple's house, Sarada Devi entered into trance. She remained in that state for several hours. Upon returning to her normal consciousness, she told the disciples around her that she had envisioned red and blue lights. She said that she had been swimming in a sea of light.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she said that if this experience had lasted for four or five days, her soul would not have remained on earth.</p>  </div>
