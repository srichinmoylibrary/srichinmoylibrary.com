<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When a disciple accompanies his Master on a spiritual journey to another country, the disciple not only gets new light in his inner life, but he also gives new light to the place that he visits. On the material plane, you give your money-power to hundreds of stores, which makes a great difference to them. On the spiritual plane, you give your soul-power. Because you are praying and meditating, the people in these countries may see something prayerful in your face and eyes that they do not see in their neighbours and acquaintances. You are coming on these trips not only to take, but also to give. You take what these countries have to give you and you also give them what you have. Afterwards, you will have a very close connection with those countries.</p>  </div>
