    <title>Question: Do you envisage the creation of a second chamber at the United Nations? If so, should it be composed of some NGOs or of the wise men of nations? Should the General Assembly, as is, represent the will of the nations and that second chamber the love of peoples?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do envisage the creation of a second chamber at the United Nations but it does not have to be composed of NGOs or of the so-called wise men of nations. The new creation must be composed of only selfless, dedicated workers â€” true servers and lovers of mankind, who do not merely remain in the theoretical plane but also come down to the practical plane and offer practical, effective answers to mankind.</p>  </div>
