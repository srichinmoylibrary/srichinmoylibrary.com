<p>After showing the ladies the picture of Sudhahota and me running together, I went back to my chair about twenty metres away and started drawing birds. After a few minutes, the elderly black lady, the supervisor, came up to me and asked to see the picture again. She had brought with her a young white lady who worked under her.</p>
<p>The young lady said to me, "I want to tell you something, but I am afraid and embarrassed." Then she looked at me and said, "You and Gorbachev look alike." Immediately she put her hands over her face and turned away in embarrassment.</p>
<p>I said, "You are right. He is my friend. I have received many letters from him and just the other day I met him in Washington." She said, "But you two look alike!" Look at this! I was only telling them about my black friends. I had not mentioned Gorbachev at all. But this was her intuition.</p>
