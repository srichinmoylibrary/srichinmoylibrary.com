<p>My Lord,<br /> Is it possible to have happiness<br /> In this world?</p>
<p>"Definitely, My child.<br /> I would not have created this world<br /> If I could not create happiness<br /> In this world.</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> There are two kinds of happiness:<br /> Happiness real<br /> And happiness unreal.</p>
<p>"When the real in you<br /> Pleases Me in My own Way,<br /> That happiness is real.</p>
<p>"When the unreal in you<br /> Pleases you in your own way,<br /> That happiness is unreal.</p>
<p>"Do you want to know how<br /> You can know the real happiness<br /> From the unreal happiness?</p>
<p>"When you are really happy,<br /> You are satisfied within,<br /> Divinely and supremely.</p>
<p>"When you are unreally happy,<br /> You get no sense of satisfaction<br /> Either in your inner life<br /> Or in your outer life."</p>
