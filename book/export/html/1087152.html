<p>I went to a restaurant in Hawaii that lets you take whatever you want for a fixed price of $4.75. They had twenty items to choose from.</p>
<p>When I got to the cash register, the lady placed her hand on my shoulder and asked, "Are you going to pile your plate still higher?"</p>
<p>The plate was so small! Out of twenty items, I won't take a little of each? Saraswati was behind me, but she didn't have the heart to insult the lady.</p>
