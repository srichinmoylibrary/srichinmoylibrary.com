<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When a child does not listen to his parents, bad things happen. When a child does not listen to his own soul, bad things happen. His soul is like a little dog, his inner dog. When he casts aside the dog and does not take proper care of it and when he does not play with his inner dog cheerfully, bad things happen.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>I am telling you a great secret: you are a fantastic Dream of God</em>, Agni Press, 1974<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/gsdg-56</p></small>    </div>  </body>
