<p>Now comes the third auspicious event of Lord Mahavira's life â€” his renunciation, or <em>vairagya</em>. When Vardhamana was thirty years old, he had certain profound inner experiences by which he knew that the choice Hour had arrived for him to renounce the world.</p>
<p>When the villagers came to know of his decision, a huge procession formed. Vardhamana was carried in a magnificent palanquin to a park beyond the city. There he came down from the palanquin and began to renounce all his possessions one by one.</p>
<p>He took off his flower garlands and discarded his robes. Then he put on a single piece of cloth which was very simple. (Some years later, this cloth became caught on a thornbush and he never wore clothing again.) Finally, Vardhamana plucked out his own hair in five handfuls and silently walked away, in the opposite direction from his home.</p>
<p>"Happy are we, happy live we, who call nothing our own" was his motto.</p>  </div>
