<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What is real delight? Real delight is our constant communion with God. Where can it be found? It can be found only in our constant search for God and in our self-giving to God. How can we apply it to everyday living? We can apply this delight to everyday living if we feel that delight is the only fruit that can nourish us, strengthen us and immortalise us.</p>  </div>
