<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You don't have to go far to know God's Will. If you just meditate and do selfless service, you can know it. You do not have to adopt a difficult method when there is an easy one. If you cultivate silence to know God's Will, then certainly you will be successful. But there is an easier process. This process is self-giving. If you give yourself totally, then you will see that you will not be carried away by the waves of uncertainty; you will become the ocean itself. So, self-giving is the easiest and most effective way.</p>
<p>One way is to dig and dig and then hope to find some water. But by digging and digging, God knows when you are going to get a glimpse of even a tiny drop of water. This way takes time and is uncertain, and while you are digging and digging if you do not get a glimpse of the water, or consciousness, let us say, then you will be disappointed. You will say, "For six years I have stayed with this Master and I feel that I don't know anything. The best thing will be for me to leave him." Whereas if you use the other way, you will go slowly and steadily. If you give yourself daily and if you throw yourself into the sea of self-dedication, then you will get real satisfaction out of life. So follow the easiest and most effective path-self-giving. Just throw yourself into the sea of peace. You do not know whether you will find dangerous water-animals or jewels inside the water, but you will be safe because it is the sea of peace.</p>  </div>
