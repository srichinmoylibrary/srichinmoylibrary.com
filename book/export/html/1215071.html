<p>What can we do for God Almighty? We can offer Him all our outer wealth as well as our inner wealth. When we offer Him both our outer and inner wealth, we see that He immediately gives us His Wealth in infinite measure. If early in the morning we offer to God just one divine thought, one pure thought, He will immediately give us thousands of divine thoughts to spend daily.</p>
<p>This is our inner wealth that we are offering. But how can we offer Him our outer wealth? When we are doing even the most minor, insignificant act, such as sharpening our pencil, we should feel that the capacity we have for sharpening the pencil, for utilising our hands to hold the pencil, has come directly from God. When we dedicate all our outer actions to God, this capacity we are giving back to God directly This is our outer wealth in the form of capacity, which we can give to God. When we do this for minor activities, immediately we see that God gives us infinitely more power when we enter into more complicated, more meaningful, more purposeful activities.</p>  </div>
