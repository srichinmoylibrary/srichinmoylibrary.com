<p>What do I need? I need a lifelong passport to humanity's heart-country. Before I get this passport, I must accomplish quite a few things in my life of aspiration and dedication.</p>
<p>I must acquire a heart full of faith-blossoms and aspiration-flames.</p>
<p>I must acquire a doubt-banished mind and a confusion-illumined mind.</p>
<p>I must acquire a vital that is always a stranger to restlessness and aggression. I must have a vital that is surcharged with energy and dynamism.</p>
<p>I must acquire a body that is divinely strong — as strong as a fort. I must have a body that is supremely pure — as pure as the heart of a temple.</p>
<p>I must say good-bye to my centuries of insecurity. I must say good-bye to my centuries of self-importance and pride. I must say good-bye to my centuries of ignorance-multiplication-game.</p>
<p>Every day, without fail, I must learn a new surrender-prayer that will reach the Forgiveness-Feet of my Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>Every day, without fail, I must learn a new gratitude-meditation that will fly into the Heart of my Lord Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Every day, without fail, I must learn to love my Lord Supreme and manifest Him unconditionally in His own Way.</p>
<p>In my heart-garden I must sow the seeds of patience, compassion and forgiveness slowly, steadily, cheerfully and unerringly.</p>
<p>In my heart-garden I must most devotedly and faithfully grow the plant of universal oneness.</p>
<p>In my heart-garden I must grow into a world-nourishing and world-fulfilling tree. This is the tree that aspires to reach the highest heights. This is the tree that offers cheerfully what it has within. This is the tree that becomes inseparably one with earth's excruciating pangs as well as Heaven's infinite Delight.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, I am now the holder of a lifelong passport to humanity's heart-country.</p>
