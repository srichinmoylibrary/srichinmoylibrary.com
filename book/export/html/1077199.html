<p>The wonder of wonders is his theory of relativity. This discovery opened up for humanity an all-illumining and all-fulfilling vision. It is such a serious, supremely important and supremely earth-fulfilling discovery. Yet at one point Einstein himself takes it in an amusing and light vein: <em>“When a man sits with a pretty girl for an hour, it seems to him a minute. But let him sit on a hot stove for only a minute — and it’s longer than an hour. That’s relativity.”</em></p>  </div>
