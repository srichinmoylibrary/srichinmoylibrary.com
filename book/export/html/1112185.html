<p>I went out to run at five o'clock and around five-thirty I was returning home. I saw a middle-aged man with a small dog that looked like Kanu, but it was even smaller than Kanu. The dog was on the sidewalk. I said to myself, "I do not want to be bothered by the dog." So I came down from the sidewalk and entered into the street. The man said, "Why are you afraid of this puppy?" I said, "I am not afraid. I was smiling at the dog and I came very near it." I asked the man, "What is his name?" He replied, "Billy." I smiled at Billy and at the owner. Then I continued on my way.</p>
