<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One person sees a mango tree and says, "Oh, what a beautiful tree and what beautiful mangoes. Let me count the leaves on this tree first and then eat the mangoes." His realisation is long delayed. Another person enters the garden and upon seeing the mango tree runs immediately to the tree and eats the mangoes.</p>  </div>
