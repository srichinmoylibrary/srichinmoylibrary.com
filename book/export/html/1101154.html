<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I would have accepted you even if you were infinitely worse. Also, if you become infinitely worse, I shall still keep you. No matter where you go, I will be with you. But if you wish to be a true God-seeker, then every day, every hour and every minute you will try to lead a better life. You have to know the value of God's Smile and the value of His Sadness. When you do something, try to imagine God's smiling Face or His sad Face. If you do not want to see His Sadness, then many bad things you will not do. And if you value His Happiness, then the good things that you do you will increase. You will say, "This makes God happy, so let me do it ten times, twenty times, fifty times."</p>  </div>
