<p>Nolini-da was giving an interview to Ajit Bose in the front room while I was working in his bedroom. Suddenly he called me. He said to Ajit Bose: "Do you know Chinmoy? He translates my Bengali writings into English and they appear in the <em>Mother India.</em>"</p>
<p>Then he said to me: "Chinmoy, Ajit wants to type an article of his. Can you give him your typewriter, since mine is not working too well? Your typewriter is also very old. You need a better machine. Let me see what I can do for you."</p>  </div>
