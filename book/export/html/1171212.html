<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are preparing prasad for 400 people, then convince yourself that you are preparing it for only 200 people. Then you will have the extra energy to do another 200.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you want to run one full mile at a stretch, you see the distance and you become frightened and tired. But if you divide it into half a mile or a quarter of a mile, it becomes quite easy.</p>
<p>Here, also, you know that you have to make prasad for 400, but if you think of 400, it will really become boring and you will get tired. But in your mind, if you divide it in half, you will feel that there is still energy and enthusiasm left after you have completed the first half. Then it will become quite easy to continue and complete the second half.</p>  </div>
