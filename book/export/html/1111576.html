<p>When I am running and old people go ahead of me, I say, "How can they do that?" I forget that I too am old.</p>
<p>One old man finished the race and then he went back to run with his wife. His wife was only five metres ahead of me when he came to join her at about the five-and-a-half-mile point. I finished a little ahead of her. When she finished, she was breathing so hard that she was practicably screaming. She sounded as if she were dying.</p>
