  <h1 class="book-heading">A special beauty</h1>
  
 
<p>There is a special beauty in the seeker who soulfully cries. There is a special beauty in the seeker who unreservedly smiles.</p>
<p>There is a special beauty in the seeker who unconditionally gives. There is a special beauty in the seeker who gratefully receives.</p>
<p>There is a special beauty in the seeker who knows that his precious purity lasts precisely because it is helped by his divine love. There is a special beauty in the seeker who knows that his divine love lasts precisely because it is constantly helped by his intense devotion. There is a special beauty in the seeker who knows that his intense devotion lasts precisely because of his surrendered oneness with his Inner Pilot.</p>
<p>Beauty human, beauty divine and Beauty supreme. The human beauty appears at lightning speed and also disappears at lightning speed. Slowly, steadily and unerringly the divine beauty appears, and it does not disappear. Eternally the supreme Beauty abides in the core of the self-giving seeker. It neither appears nor disappears: It eternally is in the core of the self-giving seeker.</p>
