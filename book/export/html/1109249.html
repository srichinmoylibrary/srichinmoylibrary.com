<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, no! Surrender is not a prayer. Everybody prays in the morning to make his will one with the Supreme's Will. In the morning perhaps you will say, "O Supreme, make Your Will my will." But real surrender is not your prayer or your meditation; it is your action. If something is happening in your mind or in your life, at that time you have to see whether you have surrendered your own will to the Supreme's Will.</p>  </div>
