  <h1 class="book-heading">U Thant the world citizen and defender of human rights</h1>
  
 
<p>In an address to the General Assembly commemorating the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, U Thant the world citizen declared: <em>“In this age of the jet plane and the Telstar, the world is fast becoming a community, a community with common interests and common aspirations. Gone are the days when each nation was an island unto itself. Today, questions of human rights are a matter of international concern.”</em></p>
<p>U Thant not only felt humanity’s excruciating pangs but also became one with humanity’s astounding progress. This progress gave him abundant joy and a true sense of satisfaction. He saw that mind-division is surrendering to heart-oneness and national pride is yielding to international light, creating a new and illumining world-society.</p>  </div>
