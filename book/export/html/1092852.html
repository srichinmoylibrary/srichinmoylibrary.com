<p>Pandit-ji, it is so painful.<br /> You took the trouble to visit your friend-rival<br /> Subhas Chandra's shrine in Tokyo, Japan.<br /> Alas, you could find nothing good<br /> To say about him.<br /> Instead you bring the Lord Buddha<br /> Into the picture.<br /> India's first President, Rajendra Prasad,<br /> As well as your own daughter, Indira,<br /> Had such nice things to say about Subhas.<br /> It is simply impossible to understand<br /> How a world figure like you,<br /> How a beloved son of India like yourself,<br /> Could justify your deplorable conduct!</p>
