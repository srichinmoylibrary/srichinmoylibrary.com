<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now we are hankering after name, fame and many other things. But when we have peace of mind, we feel on the strength of our oneness with the rest of the world that everything in the world is ours. Also, when we have peace of mind we feel that there is nothing that we have to achieve or do for ourselves. Everything already has been done for us by the Almighty, by our Heavenly Father.</p>  </div>
