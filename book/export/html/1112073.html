  <h1 class="book-heading">Shame!</h1>
  
 
<p>This evening at a quarter to seven, as I was going to the tennis court, I saw an elderly lady walking a big dog behind Jamaica High School. The dog was on a leash so I was not at all afraid of it.</p>
<p>The lady said to me, "Hi! Good evening."</p>
<p>I said, "Good evening."</p>
<p>She said, "Do you recognise me?"</p>
<p>I couldn't recognise her.</p>
<p>Then she said, "You can't recognise me? I know your name — Sri Chinmoy." She said my name correctly.</p>
<p>I smiled at her and said, "Now tell me what your name is."</p>
<p>She said, "Shame!"</p>
<p>What was I going to tell her? She knew my name, but I didn't know her name. I have never seen her, but she knew me.</p>
