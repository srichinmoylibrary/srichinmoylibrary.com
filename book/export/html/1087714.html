<p>The Emperor Timur was an ancestor of Akbar the Great. When Timur was in India, one day he saw a religious mendicant praying and meditating most soulfully at the foot of a tree. Timur was not a spiritual person, but he appreciated spiritual people. He was so deeply moved by the religious mendicant that he told him he could have anything he wanted from him.</p>
<p>The mendicant said, "I do not need anything from you."</p>
<p>Timur asked, "But why not?"</p>
<p>The mendicant replied, "Because God has supplied me with all my material needs. I have got such a beautiful tree and I can draw water from the river. During the day I have the sun, at night I have the moon, and all the time I have such a vast sky over my head! What else do I need?"</p>
<p>Timur said, "You do not have any money!" The mendicant said, "I do not need money."</p>
<p>"Then please come and visit my palace," said Timur.</p>
<p>"There is no need for me to visit your palace," said the mendicant. "It is true that each place has its own outer beauty, but I care only for the inner beauty."</p>
<p>Finally, Timur said, "I am the Emperor. You have to take something from me."</p>
<p>The mendicant said, "Then give me something that will increase my aspiration and my love for God."</p>
<p>Timur said, "I do not have any aspiration. How can I give you something that will increase your aspiration?"</p>
<p>"Aspiration is the only thing I need," said the mendicant. "Anything else that I take I will not be able to appreciate or use."</p>
<p>Timur said, "No, you have to ask me for something else. Since I do not have anything to increase your aspiration, give me another chance to offer you something!"</p>
<p>The mendicant finally said, "All right. When I meditate here, sometimes flies bother me. Can you stop them from bothering me?" The Emperor tried for a few minutes to stop the flies from bothering the mendicant, but they came back again and again. At last the Emperor said, "It is an impossible task! How can I do it?"</p>
<p>The mendicant told him, "Oh, you are a real Emperor, indeed! You cannot even save me from these flies. Yet just now you were bragging about your wealth and capacity."</p>
<p>The Emperor was deeply humiliated. He stopped disturbing the poor spiritual mendicant and went away.</p>  </div>
