<p>From aspiration we get speed. From dedication we get speed. From manifestation we get speed. Aspiration we have to maintain. Dedication we have to maintain. Surrender we have to maintain. We must aspire, we must dedicate ourselves and again, we must manifest God’s Light. But along with aspiration, there should be surrender. Along with dedication, there should be surrender. Along with manifestation, there should be surrender. If unconditional surrender is available in our aspiration, in our dedication and in our manifestation, then we will definitely get the fastest speed.</p>
<p>You are aspiring. There should be surrender in your aspiration. You are dedicating yourself. There should be surrender in your dedication. You are manifesting God’s Light. There should be surrender in your manifestation. If there is surrender in your aspiration, dedication and manifestation, then your speed will be faster than the fastest.</p>  </div>
