<p>At one point, when some of you were singing running songs to encourage the runners, you were singing so slowly that it sounded like a funeral song. One man asked, "Is that our funeral dirge that is playing?"</p>
<p>I said to myself, "That is what I always say about my disciples' singing when they sing too slowly."</p>
<p>I felt sorry that I could not acknowledge you people when you were singing and encouraging me, but I was dying. Sometimes I couldn't even see your faces.</p>
