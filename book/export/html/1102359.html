<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I fully agree. The world-servers must needs help bring the nations' souls to the fore. When the soul comes to the fore with its divine inner effulgence, then it is only a matter of time before the mind, vital and body accept it. The aspiring heart immediately accepts the soul, but it may take some time before the other members of the being accept the soul. We sow the seed beneath the ground and then it germinates. It becomes a sapling, a plant and, finally, a giant banyan tree. So from within the reality must come forward, and it is the soul that embodies the inner reality and divinity.</p>
