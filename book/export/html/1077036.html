<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul proper is not affected by our emotional actions and reactions. When we use the term ‘emotion’, usually we are referring to vital emotion, and this cannot affect the soul. But if the soul enters into the plane of the lower vital and accepts the emotional life of the vital world as its very own and becomes part and parcel of it, then it is affected. If the soul enters into the vital plane and makes the vital plane feel it is ready to deal with its emotional problems, then the soul puts aside its own divinity and can suffer from the emotional problems of the vital life. But if the soul wants to remain aloof and separate, it can. There is no danger to the soul’s light; it is eternally pure. If the soul remains in its own plane, then it will not be affected.</p>
<p>Everything depends on the soul’s compassion, on its inclination to help the vital life of the person. If I want to take your karma, I take it and then I suffer like anything for days and months. But it is up to me to accept it or not. If I take your impurities, I can rid myself of them because I have the capacity. I can take some garbage and just throw it into the universal Consciousness right away, or I can bring it to a certain spot and leave it there and then, at the right time, throw it into the proper place. But the soul cannot take something from you and then throw it into the universal Consciousness. Only spiritual Masters can do that.</p>  </div>
