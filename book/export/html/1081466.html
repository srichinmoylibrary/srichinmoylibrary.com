<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the heart-power person has solid heart-power and the mind-power person is receptive, then it can be done. If one party has receptivity and the other has capacity, then it is possible. The mind needs receptivity and the heart needs capacity. For the one with mind-power, receptivity is his capacity; whereas the capacity of the person with heart-power is his actual possession of light. If I have heart-power, then my capacity will enter into him and his receptivity will accept it. The heart can convince the mind only when the mind is receptive.</p>  </div>
