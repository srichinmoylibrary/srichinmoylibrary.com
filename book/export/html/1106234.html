<p>Two video cameras can prove that I did my 2,000-pound one-arm lift. On my second attempt I was successful, and my third and fourth lifts were progressively better. But the fifth one was the best.</p>
<p>On my fifth lift my tongue was out of my mouth! If Ranjana had taken pictures from the other side, then my tongue could have been seen. I became like Mother Kali. On the video you can hear what kind of scream I gave.</p>
