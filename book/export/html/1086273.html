<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the morning, if you are really concentrating well on a particular idea, then the idea itself has strength and power in it. But afterwards you have to execute it. If you do not try to execute it, then it will die. It is like a beautiful flower. Immediately you have to place it on the altar; otherwise, the flower will only wither and die. Each thought is a type of flower. After a few hours, it will lose all its beauty and fragrance.</p>  </div>
