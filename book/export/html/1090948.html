<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you are following the spiritual life, if you are attacked by undivine, hostile forces or if you feel that your aspiration is not as it should be, never give up the spiritual life. Every day you cannot eat most delicious food but still you eat every day. You eat every day, you keep your body fit â€” so you can go to work, go to school, do normal activities. In the spiritual life, when we meditate what do we actually do? We feed the soul, our inner being. Now, if we cannot every day feed the soul properly, say in the best way, it is better to feed the soul something than to allow it to starve. So never give up; always try to meditate.</p>
<p>Now the road is long. Sometimes while walking along the road you will see beautiful trees with flowers, foliage and fruits. Again, sometimes you will feel it is only a road, and there are no trees on either side. Sometimes you may feel the road is a barren desert. The goal is still a far cry. So what do you do? Since you are aiming at a goal, you have to walk, walk, walk.</p>
<p>We have to feel that we are all divine farmers. The seeker of the infinite Truth must feel that he is a farmer. A farmer ploughs the field and cultivates; then he has to wait for the rain. After some time the seed germinates and starts to grow into a tiny plant. Similarly, in the spiritual life also, our personal effort is needed. That is to say, we have to practise meditation. Then we have to feel the necessity of God's Grace like rain. When God's Grace descends and our human effort ascends, we come to a point where we can meditate at our sweet will. Advanced spiritual seekers can meditate at any moment, at any time, at any place.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, first try to meditate with your own individual effort and God's Grace. And if you are attacked by hostile forces, undivine forces, and you cannot meditate, then offer your present achievement soulfully and devotedly at the Feet of the Supreme, at the Feet of God: "This is what I have now. I have become a victim to these forces. These are my possessions right now, unwanted possessions, and I am offering them to you. I place them at Your Feet." In that way, if you can offer your existence to the Supreme, then you will see that your daily meditation will become most fruitful.</p>  </div>
