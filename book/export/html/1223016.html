<p>When God gave me the body, He meant well.<br /> He wanted my body to manifest Him.<br /> But alas, what have I done?<br /> And what have I not done?<br /> When God gave me the vital, He meant well.<br /> He wanted my vital to reveal Him.<br /> But alas, what have I done?<br /> And what have I not done?<br /> When God gave me the mind, He meant well.<br /> He wanted my mind to receive Him.<br /> But alas, what have I done?<br /> And what have I not done?<br /> When God gave me the heart, He meant well.<br /> He wanted my heart to feed Him.<br /> But alas, what have I done?<br /> And what have I not done?</p>
