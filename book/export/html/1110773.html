<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To start with, we have to study spiritual books, spiritual scriptures, for self-elevation. In the beginning if we study a few scriptures like the Bible and other books, then we will get deep inspiration. We may feel that this inspiration is not enough to transform our life within and without. So then we have to mix with spiritual people â€” those who we feel are already awakened and aspiring, those who are walking along the spiritual path and marching toward the destined Goal.</p>
<p>It may happen that we will feel that the company of spiritual people is not enough. We are mixing with them, joining in their soulful talk; but the need of our soul impels us to go further. Our cry, inner cry, is so intense that it compels us to look for a spiritual Master. If we get a real spiritual Master, one who is meant for us, who can see our soul, then we are totally safe. There are many, many Masters who may not satisfy our soul's needs. There are many, many universities. We study at a particular university because it fulfils our needs. Similarly, though there are many spiritual teachers, only one can completely satisfy our needs.</p>
<p>We will have infinite confidence in our particular teacher. When we meet this particular teacher in whom we have absolute confidence, then we have to ask him for a specific meditation. Each seeker needs a specific meditation from his spiritual Master. Aspirants who have launched into the spiritual path cannot give a meditation. But a real spiritual Master, one who has realised God Himself and who can enter into our soul and find our souls' qualities, propensities and inclinations, is in a position to give us a specific meditation and guide us in our spiritual life.</p>
<p>When we have a Master, when we are in his boat, we are safe. Everybody will reach the Goal sooner or later, but if we consciously and intensely aspire, we will undoubtedly reach the Goal sooner than those who are still asleep.</p>  </div>
