<p>At this time, Ganapati was no longer living in India. He was running his spiritual centres in America.</p>
<p>Suren’s wife told Ganapati’s family that her husband had seen something in Ganapati even when he was just a child of three or four. She said that her husband had told her that he knew all along that the little fellow Ganapati would one day become a spiritual giant like his predecessors.</p>  </div>
