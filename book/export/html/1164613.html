<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes it can be a blessingful gift from above. But sometimes it happens that the mind has become pure and it wants to grow into something divine, something illumining, something fulfilling. Then the mind can inspire the heart to go deeper and to become wider. So the mind can achieve something unique for the heart. Sometimes it may happen that it is high time for the mind to bring forward the heart and to inspire the other divine qualities of the soul to come forward.</p>  </div>
