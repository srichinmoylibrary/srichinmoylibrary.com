<p>December 18, 1975</p>
<p>My dear Sri Chinmoy,</p>
<p>I thought that I would take time to extend my gratitude to you for a pleasant lunch and the lovely gifts and flowers. I felt you were offering so much more in your generous gesture; and from that feeling comes my deepest gratitude for your presence and spiritual sharing.</p>
<p>I do hope that my words were appropriate in public context. <em>Many of the mothers indicated to me that they shared the same positive feelings about you and your work but did not find the opportunity to express their sentiments.</em></p>
<p>Your influence on my sons has manifested itself in a return to God and the "core values" which have maintained the hope and integrity of humanity through the ages.</p>
<p>The ladies and gentlemen of your group are gracious ambassadors. They are happy looking people and seem to retain their youth.</p>
<p>Thank you again.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>
<p>Theresa Marcantonio</p>  </div>
