<p><em>The following questions were asked by five-time Mr. Universe Bill Pearl, who has also won the coveted title of “World’s Best Built Man of the Century” and been entered into the Bodybuilding Hall of Fame. In 1978 he was elected IFBB National Chairman of the Professional Physique Judges Committee, and he has served as a consultant for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to train astronauts as well as top executives. Since 1954 when he first opened up his innovative gyms — which offered more to a wider range of people than any had before — Bill Pearl has personally programmed over 200,000 bodybuilders and trained more physique stars than any other individual.</em></p>  </div>
