<p>Today I was doing hill work on 150th Street. I was about to complete two miles when I saw the fat lady who used to have two dogs. Now she has only one dog; the other one died. The dog started following me. I knew the dog wouldn't bite me; she was only trying to lick my left knee. I stopped running and the lady said, "Don't be afraid of my dog. She is saying 'Good luck' to you!"</p>
