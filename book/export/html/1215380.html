<p>Then I was coming back. The other day I told a cute story about a white dog that lives near my 800-metre mark. Today the owner of the dog was carrying the dog into the car. I happened to be only four or five metres away. The man kept the dog on his heart chakra. When the dog saw me, he got so excited and wanted to come to me.</p>
<p>The other day also, he followed me, licking my left calf. That time the man had to come and grab him. Today the man said, "It seems that my dog has a deep attraction to you."</p>
<p>This little dog looks like Sona. He really likes me. I gave him a smile and went on my way.</p>
