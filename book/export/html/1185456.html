    <title>&lt;em&gt;Steve Powers:&lt;/em&gt; One of the problems I think people have is that even if they pray and meditate or if they just try to be good, when they go out into the world they find there are people there just waiting to rip them off. They see no justice.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is justice, but we do not know what God’s Justice is, or how it operates. Again, God’s Justice and His Compassion are inseparable. Good people and spiritual people can pray and meditate for divine protection, and also to illumine mankind. If we are assailed by undivine people when we go out, we can easily pray in the morning not only for our own protection, but also for the illumination of unlit people. If we can sincerely pray for the transformation of the undivine people in the world, then this world of darkness and chaos cannot remain as it is.</p>
<p><em>Steve Powers:</em> You are telling me we can transform humanity as the direct result of prayer?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Prayer and meditation can solve all our problems. But we cannot expect immediate or overnight results. Everything takes time.</p>
<p><em>Steve Powers:</em> But don’t you think people are living in very difficult circumstances who do pray, and then watch their children fall prey to drugs and crime and all sorts of abuses in our society?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, many people feel that this is their only life. Some people feel that this incarnation is the first and last. But we believe in reincarnation. There is a Sanskrit word, karma, the law of action and reaction. Who knows what we or our children did in our previous incarnations? Now we are totally oblivious of these former lives. Sometimes we do something wrong and only after a few years do we pay the penalty. But we do not realise that we may also have to pay the penalty for things we did wrong in previous lives. That is how God’s Justice works.</p>  </div>
