<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, philosophy can come from the illumined mind, but usually it comes from what we call the subtle physical mind or the subtle vital mind. These are very complicated spiritual terms. It is only the illumined mind which has the capacity to envision the supreme reality.</p>
<p>Many philosophers have written most sublime things which have come from their illumined mind. Our great Indian philosopher, statesman and President, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, was one of those. He wrote many immortal things from his illumined mind, but when it came to spirituality and yoga proper, he did not enter into those deeper subjects. He saw the reality, but he could not become the reality. To become the divine reality, spirituality is the only answer. In order to establish our oneness with the supreme reality, we must go beyond the illumined mind and enter into the heart.</p>  </div>
