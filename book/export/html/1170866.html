<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Lord Buddha was born in Nepal, but when it is a matter of Lord Buddha’s consciousness, I can say that the whole land of Burma is flooded with Lord Buddha’s compassion-tears. Here in Burma I feel the Buddha’s consciousness even when I walk along the street. God alone knows what is happening in the political sphere, but from the religious and spiritual point of view, Burma is the land of Lord Buddha’s heart.</p>  </div>
