<p>I am just starting to run again, but still I cherish wishful thinking! Before I start running, I am hoping to run my fastest. Then, after 400 metres, I stop. I can't run even one mile! For 400 metres I walk and for 400 metres I run. Then 800 metres I walk and 800 I run.</p>
<p>Today I ran three miles. For the first two miles I walked for 400 metres and I ran for 400 metres. This is what happens when you don't practise for a month. In Puerto Rico I had a tooth problem and a very high fever, so I couldn't run. So many other things as well have prevented me from training.</p>
