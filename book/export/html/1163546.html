<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a great difference between self-enquiry and self-deprecation. Self-enquiry is the precursor of self-discovery. Who am I? What am I here for? The great spiritual Master named Ramana Maharshi from South India used to ask these questions. Unless you want to know who you are, how are you going to know what you are here for?</p>
<p>First we start with enquiry; then it becomes discovery. But in self-deprecation, we limit ourselves in our own estimation. Let us not be bloated with pride, for that would be a mistake. But if constantly we find fault with ourselves and just curse ourselves every moment we get the opportunity, then again that is wrong. It is a way of expressing our false modesty. We know what we are. If we are sincere, then we are bound to know what kind of life we are leading and what we are offering to mankind. If we are sincere, then we can be more sincere. If we are aspiring, then we can aspire more. There is no end to our progress. But if we constantly find fault with ourselves, then we are making a mistake.</p>
<p>Self-enquiry leads to self-discovery. Self-deprecation leads to unconscious, if not conscious, destruction.</p>  </div>
