<p>There was once an elderly village moneylender who was very rich. He was a very nice man, and many times he would give money to the needy. His name was Junga.</p>
<p>One day a young man took a loan from Junga. He promised that in six months' time he would return the money.</p>
<p>After six months had passed, the young man came to the rich man and said that he could not return the money. The rich man got mad. He said, "No, you have to return it!"</p>
<p>The young man said, "I don't have the money. What can I do?"</p>
<p>The old man started screaming and insulting him. "No, you have to return it!" he said.</p>
<p>The young man said, "When I have the money, I will give it back. But right now I don't have the money."</p>
<p>The old man said, "Then why did you take the money from me and why did you promise to return it in six months?"</p>
<p>The young man, who was badly insulted, said, "You donkey, you camel!"</p>
<p>The old man got furious and said, "You take money from me and you call me a donkey and a camel? I will sue you."</p>
<p>He sent for the village head and gave some money to him. Then he said, "Now you tell me what I should do. This young man took money from me and he is not returning it. What is worse, he is calling me a camel and a donkey."</p>
<p>The young man said, "I took money, true, and one day I will give it back to him. But how badly he was scolding and insulting me, you have no idea! So what could I do?"</p>
<p>The village head scolded the young man and said, "You should not call him names. He is of your father's age. You should always have respect for elderly people. Also, you should return his money as soon as possible."</p>
<p>The young man said, "All right, I will not call him names, and one day I promise I will return his money. But when I return the money, if at that time I have a camel and a donkey, may I not call my animals Junga?"</p>
<p>The village head said, "Do anything you like, but first give the money back. As long as you do not call Junga a camel and a donkey, whatever name you want to give to your camel and donkey is up to you."</p>
<p>In two weeks' time the young man borrowed money from somebody else and returned the money to Junga. Then he brought a camel and donkey right in front of the moneylender's house and started shouting, "Junga, Junga! What do you want? Do you want to have grass? Do you want water? Do you want something?"</p>
<p>The old moneylender got furious. But the young man said, "I have returned your money. Now I can do anything I want to. These are my animals. I have every right to name them Junga. It is none of your business!"</p>  </div>
