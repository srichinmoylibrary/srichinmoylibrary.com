 <p>
JSBH 4-8. On 25 September 1987 Sri Chinmoy met with Isamu Takada, Governor of Nagasaki Prefecture. These are excerpts from their discussion.</p>
<h2><em>Governor Takada:</em> I have heard so much about you. You are the proposer of the Peace Run.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God, out of His Kindness and Compassion, gave me the inspiration. And my students around the world manifested this inspiration, along with thousands of others, as they carried the peace torch around the world in the Peace Run.</p>  </div>
