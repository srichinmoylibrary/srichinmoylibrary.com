<p>The Supreme</p>
<p>Father, I have Seen.<br /> “No.”<br /> Father, I have Known.<br /> “No.”<br /> Father, I have Felt.<br /> “No.”<br /> Father, I have Become.<br /> “No.”<br /> Father, I AM.<br /> “Yes.”</p>


<p>The Supreme</p>
<p>Father, You are the Grace.<br /> “No.”<br /> Father, You are the Law.<br /> “No.”<br /> Father, You are the Birth<br /> and<br /> Death of Creation.<br /> “No.”<br /> Father, You are the Child<br /> of<br /> Your DREAM.<br /> “Yes.”</p>

<p>These are my highest experiences. Learn, learn them by heart! These poems, plus my “Revelation,” “Immortality” and a few others, please learn. There are at least ten or twenty poems that you should learn by heart. Then you will get tremendous joy, tremendous joy.</p>
<p>I used to learn quite a few of Sri Aurobindo’s poems. My two most favourite ones were “Invitation” — “With wind and the weather beating round me…” — and “Who” — “In the blue of the sky, in the green of the forest…” Those two poems by Sri Aurobindo one cannot appreciate enough or admire enough.</p>
