<p>One day I was out running. A beautiful six or seven-year-old child, wearing a necklace, came up to me and asked, "Mister, can I run with you?"</p>
<p>I said, "Why not?"</p>
<p>I had been running at an eight or eight and a half minute pace. Now, very slowly I ran with her. We covered three blocks, and then she stopped near her house. She came from a respectable family. She was so happy and proud that I ran with her. She thanked me and gave me a broad smile.</p>  </div>
