<p>While I was watching the New York City Marathon from the sidewalk, many times I raised my hand when I saw disciples running.</p>
<p>Four or five times other people hit my hand with their hand as they were running by. They hit me so hard!</p>
<p>One or two recognised me, and while touching me said, "Sri Chinmoy!" But some just gave me a slap.</p>
<p>â€” 2 November 1986</p>  </div>
