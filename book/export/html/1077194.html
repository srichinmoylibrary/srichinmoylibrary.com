<p>Einstein’s way of teaching was very special. Humour played a gigantic role at times in his approach. He taught his students not only how to think but also what to think of. <em>“Think more. Be totally absorbed. The answer is bound to dawn,”</em> was his philosophy. Memorisation, he felt, is not and cannot be the ultimate answer. He stressed this undeniable fact vehemently and unreservedly. Only today’s proper thinking will bring in tomorrow’s satisfaction-sun.</p>  </div>
