<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life sex has to be gradually given up. If you want to realise God in this body, sex has no place. Now, you have to know that impure mental associations are as harmful as physical relationships. If the mind enjoys lower vital thoughts, then it is practically the same as having gross physical relations.</p>
<p>At the time of meditation, it is especially important not to indulge in any lower vital thoughts, sex thoughts. It will be infinitely more fatal than when the normal consciousness enjoys lower thoughts because, at the time of meditation, your whole power of concentration is extremely intense. If you think of Divinity, Peace, Light and Bliss, then like an arrow you are entering into Godâ€™s divine Kingdom. Similarly, if you think of lower vital things, you enter immediately, with the same intensity, into the lower vital. Then there you are caught.</p>  </div>
