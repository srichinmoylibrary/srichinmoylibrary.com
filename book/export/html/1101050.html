<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day, every hour, every minute, consciously try to convince your mind that you are seven years old. Then imagine what you were doing at the age of seven. Perhaps your mother was doing this or that with you, or your father was taking you here and there. At that time you did everything with such dynamism and cheerfulness. Perhaps your parents were getting someone to teach you to ride a horse and play the flute in the hope that one day you would become a great rider or musician. Even if these things did not happen on the physical plane, imagine that you were doing these things, and imagine how happy you were. If you can bring back to your conscious mind the enthusiasm and eagerness that you felt when you were seven, then easily you can be dynamic and cheerful.</p>  </div>
