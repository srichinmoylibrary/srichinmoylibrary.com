<p>The two phone calls that I made to Pondicherry from Bombay were not even one minute long. The first time I only asked my brother how my sister was. Then I dialed the nursing home. At the nursing home, my sister did not even come to the phone. But the hotel charged me for four minutes per call. Then I placed a phone call to New York. The hotel operator dialed the wrong number. When I challenged them, they denied it, and before I came downstairs, they changed the number on my bill. I happened to see that on their copy the incorrect telephone number was still there.</p>
<p>So they told me lies. They said that because somebody answered the phone in New York, I had to pay two hundred rupees, even though it was a wrong number. Plus I had to pay more than six hundred rupees for the two calls I made to Pondicherry, which should have been forty or fifty rupees. So in the Bombay hotel, deception started.</p>  </div>
