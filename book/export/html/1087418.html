<p>It depends on whether he continues to maintain his spiritual approach to tennis. During a recent interview he said that even if he cannot immediately bring his determination to the fore and loses points, he does not mind because he and his opponent are giving one another such joy playing together. This kind of attitude is so spiritual! He is reaching the hearts of so many people and he has become very, very popular. If he continues to maintain this sincere, spiritual approach throughout his career, then he will be able to inspire many, many people. I do hope he will continue and not let his business manager and others instigate him to start thinking of money-power.</p>  </div>
