<p>My problem is this:<br /> I cannot think<br /> Of God<br /> Even for seven minutes a day.<br /> God's problem is this:<br /> He cannot stop thinking<br /> Of me<br /> Even for seven seconds a day.</p>
<p>My problem is this:<br /> I do not want to know<br /> How great God is,<br /> As long as He is kind to me.</p>
<p>God's problem is this:<br /> He does not want to know<br /> How undivine I am,<br /> As long as I call Him my Father.</p>
