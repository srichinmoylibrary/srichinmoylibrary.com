<h2><em>Interviewer:</em> What do you hope will be accomplished by the dedication of this Peace Airport?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day we are trying to have happiness in our lives. This happiness we can get only from peace. If I love you and you love me, then inside our love is peace. If we have peace, then we have everything.</p>
<p>Every day so many people are coming and going through this international Airport. From now on, if they feel a sense of oneness, then they will be happy and peaceful. This is a new idea, a new hope, a new dream and a new promise.</p>  </div>
