<p>(The English Channel)</p>
<p>I am the ceaseless surge of unique delight.<br /> Two are the flames that kiss the highest height<br /> And the deepest deep no one beholds save I.<br /> One is in Paris, the other in England's eye.</p>
<p>My breadth is the hyphen white between the twain.<br /> Their union is hid in dull Time-brain.<br /> The rapture flood of their diamond amity<br /> In years thirty and five the world will see.</p>
<p>He and She my left and right, with them I shine.<br /> He is the Supreme and She the Mother divine.<br /> To lift the doleful earth to heaven's height<br /> Their human birth and forms of endless Might.</p>
