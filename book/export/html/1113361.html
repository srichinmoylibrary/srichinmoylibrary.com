<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. You should always feel that you are one of my attendants not only while you are doing selfless service but also while you are doing something that is not directly related to selfless service. A disciple must always feel that he is an attendant of the Master no matter where he is or where the Master is.</p>
<p>There are two ways-the inner attendant's way and the outer attendant's way. The outer attendant's way is practically "out of sight, out of mind." The inner attendant's way is constant, unconditional self-giving, which is the only way to see the growing fulness and glowing fruitfulness of God the Creator and God the Creation.</p>  </div>
