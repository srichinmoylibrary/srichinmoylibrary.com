<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> That comes from being disciplined, keeping my mind on what I have to do and always looking ahead. Also, I always have utmost confidence that I am going to win. No matter what happens, I am not going to change my game plan â€” even if someone gets a bum start. Also, I am relaxed. You really have to conquer the fear of pain and falling or accidents.</p>  </div>
