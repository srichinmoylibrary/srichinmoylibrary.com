<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Many things have puzzled you. But you have to know that our life of manifestation and our life of aspiration are inseparable; you can't separate them. Early in the morning you meditate. This is your life of aspiration. But you can't remain inside your room. For twenty-four hours it is not possible for you to remain inside your room. If you don't go to work, then you can't earn money to buy food and support yourself. If you stay only with aspiration and meditate, meditate, remaining always closeted, then who is going to bring you food and support you? You have to support yourself. Aspiration you have done; now go outside for manifestation. Aspiration and manifestation cannot be separated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when you were in your own country, you thought that here in New York we were acting like the seekers in the Himalayan caves. In New York there are no caves. I am a twentieth century Yogi, an ultramodern Yogi. If you expect the Himalayan caves from this modern Yogi, then I must say that hundreds of years ago I have gone through the experience of the Himalayan caves and all that. I do not want to repeat the same old stories. I am fond of new notions. Newness is absolutely necessary. How can we appreciate the old stories? The old will not be appreciated; we always need new stories.</p>
<p>So, now that you have come here, please try to do one thing, and that is to discard or abandon all your ideas about spirituality. Since you have accepted my path, kindly try to see through my eyes. Then there will be no confusion, no uncertainty.</p>  </div>
