<p>If we know that something exists, then for us that thing is real. If we cannot feel its existence, then to us it is unreal. During our meditations we try to feel the Peace of God. We are trying and we are crying to bring down inner Peace because inside the inner Peace is God’s Reality. We can see, feel and grow into this Reality only when we are in the sea of Peace. It is Peace that is the Mother and Father, Brother and Sister of God. So if we can have Peace, then we are not only getting God, but all God’s relatives as well.</p>  </div>
