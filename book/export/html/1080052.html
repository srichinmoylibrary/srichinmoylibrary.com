<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They do not love and respect each other more precisely because the capacity of their heart is limited and not unlimited. They do not care for the universality that is in the heart; they care only for the individuality in their existence. If they could feel universality, then automatically all religions would have abiding love and respect for one another.</p>  </div>
