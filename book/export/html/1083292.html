<p>My muslim professor friend, Abul, once said to me in an Indian restaurant, "I highly appreciate your pen, but I truly admire your abstinence. You don't drink tea at all, whereas I take tea, the slow poison, eight times a day." I told him not to worry. I said to him, "True, tea is slow poison, but its antidote, quick aspiration, you have in abundant measure. It will save you." My lofty prophesy has come true. My professor friend and tea are no longer friends.</p>  </div>
