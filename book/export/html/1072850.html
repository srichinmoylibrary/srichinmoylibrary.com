<p>My seeker friends,<br /> You are telling me<br /> That you have immediate problems.</p>
<p>I wish to tell you<br /> That I have immediate solutions.</p>
<p>My solutions are very simple and direct.</p>
<p>Just come with me and sit<br /> At my Lord's Forgiveness-Feet.</p>
<p>Just come with me and look<br /> At my Lord's Compassion-Eyes.</p>
<p>Just come with me and swim<br /> In the sea of my Lord's<br /> Satisfaction-Heart.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, all your problems<br /> Have totally vanished,<br /> Forever and forever.</p>
