<p>When I met the Sultan in Kuala Lumpur, immediately I got a very good vibration from him. In a previous incarnation I had known his soul quite well. At that time the Sultan had a very, very close connection with me, but our relationship was totally different.</p>
<p>The Sultan also felt something in me. He was so kind and affectionate from beginning to end. He showed me the same kind of affection that Dan Lurie, the physical fitness proponent, shows me.</p>
<p>In the newspaper he had seen the picture of my lifting Samy Vellu. So when he saw me, he immediately said, "Do you want to lift me?" Of course I did! The whole time I was lifting him, he was in a trance; he was so happy.</p>
