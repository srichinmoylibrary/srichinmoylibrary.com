<p>Once upon a time<br /> You felt that many things<br /> Were necessary in your spiritual life,<br /> And you worked very hard for them.<br /> Now tremendous relaxation<br /> Has assailed your body, vital, mind<br /> And perhaps even your heart.<br /> Rid yourself of this destructive relaxation!<br /> Walk, march, run and fly<br /> To reach your destined goal!</p>
