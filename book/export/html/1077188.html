<p>Einstein saw divinity in all human beings, no matter how small their achievement on earth or how deplorable and meaningless their human life. Even when he had to face a volley of criticism, never did he give up this conviction. Indeed, poor Einstein was even criticised once for speaking in the same manner to a cleaning lady as to the president of his university.</p>  </div>
