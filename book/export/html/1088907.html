<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A seeker can tell a true living Master if his inner and outer being is inundated with delight and ecstasy when he approaches the Master. If you see a real spiritual Master, he may not be your Master, but your inner joy will determine if he is real. Again, you may stand in front of a true Master and not get anything, because you are in a low consciousness. But if your heart is crying for a real Master, then you are bound to feel something when you stand in front of one. And if you find your own Master, you will find everything that you need in this life.</p>  </div>
