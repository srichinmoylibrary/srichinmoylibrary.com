<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This started many years ago, when I used to meditate eight, nine, ten hours a day. When I was in India, I used to go to bed at eleven or twelve o'clock and get up at two o'clock in the morning. Then I used to meditate for hours and hours. Now my meditation is continuous.</p>  </div>
