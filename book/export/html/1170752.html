<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I always say that man writes prose, but it is God who writes poetry in and through man. In poetry, each word carries us into the Unknowable, where there is tremendous joy. We may think that when we enter into the Unknowable, we will be totally lost. But we are not lost; we are flying.</p>
<p>Poetry is intuitive, so we should not try to understand it. It is not the mind we need in order to derive joy, but the heart.</p>  </div>
