<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I was doing quite a few things before I invited questions. I went to a very, very high plane of consciousness and from there I brought down Peace, Love, Light and Bliss. All the people in this hall have souls, and most of the souls were hungry. But some souls needed Love, while others needed Peace or Bliss and other divine qualities. So according to the different soulsâ€™ need and receptivity, I have brought down the divine food and fed them.</p>  </div>
