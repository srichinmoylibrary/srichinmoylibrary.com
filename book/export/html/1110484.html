<p>The Bengal of today is a fruitless lamentation. The Bengal of tomorrow can, however, be the torch-bearer of the rare fulfilment of the promise of today.</p>
<p>His was the heart that gave no shelter to the doctrine of the unreality of the finite. His was the genius that had the quality of universality in a striking degree.</p>
<p>Glory to Tagore, for through him even the most insignificant and the humblest Bengali villagers can speak to the world at large.</p>
<p>His songs are the songs that in a twinkling penetrate the heart and quicken the soul. Verily, Tagore’s life was a sacrifice to Culture. His songs were his prayers about this great Culture.</p>  </div>
