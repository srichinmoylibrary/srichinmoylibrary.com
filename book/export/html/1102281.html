<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each nation has to feel that there is only one world-nation and one world-family. It has to feel that we are not only of the One but also for the One. Since the Source is one, that means that the end is also one. When we say that we are of the One but for the many, we immediately create problems for ourselves. As soon as we say 'many,' we feel that there are many different minds, many different approaches and many different realities; we may lose the feeling of oneness. But if we say that we are of the One and also for the One, then there is no problem.</p>
<p>A tree has branches, flowers, leaves and fruits. If we do not take the tree as one unit or one reality, if we only appreciate one particular aspect, such as the fruits, then we are unable to pay full attention to all the things that the tree embodies.</p>
<p>So each nation should feel that there is only one world-tree, one reality, of which each nation is a part. Otherwise, one nation will start out praying and meditating for all the nations but immediately stop if the other nations make a mistake or do something that displeases it. But if that particular nation feels that all the nations have been combined or amalgamated into one reality, then it will all the time pray and meditate for the other nations.</p>
<p>The best way for the individual nation to make progress and also add to world-progress is to feel that there is only one reality. This reality is the Source, the traveller, the road and the goal.</p>
