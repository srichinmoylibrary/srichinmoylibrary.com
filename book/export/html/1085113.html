<p>O body of the world,<br /> O soul of the world,<br /> In you the silence-nest<br /> Of cosmic oneness-rest.<br /> Yours is the nectar-role<br /> To end earth's sombre dole.<br /> Our souls desire to flow<br /> In your duty's vision-glow.</p>

<p>The present Pilot of the United Nations-boat, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, called President Gorbachev's historic U.N. speech of 7 December 1988 "remarkable for its vision and far-reaching ideas."</p>
<p>In his turn, President Gorbachev spoke about the U.N. with glowing admiration. Unfortunately, not many have highly appreciated the United Nations. But President Gorbachev said about the U.N. and its Secretary-General, "God is on your side at the United Nations."</p>
<p>These few precious words will forever shine in the heart-history of the United Nations. Only a supreme seeker can feel the necessity of spirituality and God at the United Nations. From his aspiration-heart and dedication-life, President Gorbachev reveals to the entire world what the United Nations actually stands for in the annals of history.</p>  </div>
