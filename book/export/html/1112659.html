 <p>
SLT 86-95. Sri Chinmoy made a short visit to Florida in November 1981.</p>
<h2>Do you want a cigar?</h2>

<p>The first day in Florida while I was running, I saw a young man smoking a cigar. He said to me, "Do you want to have a cigar?"</p>
<p>I waved my hand and said, "No, thank you."</p>
<p>The man ran after me and said, "You thank me and you are not taking one?"</p>
<p>This time I got mad at him, and he stopped bothering me.</p>  </div>
