<p>Indeed, a leader is a ladder.</p>
<p>Indeed, a leader is he who lifts his followers up, and not he who pushes his followers down.</p>
<p>A leader must know that his followers are with him precisely because he is unreservedly for them.</p>
<p>A leader must learn how to multiply his capacities lovingly and completely in his followers.</p>
<p>An illumining thought precedes the leader's vision-eye. A fulfilling action succeeds his reality-life.</p>
<p>A supreme leader is he who has the dreamer's eyes and the doer's hands.</p>
<p>A true leader's true properties are an open mind and an open heart.</p>  </div>
