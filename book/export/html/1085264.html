<p>There was once a great spiritual Master who used to all the time tell his disciples, “Always depend on God’s Will, always have complete faith in God’s Will. Let God’s Will be done.” This was his motto.</p>
<p>One night he was about to go to sleep when he saw a snake near his bed. He said, “If I call my disciples they will come and immediately kill you. Again, if I do nothing, then you may kill me. Since I do not want you to be killed, the best thing is for me to leave the matter in God’s Hands. If my time has come, then naturally you will kill me. If my time has not come, you will leave of your own accord.”</p>
<p>The following day when one of the Master’s attendants came in to see the Master, he saw the snake and was simply shocked: “Perhaps the snake stayed near the Master’s bed throughout the night,” he said.</p>
<p>The Master said, “Yes. He remained here all night.”</p>
<p>The attendant asked, “Then how is it that you didn’t call us?”</p>
<p>“Shall I depend on you, you weaklings,” the Master asked, “or shall I depend on the Will of the Almighty, my Beloved Supreme? I depended on the Beloved Supreme, and He wanted me to stay on earth. Therefore, the snake did not bite me.”</p>
<p>“But what is the snake doing here now?” asked the attendant.</p>
<p>“Call the others. Let all the disciples see the snake,” the Master said. “The snake remains here to show human beings that when one has faith in God, God takes care of that person. I had perfect faith in God’s dispensation; therefore, the snake did not bite me. It is through the snake that God is giving you people a lesson. Have perfect faith in the Master, have perfect faith in God. Then, no ignorance can touch you. On the one hand, the snake symbolises ignorance. On the other hand, it is carrying the message of the Supreme. If one has faith in the Will of the Supreme, one knows that whatever happens is for the best.”</p>
