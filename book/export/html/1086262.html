<h2>Question: How can we tune in to the particular quality that you are bringing down most in your meditation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes it is quite noticeable to the outer eye whether I am bringing down power or peace. Sometimes it is not, because while I am bringing down one aspect of divinity, such as peace, inside the peace there is also power or solid strength, or inside power there is peace. Again, sometimes everything comes but only one aspect is noticeable to the human eye.</p>
<p>Now, how will you identify yourself with the most prominent quality? Do not use the mind, do not use the eyes but inwardly become one with the quality. You have to use the heart to feel it, not the eyes to see it. You should keep your eyes open — otherwise you may fall asleep-and use the heart to identify yourself with what you are seeing. If you see the beauty of a flower and enjoy its fragrance and you want to feel the essence of the flower inside your heart, you will not be able to feel it if you are only exercising the capacity of your nose and your eyes. Here you are not letting the heart exercise its capacity. You have seen and smelled the flower but you also have to grow into the flower which is full of beauty and purity. So, you are not the nose, you are not the eyes, you are the heart. The inner heart will immediately bring to the fore the essence and substance of the flower itself and you will become one with the flower. So, after you have seen a quality during your meditation, do not mentally say that it is power or delight. Just become that quality by using your heart.</p>  </div>
