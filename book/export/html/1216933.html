<p>On the plane coming back from San Francisco, there was a very mischievous child sitting next to me. His mother was sitting on his other side.</p>
<p>He started playing with clay and throwing it around. Some of the clay landed on my pants.</p>
<p>I said to his mother, "He will be an artist."</p>
<p>The mother said, "How do you know?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am an artist."</p>
<p>Then I went to sleep. Otherwise, I would have had to enter into conversation.</p>
