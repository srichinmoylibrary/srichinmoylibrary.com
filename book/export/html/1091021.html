<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way, the only way, is to pray to the Supreme to grant the soul whatever it needs. Only do not think of the person in terms of his earthly existence. Suppose a dear one has died. If you feel that your dear one did not have peace when he was alive, or that he did not have joy or love or something else, then you may pray to the Supreme to grant the soul that particular quality. But that quality the soul may not need, only the physical or vital may have needed it here on earth. So the best thing is to pray to the Supreme to grant the thing that the soul needs.</p>  </div>
