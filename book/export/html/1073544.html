<p>“God, how old are You?”</p>
<p>“I am one year old.”</p>
<p>“Only one year old! Then I am much older than You. I am four years old.”</p>
<p>“I am so happy to hear that. Now tell Me, sweetest Stephanie, do you love Me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I love You, but I also love my Guru.”</p>
<p>“That is fine. I love your Guru too. He and I are one. He is My son. Shall I tell you a secret, Stephanie?”</p>
<p>“Please, please tell me!”</p>
<p>“Your Guru loves you more than you love him.”</p>
<p>“Never! I won’t believe You, God. I love my Guru more than he loves me.”</p>
<p>“All right, will you believe Me if I say that I love you more than you love Me?”</p>
<p>“Never! I love You more than You love me.”</p>
<p>“You are wrong, Stephanie.”</p>
<p>“No, God, You are wrong. God, You know that I pray to my Guru every day. He comes to see me only two times a year. So You see, I love him more than he loves me. I pray to You every day. But You have come to see me only today for the first time. So You see, I love You more than You love me.”</p>
<p>“My sweetest child Stephanie, every night your Guru and I come to see you while you are fast asleep.”</p>
<p>“Every night You and my Guru come to see me! I am going to tell my Mommy! Mommy!”</p>
<p>With His proudest Smile, God disappears.</p>  </div>
