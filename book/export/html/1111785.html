<p>In today's race I didn't know that Fred Lebow was ahead of me. They were announcing that Mary Decker Tabb would run there in September. Then they said, "The President has come." Karabi heard it over the loudspeaker as she was finishing.</p>
<p>Dipali, out of her infinite kindness, stayed behind me so that she could follow me to the end. But Karabi went ahead at the very beginning. Husiar was twentieth out of thousands.</p>
