<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not at all. Possessions are not a hindrance to the soul’s development. We have to have a different attitude towards life’s problems and life’s activities. All hindrances, even if at first we consider them as hindrances, can be taken as opportunities in our life. If we take them as hurdles, then each hurdle will give us an opportunity to cross over it and come closer to our goal. What we think of as a hindrance is not a hindrance in God’s view.</p>  </div>
