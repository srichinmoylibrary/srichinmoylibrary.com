<h2>Sri Jagadish Chandra Bose</h2>

<p>J. C. Bose the seer was as great as J. C. Bose the scientist. He represented a novel type in the world of science. He was the forerunner of a new age of scientific research. He had moved the frontiers of intuitive science towards a fresh attainment. A man of deep faith, a perfect example of artless living and lofty thinking, an embodiment of all that is good and inspiring was Jagadish Chandra.</p>
<p><em>Sarvam prana ejati nihsrtam</em> (Everything springs up from life and makes movements therein). This eternal message of the Upanishads ceaselessly reverberated in the inmost recesses of the discoverer of "plant sensitivity." The world has come to learn from this son of India the secret of observing a plant shivering, suffering, struggling, perhaps even reciprocating love.</p>  </div>
