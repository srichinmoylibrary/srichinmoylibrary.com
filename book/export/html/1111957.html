<p>Nemi's boss, Sandy, completed the whole New York Marathon! Look what determination can do when God's Grace descends! There is a Sanskrit saying that when God's Grace descends, it can give eloquence to the dumb and enable the lame to scale mountains. Here God's Grace descended, and through his determination he completed the marathon even though he recently had suffered a stroke.</p>
<p>One person will run the marathon in two hours and another will have to exercise patience and run it in 10 or 12 hours. The race goes to the swiftest; that is one theory. But in the inner world, the race goes to the one who has utmost patience. Because of our infinite patience, our hope of realising God will one day be manifested into reality.</p>
