<p>My soul is free to smile at<br /> The beautiful God-dreamers.<br /> My life is free to serve<br /> The faithful God-servers.<br /> My heart is free to love<br /> The unconditional God-lovers.<br /> And I am free to admire<br /> The conscious God-owners.</p>

<p>The clever mind<br /> Can and does give<br /> Many things to the world<br /> Without loving.<br /> The pure heart<br /> Will never and can never give<br /> Even one thing to the world<br /> Without loving.</p>

<p>Yesterday<br /> The victory of my humility-mind<br /> Was announced by the trumpets<br /> Of the vastness-sky.<br /> Today<br /> The victory of my purity-heart<br /> Will be announced by the organs<br /> Of the fulness-sun.</p>

<p>The first God-Call awakens us<br /> From centuries' ignorance-sleep.<br /> The second God-Call illumines<br /> Our unlit human nature.<br /> The third God-Call inspires<br /> The divine in us<br /> To sing the God-manifestation-song<br /> In God's own Way<br /> Here on earth.</p>

<div id="node-1105755" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16.</h1>
  
 

<p>It is not an impossible task<br /> To forgive and forget<br /> One's failure-past<br /> If one starts to live<br /> For God and God alone.</p>

<div id="node-1105756" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17.</h1>
  
 

<p>My seeker-friend,<br /> You want to know<br /> Who gave me<br /> God's Home Address.<br /> My seeker-friend,<br /> It is my spiritual heart<br /> And not my intellectual mind<br /> That has given me<br /> God's Home Address.</p>

<div id="node-1105757" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18.</h1>
  
 

<p>Do you want to get close,<br /> Very close, to God?<br /> Then never for a second<br /> Must you worry<br /> About your earthly<br /> Achievements<br /> And your Heavenly<br /> Accomplishments.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1105758" class="section-2">

  <h1 class="book-heading">20.</h1>
  
 

<p>The moment I surrendered<br /> My sadness-vital<br /> To my Lord Supreme,<br /> He immediately increased<br /> My heart-hunger immensely<br /> And placed His own<br /> Victory-Crown<br /> On my head.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1105760" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">21.</h1>
  
 

<p>"My sweet child, My sweeter child,<br /> My sweetest child,<br /> When you come to see Me,<br /> I never ask you to tell Me<br /> What others are doing wrong.<br /> I do not ask you to tell Me<br /> Even what you are doing wrong.<br /> I immediately ask you to tell Me<br /> What you are doing right,<br /> And in how many ways<br /> You are trying to please Me.<br /> My sweet child, My sweeter child,<br /> My sweetest child,<br /> It does not become you<br /> To see others'<br /> Teeming imperfections.<br /> I am constantly dreaming<br /> In and through you<br /> To make you My Eternity's<br /> Absolutely perfect instrument.<br /> Please fulfil My Dream,<br /> My long-cherished Dream,<br /> My only Dream!"</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">23.</h1>
  
 

<p>This morning my Lord Supreme,<br /> Out of His infinite<br /> Compassion-Light,<br /> Has given me the power<br /> Of receptivity<br /> To make a permanent contract<br /> With gratitude-delight.</p>

<div id="node-1105763" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24.</h1>
  
 

<p>Today's headline:<br /> My heart has made<br /> Its unconditional surrender<br /> To God's Will.<br /> Tomorrow's footnote:<br /> My mind is all ready<br /> To welcome God soulfully.</p>

<div id="node-1105764" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25.</h1>
  
 

<p>No,<br /> Not the annihilation of the mind<br /> But the illumination of the mind;<br /> No,<br /> Not the renunciation of life<br /> But the acceptance of life;<br /> No,<br /> Not the hesitation of the heart<br /> But the expansion of the heart<br /> We need in order to sign<br /> A permanent contract<br /> With world peace.</p>

<div id="node-1105766" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">27.</h1>
  
 

<p>If your heart's aspiration<br /> Is immense<br /> And your life's dedication<br /> Is intense,<br /> Then your outer life<br /> Is bound to succeed<br /> Powerfully<br /> And your inner life<br /> Is bound to proceed<br /> Dauntlessly.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">28.</h1>
  
 

<p>What is unlit<br /> And what is sunlit?<br /> Unlit is when I say<br /> That I can do it.<br /> Sunlit is when I say<br /> That my Lord Supreme<br /> Has already done it for me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1105768" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">29.</h1>
  
 

<p>The favourite question<br /> Of a useless seeker is:<br /> "My Lord God,<br /> Do tell me when and how soon<br /> I will be able to realise You."</p>
<p>The favourite statement<br /> Of a faithful and soulful seeker is:<br /> "My Lord Supreme,<br /> I know that at Your choice Hour<br /> You will make me realise You.<br /> Therefore,<br /> I am not at all in a hurry."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1105769" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">30.</h1>

<div id="node-1105770" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">31.</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1105771" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">32.</h1>
  
 

<p>Everything else in life<br /> You may keep a supreme secret,<br /> But not your love of God,<br /> For your love of God alone<br /> Will give you salvation from sin, <br /> Illumination from darkness,<br /> Liberation from bondage,<br /> Realisation from imperfection<br /> And Immorality from death.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1105772" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">33.</h1>
  
 

<p>My God-obedience is the seed<br /> That I am offering<br /> To God the man.<br /> My God-discovery is the fruit<br /> That I shall offer<br /> To man the God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1105773" class="section-2">

  </div>
<div id="node-1105776" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">37.</h1>
  
 

<p>I must immediately shake off<br /> My God-disappointment-past<br /> So that my Lord Beloved Supreme<br /> Can smilingly and proudly<br /> Grow, glow, sing and dance<br /> Inside my today's<br /> Silver dreams<br /> And my tomorrow's<br /> Golden realities.</p>

  </div>
<div id="node-1105780" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">41.</h1>
  
 

<p>Today I am inviting<br /> The whole world<br /> To come and see<br /> My Lord Supreme<br /> While He is illumining<br /> The affection-flooded village-home<br /> Of my heart's aspiration-cry.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1105781" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">42.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Out of His infinite Compassion,<br /> Affection, Love and Fondness,<br /> Has given me a sleepless<br /> Willingness-heart.<br /> Alas, what have I done?<br /> I have given my poor life<br /> An obstinate unwillingness-mind!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1105782" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">43.</h1>
  
 

<p>Outwardly God may never<br /> Expose and arrest<br /> My false and insincere aspiration.<br /> But inwardly every day<br /> He detects and rejects<br /> My false and insincere aspiration.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1105783" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">44.</h1>
  
 

<p>God's Sweetness-Eye<br /> Inspires the soulful beginning<br /> Of my life's journey.<br /> God's Fulness-Heart<br /> Immortalises the fruitful perfection<br /> Of my self-transcendence-life.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">46.</h1>
  
 

<p>When I am in my desiring mind,<br /> I offer a very painful prayer<br /> To my Lord Supreme.<br /> When I am in my aspiring heart,<br /> My Beloved Supreme blesses me<br /> Not only with a soulful meditation<br /> But also with a fruitful satisfaction.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1105786" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">47.</h1>

<p>When I tell Him That He is my Father Supreme, He loves me sleeplessly.</p>
<p>When I tell Him That He is my only Friend, He loves me sleeplessly, Plus He even loves My imperfections.</p>
<p>When I tell Him That He is my All, He immediately tells me That He will immortalise My outer dedication-life On earth And my inner aspiration-life In Heaven.</p>  </div>
