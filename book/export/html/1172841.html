<p>I wish to add something to my ancient talk about God the Doer that a disciple has just read out.</p>
<p>When we say, “I am not the doer; God is the Doer,” this statement has to come to us from our own inner, higher experiences. When someone says that he is not the doer, but God Himself is the Doer, this is appropriate only if that individual is a most sincere seeker, if he is to some extent spiritually developed. An undivine person may kill someone and say, “I am not the doer; God is the Doer.” Naturally, jail will invite that person.</p>
<p>When we say we are not the doer, this pronouncement has to come from the depths of our devotion-heart. We shall do something significant, most significant in our lives for God. Then we shall have to use our humility and devotion and say, with utmost sincerity, “I did not do it; God did it in and through me.” Then God will be very proud of us and God will increase our inner capacities to fulfil Him and please Him in more significant ways.</p>
<p>Alas, quite often we are apt to do wrong things, undivine things, absurd things, and then say, “I have not done it; God has done it in and through me.” That is the height of our stupidity.</p>
<p>One disciple who has been with us for at least fifteen years wrote to me that, for the last two years, wrong forces have been disturbing his mind and heart. At times he surrendered to those hostile forces. Now that disciple is in serious confusion. The justification came to the fore in his mind: “Guru has written in his books that we are not the doers; God is the Doer.”</p>
<p>Then again, when that particular disciple is in the heart, he is tortured by his conscience. Now he wants to know from me which is correct: the mind’s justification that God is the Doer and the disciple is not the doer, or the heart’s conscience. The disciple gets a little comfort on the strength of my repeated assurance that God is the Doer. Then again, on rare occasions the disciple takes the responsibility on his own shoulders, and he feels that he himself is to be blamed.</p>
<p>If you do the wrong thing, you must not blame poor God. And when you do the right thing, you must not say, “I am the doer,” “I did it,” “It is all ‘I and me, I and me.’ ” If you stay on our path, this much conscience and this much inner divinity you have to develop.</p>
<p>Let us not fool ourselves. Let us say, “If I cannot do the right thing, at least let me not do the wrong thing.” Yes, it is very, very difficult to do the right thing. But again, there is a middle course. If you cannot do the right thing, do not do the bad thing. Remain at least inactive.</p>
<p>I always say if you are being attacked by wrong forces, just count how many wrong forces are torturing you today. Write down the number! Tomorrow again count them. And in the meantime pray to God, “Please take away from me all these wrong forces.” If you pray to the Supreme, who is our God, and if your sincerity is involved, you are bound to see that the number of wrong forces has decreased. Tomorrow again, pray to the Supreme with utmost sincerity. You are bound to see that the day after tomorrow, and every day after that, the wrong forces that have been attacking you will decrease considerably. But they will decrease considerably only if there is an inner cry, if there are sincere tears in your heart.</p>
<p>If we want to save ourselves, if we want to please God, there is a way. God does not expect from us overnight perfection — never, never! That He never expects. He expects only progress, a little progress. When we make a little progress, it gives God immense Satisfaction. Even tinier than the tiniest progress if we can make in our spiritual life, God becomes extremely, extremely, extremely proud of us. But if we enjoy our stupidity, if we continue doing the wrong thing, if we are indulgent to the wrong forces and try to convince ourselves that God is the Doer, this self-deception is quite deplorable.</p>
<p>Dear ones, try to do always the right thing. If you are doing or you have been doing a few undivine things, count them. You can easily count them. You are not doing hundreds of wrong things in a day. You may do three or four wrong things a day, or even five, let us say. Then pray to God with utmost, utmost sincerity to take away those wrong forces that are disturbing you. I assure you, God is all Compassion, all Affection, all Sweetness and Fondness for us. If we pray with tears in our heart to God, definitely, definitely, definitely tomorrow we will see that a few wrong forces have already left us, or they are not allowed to attack us any more.</p>
<p>In one single day we cannot become perfect. But in one single day we can get rid of many uncomely, undivine, unspiritual forces from our system, from our spiritual life. Many, many wrong forces we can cast aside.</p>
<p>Please be careful when you quote from my writings. When I say something, try to dive deep within and get the proper meaning of my writings. If you use your own clever mind and that clever mind gives you justification for wrong actions, that justification will be a painful experience.</p>
