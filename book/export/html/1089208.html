<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we go to a department store, you can buy things that you like and I can buy things that I like. But if there is only one thing, perhaps some people won't like that thing. Some people like one instrument while others like another instrument. Again, by playing many instruments, I feel I can offer more inspiration. If a tree has quite a few leaves and beautiful flowers, then it offers more inspiration than if it has only one flower. Since I am a servant of God, if I can be of more service to you by offering ten flowers instead of one flower, then I will be more satisfied. I feel that people who come also will be more satisfied because the fragrance and beauty of ten flowers will given them more joy than one flower. It is like Japan. Japan has so many islands. Each one adds so much more beauty and joy to the Japanese consciousness, and inspires more love for Japan.</p>  </div>
