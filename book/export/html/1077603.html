<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First you have to feel that there is something within you called the heart. You do not have to go to a spiritual Master in order to know that you have a physical heart of your own. Now, just as you have a physical heart, you have a spiritual heart which is located in the same place. Then feel that inside the heart there is something called the soul. You have not shut the door of the heart at this point; you are only trying to unlock another door and that is the door of the soul.</p>  </div>
