<p>"Can You believe it, my Lord? I have never told a lie in this incarnation! Not even one lie. As a matter of fact, in all my incarnations, I have never told a lie!"</p>
<p>"That means you have come into the world so many times and not told even one lie. Why?"</p>
<p>"This world is full of liars. I don't want to be one of them. I tell You a supreme secret: here on earth I don't tell lies, but in Heaven I do tell lies.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because the cosmic gods and goddesses have no humour in them. So, to create a little joy, I tell lies."</p>  </div>
