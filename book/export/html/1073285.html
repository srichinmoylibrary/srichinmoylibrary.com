<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two methods to divinise and transform the body. One is through constant aspiration, the physical aspiring along with the soul. The other is through evolution. After going back to the soulâ€™s region and returning to earth many times, the soul will gradually reach a stage at which it will be able to act here on earth the way the Supreme wants. At that time, it will be in a position to transform the body from within.</p>  </div>
