<p>In the small bus that takes everyone to the airplane, a seven or eight-year-old boy in the group was smoking.</p>
<p>There was a Punjabi on the bus, a Sikh. He had a beard and a turban, and he looked like a saint. He said to the boy, "Did you get your father's permission to smoke?"</p>
<p>The little boy said, "Does my father take my permission to smoke?"</p>
<p>So the elderly man kept quiet. The boy was so smart.</p>
