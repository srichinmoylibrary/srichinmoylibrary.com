    <title>Question: You have said that for physical fitness, it is not necessary for your students to lift more than 30 pounds, except for the few who practise weightlifting seriously. But if we practised weightlifting in the past, can we now start weightlifting again with the goal to lift much higher weights?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you practised weightlifting in the past and now if you are sincerely interested, then you can try. But since you have changed your lifestyle and have become a great, super-excellent long-distance runner, for you to go back to weightlifting and neglect your running would be a deplorable mistake. You have run through all the fifty states â€” a supreme miracle itself. Your running career should and must flourish more before you think of devoting yourself to anything else.</p>  </div>
