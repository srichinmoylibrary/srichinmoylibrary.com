<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sri Aurobindo was flooded with dynamic spirituality. Before Sri Aurobindo there were Vivekananda and Shankaracharya. But long before that was Sri Krishna; he was flooded with infinite dynamic spirituality. At first, Arjuna was unwilling to fight against his dear ones, but Sri Krishna illumined him and encouraged him to fight. The whole Bhagavad Gita is about dynamism. Inside dynamism there is both the yoga of work and the yoga of meditation.</p>
<p>Some spiritual Masters of a very high order did not believe in dynamic spirituality. They did not care for the acceptance of the world. They only wanted to withdraw from the world and meditate. But the acceptance of life and very dynamic spiritual action started with Lord Krishna thousands of years ago.</p>  </div>
