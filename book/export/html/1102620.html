<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Divine practicality means that before you start an action, you feel that the action does not belong to you. Then, while acting, you feel that you are not the doer; it is Someone else who is acting in and through you. And, when the result of the action comes, you do not feel it belongs to you; so you share it with others. You feel that it was not you who accomplished something but the Person who inspired you and was acting in and through you. If you can feel the divine inspiration behind each action and share the result with others, then you can have divine practicality in your life at every moment.</p>
