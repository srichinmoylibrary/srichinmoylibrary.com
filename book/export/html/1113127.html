<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My eyes I keep half-closed because I feel that this is the most effective way to have full control over both the physical world and the spiritual world. If I keep my eyes wide open, at that time my eyes are very strained and I see only what is happening in this world. But if I keep my eyes half-open, then I am communing with my inner beings and, at the same time, I am seeing the outer beings, human beings, who are in front of me. So I am killing two birds with one stone. I am getting the wealth from the inner world and distributing it to the outer world. When I do this, on the one hand I am receiving and on the other hand I am offering.</p>  </div>
