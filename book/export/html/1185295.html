<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know that ignorance is playing in and through violence and aggression. The basic problem is our ignorance. What can put an end to it? It is our conscious aspiration. When we go up with our aspiration, we become one with a higher goal. When we become conscious of our unity, we feel that in the field of manifestation what appears to be diversity is really unity. But suppose we have lost our feeling of oneness and we fight with someone. We are not fighting with ourself, we are fighting with someone else. This is because we have lost our feeling of oneness. The moment we feel that our opponent and we are one, only in two bodies, or when we feel that our opponent is a part and parcel of our life, then we stop fighting. It is aspiration that will make you feel that you and the rest of the world are one.</p>  </div>
