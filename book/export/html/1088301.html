<p>Shyama Charan used to work in an office. It happened that for a few days his boss, who was an Englishman, was very sad and disturbed. One day he asked his boss the reason for his sadness. The boss said that his wife was extremely ill in a hospital in England, and that he had not heard any recent news from her or from the family.</p>
<p>Shyama Charan said to him, "Let me enter into the adjacent room and meditate for some time. Then I will bring you some news." The boss smiled at the young clerk and inwardly appreciated his good will, but he did not have real faith in him. He felt that to do this kind of thing, one had to be a great spiritual Master with tremendous occult power.</p>
<p>In fifteen minutes, Shyama Charan came out of the room and said to his boss, "In two or three days' time you will receive a letter from your wife. She is doing well. I assure you, you don't have to worry about her at all." He even told his boss what was inside the letter.</p>
<p>In three days, a letter did arrive from his wife, and the contents of the letter were exactly what Shyama Charan had said. But the story does not end here. In a few months, the boss's wife came to India. One day she visited her husband's office. When she saw Shyama Charan, her eyes opened wide in surprise. She said to her husband, "How can this man be here? I saw him near my death bed in the hospital. He looked at me and smiled, and then I recovered." Her husband and all those who were working in the office were taken aback. But Shyama Charan continued his job as a clerk in that office for many, many years, for he had to support his family. Only after many years, when he had collected a few disciples, was he able to retire.</p>
<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>A spiritual Master is he who has solved space problems, time problems and all other human problems. In his oneness-heart with God's Cosmic Will, the length and breadth of the world abides. He does not go anywhere; he is just there when necessity demands. Medical power is quite often uncertain. But spiritual power is uncertain only when it is not aware of the omniscient capacity of the Source. When spirituality is fully aware of the capacity of the Source, and its surrender gradually gains the capacity of the Source, lo and behold, it is blessed by the Source and grows into the all-powerful Source itself.</p>  </div>
