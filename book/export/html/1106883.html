<p>Dear Sri Chinmoy,</p>
<p>I want to thank you for the luncheon last Sunday, and for the gifts you were kind enough to give us. My husband adds that the apple was truly delicious!</p>
<p>We are happy that our son Daniel is content and has found spiritual fulfilment with your group. It is now our hope that he will go on to fulfil himself in another way, by finding a career or occupation which will make the most of his talents and abilities. If you can be of any help to him in finding the right path to take, we would be very grateful.</p>
<p>Very sincerely yours,</p>
<p>( Mrs. Irving Stern) Laura Stern</p>  </div>
