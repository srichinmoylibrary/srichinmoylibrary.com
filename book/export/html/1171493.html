<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If they are good feelings, it is always best to express them inwardly. Otherwise, there is no end to outer expression. All kinds of sweet feelings, good feelings, it is always better to express inwardly, with utmost devotion, to the Supreme. When you try to express them outwardly, when you take the help of language and try to write them down, immediately the mind tries to come forward. The mind tries to decorate the experience with some words. The heart is simpler than the simplest, but the mind will try to use bombastic words, thinking that it will be able to convince the Supreme of your love, devotion and surrender. When you start writing, instead of giving a flower, the mind will try to bring the garden itself. Do I need the garden or do I need the most beautiful rose?</p>  </div>
