<p>Yesterday's parade route was seven miles long. From one end to the other, the marchers and floats spread out over 700 metres, practically half a mile. I would run one mile and wait for the parade to go by. Then again I would run one mile and watch the parade.</p>
<p>I told one of my attendants, Tejiyan, to be careful. Next year I will run at a seven-minute pace. He said he has started practising running so he will be able to keep up with me while accompanying me.</p>
