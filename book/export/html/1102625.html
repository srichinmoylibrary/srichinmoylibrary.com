<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can inspire yourself to be more selfless by watching people who are not selfless and by watching people who are selfless. People who are not selfless, who are greedy and miserly, can never be happy, whereas people who are selfless and sacrificing are happy. Since you want to be happy, you will be inspired to try to become more selfless. It is you who have to make the choice, either to enter the domain of selfishness or the domain of selflessness.</p>
