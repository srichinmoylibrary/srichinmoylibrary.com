<p>I always ate out, but my brothers would never eat out. Chitta would cook something for Mantu, and they would eat at home. Our two cousins are so close to us, but Chitta will not take food prepared by them, and Mantu eats whatever Chitta cooks. Lily is seventy-two or seventy-three and Chitta is nearing his eighties. God knows what he cooks-potatoes and other things! Many, many years ago Chitta used to cook when he was working at our bank. Whatever food the Ashram gives, they eat, plus Chitta's food, and they buy fruits, such as bananas and papayas.</p>
<p>My cousins brought prepared food for me. But I did not take it. I said, "It is very sentimental. My sister is not here. That is why I do not feel like eating at home. I am so happy to go out to eat." They were very sad. I said "When my sister is not here, it is too much for me."</p>
<p>I went to a restaurant once or twice a day to eat masala dosa, rose milk, sambhar and tea.</p>  </div>
