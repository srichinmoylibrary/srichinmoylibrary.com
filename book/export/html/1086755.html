<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For breakfast, God eats your cry, your heart's cry. For His luncheon, He eats your smile, your soul's smile. And for His supper, He eats your surrender, the surrender of your entire life, your entire being.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>I am telling you a great secret: you are a fantastic Dream of God</em>, Agni Press, 1974<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/gsdg-45</p></small>    </div>  </body>
