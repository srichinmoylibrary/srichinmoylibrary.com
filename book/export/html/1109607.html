<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God’s most important philosophy is to see, feel and become. First see where the Truth is. Then feel the Truth and become the Truth. When you become the Truth, you will be able to see and feel the Truth everywhere, wherever you are. God’s most important philosophy is to consciously become aware of what you eternally are.</p>  </div>
