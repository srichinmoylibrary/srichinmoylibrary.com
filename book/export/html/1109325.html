<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To have perfect courage, try to remain always inside your soul. Now you will say that you do not know where your soul is. Then cry like a child; cry only for light, for light. Inside light there is always life. Light and life go together. The more light you can invoke and absorb, the more life-power enters into you. And when you have life, abundant life, you always have courage. If life is missing, if your life-power is less than somebody else's, you lack courage. But if your life-power is greater than somebody else's, you are not afraid of that person. If your life-power is strong, you will have perfect courage in dealing with situations, in dealing with things, in dealing with people.</p>  </div>
