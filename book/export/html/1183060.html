<p>On her wedding day she discovered that her husband was anything but divine. She wanted to punish her husband. She felt that the best punishment would be for her to go and stay with a Chinese gentleman who had three children. The Master did not approve of such severe punishment. So she said to the Master, “Since you don’t approve of this punishment, you don’t deserve me. I know that you will not be able to change my husband’s nature.”</p>
<p>The Master said to her, “Give me at least a chance.”</p>
<p>She said, “I know your capacity.”</p>
<p>Luckily, the Master was not responsible for this marriage.</p>  </div>
