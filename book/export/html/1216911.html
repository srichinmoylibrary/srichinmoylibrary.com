<p>This morning I went into a restaurant in Kyoto. After I went out and had gone two blocks, I realised that I had left my gloves there. But I said, "I am not going to go back."</p>
<p>Then I saw Kodanda running. I wanted to give him the job of going to the restaurant to get my gloves, although I was a little bit afraid that he would go to the wrong restaurant and fight with the people there. But to my great surprise and joy, he went running to the right restaurant and brought back my gloves. He received my most powerful and blessingful smile.</p>
