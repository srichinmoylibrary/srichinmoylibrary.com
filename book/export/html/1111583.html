<p>This morning when I was running, after about four miles I saw Nishtha and Savita. They were standing with folded hands. After I had completed five miles, I saw Lavanya and Nilima coming up the hill from Union Turnpike. But today I was not planning to run with anybody because I wanted to run ten miles.</p>
