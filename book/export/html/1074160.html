    <title>&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; What is the nature of your training? Every day I do not lift people, but weight training I do every day. I use free weights up to 120 pounds and then I use about twenty different types of machines to strengthen my muscles and different parts of my body. I do this for at least three hours early in the morning. Around eight o&#039;clock I come here to Aspiration-Ground and take some more exercise.</title>
