<p>A husband and wife were running together for several miles. Then the wife got permission from the husband to go ahead. I ran with her for a mile and a half. Then I surrendered, and she went ahead of me.</p>
<p>When I went back to watch some of the disciples finish the marathon, I didn't see any of my running friends that I had met during my thirteen-mile training run.</p>
