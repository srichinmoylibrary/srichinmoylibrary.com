<p>This morning I ran three miles. Pulak drove me to the course. The scenery was very good and the place was very beautiful. I like that course so much, but today there were so many people playing this game and that game.</p>
<p>Pulak took millions of pictures. He would go ahead of me and take pictures. Sometimes he would be down on the ground as I ran past. But then nothing came out and I felt very sorry for him.</p>
