<h2>Question: Why is it so hard for us to become one with you, Guru?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why is it so hard? Do you try hard? Everything is hard. But the thing is you have to work hard. It is like turning on a stove. You have to turn the handle to a certain point and then only you get the fire. In your case, one day you try and the next day you give up. Then you start again at the beginning. But you have to continue, and then it will come to a certain point where you will establish oneness. Why is it so hard? Just because you don't try. We have to try daily, devotedly; then it won't be hard at all to establish our oneness.</p>  </div>
