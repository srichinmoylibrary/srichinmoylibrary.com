<p>You do not have to use your eyes;<br /> You can use God's Eyes.<br /> He will be only too happy<br /> To grant you His Eyes.</p>
<p>You do not have to use your ears;<br /> You can use God's Ears.<br /> He will be only too happy<br /> To grant you His Ears.</p>
<p>You do not have to use even your own heart.<br /> You can use God's Heart.<br /> God will be only too happy<br /> To grant you His Heart Universal.<br /> He will without fail,<br /> He will.</p>
