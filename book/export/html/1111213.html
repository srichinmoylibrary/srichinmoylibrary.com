<p>When I run up the hill on 150th Street, always I come and stop at a particular tree. I breathe in four times and then again I resume my running.</p>
<p>The other day, one of the disciples told me that she was parking her car near there when a lady said to her, "I saw your leader this morning. I see him every day. He goes running up the hill and he stops right by that tree. He looks so thirsty, I want to give him a glass of water, but I know I can't. Your leader is so terrific. You're so lucky to have such a good leader. He's such a wonderful man."</p>
<p>I think she is one of the ladies who had the fight with another lady and her dog a few months ago by the bus stop.</p>
