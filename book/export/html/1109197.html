  <h1 class="book-heading">Military non-violence</h1>
  
 
<p>The real power does not conquer. The real power illumines. The real power liberates. The real power fulfils. The U.N. Pilot's glowing revelation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The technique which has come to be called peace-keeping uses soldiers as the servants of peace rather than as the instruments of war. It introduces to the military sphere the principle of non-violence. It provides an honourable alternative to conflict and a means of reducing strife and tension, so that a solution can be sought through negotiation. Never before in history have military forces been employed internationally not to wage war, not to establish domination and not to serve the interests of any Power or group of Powers, but rather to prevent conflict between peoples."</p>
