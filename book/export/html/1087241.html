<p>I was buying T-shirts in a store. The owner said, "It is 2,500 for one." After I bargained with the lady, she agreed to sell me six shirts for 12,000.</p>
<p>While I was paying, a man came up to me and said, "Are you free?"</p>
<p>I asked, "Why?"</p>
<p>He said, "I want to ask you what price you are paying."</p>
<p>As soon as he asked me the price, the lady immediately said, "2,500." I was not trying to hide the amount that I was paying, but he did not see how much it was.</p>
<p>He was an American, so he did not bargain. I did not have the heart to tell him what I was paying. I didn't want to get into a fight with the shopkeeper.</p>
<p>You have to be an Indian to bargain!</p>
