<p><em>(Early morning. Brahma’s abode. Brahma’s blessingful meditation on the world is just over.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter four saints.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST SAINT: O Lord Brahma, save us, save the world. Sunda and Upasunda are destroying the whole world.</p>
<p>SECOND SAINT: O Lord Brahma, the two <em>Asura</em> brothers have conquered all the peoples of the world. These two <em>Asuras</em> have looted all their wealth.</p>
<p>THIRD SAINT: They are now fully prepared to cross swords with the cosmic gods.</p>
<p>FOURTH SAINT: And soon they will be ready for a ruthless attack on Indra, the King of the cosmic gods.</p>
<p>THE SAINTS <em>(together)</em>: O Lord Brahma, save us, save the world from these two <em>Asuras</em>, or very soon the human race will suffer an eternal end.</p>
<p>BRAHMA <em>(smiling)</em>: My sweet children, I am fully aware of the grim situation. I am fully conscious of the unspeakable misdeeds of the two <em>Asura</em> brothers. Do not burn with impatience. I assure you that their days are numbered.</p>
<p><em>(Brahma starts meditating. In five minutes he creates through his third eye the most beautiful girl of eighteen the universe has ever seen.)</em></p>
<p>GIRL: My Lord, my Creator, my All! My life of unconditional and eternal service I place at your feet. I am sure you have a special plan for my life. My duty, my beauty, my reality and my divinity — all I place at your feet. You are my life’s soul and you are my soul’s goal.</p>
<p><em>(Brahma blesses her. While being blessed she offers her soulful prayer to her creator, the Creator of the universe.)</em></p>
<p>GIRL:</p>

<p>My life began with duty’s pride.<br /> My life shall live with beauty’s light.<br /> My life shall sport with reality’s soul.<br /> My life shall end with Divinity’s Height.</p>

<p>BRAHMA: Tilottama, O beauty unparalleled, O beauty’s perfection, descend into the world and do me a service.</p>
<p>TILOTTAMA: A service! This life of mine is at your express command.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Go and create a terrible dispute between the two <em>Asura</em> brothers, Sunda and Upasunda. Go and tempt them with your beauty’s mightiest power and make them kill each other while fighting for the possession of your matchless beauty.</p>
<p>TILOTTAMA: My Lord, my beauty is yours. My capacity is yours. My victory is yours. I am all yours.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Tilotama)</em></p>
<p>THE FOUR SAINTS <em>(together bowing down to Brahma)</em>: We are sure that Tilottama’s beauty will kill the two <em>Asura</em> brothers. O Lord Brahma, you have saved us, you have saved the world and you have saved the human race. To you we offer the breath of our eternal gratitude.</p>
<p><em>(Brahma smiles. Exeunt the four saints.)</em></p>  </div>
