<p>"I am proud to tell you that you are an advanced disciple of mine."</p>
<p>"Master, I am so glad to hear that. That is what I longed for."</p>
<p>"I am proud to tell you that you are an advanced disciple of mine."</p>
<p>"At long last my aspiration is bearing fruit. Master, I am really happy to hear it."</p>
<p>"I am proud to tell you that you are an advanced disciple of mine."</p>
<p>"My sacrifice and your concern have made all this possible, Master. I am extremely happy."</p>
<p>"I am proud to tell you that you are an advanced disciple of mine."</p>
<p>"Master, I offer my heart's tearful gratitude for your kindest blessingful honour. Master, I offer you my long-sought realisation. Your name is infinite and eternal Compassion, and my name is Immortality's aspiring life and ascending breath."</p>  </div>
