<p>In August 1996 a lady happened to see a poster about me in Manhattan. She came to the function and asked one of the disciples, “Is that the same Chinmoy who used to work at the Indian Consulate?” Then she said that she had been a secretary at the Consulate at the same time. At first I could not recognise her, but as soon as she said her name I remembered her. I always used to see her carrying tea and coffee for her bosses. Her name is Marjorie Johnson and she is from Jamaica, West Indies. She was the secretary of Nirmaljit Singh in the Information Section. She told my disciple, “Chinmoy was always inwardly what he is today.”</p>
<p><em>Marjorie Johnson: Chinmoy was always so peaceful. You felt such peace emanating from him and he often used to sing while he worked. To me, he personified goodness. I saw that he was beyond the ordinary and I knew then that he was going to make an impact on people’s lives. Gurus are born, not made. He is a real Guru in India’s highest tradition.</em></p>  </div>
