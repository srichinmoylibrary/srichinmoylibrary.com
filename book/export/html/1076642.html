<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, he will. But right now man cannot control his fate, because man is not aspiring. He is now in the world of desire. He is trying to possess and be possessed. But, if that particular man wants to live in the world of aspiration, when he wants only to live here on earth for God, for light and for truth, if that particular person wants Infinity in his life or for the world — Infinity, Eternity and Immortality — and nothing mortal, nothing transitory, then that particular man also can achieve all these things in his life.</p>  </div>
