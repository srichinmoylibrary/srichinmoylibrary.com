<p>It took two hours for me to buy twenty dolls for X's and Y's groups. I lost in bargaining to a lady in one store, so I had to go back to the first store and pay the higher price. But all together there were only twenty dolls, and I needed twenty-two. What could I do? I said, "For the leaders, let me buy something else."</p>
<p>So X and Y got stuffed animals instead of dolls.</p>
