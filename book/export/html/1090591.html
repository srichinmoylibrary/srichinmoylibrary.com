<p><em>[Gorakshanath and Matsyendranath are in Gorakshanath's room.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: O Master, I went along with you, but please tell me, why have you done this? Have we done the right thing? Oh, I know whatever you do is right, but please explain to me what we did. I want to know more from you.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: My son, do you feel sorry for it?</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: I do feel sorry...</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Why? Why do you feel sorry? You should be wise. This King was ruining the whole Kingdom with his stupid laws. How can everything be of the same value? How can everybody have the same status? Is it possible? God has given some men more capacity than others. God has made some things more valuable than others. On this hand two fingers cannot be the same. They are all different. If one person prays and meditates, and another does not, naturally the former will realise God sooner than the latter. You have prayed, you have meditated and you have realised God. Equality does not come without equal merit. King Harabhanga thought that just by making the price of everything the same, all people would become equal. But that is impossible. Everything has its own value. You cannot put a lion and a sheep together, feed them the same food and expect them to become the same. The sheep will remain a sheep, and the lion will remain a lion. Spiritual people will be spiritual, and ordinary people will be ordinary. God's Kingdom is vast and everybody has his own place. One cannot mix with those who are of a different standard and expect them to become equal. Now once again this Kingdom will have a sane life. A new King will take Harabhanga's place — perhaps his own son — and you will see that, like other Kingdoms, this Kingdom will have prosperity. It will have judgement, peace and divine glory, for everything will have its proper value according to its capacity and according to its merit. My son, you and I have done a great service for the Supreme.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, I have understood your philosophy. I am always at your feet and at your command. To please you, to be unconditionally yours, is the sole object of my life. My supreme adoration is Your Feet. Your very sight is my delight. Your very touch is my new mind, and Your Light of infinite Wealth is my true home.</p>
<p><em>[Gorakshanath sings.]</em></p>
