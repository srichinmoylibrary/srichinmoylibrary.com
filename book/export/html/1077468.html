  <h1 class="book-heading">Creation and evolution</h1>
  
 
<p>The Self-Division of the Supreme proclaims the birth of creation.</p>
<p>Creation is the descent of Consciousness. Creation is a never-tiring march which marks the beginning of an inner and outer development.</p>
<p>What is evolution, if not the veiled determination of an apparent unconsciousness seeking conscious formation and growth.</p>
<p>Nature is the evolving phenomenon, while Consciousness is its guide in evolution. At each stage, nature transcends the limits of its own species and presses forward to new conquests.</p>
<p>The real development and Progress of life must always sit at the feet of the Dynamic Divine and not at the feet of the Static Divine.</p>
<p>In the march of evolution, each period has a demand of its own. Each incarnation of God fulfils that very demand.</p>  </div>
