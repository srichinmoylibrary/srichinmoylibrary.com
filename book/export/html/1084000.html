<p>In the past<br /> When God came to you<br /> You were deeply sceptical.</p>
<p>This morning<br /> God came to you again.<br /> You doubted Him openly.</p>
<p>God will come to you<br /> Again and again<br /> Even if you go<br /> To the length of hating Him ruthlessly.           Why? Why?<br /> Because <br /> Poor God cannot dare<br /> To live without you.<br /> You are His Soul.<br /> You are His Goal.<br /> You are His All.</p>
