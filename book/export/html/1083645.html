<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God sings cheerfully and mournfully. He sings cheerfully when He sees that we are going to learn His songs and then sing them to inspire humanity and then create new aspiration in humanity. He sings mournfully when humanity has given up all hope and has made friends with dire despair, when humanity learns the song of self-destruction and when humanity does not learn the song of self-perfection from Him.</p>  </div>
