<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The first gift of a high meditation will not be heat in your head. Nothing will affect you. If you have a very good, high meditation, then restlessness is bound to disappear and peace will come. Although this is dynamic peace, it will never make you feel restless or prevent you from sleeping. In fact, in India we advise people to meditate before they go to bed. Meditation itself will help you enter into a very peaceful world.</p>
<p>What you are doing while you are meditating is pulling down spiritual force beyond your capacity. You are straining, which is very bad. You are trying to exert dynamic effort, but it is becoming aggressive movement instead.</p>  </div>
