<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you know that what you are doing is the right thing, you will do it, in spite of the fact that you have failed ten times. If you are doing the right thing, then you can do it even two hundred times without achieving success. When I was trying to lift 300 pounds, I knew I was doing the right thing. After two hundred failures, did I give up? No, I continued, and eventually I succeeded on my 214th attempt. If I know that I am doing something that is definitely right, even if I am not succeeding, if it is Godâ€™s Will that I do something, I will do it.</p>  </div>
