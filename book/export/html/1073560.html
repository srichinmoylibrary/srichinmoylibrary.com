  <h1 class="book-heading">Jhardine’s conversation with God</h1>
  
 
<p>“God, I do not like our Guru.”</p>
<p>“Why do you not like him, Jhardine?”</p>
<p>“I don’t like him because he does not like me.”</p>
<p>“Whom does he like?”</p>
<p>“He likes my younger sister, Tara.”</p>
<p>“How old is your sister?”</p>
<p>“She is two years old.”</p>
<p>“How old are you?”</p>
<p>“I am five years old. Anyway, I do not like our Guru. You know why? I hate him because he likes Jennifer very much.”</p>
<p>“How old is Jennifer?”</p>
<p>“I think she is four months old.”</p>
<p>“Jhardine, you are jealous of the two girls who are much younger than you. Your parents, who are much older than you, are not jealous of you. When your Guru smiles and smiles at you, you don’t even look at him. You don’t look at your Guru’s picture with love and joy, whereas Jennifer and Tara get much joy when they look at their Guru’s picture. If you want to get joy and love from your Guru, then look at his picture with all love and joy.”</p>
<p>“God, I shall do that.”</p>
<p>“Then you are going to feel that your Guru likes you and loves you.”</p>  </div>
