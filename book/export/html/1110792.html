<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The purpose of life is to manifest the inner divinity. The purpose of life is to become a conscious instrument, a chosen instrument of God. The purpose of life is to manifest the highest Truth which we embody. First we have to see the Truth and feel the Truth. Then we have to reveal and manifest the Truth.</p>  </div>
