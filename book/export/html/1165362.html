<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Awareness is not of the mind. You want to be aware of the soul with your mind. You want to see the soul with your physical organs. But the physical organs are very, very deceptive, I must say. We are totally blind to the Truth sometimes. Truth comes to us in its natural way, but we try to see Truth from a different angle. So we do not really see it. But instead of trying to see the Truth, let us try to <em>feel</em> the Truth and become the Truth. When we become the Truth, at that time we do not have to see. I have a body, but I do not have to <em>see</em> whether I have arms or not. Similarly, when we become the Truth, at that time we do not have to see whether Truth has this or that. Just by being one with the Truth, we know what it is and what is has.</p>  </div>
