<p>Today I lifted 145 pounds with both arms simultaneously. I could have gone higher if I had given another push, but I was satisfied. Then I just dropped the dumbbells. I am killing myself to lift up these weights, but when I go to a certain height, it is enough for me to pass my examination. Otherwise, an inch or two more I could go.</p>
<p>Today I also lifted 145 pounds with one arm 100 times. My timing was two minutes 6.36 seconds. I tried breathing out through the mouth to see if I can take a shorter time to recover.</p>
