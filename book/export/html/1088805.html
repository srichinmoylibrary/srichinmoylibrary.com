<h2>Question: Can inspiration be controlled?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Inspiration is like a flight of birds. When birds fly overhead, why should they land where you are? Why should they come to you? Since I am a spiritual Master, I can say, "Stop here," and they will stop. You don't have this kind of capacity to command inspiration. But when inspiration comes to you, you get satisfaction because it has listened to you and it is serving its purpose. If I call to a child who is running, she won't necessarily come to me. But if her mother or father calls the child, then she will come to them immediately. Here is the difference.</p>  </div>
