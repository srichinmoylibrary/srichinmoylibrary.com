<p>Venkat was also waiting at the door, holding a copy of <em>Bharati.</em> He offered the magazine to Nolini-da and said: "Here is my translation of your <em>Smriti Pata.</em>" (Venkat had translated a portion of Nolini's autobiograpphy into his mother tongue, Hindi.)</p>
<p>"Ah, I have already seen a copy of it. I liked it very much."</p>
<p>Venkat then said to Nolini-da: "Please tell me if you have ever written anything on Lord Krishna."</p>
<p>Nolini-da gave him a smile and said: "Well, I am the wrong person to ask. Go and ask Chinmoy."</p>
<p>I said to Venkat: "Although Nolini-da has not written an article specifically on Sri Krishna, he has written quite a few things on Sri Krishna at various places. I shall collect them and give them to you."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said to Venkat: "So you see, your problem is immediately solved."</p>  </div>
