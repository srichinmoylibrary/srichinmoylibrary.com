<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some look cute, but sometimes they look clumsy. Right now with my third eye I am seeing some fairies which are not beautiful. Just because they are like cute children, we like them. No matter what children wear, say or do, we like them. Sometimes, the way the fairies dress, they are very untidy and unclean. Of course, we feel this only when we are using our purity-heart to see them and judge them.</p>
<p>If we see an angel, our whole being will be swimming in a sea of delight. But if we see a fairy, we may get an altogether different experience. At times the fairies are quite restless and, like human beings, they have a tendency to quarrel and fight and adopt undivine means. This can create a headache in the innocent human observer. Again, many fairies are good, like good human beings. These fairies undoubtedly give enormous delight to the human observer.</p>  </div>
