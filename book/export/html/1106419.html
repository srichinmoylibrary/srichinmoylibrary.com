<p>A few days ago I hurt my left knee while I was out walking. I was going along 150th Street and I passed by the bus stop. One lady had missed the bus and she was screaming. I felt such sympathy for her. I turned to look at her and I twisted my left knee. Who knows when and why these things happen!</p>
<p>About fifteen years ago, all of a sudden, my calf muscles atrophied. They disappeared. I do not know how I was able to support my bodyweight. They were not painful, but they were very, very weak. I still do not know how it happened.</p>
