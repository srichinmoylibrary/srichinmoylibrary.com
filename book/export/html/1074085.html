<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we have harmony in the family then we get full satisfaction from our lives. Each and every family should join together and create world harmony. Lack of world harmony has made the world sorrowful. The word 'harmony' itself creates a kind of sweet feeling in us. This sweet feeling can and will create world harmony.</p>
<p>If there is harmony, there can be no misunderstanding, and if there is no misunderstanding, today's world will have a new outlook on life. I have given the name "World Harmony" to my concerts precisely because I feel that each and every human being wants to have a peaceful and blissful life, and for this world harmony is the answer.</p>  </div>
