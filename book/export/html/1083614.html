<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As there is no limit to man's ignorance, even so there is no limit to God's Forgiveness. Man's infinite ignorance can come to an end the day man becomes sincerity's intensity and intensity's sincerity. Sincerity's intensity and intensity's sincerity can be found only in cheerful and constant self-offering to the Will of the Inner Pilot.</p>  </div>
