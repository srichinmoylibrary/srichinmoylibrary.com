SCA 945-946. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in Huntington, New York on 20 July 1999.</p>
<h2>Question: Where does a person go when he dies?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on how the individual spent his life on earth. Each soul has a place of its own in the soul's world. According to the growth of the soul, the soul will go to a particular place in the soul's world. There is no hard and fast rule that all human beings, when they pass beyond the curtain of Eternity, will go and stay together. The Supreme alone decides where each soul will go after it leaves the body.</p>  </div>
