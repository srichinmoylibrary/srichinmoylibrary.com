<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, by practising one's own religion one can definitely realise God. But one has to feel that there is something higher and deeper than religion and that is our constant inner cry. Religion as such will tell us there is a God. It will tell us that we have to be good, we have to be kind, we have to be simple, sincere and pure. This much religion will offer us. But there is also something called spirituality, which is higher and deeper. It will say that it is not enough just to know that God exists. We also have to see Him, we have to feel Him, we have to grow into Him. And this we do through prayer and meditation.</p>
