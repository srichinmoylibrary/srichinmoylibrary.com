<p>"Father, how is it that I am acting like a beggar? Why do I need my children's love? Is Your Divine Love Infinite not enough for me?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, My son, My Divine Love Infinite is more than enough for you. Unfortunately, you and I are suffering from the same disease, eternally old disease. We want to be loved by our nearest and dearest ones. We want to be loved by our creations."</p>
<p>"Father, please tell me in a few words what love actually means."</p>
<p>"Son, love means complete and perfect oneness and fulfilled reality."</p>
