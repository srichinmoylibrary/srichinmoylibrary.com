<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the outer world, unfortunately, I have not seen any particularly significant change. But in the inner world, at every moment I see significant changes in the United Nations, and these significant changes are a brighter hope, a more illumining promise and a more fulfilling inner confidence.</p>
