<p>After running five miles in the half-marathon, I was finished; I had absolutely no strength. Then, at nine miles, I got such a painful cramp. By eleven miles my cramps were so painful that I had to walk. I couldn't run 800 metres at a time without walking. I stood on the sidewalk, trying to stretch my legs, but the cramps were so powerful that I couldn't do it. No matter what stretching exercises you take for cramps, they are so painful. What can you do? I had such pain that I could barely stand up. At that time I saw Nemi going ahead of me. I said, "Go!" I had to surrender to her speed.</p>
