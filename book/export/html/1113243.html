<p>At three-thirty that afternoon I was typing in the flower-room when Nolini-da came in and said: "Tomorrow I shall need a new file for I have started translating Sri Aurobindo's thoughts and aphorisms."</p>
<p>I said to him: "You already have one."</p>
<p>"Where? When?"</p>
<p>"I shall get it for you right now."</p>
<p>"No, it is not necessary now, but give it to me tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>At the time I was typing an article by Nolini-da for the <em>World Union</em> magazine. The title was "A Global Unity." He commented: "Unity we need, but division we want."</p>  </div>
