<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How can you identify yourself with the perfection of the Divine Mother? All the time, try to feel the Divine Mother within you, and try to please the Divine Mother within you. Try to fulfil the Divine Mother within you in your multifarious day-to-day activities, constantly, devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally. Then it is not only possible but inevitable for you to achieve the perfection of the Mother Divine.</p>  </div>
