<p>The course was excellent, and the weather was really ideal. Only in two or three places they hadn't swept the course and there were big stones and pebbles. And there was one extremely steep hill, three or four metres long. It was so difficult after the third loop to go down it.</p>
<p>On the third loop Garima was running ahead of me to inspire me. When she ran down that very steep, short hill, I said, "How am I going to make it?" I didn't dare to even walk down it, it was so steep. But that was the course. In at least four places it could have been a little more flat.</p>
