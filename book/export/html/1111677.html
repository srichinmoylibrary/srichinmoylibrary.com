<p>Today when I was riding in the car, I saw someone running. I said, "Look at this girl. Definitely it is one of our people."</p>
<p>O God, when the runner turned around, I saw that it was Kanan. Luckily he didn't hear what I had said. I did not want to disturb him because he was going for a long run. Therefore I deliberately did not call him to come join us in the car.</p>
