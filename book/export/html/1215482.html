<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am referred to as a spiritual Master, but I will always call myself a seeker, an eternal seeker learning at the Feet of my Beloved Supreme. Life is the greatest opportunity to make progress, and at every moment we can avail ourselves of this opportunity. Each of us is a seeker, walking along Eternityâ€™s Road, which has no beginning and no end.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> You are saying that we are all disciples?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are all seekers. Some of us are consciously seeking; some are unconsciously seeking. But if we do something consciously, then we derive more benefit.</p>  </div>
