<p>Bill Pearl’s prana is so powerful. Let him just go to hospitals and stand near sick people. Then, instead of getting oxygen, the sick people should just touch a corner of his garment. So much life-energy they will get from him! In this way, they will immediately get better. Like that, from room to room he could go curing hundreds of people. All strong bodybuilders should go to hospitals and do this work.</p>
