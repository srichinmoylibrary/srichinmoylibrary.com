<p>He who trusts his mind is a fool.<br /> Indeed, he has to pay the penalty for his stupidity.<br /> He who trusts his heart<br /> Is not only a wise man<br /> But <em>the</em> wise man,<br /> For his heart always,<br /> Like a magnet,<br /> Pulls Wisdom-Light<br /> From the Delight-Source of the soul.</p>
