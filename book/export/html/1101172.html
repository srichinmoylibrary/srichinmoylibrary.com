<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every year we go out to different countries and try to be of service to mankind. We feel that life is a tree. We want to climb up as many branches as possible, because each branch has its own beauty, its own purity, its own unique qualities and special message. We feel that each individual on earth is a special dream of God, and that it is the bounden duty of each and every individual to transform the particular dream that he embodies into a reality. How do we do it? Only by claiming the entire world as our own, very own. The world does not need another Julius Caesar or Napoleon to declare his superiority. This world needs someone who will say, "I came, I loved and I have become."</p>  </div>
