<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It means that they have conquered the animal forces, the destructive forces. The tiger symbolises destruction, and they have conquered the destructive forces. They are telling their devotees to become good and to aspire. They are telling their disciples that their animal qualities either are being destroyed or will be destroyed. That is why the gods and goddesses ride a tiger. Sometimes they ride a lion also. The lion means divine manifestation.</p>  </div>
