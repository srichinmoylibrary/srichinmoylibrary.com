<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the individual. Each spiritual Master has a special world of his own, a well-protected world. Naturally, his close disciples will be together there. They do go and enter into their relatives and close friends for God-manifestation. Also, they watch which souls are going to take human incarnation. So they do participate. There is no end to their work. They are all the time offering good will to mankind â€” this way, that way, here, there.</p>  </div>
