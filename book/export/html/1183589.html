<p>A teacher was asking different students in her class all kinds of interesting questions. The students were answering very well. She asked questions on many subjects; literature, history, current events and math. Most of the questions were like puzzles.</p>
<p>The teacher asked one girl who was very good at math, "If it takes a man twenty days to dig twenty holes, how long will it take the man to dig half a hole?"</p>
<p>The girl replied, "That is very easy! It will take half a day."</p>
<p>The teacher said, "I admire your mathematics, but not your logic. There is no such thing as half a hole! A hole is a hole."</p>
<p>To one excellent athlete, the teacher said, "Jimmy and Joey were playing checkers. They played seven games, and each won five games. How could this have happened?"</p>
<p>The student exclaimed, "I cannot figure it out! If I win five out of seven games, then how can my opponent do the same?"</p>
<p>The teacher answered, "That is the question."</p>
<p>"Wait, I have it! They were not playing each other."</p>
<p>"Right!" replied the teacher, and all the students started laughing and laughing.</p>  </div>
