<p><em>(James Monroe alone in his room.)</em></p>
<p><em>James Monroe:</em> Lord, I love my country dearly, yet I am not happy. I have two beautiful homes, yet I am not happy. George Washington, the Father of the Nation, showed me much affection, yet I am not happy. The great Jefferson said to me, "Monroe is so honest that if you turned his soul inside out, there would be no spot upon it," yet I am not happy. When I ran for a second term as president, it can almost be said that nobody ran against me, yet I am not happy. People called my time as president "the era of good feeling," yet I am not happy. While I was in office the boundary line was established between our country and Canada. This is indeed the world's most inspiring, encouraging and illumining example of disarmament: an unbelievably unfortified border. To a great extent I am responsible for that, yet I am not happy. The hero in me spoke when I asked Spain and other European nations to keep their hands off North and South America, yet I am not happy. When our Latin American neighbours wanted to free themselves from the Spaniards, I encouraged, even assisted them, yet I am not happy. Nothing on earth is giving me any satisfaction. I must needs leave this shore for the other shore where my most esteemed colleagues Washington, Jefferson and Madison are enjoying their well-deserved rest. Needless to say, I too need some rest. <em>(With folded hands)</em> It is the fourth of July, the most significant day in our country's history. May I be blessed with the boon from You that, like Adams and Jefferson, I too may leave my body today. <em>(A bright light from above descends on Monroe.</em> ) Lord, You have heard my prayer. Not only do I offer You this earth's body, but also my Heaven's soul I surrender to Your divine care.</p>  </div>
