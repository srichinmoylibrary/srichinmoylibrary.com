<p>From the inmost recesses<br /> Of his heart,<br /> Subhas confided in Dilip:<br /> 'I am frequently<br /> In the vortex of politics.<br /> I deal with many friends.<br /> Most of them are quite often<br /> Perfect strangers to truth.<br /> At least in you-<br /> In your soul,<br /> In your heart,<br /> In your life-<br /> I have found<br /> An unceasingly dependable friend.</p>
<p>'Dilip, how can I ever forget<br /> Your heart's spontaneous generosity?<br /> You gave me ninety pounds<br /> When I was in dire financial need.<br /> A friend in deed<br /> Is<br /> A friend indeed!'</p>
