<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You find fear, shame and guilt standing between you and your true surrender to the Supreme. Please think of the Supreme as your most beloved father, mother, brother, sister. Also think of Him as someone who is more than prepared to do everything for you unconditionally. No matter how many mistakes you commit or how many wrong things you do, the Supreme will purify, illumine and perfect you.</p>
<p>You may ask, "If there is someone who is so kind to me, why can't I offer Him these faults on the basis of my oneness?" You say you have doubt, fear, shame; but I wish to say that He is more than willing to accept them as His own. What you have can easily be accepted by Him. If you fear that He will not accept these things because they are not divine, you are making a deplorable mistake. You must offer Him whatever you consider your very own, whether divine or undivine. In your case, all the negative qualities that are standing in your way can easily be surrendered if you are constantly and consciously sincere. If you are sincere, then I assure you that your sincerity will help you in establishing oneness with His boundless, unconditional Concern, Compassion, Forgiveness and Oneness-Light. Very often, human beings observe something but do not give importance to it. But if you give importance to God's Concern and Love, you will feel the results in your life of aspiration.</p>  </div>
