<p>FIRST BOY: “Guess what I drank this morning?”</p>
<p>SECOND BOY: “Beer? Whiskey?”</p>
<p>FIRST: “Stop!”</p>
<p>SECOND: “Then what? What did you drink?”</p>
<p>FIRST: “I drank buffalo’s milk. You can’t imagine how delicious it tastes. My mother says that buffalo’s milk is more nourishing than cow’s milk.”</p>
<p>SECOND: “Never! Your mother is a fool!”</p>
<p>FIRST: “My mother is a fool? You know that my mother is going to be the head of a school?”</p>
<p>SECOND: “Do you know why your mother says that the buffalo’s milk is more nourishing?”</p>
<p>FIRST: “I don’t know. Ted me why.”</p>
<p>SECOND: “She just looks like a buffalo.”</p>
<p>FIRST: “Stop! My mother may look like a buffalo, but your mother is a buffalo herself.”</p>  </div>
