<p>This morning I was walking down the 150th Street hill at about 6:15. After about 100 metres I saw an elderly lady. This is the lady that I always see whenever I run there, even when I go out at three or four in the morning. She always has her two dogs with her and says hello. She is very nice to me. This morning she smiled at me and said, "My dogs will never bite."</p>
