<p>I have lost my mind's purity.<br /> That means I have lost much.<br /> I have lost my heart's faith.<br /> That means I have lost more.<br /> I have lost my love of God.<br /> That means I have lost all,<br /> I have lost everything.<br /> I have lost God the powerful Creator.<br /> I have lost God the beautiful creation.<br /> My Lord, my Lord, my Lord,<br /> Do tell me how I can regain<br /> my mind's purity,<br /> My heart's faith and my love of You.</p>
<p>"My child, go and sing inside<br /> your heart-garden.<br /> You will regain your mind's purity.<br /> My child, go and play with the<br /> blue-gold child<br /> Inside your heart.<br /> You will regain your heart's faith.<br /> My child, go and meditate with the breath<br /> Of your newly-acquired<br /> blue-gold child-friend.<br /> You will regain your love for Me."</p>
