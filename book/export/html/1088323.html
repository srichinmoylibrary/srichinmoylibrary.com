<p>When Bhaskarananda was 18 years old, his parents forced him to marry. The following year, when his wife was blessed with a child, all his relatives were swimming in the sea of delight. But the father of the child was an exception; he was swimming in the sea of suffering. He said to himself, "This is the beginning of my attachment-life," and on that very day he left home for good. Only after he became a great spiritual Master with abundant occult powers did he return home, but by then his child was with God.</p>
<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>Often we start with attachment-life and then enter into detachment-life. Attachment-life tells us that we can have everything in the course of time. Detachment-life tells us that we are eternally everything. Attachment-life tells us that hunger is one thing, feast is something else, and that they have to be brought together. Detachment-life tells us that hunger is the birth of satisfaction and feast is the transcendence of satisfaction.</p>  </div>
