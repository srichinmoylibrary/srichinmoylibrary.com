<p>I was so moved by our visit to Hiroshima. There I felt spiritual grandeur, peace and tranquility. Some of the bomb victims' spirits are still hovering around and trying to take revenge, but most of the souls that were there when the bomb dropped have gone back to the souls' world, so for them the story is over.</p>
