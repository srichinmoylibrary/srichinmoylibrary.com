<p>In 1965 Ann Harrison showed me the ABC’s of driving. I would drive 200 metres and brake. Then she would drive us back to the starting point because I did not know how to go in reverse.</p>
<p>In the car she had a very cute kind of doll hanging. When the doll moved a little to the right, my sponsor thought this meant that she could go against the red light. O God! How many times God saved us from a serious accident! Her inner voice, this little doll, was telling her to go and I was shouting, “Stop! Stop!”</p>
<p>Then we would come to a green light and the little doll would tell her to stop. The drivers in the cars behind her would all be cursing us, but her inner voice would not permit her to go.</p>  </div>
