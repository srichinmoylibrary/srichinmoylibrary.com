<p>I have failed,<br /> Not because I have not attempted.<br /> I have attempted time and again<br /> Soulfully, even sleeplessly.<br /> I have failed<br /> Because I have not made even one attempt<br /> At my Lord Supreme's choice Hour.<br /> What was I trying to accomplish?<br /> I was trying to reach<br /> The summit-height of Heaven.</p>
