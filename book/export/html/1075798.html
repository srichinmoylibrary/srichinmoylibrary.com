<p><em>(Motilal Roy's residence. First floor. A furniture godown. Aurobindo in meditation with eyes open.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter Motilal with a dish in hand)</em></p>
<p>MOTILAL: It seems you are in another world. You look absorbed in your depths. Will you tell me if I have a chance of taking to Yoga?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Certainly you have.</p>
<p>MOTILAL: My family tie ...</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: That's nothing.</p>
<p>MOTILAL: Then, pray tell me how I can take up the spiritual life.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Try to surrender everything to God.</p>
<p>MOTILAL: Will it be possible for me?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Why not? God is within and without us. He himself will do your Yoga.</p>
<p>MOTILAL: Then please show me the easiest path.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Surrender, that is the easiest. Try to surrender all you have and all you are.</p>
<p>MOTILAL: <em>(Bowing down to Aurobindo's feet)</em> Please give me your Blessing.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(Smiling and then placing his hand upon Motilal's head)</em> If you must have it, here it is.</p>  </div>
