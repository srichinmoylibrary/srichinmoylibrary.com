<p>After fifteen minutes I saw a very nice old man running with his hands behind his head. He said to me, "Good morning."</p>
<p>I asked him, "Is there any reason why you are doing that?"</p>
<p>He answered, "To strengthen my chest."</p>
<p>In silence I said, "You don't need to, but I want to strengthen my chest."</p>  </div>
