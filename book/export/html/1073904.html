  <h1 class="book-heading">Ganapati’s uncle becomes deeply upset</h1>
  
 
<p>Ganapati’s maternal uncle was his father’s dearest friend and greatest admirer. When this uncle learned that Suren had stolen the family’s money and jewels, he thought that Ganapati’s whole family would be ruined.</p>
<p>He said to Ganapati’s father, “What are you going to do?”</p>
<p>Ganapati’s father tried to reassure him. He said, “Do not worry. We will not suffer at all. I have so much property and also I have money in other banks.”</p>
<p>But Ganapati’s uncle was not convinced. He had such love for Ganapati’s family that eventually he became insane with worry and anxiety.</p>  </div>
