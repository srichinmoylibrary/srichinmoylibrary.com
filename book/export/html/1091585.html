<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes! For beginners especially, it is always advisable to meditate on the heart centre. In fact, even if one is advanced, one should meditate there because from the heart centre you feel oneness with the highest, you get joy and become part and parcel of whatever you are meditating on. If you concentrate on the third eye, you may not have the feeling of oneness. You may see Light, but you will feel that it is not yours. First you will feel that you have seen Light, but then you will think that perhaps it was not Light at all but just imagination or hallucination. Doubt may enter into your mind. When you use the heart, however, the joy that you get you immediately feel is yours; the peace that you feel is yours; anything that you feel becomes yours. This is the heart's capacity for oneness.</p>
<p>So it is always advisable to meditate on the heart first. Once you have established your oneness with infinite Peace, Light and Bliss, you will have the capacity to identify yourself with the Vast. Then, when you concentrate on the third eye and see Light, the Light can easily enter into you and become yours. Once you have established your oneness with the Vast in the form of Peace, Light, Bliss or any other divine quality, when you see Light either inside you or around you, you will have the capacity to identify yourself with it and make it your own. After you have established your identity with Peace, Light and Bliss, when you see these things with your third eye, you will have the capacity to bring them into your system. And if they are already inside you, then you will have the capacity to bring them to the fore. So it is always advisable to meditate on the heart centre. The third eye is good, but it may create confusion, so why take the risk?</p>  </div>
