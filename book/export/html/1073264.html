<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people do not know how to sleep properly. They sleep flat on their chest, which is an absurd way of sleeping. At that time the <em>Ida, Pingala</em> and <em>Sushumna</em> cords cannot function at all. Always you have to face the light and allow the light to enter at the heart centre. When you are sleeping on your back or on your side, you are seeing some light, whereas when you sleep on your chest, light is immediately obstructed. So the best way to sleep is on your side or on your back. Never lie facing down, and do not cross your arms or hands on your chest when you sleep.</p>  </div>
