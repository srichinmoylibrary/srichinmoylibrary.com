<p>Once Guru Devadas Maharaj left his small ashram for a few days and asked his dear disciple Ramdas to remain seated at a particular place and continue meditating until he came back. For five or six days Ramdas meditated day and night until his Master returned. The Master immediately blessed Ramdas and said, "Today you have highly pleased me. You could have slept, you could have left the place, you could have deceived me in various ways. I clearly see that you have not deceived me in any way; therefore, my heart of infinite gratitude and my life of infinite pride I offer to you."</p>
<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>The command from the divine Master is never a command as such. His voice may sound very strict and stern, but inside him is the flow of his compassionate oneness. His compassionate oneness awakens the sleeping heart and illumines the doubting mind of the disciple even before the disciple is asked to do anything.</p>
<p>Divine obedience is not only soulful but fruitful. Divine obedience gets tremendous delight by virtue of its inner, spontaneous oneness with the Master's will. Here it is not actually the oneness of the superior and the inferior; it is the oneness of one reality that has two heights. The first reality enters into the second reality to manifest God the Unmanifest. The second reality enters into the first to realise God the infinite and ever-transcending Vision.</p>  </div>
