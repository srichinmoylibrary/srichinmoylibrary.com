<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. Each one has his own way of meditation. What actually happens in the individual is that sometimes he gets from within himself a kind of meditation. I mean the inner being comes forward and tells the individual to pray or meditate in this or that way, that this or that will help. Sometimes a spiritual figure comes along who can easily enter into the individual and know the ins and outs of the seeker's inner and outer life and know the growth and the development and the aspiration of the seeker. Then this spiritual teacher can tell him how to meditate and when to meditate.</p>
<p>When you have a teacher, you are extremely lucky, especially if the teacher is a genuine one. If you don't have a teacher, but if you have a genuine aspiration, God within you will tell you the correct meditation. It is not possible for everyone in the world to have a spiritual teacher. It is well and good if one gets a teacher. If one does not get one, what will happen? We are all God's children. God does not want to deprive us of God Realisation. God wants us to realise Him. So, if you get a teacher, well and good. If not, go deep within to discover your own meditation.</p>  </div>
