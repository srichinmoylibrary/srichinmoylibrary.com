<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> With a oneness-heart. I have lifted people from all walks of life to offer my oneness to them. We all belong to one family. In a family, somebody is a doctor, somebody is an engineer, somebody is a football player. But they are all brothers and sisters of the same family. So here also, on the strength of my oneness with people from various fields, I am lifting them up. My sole objective is to be of service to mankind.</p>  </div>
