<p>In Agra, the drivers take two hours to go to the Taj Mahal, although it is only twenty minutes away. God knows where they take you! Then, in the hope of a little more money, for four blocks they will follow you like a faithful dog. If you throw them something — even the smallest coin — then when they go to pick it up, you can gain some ground on them and escape.</p>
