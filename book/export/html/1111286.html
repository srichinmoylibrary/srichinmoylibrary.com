<p>About ten minutes before the race, my Cleveland friend all of a sudden came up to me. He didn't say hello or anything; he just grabbed my hand and started shaking my hand.</p>
<p>He is a far better runner; I was so honoured.</p>
<p>Then he started giving me advice. He said, "You have to drink a lot, drink a lot."</p>
<p>It was so hot — really very, very hot. Everybody had told me that the weather would be very cold. But no, it was really hot.</p>
<p>So my Cleveland friend said, "Drink a lot, drink a lot; otherwise, you won't be able to make it."</p>
<p>My Philadelphia friend — God knows where he was! But he would appear very soon.</p>
