<p>One Europe. The supreme visionary in President Gorbachev brings to the fore the uncharted brightness and fulness of tomorrow's Europe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Europeans can meet the challenge of the coming century only by pooling their efforts. We are convinced that what they need is one Europe, peaceful and democratic â€” a Europe that maintains all its diversity and common humanistic ideas, a prosperous Europe that extends its hand to the rest of the world, a Europe that confidently advances into the future."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strasbourg, France<br />6 July 1989</p>  </div>
