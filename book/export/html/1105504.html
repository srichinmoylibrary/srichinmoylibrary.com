<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life our most precious wealth is surrender. We are born with surrender, so that no one is without this wealth in infinite measure. But unfortunately, some seekers are unable to use this wealth.</p>
<p>Sometimes we can have infinite wealth, but this infinite wealth may not be worth much. We cannot feel that an infinite amount of cotton is the same treasure as an infinite amount of gold. Naturally, even a small quantity of gold will be more precious than an inflate amount of cotton.</p>
<p>In our path, surrender is the most effective key to open the door of the Eternal. This surrender has to be vigilant, conscious and constant. Before each action is performed, while it is in the process of being performed and after it has been completely performed, the seeker has to feel the living breath of surrender. To whom? To the Inner Pilot.</p>  </div>
