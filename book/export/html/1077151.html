<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have destroyed many — countless numbers. But transformation is another thing. Sometimes some forces don’t want transformation. Even now I have a few close disciples who accepted forces that I had to destroy. If I had not destroyed these forces, their transformation would not have taken place for twenty years or forty years, or who knows in what incarnation. I have dear disciples. I have destroyed forces in them, not because these people are close, but because they have really wanted help from me. If people do not want my help, it is like a mother trying to force her child to eat. How many times can a mother force a child?</p>  </div>
