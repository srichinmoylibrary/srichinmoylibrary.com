<blockquote>
<p>"Conscience is the voice of the soul, as passions are the voice of the body. No wonder they often contradict each other."</p>
<p>â€” Rousseau</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conscience and passion need not contradict each other if man aspires to offer his heart's light to his passion and his heart's surrender to his conscience. In this way, he can easily transcend this apparently irreconcilable contradiction.</p>  </div>
