<p>I was walking at St. John’s University track. My friend Coach Hurt saw me and said, “Sri, Sri!” Again he said, “Sri, Sri!” Then he added, “You look fit!”</p>
<p>He was ten metres away from me. Three times he said hello to me. He was coaching two groups of girl sprinters. How fast they were running! He had a long bamboo stick and he was using it to illustrate what exercise they should do.</p>
<p>Then I walked on the track for about two miles.</p>
