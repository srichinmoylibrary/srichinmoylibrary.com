<p>We had a marathon in Germany that was a perfect joke from the beginning to the end. it touched the height of absurdity. Our organisation reached the highest height. Fortunately, this was only a family gathering. The most important thing for the German disciples was their concert, so they paid all attention to that.</p>
<p>One reporter said I ran 26 miles. It was six, but he added 20 miles.</p>
