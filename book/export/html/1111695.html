<p>In today's eight-hundred-metre Green Leaves and Ripe Fruits race for men and women over fifty, Vince and I were going slowly and only keeping pace with Ilona during the first four hundred metres. But we knew that we would end up going ahead of her. After four hundred metres we started widening the gap, and Ilona fell behind us by a big margin. Whenever I increased my speed, Vince would increase his speed. In the last hundred metres we had a wonderful fight. I won by only one second.</p>
<p>I was planning to walk the whole race, but then Vince would have had no other competitor, except for a few ladies. His fate would have been like Senani's in the sixty-and-over race.</p>
