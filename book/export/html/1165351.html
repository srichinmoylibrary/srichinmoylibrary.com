<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can conquer the karmic law. We destroy the consequences of our past actions, of all the wrong things we have done, when we realise God. Through our meditation we first learn to deal with the results of our past lives. Then, eventually, we eliminate these results. Meditate well; go deep within. Ultimately you will be able to see with your third eye. When your third eye is opened up, you can destroy your past karma. It is through vision and through sincere effort that one can nullify his past.</p>  </div>
