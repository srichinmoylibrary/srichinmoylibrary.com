  <h1 class="book-heading">The lousy runner</h1>
  
 
<p>Yesterday I ran our dear friend Cahit Yeter's races. The one-mile race I managed, but in the five-mile race that came next, I suffered so much.</p>
<p>Cahit had given me the number 'one' for my running number. At about a mile and a half into the five-mile race, a little girl was running near me with her father. He said to the child, "Look, number one is running with you."</p>
<p>At the time I was struggling and struggling. The little girl said, "Number one is a lousy runner."</p>
<p>The father said, "Don't say that!"</p>
<p>Then she went ahead of me. We were competing with each other.</p>
<p>Finally, what happened! I went ahead of her towards the finish of the race.</p>
<p>Cahit gave me the number 'one,' so number one got wonderful appreciation from that little girl.</p>
