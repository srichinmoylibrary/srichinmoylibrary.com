 <p>
MSUN 45-51. These seven questions were answered by Sri Chinmoy on 16 and 26 November 1976.</p>
<h2>Question: What stands between the outer goal of the United Nations and the inner goal of the United Nations?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, we have to know what the two goals are. The outer goal of the United Nations is the expansion of its lofty ideas. The inner goal of the United Nations is the manifestation of its illumining and fulfilling ideals. What stands between its ideas and its ideals is a lack of self-giving. If individuals and nations were self-giving instead of self-centred, then there would be nothing separating the ideas from the ideals or the outer goal from the inner goal.</p>  </div>
