<p>I went to another store in Korea and was looking at a dirty wallet. The owner asked me, "Are you Japanese?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, I am Indian."</p>
<p>He said the wallet cost 10,000, but after I took one step out of the store he said, "Since you are an Indian, I will give it to you for 3,000."</p>
<p>I went back into the store, but when I was about to buy the wallet, he said, "No, the price is 5,000."</p>
<p>So I didn't buy it. I said to myself, "For 5,000, why should I buy such a stupid thing?"</p>
