<p>"God, can You do me a favour?"</p>
<p>"Definitely. Tell Me what kind of favour you want."</p>
<p>"My Lord, I am not satisfied with my name of late. What is worse, I have been hating my name. Can You give me a new name?"</p>
<p>"Are you sure that you would like a new name, My child?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. I am breathlessly eager to hear my name from You. And I give You my word of honour that I will use only this name from now on."</p>
<p>"Do you mean that not only I, but all human beings, will call you by the name that I give you?"</p>
<p>"My Lord, do You want me to die in anticipation?"</p>
<p>"I am now giving you your new name: Inconscience incarnate."</p>
<p>"What have You done to me? What have I done to myself?"</p>
<p>"Be always careful of the desire you want Me to fulfil!"</p>  </div>
