<p>Today I lifted my 200 pounds with both arms three times and these lifts are definitely higher than the lift that is being shown on television. First Dhanu did me a favour — his camera did not work — and then Mridanga did me a favour — his video camera ran out of tape. God does not want me to be too proud!</p>
