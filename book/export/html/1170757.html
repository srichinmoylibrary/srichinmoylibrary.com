<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Common sense is wisdom. Suppose I see a flame. It is so beautiful that I want to touch it. But common sense tells me that if I touch it, then definitely I will burn my hand. So we start with common sense, but then afterwards we have to go beyond common sense, using whatever wisdom we have got from our past lives or from earlier in our present life. Then we come to a certain stage or height where we see that common sense no longer works. So from there we have to go forward and upward until we are far, far beyond the domain of common sense.</p>  </div>
