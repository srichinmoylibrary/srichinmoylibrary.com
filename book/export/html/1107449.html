<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each house has body, vital, mind, heart and soul. All the qualities of body consciousness, vital consciousness, mental consciousness are inside the house. The heart of a house and the soul of a house are like individual human beings. When the children are at home and the parents are not there, the children feel miserable because their parents are away. Similarly, when you go out of the house, your house-child misses you. It suffers.</p>  </div>
