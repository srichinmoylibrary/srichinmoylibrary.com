<p>After Gandhi-ji and Nehru unsuccessfully tried to remove Subhas as Congress President in 1939 and then tried to put many roadblocks in his path, Subhas saw that the only way for the country to make progress was through a spirit of cooperation and oneness. With utmost sincerity and humility he wrote to Gandhi-ji:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If I am to continue as President, despite all the obstacles, handicaps and difficulties, how would you like me to function?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After having bound Subhas from head to foot, Gandhi-ji replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you are to function as President, your hands must be unfettered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The supreme proponent of satyagraha-zeal for truth-continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So far as the Gandhiites (to use that wrong expression) are concerned, they will not obstruct you. They will help where they can, abstain where they cannot."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When did they help? When, for God's sake? The height of ridiculous absurdity!</p>  </div>
