<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When one realises God, it does not mean that he will remember all the millions and billions of outer experiences he has had during his lifetime. But his inner experiences, the significant higher experiences that he had in the inner world, he can bring to the fore at his command. If he wants to bring his whole inner life in front of himself he can.</p>  </div>
