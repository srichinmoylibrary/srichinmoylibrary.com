<p>You taught your countrymen how to wake up from a long-cherished slumber. You taught them how to open their eyes and look within, look around and look above. Some of your countrymen were extremely grateful to your unimaginably good heart, while others were displeased with you for putting an end to their cherished ignorance-sleep. Still others foolishly wanted to run faster than the fastest immediately.</p>
<p>Gorbachev, the awakener, lovingly and compassionately said to them: "Comrades, we are by no means ready to run the fastest. We have just awakened. We can and we must first walk slowly and steadily, without fear, without doubt, without suspicion and without self-abnegation." Alas, the coach who was teaching them how to play life's vastness-oneness-reality-game became a victim of ruthless attacks.</p>  </div>
