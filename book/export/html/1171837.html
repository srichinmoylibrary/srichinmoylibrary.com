<h2>Question: Could you say a few words on your purpose in coming to the West?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In 1964 I came to the West to be of service to the Supreme in the aspiring mankind. To be absolutely true and honest, the Supreme in me, who is my Inner Pilot, commanded me to come to the West and serve Him in the West.</p>  </div>
