<p>When I first arrived in India, a bald-headed man came up to me near the Air India office in our hotel and said, "Sri Chinmoy? Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He said, "I can't believe it!" His eyes were swimming with tears. So soulfully he was shedding tears and embracing me. His soul knew who I am. He created a real scene in the hotel. So many people were watching!</p>
<p>He told me that he used to come to our meetings three years ago and then he stopped. He knows Adhiratha and he was telling me how Adhiratha stands next to my chair when he is guarding on stage on Wednesday nights. He also knows Sumantra and Ayoddhri.</p>
<p>He said he had come to India to visit some spiritual places, so I gave him the names of a few places to see. He said that he wants to start coming to our meetings in New York when he returns. He is a construction worker from Long island.</p>
