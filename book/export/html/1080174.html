<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, the United Nations can and should aspire for a higher goal than what the member states that compose it represent. The member states are like strong pillars of an edifice, but many more things are required to build the edifice. Those things are also of tremendous necessity. When everything is in its proper place and all things are combined to achieve a specific goal, at that time the body of the achievement-reality becomes divinely integral and supremely perfect.</p>  </div>
