  <h1 class="book-heading">Three categories of disciples</h1>
  
 
<p>One day a spiritual Master was meditating with some of his disciples and a few seekers. After about twenty minutes, he looked around and said, "Is there anyone who would like to ask me a spiritual question?" One disciple raised his hand and asked, "Master, could you please say something about your disciples' spiritual development?"</p>
<p>"My child," replied the Master, "I can only tell you that I love all my spiritual children dearly, no matter what their level of spiritual attainment may be."</p>
<p>"Please tell us more," begged the disciples. "Can you tell us more about the different levels of development?"</p>
<p>The Master paused. "Let me tell you a story," he said. "Once there were three dolls. These dolls were conscious dolls. One was made of sugar, one was made of cloth and one was made of burnt stone. Now it happened that each of these dolls entered into the sea. When the one that was made of sugar entered into the sea, it totally dissolved. The second doll entered into the sea, and came out fully soaked. Then the third doll entered bravely into the sea. When it came out it just shook its body, and not a trace of water was left on it.</p>
<p>There also, my children, I have three types of disciples. One type, when he enters into the ignorance-sea, is totally lost, totally melted. When the second type enters into the ignorance sea, he is able to come out. But ignorance is all around his consciousness. He still carries ignorance with him. The third type enters into ignorance bravely and fights against ignorance. He not only comes out victorious, but he also takes up the challenge of transforming ignorance into wisdom-light.</p>
<p>"I do hope one day all of my disciples will fit into the third category: brave soldiers of the Supreme entering into the sea of ignorance like warriors, fighting against ignorance and coming out victorious, and finally changing ignorance-sea into wisdom-light."</p>
<p>The disciples bowed down to their Master and said, "You have inspired and illumined us. We shall all strive from now on to become brave soldiers of your mission, soldiers of the Supreme, fighting against the forces of ignorance and ultimately transforming them."</p>
