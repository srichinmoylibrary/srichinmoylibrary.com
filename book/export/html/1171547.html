<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Through oneness, oneness, oneness. If you throw a tennis ball, does the tennis ball have any fear? If you are on the third floor and you throw the tennis ball down to the street, it is you who may have fear. You may be afraid that the tennis ball will hurt someone or that it may get lost or that something will happen to it. But the tennis ball has no fear.</p>
<p>We have to feel that God is playing with us like a tennis ball, throwing us here and there. But, in God's case, He does it consciously. You are His instrument. He knows that He will be able to trace you, no matter where He throws you. He also knows that you are not going to break. If He knew that you would break, would He throw you?</p>  </div>
