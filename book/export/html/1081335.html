<blockquote>
<p>Girish has one hundred and twenty-five per cent faith.</p>
<p>— Sri Ramakrishna</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In G.C. [Girish] alone I have seen that true resignation-that true spirit of a servant of the Lord...I have not met his parallel. From him I have learnt the lesson of self-surrender.</p>
<p>— Swami Vivekananda</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If one is in the company of Girish Babu for even five minutes, one gets freed from worldly delusion... He has such keen insight that he can see at a glance the innermost recess of a man's heart, and by virtue of this powerful insight he was able to recognise the Master as an Avatar.</p>
<p>— Nag Mahashay</p>
