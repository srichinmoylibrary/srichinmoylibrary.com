<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the final analysis, one has what one becomes. We have deep within us the things that we have always been longing for: Eternity, Infinity and Immortality, infinite peace, light and bliss. But right now we are not aware that we have these. Right now we are looking here, there and everywhere for these things, without knowing where to search for them.</p>
<p>But if we pray and meditate sincerely, there will come a time when we will realise the Truth. At that time we will see that the things we have been searching and crying for are things we have deep within us. We embody these very things.</p>
<p>When we embark on our journey, the first thing we have to know is that we can: we can reach the ultimate Truth. Then we have to realise that this ultimate Truth is not somewhere else or someone else's. It is deep within us; it has always been ours. Our third and ultimate discovery is that we represent the Truth; we are the Truth.</p>
<p>So, to come back to your question, the second realisation — I have — in the final analysis is transformed into the third realisation — I am. What we have is what we have always had, and when we consciously realise this, we grow into it. Then we see that what we have consciously become is what we have always been and eternally are.</p>  </div>
