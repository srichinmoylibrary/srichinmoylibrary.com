  <h1 class="book-heading">Why?</h1>
  
 
<p>A soulful seeker says to his Inner Pilot: “My Lord, I have not said much to the world. Why, You know. It is because the world does not understand me. Not only that but, what is worse, the world badly misunderstands me.</p>
<p>“My Lord, I have not done much for the world. Why, You know. It is because the world does not want my help. Not only that but, what is worse, the world is apt to destroy my little, humble creation.</p>
<p>“My Lord, I have not thought of the world much. Why, You know. It is because my thought-waves are blighted by the blindness of the world. Not only that but, what is worse, the ruthless world compels my mind to starve.</p>
<p>“My Lord, I do not meditate on the world much. Why, You know. It is because the world deliberately destroys my conscious, constant and inseparable oneness with the Lord Supreme. Not only that but, what is worse, the world vehemently throws poisonous suspicion-snakes all around me.</p>
<p>“My Lord, I do not love the world much. Why, You know. It is because the world does not want to learn the lesson of divine love: constant self-giving, which is another name for God-becoming. Not only that but, what is worse, the world does not care for its own divinity and only reality, which is the soul, the all-loving and all-illumining soul.” </p>
