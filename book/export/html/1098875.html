<p>In the beginning, I received a salary of $230 every month. Then it went a little higher — $10 more per year! Every Friday, at four o’clock, my boss used to allow me to bring refreshments for the nine or ten colleagues who worked in my section. I used to take mail to the post office in Bloomingdale’s. There was a bakery there and I used to buy one or two items for everyone.</p>  </div>
