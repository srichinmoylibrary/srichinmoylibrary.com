<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, if it is a good dream, if it is an inspiring dream, certainly it helps. But if it is an undivine dream, it will not help. If somebody is stabbing you and you are stabbing somebody else, or if you are in the battlefield or some catastrophe is taking place, you have to know that these kinds of dreams come from the vital world and they will not help you at all. But if you have a dream in which an angel appears before you, or if I am blessing you in a dream or if you see a sea of Peace right in front of you, then these kinds of dreams naturally will expedite your spiritual progress. So it depends on what kinds of dreams you have. If it comes from the vital world, the destructive world, then you can't make any progress. But you definitely can make progress when you see divine things or feel in the dream itself Peace, Light and Bliss in boundless measure.</p>  </div>
