<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you give God the chance, He is bound to please you. If you don't give Him the chance, how is He going to please you? As an individual, if you feel that you alone can please yourself, there is no purpose for God. But if you feel that God is your own, not only will He be able to fulfil you, He will also feel that it is His bounden duty to fulfil you. He is bound to please you twenty-four hours a day if you will only give Him the chance He is like a beggar, an eternal beggar. He is begging you to give Him the chance to please you.</p>  </div>
