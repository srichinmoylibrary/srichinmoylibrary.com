<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Real spirituality is everywhere the same â€” in India, in America, in Milan. Everywhere spirituality is the same. Real spirituality means Yoga. Yoga means oneness with God. Now this oneness we establish in two ways. In the West we give more importance to prayer. In the East we give more importance to meditation. In Christian spirituality, prayer comes first. In Indian spirituality, meditation comes first. I believe that the realisation which the Christ had, our Krishna also had. But the Christ spoke so much of prayer, prayer, prayer, whereas our Krishna emphasized meditation, meditation. But when realisation comes, the Goal is the same. To come to the Goal I can take one road, you can take another road; but the Goal remains the same.</p>  </div>
