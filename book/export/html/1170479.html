<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What can you do? You have proved that you can bring victory to your Inner Pilot. How many people on earth would have succeeded in doing what you did? How many would have said to those undivine people, the way you did, "I love my Inner Pilot, I love my Inner Pilot." Out of 3,000 disciples, perhaps only five per cent would have survived if they had gone through what you went through. So did you not prove that you love the Supreme?</p>
<p>No matter how many times ignorance attacks you, your mantra is always, "I love my Inner Pilot, I love my Inner Pilot, I love my Inner Pilot."</p>  </div>
