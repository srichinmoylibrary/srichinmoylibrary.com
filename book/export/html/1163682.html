<p>His envy-life never dies!<br /> There was a time<br /> When he envied the world-champion athletes.<br /> There was a time<br /> When he envied the world-philosophers<br /> and saints.<br /> And now whom does he envy?<br /> He envies his soul in its purest beauty.<br /> He envies his God in His absolute Perfection.</p>
