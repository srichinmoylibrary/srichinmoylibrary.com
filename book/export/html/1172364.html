<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> <em>Nirvikalpa</em> samadhi and other samadhis are all high stages. But there is a stage which is superior to <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi. That is the stage of divine transformation, absolute transformation. You can be in samadhi, but samadhi does not give you transformation. While you are in your trance you become exalted, for you are one with God. But when you come back into the material plane, you become an ordinary man. But if you have transformed your outer and inner consciousness, then you are no more affected by the ignorance of the world.</p>  </div>
