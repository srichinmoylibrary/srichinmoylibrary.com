<p>There is a lady in Woodstock who has so many little, little crafts in her store. She also sells super-excellent flutes. After trying out two flutes, I told her the one I liked. Then she said, "I have a special surprise for you. It is a gift." She told me that Tanima had given her money to get a flute for me, and she had kept it aside. After I played on Tanima's flute, I saw that it was the best.</p>
<p>Anupadi had also gotten me a gift from that store. So I wanted to give the lady some money so that Tanima and Anupadi could get gifts for themselves the next time they came in.</p>
<p>I trusted the lady, but she insisted on giving me a receipt.</p>
