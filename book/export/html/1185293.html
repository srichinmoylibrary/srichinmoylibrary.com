<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is not only right for you, it is right for everyone. When you are stricken with worries you only close your heart. At that time negative forces try to bother you like flies and mosquitoes. But if you stop worrying, you open your windows, and then light will enter into the heart room.</p>  </div>
