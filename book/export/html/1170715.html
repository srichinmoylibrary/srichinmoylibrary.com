<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the soul wants to keep a connection with the family members from its previous life, it can do so. It may not only keep a connection, but it may actually reincarnate in the same family. At that time, however, it may not have the same relationship with the other family members. Suppose you were somebody's daughter in one incarnation. In future incarnations you may come as that person's mother or sister.</p>  </div>
