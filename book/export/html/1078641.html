<p>LET OTHERS SERVE YOU</p>
<p>Let others share in your every gain.<br /> Let others share in your every pain.<br /> Let others love you<br /> The way they want to.<br /> Let others serve you<br /> The way they want to.<br /> You love them because you know<br /> That their hearts are of your dream-boat,<br /> And their lives are for your reality-shore.</p>
