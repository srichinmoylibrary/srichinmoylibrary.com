<p>Oh, my God, are You complete?<br /> No, I am not.</p>
<p>Why are You not complete?<br /> Perhaps you are the cause.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, are You perfect?<br /> No, I am not.</p>
<p>Why are You not perfect?<br /> Perhaps you are the cause.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, are You fulfilled?<br /> No, I am not.</p>
<p>Why are You not fulfilled?<br /> Perhaps you are the cause.</p>
<p>My God, You are a very clever God.<br /> You put the entire blame on me.<br /> All right. I accept.<br /> Now, tell me,<br /> How can I make You complete?<br /> How can I make You perfect?<br /> How can I fulfil You?</p>
<p>To make Me complete, my child,<br /> Give Me your heart of heartful love.</p>
<p>To make Me perfect, my child,<br /> Give Me your life of lifeless ignorance.</p>
<p>To fulfil Me, my child,<br /> Give Me your soul of soulful promise.</p>
