<p><em>(The </em>Karmayogin/ Office. Aurobindo, Nolini, Suresh Chandra Chakravarty, Biren Ghosh and Bijoy Nag are trying automatic writing. Time: 8 p.m.)/</p>
<p><em>(Enter Ramchandra Majumdar)</em></p>
<p>RAMCHANDRA: <em>(Turning towards Aurobindo in a low voice)</em> I have just heard from Father that in a day or two the Government will forcibly enter our office and arrest you.</p>
<p><em>(Aurobindo in contemplation)</em></p>
<p>SURESH: True?</p>
<p>BIJOY: Authentic?</p>
<p>NOLINI: Is it possible? Have not the Government taken note of 'An Open Letter to My Countrymen'?</p>
<p>RAMCHANDRA: They have. But they know their own way. They are led by secret reports.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(Abruptly)</em> Chandernagore.</p>
<p>SURESH: Chandernagore?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: I am starting at once for Chandernagore. I am going by a back route to the bank of the Ganges.</p>
<p><em>(Aurobindo and party come to the Ghat. Aurobindo steps into a boat. Suresh and Biren follow him. The boat is rowed by two men.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(To Suresh and Biren)</em> Have no fear. I have heard the voice from above.</p>
<p>SURESH: That sets our anxieties at rest.</p>  </div>
