<p>At one point Tagore sent Gandhi-ji a telegram urging him to cooperate with Subhas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"OWING TO GRAVELY CRITICAL SITUATION ALL OVER INDIA AND ESPECIALLY IN BENGAL WOULD URGE CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE IMMEDIATELY TO REMOVE BAN AGAINST SUBHAS AND INVITE HIS CORDIAL COOPERATION IN SUPREME INTEREST OF NATIONAL UNITY."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas, Tagore's plea fell on deaf ears. Gandhi-ji replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"YOUR WIRE WAS CONSIDERED BY WORKING COMMITTEE. WITH KNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE THEY ARE UNABLE LIFT BAN. MY PERSONAL OPINION IS YOU SHOULD ADVISE SUBHAS BABU SUBMIT DISCIPLINE IF BAN IS TO BE REMOVED. HOPE YOU ARE WELL."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How Tagore suffered by loving both Subhas and Gandhi-ji can only be felt and never described, perhaps not even by the Poet of poets, Tagore himself.</p>  </div>
