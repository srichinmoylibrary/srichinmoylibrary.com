<p>Absolutely! We cherish insecurity within us; we have no sense of value. It is like the child who does not know the difference between sand and milk. If you put both in front of him, then he may eat sand or he may drink milk. We feel that insecurity is a most delicious fruit. But when it is compared with security, with inner joy and confidence, it is nothing. Once you have got real confidence, inner confidence make the comparison between insecurity and security and you will see the difference. Insecurity is like the tiniest ant, whereas security is like the combined strength of a million elephants.</p>  </div>
