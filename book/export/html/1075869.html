<p>SRI CHINMOY (B. 1931) is the author of more than 1,340 books of poems, aphorisms, short stories, plays and essays on spiritual themes. His seven major plays portray the lives of the great Avatars — Sri Ramachandra, Sri Krishna, the Buddha, the Christ, Sri Chaitanya, Sri Ramakrishna and Sri Aurobindo. He has also written about the American revolutionary leaders, the Moghul court of Akbar, and various other kings, saints and sages as well as the pastimes of the Indian cosmic gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>Writing from the unique inner perspective of a spiritual Master, Sri Chinmoy fully identifies with the experiences of his subjects, and we gain new insights into the spiritual impulses that have guided mankind for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy was born in Chittagong, East Bengal. He grew up in a spiritual community in South India, where this present play — one of his earliest — was first written. In 1964, in response to a call from Above, Sri Chinmoy came to America, making his home in New York. He now serves as a Guru to several thousand students around the world and has established meditation centres in many countries. Sri Chinmoy has dedicated his life to the establishment of world peace. In addition to his prayers and meditations, he offers tremendous inspiration to all who come in contact with him by virtue of his abundant creativity, which he expresses through literature, music, art and sporting activities.</p>  </div>
