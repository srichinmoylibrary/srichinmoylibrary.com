<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It was an act of my offering, self-offering, which I call inspiration. We are all citizens of the world. If I can inspire others, and if they can inspire the rest of the world, then we can have a better world. It is by virtue of inspiration that we can do good things for mankind. We are all longing for peace, peace, peace. And I feel it is our inner strength that will be able to give us peace. Inner strength is nothing other than oneness, universal oneness.</p>  </div>
