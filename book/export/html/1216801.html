<p>The day before I was scheduled to appear, the Conference authorities informed me that they could give me only two hours, instead of four. Instead of getting annoyed, I was delighted! I said to myself, "Why two hours? Why not one hour? The less time the better!"</p>
<p>I arrived at the Conference at ten o'clock. An Indian swami who was speaking before me went on and on about spirituality, while an interpreter translated into Spanish. So instead of starting at ten o'clock, I started at eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>When I finally went to the stage, they read out a very long introduction about me. The lights were quite dim, so they asked me whether I needed better light. I said, "I don't want to meditate in the dark. Definitely I need better light."</p>
<p>I meditated for a short time, played the esraj and sang two or three songs. Then the Puerto Rican women disciples sang four or five songs, and Uttama did Hatha yoga for ten minutes to bring down cosmic energy. While Uttama was drawing cosmic energy onto the stage, I was meditating very powerfully. Master and disciple were bringing down cosmic energy together.</p>
<p>Around ten minutes to twelve, we finished our roles. The Conference organiser, who had been sitting in the front row, came up to the stage and bowed down in front of me with folded hands for about two minutes. Then she got inspired to start praising me to the skies. She said I was absolutely the greatest of all the spiritual Masters, not only for this era, but also for future generations. Like this she went on for five minutes. The swami who had spoken before me and so many other swamis were there while she was saying this.</p>
<p>Luckily, the audience was polite. Otherwise, the disciples of some of the other Masters might have caused trouble when they heard me getting such appreciation.</p>
