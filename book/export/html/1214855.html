  <h1 class="book-heading">Human will-power and divine will-power</h1>
  
 
<p>We are all seekers, and what we all need is divine will-power. What do we mean by will or will-power? Human will is an experience of the body in the material plane, in the human consciousness. Divine will is an experience of the soul in the body, vital, mind and heart.</p>
<p>In the hoary past, human beings used will in order to remain simple. They thought and felt that God was all simplicity; therefore, they too wanted to be simple. But in the modern day world, human beings think and feel that God is not at all simple. They think that He is complicated and difficult to understand; therefore, the modern day world looks for truth in a very complex and sophisticated manner. In the hoary past, humans wanted to realise what they eternally are. Now we try to become what we can ultimately claim as our very own.</p>
<p>Will is an experience. This experience we utilise to cultivate and manifest the truth in us. When we utilise the soul’s will, we feel that God the Truth and God the Light are infinite and immortal. But when we utilise the will of the physical consciousness, the earth-consciousness, we feel that God is only a little better, only an inch higher, only a little more perfect than we are.</p>
<p>When we use the human will, we make a comparison between God’s Height, Capacity and Reality and our own height, capacity and reality. But when we use the divine will, at that time we make no comparison. We know God is infinite, God is eternal, God is immortal. We also know that what God is, we inherently are. God is manifesting Himself — what He eternally is. We are trying to realise ourselves — what we eternally are. Right after our realisation, we shall also act like God; we shall also sing the song of manifestation.</p>
<p>The world is progressing toward a specific goal. But the seeker in us is progressing toward the highest transcendental Goal. In the course of its progress, the world has succeeded in reaching the moon, it can travel down to the bottom of the ocean. But the world does not have the capacity to cover the distance between its eyes and its nose. Our eyes are closed shut, or, even if they are open, they are unable to see the truth. The nose is the life-breath; it brings in cosmic energy, cosmic light and power. But the present-day world denies the existence of light or feels that light is far beyond its reach or that, even it if it has the capacity to reach and become light, even then it will not gain satisfaction by doing so. The world feels that what it has so far received and achieved has not given it ultimate satisfaction and perfection, so why should it believe that there is something else that can give it ultimate perfection? But here the present-day world is making a deplorable mistake.</p>
<p>Will-power makes us see and feel what we are in God’s Eye. In God’s Eye we are more than perfect. Every conception of perfection is different. Once we attain to our ideal of perfection, we feel that we have played the game; our role is over. But in God’s Eye, perfection is something constantly transcending itself, something constantly singing the song of Eternity’s transcendence. God’s idea of perfection constantly sings the song of self-transcendence.</p>
<p>Human will gave the world its prosperity and glory. The divine will shall give us what we eternally have and what we eternally are. What we eternally have is God’s Concern, and what we eternally are is God’s Perfection and God’s Manifestation.</p>
