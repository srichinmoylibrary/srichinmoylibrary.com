<p>Today’s programme, “Lifting Up the World With a Oneness-Heart,” I am most prayerfully and most soulfully offering to my spiritual Master, Sri Aurobindo, who studied here at King’s College, Cambridge, from 1890 to 1892.</p>

<p>India’s Poet, India’s Seer,<br /> India’s Yogi,<br /> The transcendental Sri Aurobindo,<br /> Direct Descendant of the Absolute Supreme,<br /> To you I bow and bow and bow.</p>
<p><em>Bharater kabi bharater rishi</em><br /><em>bharater jogi Avatar</em><br /><em>Sri Aurobindo he ati manab</em><br /><em>branatijanai barebar</em></p>

As a prelude to the lifting part of the ceremony, Sri Chinmoy performed his own compositions for several minutes on the esraj, a slender North Indian bowed instrument with sympathetic strings. During his esraj performance, Sri Chinmoy offered the English translation of his Bengali song <em>Bharater Kabi</em> before singing the song <em>a capella</em>.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
