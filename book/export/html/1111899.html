<p>Carla is going to run tomorrow's Inspiration Marathon. Several years ago she finished last in the New York Marathon, but now she has improved her time by over two hours. With utmost sincerity we appreciate her present speed. She should also try to appreciate the patience we had in the past while we waited for her to finish.</p>
