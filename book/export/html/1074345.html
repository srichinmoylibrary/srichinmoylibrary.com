<p>As long as you are within the reach of the senses, you will try and cry. Once you are beyond the reach of the senses, you will fly and fly. But how can you be beyond the reach of the senses? You can be beyond the reach of the senses the moment you declare that your senses are for God to use, and not for you to use.</p>
