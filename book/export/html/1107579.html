<p>God’s Will and my will. Is my will becoming one with God’s Will? Yes, it is.</p>
<p>What does God want from me? God wants me to express my deep appreciation for those who help me in my life’s journey towards the uncharted Golden Land, and I am doing it.</p>
<p>God wants me to thank my friends sincerely and unreservedly, and I am doing it.</p>
<p>God wants me to say a few nice things about my enemies. Indeed, it is a hard task, but somehow I manage to do it.</p>
<p>God wants me to decrease drastically my desire-bound earthly needs, such as material possessions, name, fame and glory, and I am doing it.</p>
<p>God wants me to increase boundlessly my aspiration-free Heavenly needs, such as a self-giving concern for humanity and an unconditional surrender to divinity. I am doing it.</p>
<p>God wants me to grow into a gratitude-sea so that I can receive Him all the time measurelessly and, at the same time, please Him in His own Way. I am doing it.</p>
<p>In an uncertain world there are only four things that are unmistakably and absolutely certain:</p>
<p>God loves me unconditionally.</p>
<p>I need Him breathlessly.</p>
<p>God has come to me as a Compassion-Tree.</p>
<p>One day, at God’s choice Hour, I shall go to Him as a satisfaction-fruit, His satisfaction-fruit. </p>
