<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> My Soul-Reality's All,<br /> Countless times I have withdrawn from You.<br /> I have withdrawn my promise-oneness.<br /> I have withdrawn my willingness-oneness.<br /> I have withdrawn my soulfulness-oneness.<br /> I have withdrawn my surrender-oneness-bliss.<br /> Still You have not withdrawn from me.<br /> You remain Your Eternity's Compassion-Eye.<br /> You remain Your Infinity's Forgiveness-Heart.<br /> You remain Your Immortality's Vision-Fulfilment-Cry.</p>
