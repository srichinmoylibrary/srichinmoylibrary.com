<p>IN MY PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE</p>
<p>There was a time<br /> When I lived to eat.<br /> I ate and ate and ate.</p>
<p>Now<br /> I eat to live.<br /> I regularly eat,<br /> I devotedly eat.</p>
<p>There shall come a time<br /> When I shall eat<br /> At God's Will,<br /> At God's Hour;<br /> From God's Kitchen,<br /> With God's Smile.</p>
