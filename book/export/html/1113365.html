<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme has many, many qualities, which He will adopt according to the individual seeker's needs at different times of the day. In a general way you can say that the Supreme starts His journey with Compassion. Inside His Compassion is his Concern, and inside His Concern is His Sympathy, inside His Sympathy is His Justice-Light, inside His Justice-Light is His sense of Perfection and inside His Perfection is His Satisfaction. But there is no hard and fast rule. The Supreme can change everything if He wants to. The most important thing is for the seeker to be receptive so that he can receive whatever quality of the Supreme is best for his progress.</p>  </div>
