  <h1 class="book-heading">God&#039;s visiting hours</h1>
  
 
<p>When I see my God in reason, He is Justice.</p>
<p>When I see my God in faith, He is Protection.</p>
<p>When I see my God in love, He is Compassion.</p>
<p>When I see my God in will, He is Vision.</p>
<p>When I see my God in joy, He is Perfection.</p>
<p>When I see my God in truth, He is Fulfilment.</p>
<p>My breath invokes God throbbingly, my soul silently, my heart lovingly, my mind hesitantly, my vital unconsciously and my body fearfully.</p>
<p>There are two choice hours for my God to visit me. Once when my soulful life is without haste; once when my life's mounting flame is without rest.</p>  </div>
