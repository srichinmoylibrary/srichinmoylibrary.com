<p>At one point I saw Voirab's mother holding two cups for the runners to take as they ran by. Other people near her were also holding out cups, but because I recognised her, I stretched my hand out to take water from her. Unfortunately, she did not recognise me, and she gave the cup to somebody else! She was so excited about the marathon that she didn't see who I was.</p>
