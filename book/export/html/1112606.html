<p>The Director-General of the United Nations in Geneva, Mr. Luigi Cottafavi, is an Italian. For about forty-five minutes we met with him and talked all about different religions. We also spoke all about Hinduism and about India.</p>
<p>He was very nice and kind, and full of life and enthusiasm. Physically he was very tall and strong. There is a great difference between the Director-General in Geneva and the Secretary-General here in New York. The Secretary-General has luminosity; the Director. General has dynamic vigour.</p>  </div>
