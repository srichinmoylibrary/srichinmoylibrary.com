<h2>Question: What does God look like?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God will look the way you want Him to look. He has all Power, all Kindness, all Compassion for you. If you want Him to look like the most beautiful angel, He will appear before you as an angel. If you want Him to look like a beautiful child, He will appear like a most beautiful child. If you want Him to look like a most beautiful flower, He will appear as a most beautiful flower. He will look exactly the way you want Him to look.</p>
<p>God will always try to please you in the way you want to be pleased. But before God pleases you, He will ask you to please Him in His own way. That is to say, you should pray to God, meditate on God. If you pray and meditate, then you are pleasing Him in His own way. You pray to God to become good. If you meditate on God to become good, then you are pleasing Him in His own way. Once you please Him in His own way, He will definitely stand before you looking the way you want Him to.</p>  </div>
