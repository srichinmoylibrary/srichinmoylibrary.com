<p>Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s peerless freedom-fighter and India’s matchless nation-transformer, offered these words of welcome and cooperation to U Thant in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on 10 November 1961, a few days after U Thant had been appointed Acting Secretary-General: “To you, sir, who occupy now this high seat of the Secretary-General, I offer my warm welcome and regard and greeting. And I can assure you that we, in common with others, not only welcome you here but offer you our full cooperation, for you represent the United Nations, to which all of us must offer cooperation.”</p>  </div>
