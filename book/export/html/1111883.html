<p>When I was at nine and a half miles, it started raining so heavily! Everybody was miserable. After I had made the turn and was coming back — at around sixteen miles — I saw a middle-aged man coming from the other direction. He had only run thirteen and a half miles and had not yet made the turn.</p>
<p>He was a perfect gentleman, cleanly shaven and nice looking. He said to me, "You are a gentleman and I am a gentleman. So you don't mind." Then he turned around and joined me. He had only run thirteen and a half miles, but now he was running with me at sixteen miles. I said, "Wonderful!"</p>
<p>At first he was running with me, but after fifty metres he started walking.</p>
