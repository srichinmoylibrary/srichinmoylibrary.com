<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely! If a spiritual person wants to realise God overnight, like taking instant coffee, at that time a philosopher will come and say, “You fool! How can you realise God, the most difficult subject on earth, overnight?” In this way, the patience of a seeker can be helped by a philosopher. The philosopher will say, “Take your time. To accomplish anything takes time. How can you expect to realise God in the twinkling of an eye?” When a philosopher gives this kind of advice, it can definitely be of great help to a spiritual person. Suppose a spiritual person has been praying for years and years, and now he is becoming impatient because he is not having even a glimpse of light. A philosopher will encourage him to exercise more patience, perseverance and other divine qualities.</p>  </div>
