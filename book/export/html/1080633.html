<p><em>When Sri Chinmoy completed his first one million drawings on the theme of the soul-bird, Yehudi Menuhin sent him the following letter of congratulation:</em></p>
<p>13th January 1994</p>
<p>Dear Sri Chinmoy,</p>
<p>It is good to know that you, who has such a great following, can bequeath the world so many drawings and sketches.</p>
<p>We have become so addicted to the camera that we have forgotten how the ancient travellers entered their impressions on a note-book, both graphically and verbally.</p>
<p>I congratulate you on this wonderful achievement, which transports us men, who would be winged, to the birds, which we have tried to emulate.</p>
<p>With all good wishes,</p>
<p>Devotedly,</p>
<p>Yehudi Menuhin</p>  </div>
