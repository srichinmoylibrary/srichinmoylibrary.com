<p>I was crossing from one side of the street to the other because somebody told me that Lavanya and Nilima were coming on the other side. As I was crossing, one of the runners said, "Look at that idiot!"</p>
<p>Afterwards, I became more alert. I would run a little ahead of the people coming and then cross.</p>
