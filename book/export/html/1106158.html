<p>Just as I lifted 313 pounds for the first time, I saw in front of me Sri Aurobindo. I saw Him in the Consciousness He had when He used to meditate on Mother Kali for some time and become inseparably one with Her. Sri Aurobindo was watching me and He was extremely happy and proud.</p>
<p>Here I was at the height of my concentration, and all of a sudden I saw Sri Aurobindo. Such a kaleidoscope goes on!</p>
