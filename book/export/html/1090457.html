<p>What do we get from the inner life?</p>
<p>We get simplicity, sincerity, integrity, purity, humility and divinity. He who has all these divine qualities will, without fail, have a life of joy, peace, freedom and fulfillment. And he who does not have these divine qualities will unmistakably have a life of tears, turmoil, bondage and frustration.</p>
<p>What else do we get from the inner life?</p>
<p>We get a growing, flowing and energising consciousness to illumine and perfect our thoughts and feelings and to accomplish our aims.</p>
<p>We can also grow into active and effective participants in God's cosmic experience.</p>
<p>To live an inner life is to become fully conscious of God's existence.</p>
<p>To become fully conscious of God's existence is to love humanity's breath with a boundless heart.</p>
<p>If we need a golden opportunity to see God's Face, the inner life is ready to grant it. If we need a faultless assurance that we are God's chosen children, the inner life is eager to give it.</p>
<p>When I truly live the inner life, I can dare to say, "God is mine." Doubt and fear will forever forget my name, form and address.</p>
<p>I dare to say, "I am God's." The journey Supreme and the Goal Transcendental will forever be mine.</p>
<p>God with his Light awakens my love.<br />God with his Bliss intensifies my devotion.<br />God with his Blessings immortalises my surrender.</p>
<p>With my love I discover God.<br />With my devotion I feed God.<br />With my surrender I fulfil God.<br /> My surrendering soul's journey begins with God's Concern. My craving life's journey begins with God's Compassion.</p>
<p>At the end of my soul's journey, I shall see God the way He wanted me to see Him. At the end of my life's journey, I shall see God the way I wanted to see Him.</p>
<p>Life is for man.<br />Man is of life.</p>
<p>Life is man's necessity.<br />Man is life's ability.</p>
<p>I have two I's, the small and the big. The small 'I' is the ego which is still unnoticed, while the big 'I' is the Self, which is still unknown. I shall notice the unnoticed to learn the Truth. I shall know the unknown to become the Truth.</p>
<p>It is in our inner life that we come to learn that</p>
<p>The soul is noble. It embodies the Truth.</p>
<p>The heart is noble. It realises the Truth.</p>
<p>The mind is noble. It expresses the Truth.</p>
<p>The vital is noble. It admires the Truth.</p>
<p>The body is noble. It serves the Truth.</p>  </div>
