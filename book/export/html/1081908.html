<p>God, my heart<br /> Was born to love.<br /> Do You believe it?<br /> "Son, I do, I certainly do."</p>
<p>God, my body<br /> Was born to serve.<br /> Do You believe it?<br /> "Son, I do, I certainly do.<br /> I also believe something<br /> More:<br /> Today you love,<br /> Today you serve;<br /> Tomorrow you will guide,<br /> Tomorrow you will lead."</p>
