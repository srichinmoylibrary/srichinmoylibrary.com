<p>Some blame you because you do not want them to remain where they are: inside pitch-dark caves. Others blame you for not wholeheartedly helping them run at their fastest dream-speed.</p>
<p>Those who do not want to budge an inch are fervently requested by you to move forward and bathe in the beauty and purity of tomorrow's dawn. Those who are over-eager but have no capacity to run the fastest along the world-progress-road, are compassionately and powerfully cautioned by you to stop indulging in meaningless fantasies.</p>  </div>
