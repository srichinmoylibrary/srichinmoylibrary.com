<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You should not imitate me. You should only try to sing very soulfully, devotedly and self-givingly. Always there should be real feeling, plus utmost simplicity, purity and serenity. Sometimes for various reasons, inner and outer, I sing in a different way, so I should not be imitated. When I play the esraj, most of the time I choose slow songs because for me they appeal more to the heart than fast songs. But occasionally people are falling asleep. At that time fast songs are needed to wake them up. Otherwise, most of the time slow songs touch the very depths of the aspiring heart more. From time to time one can play fast songs to give a kind of mental or vital thrill, but for the heart, usually slow songs are infinitely more effective. That does not mean that you will discard the fast songs. But while the seekers are in a meditative consciousness, it is better to sing slow songs.</p>  </div>
