<p>One of the palace dogs was hungry, so Birbal placed some food before him and Akbar did the same. The dog did not touch the food offered to him by the Minister, but he ate all the food given to him by the Emperor.</p>
<p>Akbar asked Birbal, "How is it that the dog did not touch your food, whereas he ate up all of my food?"</p>
<p>The Minister's reply was, "Your Majesty, you should know that even a dog wants to remain faithful to his caste!"</p>  </div>
