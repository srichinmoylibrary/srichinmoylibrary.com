  <h1 class="book-heading">Eagerness</h1>
  
 

<p>Eagerness is the purity of my life's tears.<br /> Eagerness is the beauty of my heart's smiles.<br /> Eagerness is my closeness to God the creation.<br /> Eagerness is my oneness with God the Creator.</p>
<p>My eagerness is my glorious privilege<br /> To see one step ahead, unlike others.<br /> My eagerness does not expect surprises,<br /> For my Captain has fully convinced me<br /> That He not only knows the Way<br /> But also has already planned everything for me.</p>
<p>From my Captain my eagerness has learned<br /> To see every second as the birth of a new day,<br /> And in it the complete life of a new year<br /> To please Him in His own Way.</p>
<p>My Captain says to me,<br /> "My child, because of your life's eagerness<br /> I am giving you My Eternity's Life.<br /> My child, because of your heart's eagerness<br /> I am giving you My Infinity's Heart.<br /> My child, you are your<br /> Aspiration-spontaneity-eagerness,<br /> And I am My<br /> Satisfaction-Immortality-Fondness."</p>

<div id="node-1073447" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">I am prepared</h1>
  
 

<p>My name is preparation, preparation-purity.<br /> My Captain, what is Your Name?<br /> "My Name is Compassion, Compassion-Beauty."<br /> My Captain, my body is prepared.<br /> "Then ask your body to wake up<br /> and look around<br /> And soulfully appreciate the beauty<br /> Of My fruitful creation."<br /> My Captain, my vital is prepared.<br /> "Then ask your vital<br /> To go to discipline-school to study<br /> And receive most glorious<br /> achievement-degrees."<br /> My Captain, my mind is prepared.<br /> "Then ask your mind to stop living<br /> In the fruitless thought-world,<br /> For I want your mind to swim<br /> In the sea of peace."<br /> My Captain, my heart is prepared.<br /> "Then ask your heart to sing every day<br /> A new oneness-song<br /> That will please My Transcendental Vision's<br /> Universal Life."<br /> My Captain, my soul is prepared.<br /> "Then ask your soul to come to Me immediately<br /> And occupy its secret and sacred seat<br /> In My Golden Boat<br /> Which is about to start<br /> Its birthless and deathless voyage."<br /> My Captain, finally, I am prepared.<br /> "Then at this very moment I declare<br /> You and I are Eternity's<br /> Earth-transformation-dreamers."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">If you have me first</h1>
  
 

<p>My Captain, I want success.<br /> "Then, My child, open your hands."<br /> My Captain, I want progress.<br /> "Then, My child, open your heart."<br /> My Captain, I want perfection.<br /> "Then, My child, open your life."<br /> Captain, my Captain, how is it that<br /> I am unable to open my hands?<br /> "I cannot tell you why,<br /> But I am extremely happy<br /> That you are unable to open your hands."<br /> Captain, my Captain, how is it that<br /> I am unable to open my heart?<br /> "I cannot tell you why,<br /> But I am extremely happy<br /> That you are unable to open your heart."<br /> Captain, my Captain, how is it that<br /> I am unable to open my life?<br /> "I cannot tell you why,<br /> But I am extremely happy<br /> That you are unable to open your life."<br /> My Captain, why are You so cruel to me?<br /> Do You not want my success?<br /> Do You not want my progress?<br /> Do You not want my perfection?<br /> "My child, I do want your success,<br /> I do want your progress<br /> And I do want your perfection.<br /> But you are such a fool<br /> That you want your success,<br /> Progress and perfection<br /> Without wanting Me first.<br /> Your success, progress and perfection<br /> Will never be able to give you real satisfaction<br /> Unless you have Me first in your life.<br /> "Your surrender-oneness-mind,<br /> Your surrender-oneness-heart,<br /> Your surrender-oneness-life to Me<br /> Can alone give you ceaseless joy,<br /> breathless joy<br /> And limitless joy.<br /> If you have Me first as your constant<br /> Oneness-Possession-Treasure,<br /> Then only will your success<br /> Be My Eternity's Seed,<br /> Your progress, My Infinity's Flower<br /> And your perfection, My Immortality's Fruit."<br /> My Captain, at Your Forgiveness-Feet I sit.<br /> To Your Compassion-Eye I bow.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">The secret to make you happy</h1>
  
 

<p>My Captain, do tell me the secret<br /> To make You happy.<br /> My Captain, there was a time<br /> When I was in the desire-world.<br /> Therefore, You were so sad.<br /> But now I am in the aspiration-world.<br /> Why are You so sad now?<br /> It seems that I will never be able<br /> To make You happy.<br /> "My child, while you were in the desire-world,<br /> You were a ferocious and all-devouring tiger.<br /> Therefore, it was impossible for Me<br /> To be pleased with you and remain happy.<br /> Although you now live in the aspiration-world,<br /> Your aspiration-life is as weak as a tiny ant.<br /> How can I be proud of you?<br /> How can I be happy?"<br /> My Captain,<br /> My desire-life created sadness for You.<br /> My aspiration-life is creating sadness for You.<br /> I do hope someday I shall realise You,<br /> And my realisation-life<br /> Will make You truly happy.<br /> "My child, it entirely depends<br /> On what kind of realisation you want.<br /> If you long for a realisation-drop<br /> And not a realisation-ocean,<br /> Then you will undoubtedly<br /> Make me once more unhappy.<br /> Right now your realisation-hour is a far cry.<br /> But since you are in your aspiration-life,<br /> Aspire and aspire for the highest height.<br /> Your achievement of your highest height<br /> Will eventually blossom<br /> Into an inseparable oneness-realisation<br /> With My Universal Life.<br /> "Forget your desire-life.<br /> Neglect not your aspiration-life.<br /> Inject your aspiration-life<br /> With your heart's promise-light<br /> So that at My choice Hour I can bless you<br /> For your realisation<br /> Most powerfully, most proudly and most happily<br /> With My Immortality's Satisfaction-Delight."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073450" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">How many times a day?</h1>
  
 

<p>Captain, please tell me how many times a day<br /> You think of me.<br /> "Once, My child."<br /> Alas, only once? You are so unkind to me!<br /> Captain, how many times a day<br /> Do You bless my heart<br /> With Your Love?<br /> "Once a month."<br /> Alas, alas, only once a month!<br /> Captain, You are so unkind to me!<br /> Captain, please tell me how many times a day<br /> You speak well of me to others.<br /> "Once in three months."<br /> Once in three months! Alas, alas, alas!<br /> Captain, Your dislike of me is unimaginable!<br /> Captain, why do You think of me<br /> Only once a day?<br /> "My child, what can I do?<br /> When I think of you,<br /> I see that you are thinking of the whole world<br /> And not of Me."<br /> Captain, why do You bless my heart<br /> With Your Love<br /> Only once a month?<br /> "My child, your heart is full of insincerity,<br /> Plus, you keep your heart's door<br /> Closed so often.<br /> Do you not realise<br /> That you give Me a shocking experience<br /> With your frequently closed heart?"<br /> Captain, why do You speak well of me<br /> to others<br /> Only once in three months?<br /> "My child, if I use My Justice-Light,<br /> Then I will not be able to speak well of you<br /> Even once a year.<br /> It is because to you I am<br /> My Heart's Compassion-Height<br /> That I speak well of you once<br /> in three months."<br /> But, Captain, I think of You every day<br /> More than once.<br /> I offer my heart's love to You every day<br /> More than once.<br /> I speak well of You<br /> More than once a day.<br /> "True, you think of Me every day<br /> With no sincerity at all.<br /> Be sincere in your thought!<br /> True, you offer your love to Me<br /> More than once a day,<br /> But your love has no soulful, devoted oneness.<br /> Be soulful in your love!<br /> True, you speak well of Me<br /> More than once a day,<br /> But I clearly see<br /> That there is no inner conviction<br /> In what you say to others about Me.<br /> In a very clever way<br /> You like to draw admiration from others<br /> By speaking well of Me.<br /> Be certain in your pronouncement!"<br /> Captain, that means I will never be able<br /> To please You.<br /> "Not true, My child. You can and you will."<br /> Captain, when?<br /> "From the day you start feeling<br /> That your life is the beauty of surrender<br /> And your heart is the purity of gratitude."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073451" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">When you take one step towards me</h1>
  
 

<p>Although I have an insincere mind,<br /> I frequently think of You, my Captain.<br /> Although I have an impure heart,<br /> I fearfully love You, my Captain.<br /> Although I have a complicated life,<br /> I hesitantly need You, my Captain.<br /> Please tell me what You actually think<br /> Of my insincere mind, impure heart<br /> And complicated life.<br /> "My child, when you use your insincere mind,<br /> Impure heart and complicated life,<br /> It is like taking one step towards Me.<br /> While you are taking one step towards Me,<br /> I go one step farther away.<br /> But if you ever use your sincere mind,<br /> Pure heart and simple life,<br /> Then I tell you,<br /> When you take one step towards Me,<br /> I take ninety-nine steps forward to meet you<br /> And give to your mind<br /> A beautiful Sincerity-Smile,<br /> To your heart,<br /> A powerful Purity-Embrace<br /> And to your life,<br /> A fruitful Simplicity-Oneness."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073452" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">You are my only friend</h1>
  
 

<p>Captain, my Captain,<br /> You are my Friend, my only Friend.<br /> Therefore, I depend on You for everything.<br /> I depend on You<br /> For the fulfilment of my human desire-life.<br /> I depend on You<br /> For the fulfilment of my divine<br /> aspiration-heart.<br /> Captain, my Captain,<br /> Am I Your friend?<br /> "My sweet child,<br /> You definitely are."<br /> Captain, my Captain,<br /> If so, do You ever depend on me<br /> For anything?<br /> "My sweet child,<br /> I depend on you only for one thing.<br /> I sleeplessly depend on<br /> Your heart's breathless oneness-love."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073453" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Do I have to give up everything?</h1>
  
 

<p>Captain, my Captain,<br /> Do I have to give up everything<br /> In order to claim You<br /> As my own, very own?<br /> "My sweet child,<br /> First claim Me as your own, very own.<br /> To your wide surprise<br /> You will discover<br /> That besides Me you have nothing<br /> of your own<br /> To give up,<br /> For your very existence-life<br /> Is My blessingful Possession.<br /> You will also discover<br /> That I am your Eternity's Dream-Boat,<br /> Plus, you are My Immortality's<br /> reality-passenger.<br /> Our destination is the Blue-Gold Shore<br /> Of My Infinity's Nectar-Delight."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073454" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">How far am I from realisation?</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Captain,<br /> How far am I from realisation?<br /> "First ask Me, My child,<br /> How far you are from aspiration."<br /> My Lord Captain,<br /> How far am I from aspiration?<br /> "First ask Me, My child,<br /> How far you are from purity."<br /> My Lord Captain,<br /> How far am I from purity?<br /> "First ask Me, My child,<br /> How far you are from sincerity."<br /> My Lord Captain,<br /> How far am I from sincerity?<br /> "First ask Me, My child,<br /> How far you are from simplicity."<br /> My Lord Captain,<br /> How far am I from simplicity?<br /> "My child, the distance between<br /> You and your simplicity<br /> Is exactly the same distance<br /> As between what you want<br /> And what you need."<br /> My Lord Captain,<br /> I know I want many, many things.<br /> But I do not know what I actually need.<br /> "My child, you need only one thing:<br /> You need Me and nothing else<br /> And nobody else.<br /> You also have to know what actually happens<br /> When you want something<br /> And you need something.<br /> When you want something,<br /> You want to be the possessor.<br /> When you need something,<br /> You want to be possessed.<br /> The day you want to be possessed by Me,<br /> Only by Me,<br /> Your realisation of Me,<br /> Your complete oneness with Me,<br /> Will be within your easy reach.<br /> So, My child, let Me be your possessor.<br /> You be My conscious and<br /> surrendered possession.<br /> Lo and behold,<br /> You have become your realisation-supreme."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073455" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Then you will please me</h1>
  
 

<p>My Compassion-flooded Captain,<br /> My spotty heart displeases You,<br /> My naughty mind displeases You,<br /> My haughty vital displeases You,<br /> My naughty life displeases You.<br /> Do I have anything that pleases You?<br /> "Yes, My sincerity-bathed child,<br /> Your soul's sleeplessly eager willingness<br /> Pleases Me.<br /> Try to be an awakened heart<br /> And a liberated life.<br /> Then you will please Me<br /> Far beyond your imagination."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Be brave within! be brave without!</h1>
  
 

<p>Captain, my Captain,<br /> My dear, sweet and compassionate Captain,<br /> Fifty-six years ago,<br /> out of Your infinite Bounty,<br /> You sent this soul into the world<br /> To unconditionally love You, serve You<br /> And please You in Your own Way.<br /> You alone know how far I have succeeded.<br /> Captain, my heart's Captain, my life's Captain,<br /> Today, on this most auspicious occasion<br /> In my life,<br /> I am begging You to grant me<br /> A very special Boon.<br /> Do grant me the capacity<br /> To please everybody on earth.<br /> "My stupid child,<br /> I have created this world.<br /> Since I do not have the capacity<br /> To please each and every human being<br /> on earth,<br /> How can I grant you this Boon?<br /> To please each and every human being<br /> Is an impossible task.<br /> I try to please each human being as far as I can.<br /> Then I leave it up to their fate.<br /> "Again, there are human beings<br /> Who are pleasing Me even far beyond<br /> Their own imagination.<br /> For them is My Vision-Eye,<br /> For them is My Compassion-Heart,<br /> For them is My Satisfaction-Divinity.<br /> From today on I am asking you<br /> To please only those who think and feel<br /> That to please Me in you<br /> Is their only duty, earthly and Heavenly.<br /> Do not waste even one moment<br /> Of your precious time on earth<br /> On those whom you have to please,<br /> Whose feet you have to touch at every moment<br /> To catch a glimpse of satisfaction-smile<br /> In their eyes.<br /> "Be brave within!<br /> Be brave without!<br /> This pilgrimage is only for the brave,<br /> Only for the few<br /> Who are supremely chosen instruments<br /> of Mine.<br /> Unfortunately, there are many<br /> Who want from you and from Me<br /> Nothing but attention.<br /> But what they need from you and Me<br /> Is the hunger for aspiration<br /> And the thirst for perfection.<br /> "My child, My Eternity's child,<br /> Your boat is sailing fast, very fast.<br /> Many, many, many more will join your boat<br /> On the way.<br /> And again, on the way,<br /> All those who become tired<br /> Will jump out of the boat on their own.<br /> You have no time to look into ignorance-sea<br /> To watch who is drowning.<br /> Your boat will never come empty.<br /> It will come at its full capacity<br /> And reach the Golden Shore,<br /> My Immortality's Heart-Abode."</p>
