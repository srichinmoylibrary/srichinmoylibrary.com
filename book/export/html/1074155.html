<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am the right person to answer this question! My muscles cannot go beyond the boundary of 14 inches for my biceps, and there are people here whose biceps are 15 or 16 inches. Some people have big muscles, but they do not have strength, while others have small muscles but enormous strength.</p>
<p>If you have big muscles, it gives you joy and you get more confidence. Again, if you know that you can lift up heavy weights, then your confidence is already established and you do not need big muscles.</p>
<p>In my case, you can say that grapes are sour! I tried to have big muscles. I told Mahasamrat Bill Pearl that I was going to make my biceps 15 inches. Recently he measured my arms and nothing had increased although I have taken so much exercise. So now I can say it is not necessary to have big muscles!</p>  </div>
