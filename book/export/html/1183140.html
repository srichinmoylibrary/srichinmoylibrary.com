<p>Do you know, daughter,<br /> Why God loves you?<br /> No, Father, I do not know.<br /> He loves you<br /> Because<br /> You are a good player of love-game.</p>
<p>Do you know, daughter,<br /> Why God is devoted to you?<br /> No, Father, I do not know.<br /> God is devoted to you<br /> Because<br /> You are a superb player of devotion-game.</p>
<p>Do you know, daughter,<br /> Why God has surrendered to you?<br /> No, Father, I do not know.<br /> God has surrendered to you<br /> Because<br /> You are an excellent player of surrender-light.</p>
