<p>God sees me<br /> Through His beams of Love;<br /> Therefore, He calls me<br /> His perfection-representative.<br /> Man sees me<br /> Through his whims of hatred;<br /> Therefore, he calls me<br /> His arch adversary.<br /> I see myself<br /> Through my heart's uncertainty-door;<br /> Therefore, I call myself<br /> A totally lost soul.</p>
