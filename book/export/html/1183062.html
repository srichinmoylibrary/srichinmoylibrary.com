<p>The husband and the wife were blessed with a child. They begged the Master to give him a name, and the Master gave them a broad smile. They thought that the smile indicated the Master’s consent and that in the near future the Master would give the child a spiritual name. Alas, they waited for a month, two, three, four, five months. Then they said to the Master, “How is it that you are not keeping your promise? You told us that you would give a spiritual name to our child.”</p>
<p>The Master said, “When did I say this? When and where?”</p>
<p>“You didn’t use words but your smile was more than enough to convince us that you did want to give him a name.”</p>
<p>The Master said, “Your intuition did not do justice to my smile. I shall not be able to give him a name.”</p>
<p>Both of them left, mad and furious. But the divine force, the Compassion of the Supreme, did not leave them. Therefore, inwardly they used to pray to the Master and there came a time when they returned to him. Then the Master immediately gave the child a name. In this way the Master lost and regained three disciples.</p>  </div>
