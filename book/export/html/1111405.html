<p>Yesterday I was running on the street facing Thomas Edison High School. A young black boy said to me, "Hi, Pop! Hi, Pop!" Then he said, "Hi, Shry! Hi, Shry! Don't get a heart attack." In this way he was asking me not to run. He added, "Your children are not here."</p>
<p>Then two teachers turned around and saw me. They stood aside and showed me much respect.</p>
