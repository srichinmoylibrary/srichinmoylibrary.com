<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We want to go from the finite to the Infinite. God is Infinite and just because He is Infinite, just because He is Omnipotent, He is also in the finite with us. When we stay on earth, we have the body which houses the soul. We should take religion or our path as our own body, as our own individual existence. Then when we go beyond the body and are one with the Infinite, at that time we don’t have to follow a path. But before that if we don’t follow a set path, then we will make no progress. Today it will be this path, tomorrow it will be that path.</p>  </div>
