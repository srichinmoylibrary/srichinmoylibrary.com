<p>Today, first I saw Nishtha the great, then Vidagdha the great. After I passed Vidagdha, I heard someone running towards me very fast. I said, "How can Vidagdha run so fast?" Then when I turned around, I saw it was Yasu.</p>
<p>After Yasu I saw Sundar. He was running so fast and making such noise with his legs; they were thundering!</p>
