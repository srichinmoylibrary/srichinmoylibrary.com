<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Crucifixion is not the answer. Illumination is the answer. Let us say that today my mind is very bad. It is doubting and creating so many problems. So I destroy my mind. Then tomorrow I may start having problems with my vital. My desiring vital may be desperately trying to strangle my aspiration. Therefore, I destroy my vital. The day after tomorrow I may see that my body is extremely lethargic. It does not want to get up in the morning; it wants to remain always asleep. So I destroy my body. In this way, if I go on destroying, I will have nothing left. I will have no mind, no vital, no body â€” nothing.</p>
<p>Destruction is not the answer. The answer is transformation. We have to transform and transcend. If my body is lethargic, I will compel my body to get up. If my vital is destructive, I will compel my vital to be dynamic. If my mind is doubting, I will compel my mind to have faith.</p>
<p>Always we have to take the positive side. Instead of destroying the lethargic body, we will make it active. The destructive vital we will try to make dynamic. And in the doubting mind we will instill faith, implicit faith. Instead of destroying anything, we will only illumine and transform it. We will replace lethargy with wakefulness, destruction with dynamism, doubt with faith.</p>
<p>God has sent us here to do some special work for Him. Everything that we have and everything that we are is imperfect, but God does not want us to destroy ourselves. He wants us to transform ourselves and become perfect. He has given us the message of perfection. If something in us is imperfect, then let us make that particular thing perfect. Only then will God be pleased with us. God created us not for destruction but for perfection, so that He can enjoy satisfaction in and through us.</p>  </div>
