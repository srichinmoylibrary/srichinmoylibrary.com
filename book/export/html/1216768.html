<p>When I first got to Scotland, I told the disciples my stories about not having a ballpoint. I told them how bad the British are and how good the Indians are. They all felt miserable. They said, "Those people were not disciples. What can you expect from them?"</p>
<p>After the last concert, the British disciples performed scenes from <em>The Son</em> for the other disciples. They brought down the actual atmosphere of the play — even the Christ's consciousness and Mary's consciousness. No other performers have done it so perfectly. The director was Charana. Their costumes were also excellent. At the end of the play I appreciated them like anything.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Charana presented me with a set of three silver ballpoints. He said, "We have heard your ballpoint stories, so we are presenting you with these."</p>
<p>Then I entered into a small room near the stage to speak with two disciples for a few minutes. When I left the room, I very nicely left the ballpoints in the room. Later I realised that I didn't have them, but I did not remember where I had left them. I said to myself, "The ballpoint story will never end! Fortunately, the disciples found them. They were not supposed to go into that room, but after I left they went there to see if I had left anything. The following day they brought the ballpoints to me.</p>
