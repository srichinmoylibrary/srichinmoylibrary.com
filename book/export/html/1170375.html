<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us say that somebody who is now twenty years old has teeming, countless desires. When he is sixty or seventy years old, he knows that these desires are not all going to be fulfilled. This does not mean that he will aspire for something higher. The road ends, but he doesnâ€™t necessarily walk along another road. There are many, many people on earth who start their lives with desires and, at the end, feel that only a few of their desires were fulfilled. But knowing this, they do not immediately change; they do not step onto the road of aspiration. So to lose ordinary desires does not mean that you are entering into the life of aspiration.</p>  </div>
