<p><em>The series of four lectures on the Gita which Sri Chinmoy offered at New York University in March 1970 were drawn from a series of eighteen talks covering each chapter of the Bhagavad Gita which he had given privately to his students between 13 February and 8 June 1968. The complete talks were published by Rudolf Steiner Publications in 1973 under the title Commentary on the Bhagavad Gita: The Song of the Transcendental Soul.</em></p>  </div>
