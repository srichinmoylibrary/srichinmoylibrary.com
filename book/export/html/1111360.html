<p>I started running in the Long Island Marathon at seventeen and a half miles. I was feeling sad and miserable because I had so much energy. People around me were so tired, and I felt so guilty because I was deceiving those people. There was a small hill, and I was going up so easily, because I had just started.Everybody else was dying. Of course, they did not know that I was only running a few miles with some of my disciples to inspire them.</p>
