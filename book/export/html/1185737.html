<p>Each aspiring life<br /> Is a Dream-Wave<br /> Of the Lord Supreme<br /> Which will eventually<br /> Break upon the blue-gold shore<br /> Of God's Vision-transformed Reality.</p>

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> How can I make lightning progress<br /> In my spiritual life?</p>

<p>Your division-mind may deceive<br /> My sleeping mind,<br /> But your oneness-heart can never deceive<br /> My searching mind<br /> Or my aspiring heart.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">117</h1>
  
 

<p>God loves me,<br /> But I do not have the time<br /> To love God.</p>
<p>God speaks to me,<br /> But I do not have the time<br /> To speak to God.</p>
<p>God knows who I am,<br /> But I do not have the time<br /> To know who I am,<br /> Whose I am<br /> Or why I am.</p>

<p>O my inner life,<br /> Do not weep for me,<br /> For I do not deserve it.</p>

<p>Something has to die immediately<br /> Inside my mind.<br /> Ah, I know what it is!<br /> It is my monster-ego.</p>
<p>Something has to blossom immediately<br /> Inside my life.<br /> Ah, I know what it is!<br /> It is my flower-heart.</p>

<div id="node-1185759" class="section-2">

<p>The lethargic body collapses -<br /> The aggressive vital follows.<br /> The impure mind collapses -<br /> The insecure heart follows.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185760" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">123</h1>
  
 

<p>Since the beginning of creation<br /> The soul and the heart<br /> Have been singing the same songs<br /> While traveling along<br /> Eternity's Road.<br /> The heart sings,<br /> "So much to do on earth,<br /> But where is the time?"<br /> The soul sings,<br /> "So much to do in Heaven,<br /> But where is the time?"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185761" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">124</h1>
  
 

<p>Your life of noise must love<br /> The Voice of God.<br /> Your life of noise must love<br /> The Life of God.<br /> If not, you are bound to see<br /> Your life unfinished,<br /> And therefore unrecognised<br /> Here on earth.</p>

<div id="node-1185762" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">125</h1>
  
 

<p>You were a thinker<br /> Of the past.<br /> You are a lover<br /> Of the present.<br /> You will be a fulfiller<br /> Of the future.</p>

<div id="node-1185763" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">126</h1>
  
 

<p>You are imperfect,<br /> But you can easily become perfect.<br /> You just need a head that bows,<br /> A heart that loves<br /> And a soul that dreams.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185764" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">127</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I would like to express<br /> My gratitude to You,<br /> But I am groping for words.</p>
<p>"My son,<br /> Do not waste your precious time<br /> Learning the art<br /> Of gratitude-expression.<br /> Just learn to tell Me<br /> Only one thing:<br /> That you are happy,<br /> Forever happy."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185765" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">128</h1>
  
 

<p>A crying heart and a smiling life<br /> Are the direct descendants<br /> Of God the Dreamer<br /> And God the Lover.</p>

<div id="node-1185766" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">129</h1>
  
 

<p>When I speak to you about God,<br /> You don't believe me.<br /> When you speak to me about God,<br /> I don't believe you.<br /> Therefore, what is the use<br /> Of our talking to each other<br /> About God?<br /> The best thing will be for us<br /> To pray for God to speak,<br /> For He is the only One<br /> Who can talk about Himself<br /> With inner Illumination<br /> And outer Compassion.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185767" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">130</h1>
  
 

<p>There is and there can be<br /> Only one age-old question:<br /> Can anyone realise God?</p>
<p>There is and there can be<br /> Only one answer:<br /> Yes, certainly,<br /> Anyone can realise God.<br /> Why?<br /> Because that is what God wants.<br /> How?<br /> By constantly singing<br /> The song of surrender<br /> On the summit-height<br /> Of one's own realisation-mountain.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185768" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">131</h1>
  
 

<p>Those who do not believe in God<br /> Are self-styled gods.<br /> Those who believe in God<br /> Are being moulded by God Himself<br /> To become exact replicas<br /> Of His Vision-Eye,<br /> Compassion-Heart<br /> And Satisfaction-Life.</p>

<div id="node-1185769" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">132</h1>
  
 

<p>He who prays unconditionally<br /> For God's transcendental Satisfaction<br /> And he who meditates unconditionally<br /> For God's universal Manifestation<br /> Is the God-man of tomorrow.</p>

<p>The line of those<br /> Who do not want to transcend<br /> Their earth-bound bondage-life<br /> Is endless.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185771" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">134</h1>
  
 

<p>A God-searching mind<br /> Does not know<br /> What outer frustration is.</p>
<p>A God-loving heart<br /> Does not know<br /> What inner stagnation is.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185772" class="section-2">

<p>Today I have made<br /> Two decisions:<br /> From now on<br /> I shall love God<br /> Consciously;<br /> From now on<br /> I shall obey my Lord Supreme<br /> Sleeplessly.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185773" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">136</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You know that I do not want<br /> To disappoint You.<br /> How is it then<br /> That You are not willing<br /> To appoint me<br /> To serve Your Feet,<br /> Love Your Heart<br /> And manifest Your Vision-Eye<br /> Here on earth?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185774" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">137</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You have given my heart<br /> The capacity to wait for You<br /> For Eternity.<br /> Will You not give my mind<br /> The capacity to wait for You<br /> Even for a fleeting second?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185775" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">138</h1>
  
 

<p>My soul-bird needs two wings,<br /> An aspiration-wing<br /> And a dedication-wing,<br /> To fly the highest<br /> In the firmament of Eternity's Peace,<br /> Infinity's Love<br /> And Immortality's Delight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185776" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">139</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Please tell me how I can stop<br /> Deceiving You.</p>
<p>"My sweet child,<br /> You can and will stop deceiving Me<br /> Only when you stop<br /> Deceiving yourself.<br /> You deceive yourself when you mix<br /> With those time-wasters<br /> And life-killers:<br /> Your unconscious body<br /> And your impure mind."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185777" class="section-2">

<p>God tells me that if I agree with Him<br /> At every moment,<br /> Then He will grant me<br /> His own Satisfaction-Love<br /> To use in His Eternal Now.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1185778" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">141</h1>
  
 

<p>If you can feel<br /> That your heart's inner cry<br /> Is the only thing you have,<br /> Then God will grant you<br /> The thing He treasures most<br /> In His own Life:<br /> Sweetest Oneness-Satisfaction.</p>

<p>If there is a tug-of-war<br /> Between your heart's faith<br /> And your mind's doubt,<br /> Which side will you join?<br /> Or will you be afraid<br /> To join either side,<br /> And embrace the life<br /> Of indifference?</p>

<p>Insincerity,<br /> I do not want to have you anymore.<br /> It is you who have carried me away<br /> From the Mind<br /> Of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Impurity,<br /> I do not want to have you anymore.<br /> It is you who have carried me away<br /> From the Heart<br /> Of my Beloved Supreme.</p>

<p>My worst enemy is not<br /> My hopeless unworthiness.<br /> My worst enemy is<br /> My constant unwillingness.</p>

<p>Your sweet Lord wants from you<br /> Only four things:<br /> Your regularity-drop,<br /> Your punctuality-flame,<br /> Your sincerity-cry<br /> And your spontaneity-smile.<br /> With these four invaluable treasures,<br /> You will be able to walk along<br /> The road of your perfection,<br /> And God will be able to walk along<br /> The road of His Satisfaction.</p>
