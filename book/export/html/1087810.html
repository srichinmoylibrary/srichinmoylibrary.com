<p>CHRISTOPHER: I have a dentist who is totally different from others.</p>
<p>RADHA: In what respect?</p>
<p>Christopher: He does not live from hand to mouth. He lives from head to mouth. He lectures from his head and eats with his hand. But other dentists put their hands into the patient's mouth and then put out their hands for money.</p>  </div>
