<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I will never dare to say that the Supreme wanted India to play <em>the</em> most significant role in world spirituality right from the dawn of civilisation; that is absurd. But India definitely was chosen by the Supreme to play <em>a</em> most significant role in the realm of spirituality right from the beginning. It was chosen to be one of the most spiritually aspiring countries. Right from the beginning the Supreme chose not only India, but five or six other countries as well, to realise, reveal and manifest His Divinity. Those supremely chosen countries are responding to the spiritual light much more than other countries.</p>  </div>
