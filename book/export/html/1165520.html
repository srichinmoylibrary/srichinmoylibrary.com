    <title>Question: On our birthdays, our consciousness seems much more rarified. Our access to your inner wealth and our inner wealth seems more intense. What actually happens in the inner world that allows us to be like that?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On your birthday the soul comes to the fore. On other days, the heart is not active and dynamic, the heart itself is sleeping. Inside the heart is the soul. When the soul gets the opportunity to come to the fore, the inner link that you have with God becomes strengthened. Therefore, you feel that something very special is happening. This intensity is very good. You just have to remember that something special is happening. What is happening you may not know and God may not want you to know, but your soul is definitely coming to the fore with all its dreams for God-manifestation.</p>  </div>
