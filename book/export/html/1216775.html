<p>On the plane everyone got a souvenir ballpoint saying that they had been on the Concorde. They said that anyone who wanted could come up for a certificate. A few ladies went up to get one. When the last lady went up, the certificates were all used up. The stewardess apologised and said to her, "Hope to see you again."</p>
<p>The lady replied, "I can't afford to see you again."</p>
<p>Right from the beginning of the ride, the flight attendants came and asked, "Do you want anything?" They meant well, but they didn't have enough people to give us excellent service. They should have more attendants helping.</p>
