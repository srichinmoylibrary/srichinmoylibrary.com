<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is everywhere. But when we talk about God in the sky or on top of a mountain, He seems more distant than when we talk about God in our own heart. We get the most intimate feeling when we think of our heart. Even when we are thinking of our own body, we get much more joy when we think of the heart than when we think of our fingers or hands or nose. From the heart we get the dearest feeling. Why? Because God is much more manifested inside the heart than elsewhere in our being. God is inside bad people and He is also inside good people. But I only want to mix with saints and good people and not bad people, because God is more manifested in good people. Similarly, God is everywhere in the body, but God's Presence can be felt most convincingly and powerfully inside the heart.</p>
<p>So when I speak of the Inner Pilot, I mean God who is inside the heart. He is also inside the sky, a mountain, everywhere. But I get the most joy when I think of Him and feel Him inside my own heart as my Inner Pilot guiding me through life. Those who pray and meditate are conscious of His Presence.</p>  </div>
