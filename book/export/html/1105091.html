<p>My Lord,<br /> When I pray, it is all wrong.<br /> When I meditate, it is all wrong.<br /> When I serve, it is all wrong.<br /> My Lord, what can I do?<br /> “My child,<br /> Before you pray,<br /> Ask Me to pray in and through you.<br /> Before you meditate,<br /> Ask Me to meditate in and through you.<br /> Before you serve,<br /> Ask Me to serve in and through you.<br /> Give Me the full responsibility.<br /> You just be the witness.<br /> Watch Me, what I do and how I do it.”</p>
