<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The colour silver does have a special significance which is applicable in any field. It means purity. When one sees this colour during meditation, one has to know that he has achieved tremendous progress in his life in terms of purity. When you see the colour silver, at that time you have to feel that your mind is becoming pure, your vital is becoming pure, your body-consciousness is becoming pure. Silver is purity. This also applies to the colour silver in art.</p>  </div>
