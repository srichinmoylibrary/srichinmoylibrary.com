<p>Our second Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was simplicity incarnate and heart's magnanimity incarnate. From his appearance, nobody could tell that he was a great leader. Only people who were around him and knew him well, or those who were in the political world, could recognise who he was.</p>
<p>One day he was working in his garden. He was wearing very, very simple gardening clothes. A few middle-aged men came up to him and said, "Can you tell us where the chief is?"</p>
<p>He said, "Yes, I can. Just wait. I will call him." Then he went into the house, washed his hands, put on a panjabi and dhoti and came out and stood in front of them.</p>
<p>Some of them bowed down; some were shocked. Some felt miserable. "Oh, we thought you were just the gardener," they said.</p>  </div>
