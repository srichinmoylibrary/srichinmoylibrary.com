<h2>Question: How can one discover oneâ€™s mantra?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one has a spiritual Master, then he should get the mantra from his Master directly. If he does not have a Master, then he has to go deep within in order to discover the best mantra for him. But in the meantime he can chant <em>AUM</em>. <em>AUM</em> is the mother of all mantras. Its divine power is very great.</p>  </div>
