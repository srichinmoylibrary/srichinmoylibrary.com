<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You don't have to memorise with the heart. Just become one with the heart. When you become one with the heart, at that time you are the heart. Then try to become one with the subject that you are studying. Your oneness, your heart's oneness with the subject, is bound to bring to the fore the essence and the substance of the subject. And when both the essence and the substance are brought to the fore, automatically you will be in a position to memorise the thing.</p>  </div>
