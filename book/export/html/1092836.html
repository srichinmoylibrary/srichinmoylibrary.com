<p>In 1940 Tagore requested an interview with Subhas. In spite of his deepest love, deepest admiration and deepest respect for Tagore, it took Subhas two long months to offer him an interview, for Subhas had been inundated with myriad activities since resigning the Presidency in April 1939.</p>
<p>Finally, on 2 July, Tagore came and met with him in Calcutta for about two hours. Afterwards, Tagore left for Santiniketan, only to hear on his return that Subhas had been arrested-just three fleeting hours after the interview had taken place. It was to be his eleventh and last imprisonment.</p>
<p>Since Subhas Chandra's arrest was ill-founded, he challenged the authorities. On 29 November he announced that he would fast until death embraced him. After one week, the authorities took him seriously, removed him from jail and placed him under home-internment. It was from there that Subhas escaped and made his sad and glad exit from his Mother India's shores. His body could not return, but his entire inner being returned and became the supremely beloved child of Mother India.</p>  </div>
