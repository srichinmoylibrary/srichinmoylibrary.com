<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is the Owner and Creator of the universe, and the Creator and His creation are inseparable. In the ordinary world, the creator or owner of a thing can pick it up or put it down; he can keep it or give it away. But, in the case of God and the universe, it is not like that. If you look at God, you will see the universe inside Him. And, if you look at the universe with your spiritual eye, your third eye, immediately you will see God inside it. Human possession comes and goes. Today you have millions of dollars; tomorrow you may be an absolute beggar. But in God's case, the Possessor and the possession can never be separated.</p>
