<blockquote>
<p>"He is verily a blazing fire!"</p>
<p>— Sri Ramakrishna</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have travelled far in different parts of the globe, but nowhere could I meet a great soul like Nag Mahashay."</p>
<p>— Swami Vivekananda</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Only by seeing Nag Mahashay can one understand to what spiritual height a man can attain through the Grace of our Lord. In self-control and renunciation he is by far our superior."</p>
<p>— Swami Vivekananda</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is due to the appearance of such great souls that spirituality is still present in India. Blessed indeed is Nag Mahashay."</p>
<p>— Swami Brahmananda</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"By constant beating, Nag Mahashay had the head of his ego completely broken. It was unable to raise its hood anymore."</p>
<p>— Girish Chandra Ghosh</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"If a man be sincere and if really all idea of egotism has vanished from him, he attains to the state of Nag Mahashay. The earth becomes consecrated by the very touch of the feet of such great men."</p>
<p>— Girish Chandra Ghosh</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mahamaya fell into a great difficulty in trying to ensnare two persons: Naren and Nag Mahashay. As She tried to capture Naren, he became bigger and bigger and at last so big that all Her fetters fell short and She had to give up Her task as hopeless. And when She attempted Her trick on Nag Mahashay, he began to make himself smaller and smaller and at last reduced himself to such a degree of smallness that he easily escaped through the meshes of Her snares."/</p>
<p>— Girish Chandra Ghosh</p>
