<p>I was outside walking up and down my street. Radha, the little girl who lives two doors down from me, came up to me and said, "Guru, will you be walking for a long time?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>She said, "I will ride my bicycle with you."</p>
<p>She rode alongside me for about a mile. She was talking and talking, and I was meditating. Finally she said, "Guru, you are not in the mood to talk!"</p>
<p>I smiled at her.</p>
<p>Then Radha's sister introduced me to their father. We both smiled at each other. We didn't know how to talk.</p>
