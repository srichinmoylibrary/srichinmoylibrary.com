<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All religions claim one essential Truth and that Truth is their union with God. But in the field of manifestation one says: "If you do this, you will realise God." But in the last analysis we are teaching one and the same thing. All roads lead to Rome but you follow one road and I will follow another road. Yet when we reach the goal, this will be Rome. There exists only one goal that is Truth, but this goal is expressed and at the same time is sought in different forms.</p>  </div>
