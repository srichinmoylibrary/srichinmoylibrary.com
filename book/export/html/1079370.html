<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. An electric shock or thrill is a kind of spiritual experience. You have brought down some dynamic light into your system, and this dynamic light is operating inside you. But this is not a form of meditation: It is the result or after-effect of a meditation.</p>  </div>
