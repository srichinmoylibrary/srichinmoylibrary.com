<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ghosts are dissatisfied vital beings. The soul is not a vital being. A dissatisfied vital being takes the form of a ghost. The soul is all-loving, all-knowing. It will never play the role of a ghost. The soul comes for illumination and perfection. It is absurd to say that the soul would take the form of a ghost.</p>  </div>
