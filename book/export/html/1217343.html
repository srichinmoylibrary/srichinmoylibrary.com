    <title>Sri Chinmoy, in the Hindu tradition one speaks of how &lt;em&gt;Atman&lt;/em&gt; equals / Brahman/ — the individual soul equals the Universal Soul. Jesus Christ once said, &amp;quot;I and my Father are one.&amp;quot; These two statements, coming from two different spiritual backgrounds — are they, in the spiritual light, one and the same?</title>

<p>It is the same statement. <em>Atman</em> and <em>Paramatman</em> are the individual soul and the Supreme Self. God comes down into the manifestation and takes the form of the individual soul, <em>Atman</em>. Then the individual soul in the process of its evolution reaches and becomes the Supreme Self, <em>Paramatman</em>. To fulfil Himself integrally and wholly in the material world, God needs the individual soul.</p>
<p>The statements are the same. When Christ said, "I and my Father are one", it was like saying that <em>Atman</em> and <em>Paramatman</em> are one. That is why in India we say <em>Atmanam Viddhi</em>, "Know Thyself." If you know yourself, then you know God, because in essence there is no difference between you and God. Self-realisation is God-realisation and God-realisation is Self-realisation. For this reason in India we also say <em>Soham asmi</em>, "He am I", and <em>Aham Brahma</em>, "I am Brahman." In the same vein, all the esoteric traditions have always maintained that true knowledge is found by seeking within. This is why Jesus said, "The Kingdom of Heaven is within you."</p>  </div>
