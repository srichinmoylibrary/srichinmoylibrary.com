<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is always advisable to become both the best of silence and the best of sound all at once. We have to know what is meant by "the best of silence" and "the best of sound." The best of silence means our highest Height, the ever-transcending Height. The best of sound means God-manifestation in and through us, constantly, consciously and unconditionally.</p>  </div>
