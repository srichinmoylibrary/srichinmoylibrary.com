<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can maintain inner tranquillity no matter what happens in his office or how many wrong forces from the office try to assail him. He can do this provided he feels that the forces which are attacking him are in no way a match for his love of Light.</p>
<p>Let us take an attack as a force of darkness. When you are in the office you are constantly attacked by the force of doubt, which is the representative of darkness. If you feel that you have nothing to break these forces, then you are totally lost. You have to feel that inside your heart there is something called Light — boundless Light — and that this boundless luminosity is definitely more powerful than the attacker. This Light that you have inside you can easily transform these forces. When darkness consciously or unconsciously enters into Light, it is bound to be transformed. You will be able to feel this just because you pray, just because you meditate, just because you want to increase your love of God every day, every hour, every minute, every second. Each second you are aware of God's Presence inside your heart, so you can rest assured that you definitely embody Light and that this Light is constantly increasing in you. And if you see a constant increase of divine Light inside your heart, that means there is something immortal inside you which will never surrender to the wrong forces.</p>
<p>The wrong forces are coming from outside; and inside, the strongest force, the mightiest force, is Light. When you can bring your mightiest force, Light, to the fore, then you will see to your great astonishment that the outer forces immediately will give way, because the inner force is in constant communication with the Source, the Almighty Absolute. So the more you can increase your inner Light, which is the divine force, the sooner you will see that the outer wrong forces which are attacking you will be transformed into Light. When darkness consciously or unconsciously enters into Light, it is bound to be transformed.</p>  </div>
