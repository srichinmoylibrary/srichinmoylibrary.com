<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many good beings in the inner world. If you have access to the good beings, then definitely they will be able to help you and guide you to God-discovery and God-realisation. But again, there are some inner beings that may not be spiritual at all. Sometimes they pretend to be spiritual, like false teachers, and if the seeker depends on them and listens to their dictates, he can make serious blunders. But if the seeker has someone in the inner world who is guiding him and really taking him to God-realisation, then he is very fortunate. It depends on the being that he is in touch with.</p>  </div>
