  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Do children see more beauty than grown-ups do?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, children always see more beauty than grown-ups do. Because of their tremendous inner purity they see beauty in everything. Even in ink they see beauty; even in darkness they see beauty and light. When they see beauty in everything, we have to appreciate and admire them because they are still in the world of the soul. Because children remain more in the heart and the soul than adults do, they see more beauty. When the mind is developed, this undivine mind immediately tries to see impurity even in light, even in wisdom, even in something progressive. The human mind gets satisfaction by seeing ugliness and impurity even in things that are really beautiful and good. If an artist has created something, the mind immediately tries to find some error in it. But a child does not use the mind. He takes everything as his very own, so he sees beauty in everyone and in everything. He feels that there is nothing which is absolutely undivine, and this is perfectly true. There is nothing absolutely undivine, but some things have more light in comparison with other things. In the inner world everything is beautiful; but again, there can be a comparison made.</p>  </div>
