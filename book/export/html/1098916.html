<p>The funniest thing was that a young girl, fatter than the fattest, used to sit on the threshold of this apartment building and she would not allow people to cross. I had to take three trains to come home from Manhattan at night and then absolutely plead with this girl to let me in. I was not the only one she did not allow to enter. And she did not even live in our building! How fat she was. Perhaps she had a disease. I never saw her eat anything but at home, God knows what she ate!</p>  </div>
