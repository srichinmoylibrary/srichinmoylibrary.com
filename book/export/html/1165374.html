<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The action that makes your heart larger is good. When you do something and get inner joy, you feel that something is expanding. It is your consciousness. Like a bird you are spreading your wings. The action that enlarges your consciousness is right action. The action that binds you is wrong action. Always feel that anything that enlarges you is right and anything that binds you is wrong.</p>  </div>
