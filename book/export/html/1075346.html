<p>Why is she chosen?<br /> She is chosen<br /> Because<br /> She cries and cries<br /> In her heart.</p>
<p>Why is he chosen?<br /> He is chosen<br /> Because<br /> He dares and dares<br /> In his mind.</p>
<p>Why is she chosen?<br /> She is chosen<br /> Because<br /> She knows what surrender is.</p>
<p>Why is he chosen?<br /> He is chosen<br /> Because<br /> He knows what service is.</p>
