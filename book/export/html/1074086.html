<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Being a spiritual man, I always try to be far above criticism and controversies. It is infinitely easier to criticise others than to appreciate them. Our Creator is all Love. No critic can perfect us. It is God alone who can perfect us. Therefore, to obtain perfection, we must look to God and not to the critics.</p>
<p>I am a musician; I am an artist. I listen to the dictates of my inner musician and inner artist, and I do not pay any attention to criticism and controversies.</p>  </div>
