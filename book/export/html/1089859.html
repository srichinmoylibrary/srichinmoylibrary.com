<p>When human-realisation fails and disappoints us, God-realisation becomes a reality. Before that, human-realisation is all reality and God-realisation is unreality for us. God-realisation comes when we feel that God is the only person in Heaven and earth who cannot disappoint us.</p>
<p>For God-realisation, what we need is outer strength and inner strength. Outer strength we shall use to see God in everything. Inner strength we shall use to feel that we are destined to reach our goal. The moment we feel that God-realisation is our birthright, God-realisation can no longer remain a far cry. We have to feel that we have been chosen to realise God in this incarnation. If we can grow into this reality, God-realisation will soon be ours.</p>  </div>
