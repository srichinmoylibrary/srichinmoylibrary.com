<p>This morning I ran eleven miles in the Father's Day Marathon around the Jamaica High School Track. When the race started, I waited until the last person was 30 metres ahead and then I started. The first person I passed was Chameli. As I passed her, I greeted her. Like that, I greeted many. I was getting such joy by competing with Anupadi. I passed her and greeted her seven or eight times. Many times I was looking at Anupadi's strides.</p>
