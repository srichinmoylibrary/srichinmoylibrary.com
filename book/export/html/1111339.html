<p>Yesterday, at two o'clock in the morning in Queens I was walking very fast. Six cars — not one, but six — were bothering me like anything. They were driven by young boys, blacks and Puerto Ricans. They were going against the light and going the wrong way down a one-way street. They were screaming and doing all kinds of absurd things.</p>
<p>Then they drove onto the sidewalk to bother me. So I tried to get the license numbers. Then they got frightened and said, "Sorry, sorry, we won't do it anymore."</p>
