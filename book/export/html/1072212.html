<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Indeed, meditation is a vague word. We use it in season and out of season. What does meditation mean? Meditation means the language of our inner life and the language of God. It is through meditation that we can commune with God. It is through meditation that we can see God face-to-face. It is through meditation that we can know that God is both with form and without form.</p>
<p>Each person has to have a meditation of his own. He has to get it from the inmost recesses of his heart or from a spiritual teacher. In this university you have many teachers and each one is competent to teach you a particular subject. In the same way, if you want to launch into the inner life of aspiration, the life of the soul, then you will need a teacher who can teach you to concentrate, meditate and contemplate. Until you get a teacher, you may not be sure what message your inner voice is giving you.</p>
<p>You can start by reading scriptures and spiritual books. These books will instruct you how to discipline your life to some extent. But if you want to go to the end of the road and reach your inner Goal, then you need true meditation.</p>  </div>
