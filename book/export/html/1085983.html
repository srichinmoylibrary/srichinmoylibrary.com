<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The purpose of the soundless sound is God-revelation and God-manifestation. It embodies God all the time, but it has to reveal and manifest Him. It has reached its first goal, but the second and third goals are not yet reached. Revelation is the second goal and manifestation the third and ultimate Goal. But there is no end even to this ultimate Goal. You can say that it has reached something but it has not yet stopped reaching something else. When we aspire we realise something. But our aspiration does not end; on the contrary, it only begins again for a higher realisation. So, to come back to your question, the main purpose of the soundless sound is God-manifestation in God's own way at God's choice Hour.</p>  </div>
