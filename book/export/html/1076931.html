<p>Now look, this child of yours in the bedroom cries for food. You are in the kitchen, but you run when you hear the cry of your child. The child may be anywhere, but why do you come running from the kitchen? Because you have heard his cry. We are God's children and when He hears our cry, He comes to us. He comes to help us. He cherishes us because we are helpless and because we need Him. When we have a true need and when we cry most sincerely, God will certainly come. He will give you compassion, strength and the power to forgive and love the person who hurt you. God will change that person because when you yourself change, the other person is changed, also.</p>  </div>
