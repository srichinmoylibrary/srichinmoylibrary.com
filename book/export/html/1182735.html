<p>To become a perfect instrument<br /> Of your Beloved Supreme<br /> You need only two things from Him daily.<br /> During the day<br /> You need His Compassion<br /> So that in the battlefield of life<br /> Your searching mind can succeed<br /> And your crying heart can proceed.<br /> During the night<br /> You need His Forgiveness<br /> Because unconsciously, if not consciously,<br /> You make friends with ignorance-sleep.</p>
