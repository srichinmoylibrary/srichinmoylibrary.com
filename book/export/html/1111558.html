  <h1 class="book-heading">Praying for leg cramps</h1>
  
 
<p>When I was running my last six miles during the twenty-four-hour race, I was going ahead of everyone, no matter which runner I came near. But I said to myself, "O God, some of them have run almost a hundred miles and I have run only twenty-two."</p>
<p>At one point I was behind Yasu. Poor fellow, he was holding his left leg, the hamstring. He was getting cramps. I prayed to God to give the cramp to me immediately, but God didn't listen to my prayer. My prayer was sincere. I said, "Let me suffer and let him go." He was only one metre ahead of me. I felt miserable, but God didn't listen to my prayer. So I went on.</p>
