<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can read spiritual writings, chant, or learn spiritual songs. Singing is also a form of meditation. Nobody is going to laugh at your voice when you're alone at home. There will be only you and the Supreme to observe. You can also do japa, repeating 'AUM' or 'Supreme' or your own spiritual name. If you read my writings, sing spiritual songs and do japa, that is an extension of your meditation. But do not go back to sleep unless it is absolutely necessary for your health. If you do, you are just entering voluntarily into the arms of death.</p>  </div>
