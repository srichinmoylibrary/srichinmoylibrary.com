<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the whole universe, in all of Godâ€™s creation, man is unique because next to man is total perfection, complete unveiling consciousness. Man is unique because he has the absolute potentiality to realise God, and when we realise God, who can be superior?</p>
<p>There are thousands of cosmic gods. If I get a headache, and if I pray to a certain cosmic god, that god will take away my headache. If I get a stomach ache, I have to pray to a different god. But these gods are not superior to me. They are all supernatural entities in the vital world with capacities higher than those of ordinary men. These beings are usually good, but they are all finished products. They do not make any progress because they do not care to enter into the world for the transformation of their nature.</p>  </div>
