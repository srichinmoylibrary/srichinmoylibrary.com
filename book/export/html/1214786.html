<p>The human mind, like the wind, is uncontrollable. By virtue of scientific development, we have discovered the ways and means of controlling the restless wind to a considerable degree. But alas, control of the human mind is still a far cry to millions and billions. It just baffles human understanding</p>
<p>But U Thant was endowed with preternatural qualities. He was adept in the divine art of controlling the mind. Therefore, with aplomb and purity in his heart he was able to throw himself into the tornado of world-activities while maintaining silence soulful and fruitful.</p>  </div>
