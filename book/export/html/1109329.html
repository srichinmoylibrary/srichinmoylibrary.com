<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The world is evolving and progressing. Once upon a time we were all animals, but from the animal kingdom we entered into the human kingdom. Human beings are more perfect than animals, although we are still half-animals. But one day we will become perfect. Likewise, those souls still in the animal kingdom will also someday take human incarnation, and eventually perfection will dawn for them, too.</p>  </div>
