<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. From my music they get a force. I haven't done anything outwardly in the music world, but they are receiving something from my music; and what they receive they are manifesting in their own music. My music is for the very limited, the few disciples who will appreciate everything I do just because it is I who have done it. I don't play one piece of music correctly; all the notes are wrong. When actual musicians appreciate my music, it is because they truly love me. They do not only hear my music; they also feel my presence in it.</p>  </div>
