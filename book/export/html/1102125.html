<p>"My Lord, You know that I am a victim to constant doubt. Please tell me if You ever have any occasion to doubt Yourself."</p>
<p>"My sweetest child, only once did I have the occasion to doubt Myself in the course of My endless Life."</p>
<p>"My Lord, only once! When?"</p>
<p>"My child, it was the time when I created My creation and saw it becoming totally attached to Me. I am the Creator, eternal, free and detached. How could My own creation be attached, totally attached and bound? Believe Me, My child, I could not account for it. I had to doubt My own capacity."</p>
<p>"My Lord, forgive me. I can't agree with You. You have created me. I am Your creation. How can I live without being attached to You?"</p>
<p>"My child, I don't want you to be attached to Me, but I want you to be devoted to Me."</p>
<p>"My Lord, what is the difference?"</p>
<p>"My child, the difference is this. Attachment is frustration, and frustration is destruction. Devotion is wisdom-light, and wisdom-light is realisation-height."</p>
