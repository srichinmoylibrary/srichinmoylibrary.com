<p>I was at the Indian market in Lima for such a long time. The shopkeepers would say one price and I would say another.</p>
<p>Savyasachi has more compassion than I do. I wanted to buy something, but I could not get the price I wanted. So I went away without buying it. But Savyasachi thought I liked it, so he went back and got it for me.</p>
