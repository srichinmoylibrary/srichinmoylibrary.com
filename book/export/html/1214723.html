<p>Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Queen of India’s heart and veerless pilot of India, expressed her strong support and admiration for U Thant in an address to the United Nations General Assembly on 14 October 1968. Speaking of U Thant’s miraculous perseverance, she said: “I should like to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General. Where others might have been overwhelmed by heartbreak, U Thant has persevered, undaunted, in his great work with rare faith, devotion and detachment. It is up to all of us to give him our fullest support.”</p>  </div>
