<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Concern is a most complicated word. Sometimes we say that we have concern about someone, but it may not be real concern. It is concern when you are offering something for the sake of love, for the sake of God, when you are showing oneness with mankind. If God is the bridge between two individuals, then God must unite the two of you. Then it is real concern. If God unites an individual to the world at large then there is concern. But if God is out of the picture when you want to do something for somebody, then it is all attachment, because one is trying to possess the other.</p>  </div>
