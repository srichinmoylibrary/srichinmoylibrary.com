<p>Mahatma Gandhi was a saint who expressed his love in a patriotic way. A saintly patriot need not be a great spiritual Master. According to the spiritual Masters, Mahatma Gandhi was not an authority on the inner life or the spiritual life; he was an authority on what was decent, proper and necessary in Indian social life and Indian politics. He was a very great man and a very great soul. His illumining vision was much higher and wider than that of his fellow men. He showed his heart's deepest compassion and oneness for the simple Indian villagers who were downtrodden and neglected. He offered his whole life to help raise the condition of the Indian masses.</p>
<p>I have a great admiration for his complete identification with the Indian people in our India's Independence movement.</p>  </div>
