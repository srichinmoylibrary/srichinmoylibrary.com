<p>I need Forgiveness from God. But alas, where are my faith-blossoms, where?</p>
<p>I need Compassion from God. But alas, where is my aspiration-heart, where?</p>
<p>I need Love from God. But alas, where is my oneness-world, where?</p>
<p>I need Affection from God. But alas, where is my surrender-life, where?</p>
<p>I need Peace from God. But alas, where is my silence-mind, where?</p>
<p>I need Encouragement from God. But alas, where is my intensity-eagerness, where?</p>
<p>I need Concern from God. But alas, where is my readiness-response, where?</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, I have now come to realise that I have not pleased You in any way at any time. I feel that mine is a hopeless case.</p>
<p>"No, My child, yours is not a hopeless case, no!"</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, do tell me what I must do.</p>
<p>"My child, purify your heart, simplify your mind, energise your vital and awaken your body-consciousness. My child, do not allow yourself to be struck down by stupidity any anymore. Do not allow yourself to enjoy ignorance-sleep anymore. Do not allow yourself to be paralysed by self-doubt â€” no, never! Do not allow your mind to remain inside the dark cave within you. Do not offer even an iota of affection to your insecurity. Be a constant prayer-cry and a constant meditation-illumination."</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, I do not know how to pray. I do not know how to meditate. Is there any way You can teach me how to pray and how to meditate? Is there any way You can shorten the distance to my destination? Is there any way you can expedite my spiritual journey?</p>
<p>My child, I am telling you the supreme secret: cry like a child, sleeplessly cry; and smile like a child, sleeplessly smile. If you can cry sleeplessly for My Compassion-Eye, then you will learn how to pray. If you can smile sleeplessly inside My Satisfaction-Heart, I shall teach you how to meditate. Only cry and smile, smile and cry, My child!"</p>
