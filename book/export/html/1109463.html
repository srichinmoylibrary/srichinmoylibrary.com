<p>In the realm of spirituality, this truth was fully manifested in the life of Swami Vivekananda. His was the heart that pined to realise the lofty Truth, and he did it. But about his actions, we can say that they were democratic; that is, his actions were for the good of humanity at large.</p>  </div>
