<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we have no humility, whatever path we follow, all effort will be useless. Some aspirants, new ones particularly, have no humility at all. But those who come to meditate with arrogance and who feel that they know everything, would be better off staying at home. No matter what we have in the outer life — whether material wealth, mental brilliance or physical power — all these treasures are nothing, absolutely nothing, in comparison to the inner spiritual wealth.</p>
<p>If we receive even an iota of inner peace or bliss, we will feel that life on earth is fulfilling. Whatever else we have or we are is absolutely worthless in God’s Eye. Only if mental brilliance, material wealth and physical power are placed in the service of the Divine do they become meaningful. The divine light gives them a new life. Without spiritual wealth, outer wealth is totally useless.</p>
<p>So let us be very humble in our spiritual life and give utmost importance to the spiritual treasures: purity, love, devotion and surrender. Only when we have these can our outer wealth and power be utilised in a divine way.</p>  </div>
