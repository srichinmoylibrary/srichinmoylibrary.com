<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are sitting in the park or on the bus and you see someone. He is not paying any attention to you but you are getting such good vibrations from him. Again, somebody who is dressed up well and is a perfect gentleman may not be giving you good vibrations. But soul's affinity is one thing and soul's standard is something else. You are an expert at your standard, and somebody else is an expert in his standard. So two experts have met together at one place. But soul's affinity is not the same thing. Two persons of different standards may have a soul's affinity. A spiritual Master may have a soul's affinity with a very undeveloped soul.</p>  </div>
