<p>In Milan the audience showed me utmost devotion. After each instrument they clapped and clapped. After the girls sang, they also clapped. It was sincere appreciation.</p>
<p>Afterwards, four hundred seekers came onto the stage to pick up a flower petal. With such devotion they picked it up, and with such sincere and loving devotion they passed by me. Many were folding their hands, and some knelt down and gave me sweets or flowers.</p>
<p>I had quite a good experience in Milan. But the performance was absolutely useless because the acoustics were so bad. It was not Dhanu's fault at all. Everything that could possibly go wrong did go wrong. Also, it was raining cats and dogs outside. But the seekers' sincere oneness with my aspiration-heart saved me! Their aspiration and devotion turned that night of frustration into a day of satisfaction.</p>
