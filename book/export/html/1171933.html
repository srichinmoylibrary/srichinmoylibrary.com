SCS 98-107. Questions and answers following /What does it mean to be spiritual?/</p>
<h2>Question: What is the difference between spiritualism and spirituality?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spiritualism includes mediums and seances and all this. But in spirituality, true spirituality and Yoga, we only think of God, meditate on God and love God; we try to transform and divinise our own nature. Real spiritual people will get boundless Peace, Joy, Love and Bliss from within. But those who practise spiritualism and are deeply involved in the so-called spirit-worlds will never get these qualities.</p>  </div>
