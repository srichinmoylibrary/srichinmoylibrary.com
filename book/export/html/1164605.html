<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If it comes from the heart, easily you will know because it will be so convincing. The mind will not come and interfere. Suppose you have receive a message and you carry it out. If you feel, "Only if I get success from this message will I know it was correct," then you will know that it comes from the mind. But if you feel that you have got an inner message and you will execute it whether it is successful or not, then that message is most assuredly coming from the heart.</p>  </div>
