<p>The Holy Father, who represents the Saviour Christ's spirituality on earth, appreciates and admires President Gorbachev thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I follow with great interest the process of renewal which you have set in motion in the Soviet Union. I wish you success and declare myself ready to support every initiative that will better protect and integrate the rights and duties of individuals and peoples, so that peace may be insured in Europe and the world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, spirituality has its distinct role in President Gorbachev's life.</p>
<p>Him to quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Today our main joy is to lift the individual spiritually, respecting his inner world and giving him moral strength."</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
