<p>The Lord Beloved Absolute Supreme, out of His infinite Bounty, has created thousands of soul-stirring, heart-elevating and life-awakening mantras in English in and through your Master.</p>
<p>There was a time when my ignorance-ocean thought that mantras, incantations, could be written only in Sanskrit. Ignorance vast was my name. Then wisdom dawned on me when I read and studied Sri Aurobindo's <em>Savitri</em>. At that time, I came to realise that mantras can be created in English as well.</p>
<p>My wisdom increased when I read some of the lines of the well-known English poets. To my great surprise and joy, these English poets definitely created mantras. I am sure other languages have also offered mantras.</p>
<p>Now I know that mantras are not the sole monopoly of Sanskrit. They can be the wealth, the most divine wealth, of each and every language.</p>  </div>
