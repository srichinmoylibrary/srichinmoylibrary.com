<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> Will you do me a big favour?<br /> "Certainly I shall."<br /> Please tell our Father<br /> That of late I have been<br /> Thinking of Him constantly.<br /> "Brother C,<br /> I give you my word of honour,<br /> The moment I go back<br /> And sit at Father's Feet<br /> I shall offer Him<br /> Your message.<br /> Don't you worry.<br /> Brother C,<br /> It is getting late.<br /> I must not cause<br /> Any unnecessary worry<br /> For our poor old Father."<br /> Brother Jesus,<br /> I perfectly understand that.<br /> Go, go back to our lucky Father.<br /> Let me stay,<br /> Commissioned if not compelled,<br /> With our unlucky Mother.</p>
