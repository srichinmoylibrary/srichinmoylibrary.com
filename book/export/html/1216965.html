<p>The souls of many disciples who have not come on the Christmas trip with us have visited us while we were here. I have seen Madhuri's soul quite a few times and also the souls of a few German girls. But Hiranmoyi's soul has come the most!</p>
<p>Again, some disciples whose bodies are here have left their souls in America or Europe or Africa. They have brought their body here, but the soul is not functioning!</p>
