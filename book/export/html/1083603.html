<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God loves all His children equally, but some of His children are infinitely more devoted than others. Naturally, on the strength of their devotedness, constant love and conscious surrender, they become much closer to God than others. God's Love is like the sunlight. Sunlight is for everyone, but if someone wants to use more sunlight than someone else, naturally he will get more benefit. He who surrenders himself more to God gets the opportunity to use Him more. And how does God give him this opportunity? Just by making that person closer to Him.</p>  </div>
