<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They can give me affection, love and concern and take some of my headaches away. When I am frustrated, they will say, “No, carry on. This is life. You are destined to achieve something very great for the Supreme. Naturally you will have to work hard for it.” This kind of consolation and concern they give me. It is like a mother. Previously the child was weak and the mother helped. Then the child became much more powerful than the mother in every way. But the mother still shows her concern. This is the thing that Nolini said to me in the ashram: “A child of the mother is always a child, even until the last achievement and fulfilment.” The last achievement, you can say, is realisation. But even after that, you have to call the mother “Mother.”</p>  </div>
