<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our inner running definitely helps us in our outer running. Through prayer and meditation we can develop intense will-power, and this will-power can help us do extremely well in our outer running. Meditation is stillness, calmness, quietness, while the running consciousness is all dynamism. Again, the runner’s outer speed has a special kind of poise or stillness at its very heart. An airplane travels very fast, yet inside the plane we feel no movement at all. It is all tranquillity, all peace. So the outer life can be successful only when there is inner poise. Poise is an unseen power, and this unseen power is always ready to come to the aid of the outer runner.</p>  </div>
