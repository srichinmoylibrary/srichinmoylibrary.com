<p>The wife said to her husband: “How is it that every time I start singing, you leave the house immediately? What is wrong with you?”</p>
<p>“Nothing is wrong with me, but I must say that I am afraid of my friends’ opinion, of my neighbours’ opinion.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“When you start singing, I wish to tell you that I am compelled to leave the house because you don’t sing at all. You just weep and scream. And what do my neighbours and friends think? They immediately think that I have been thrashing you. I don’t want to lose my reputation. I don’t want to be a bad husband.”</p>  </div>
