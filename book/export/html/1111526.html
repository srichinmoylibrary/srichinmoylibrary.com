<p>This morning in Puerto Rico I ran randomly. When I run randomly, God knows where I go. My aim was to run for one hour. Nowadays I only care for the time, not the miles. So I ran by Shubhra's house. In thirty-five minutes I was there. O God, suddenly a police car came up quite fast and stopped abruptly. Two policemen came out of the car. They slammed the doors and entered into a small house nearby. A lady and her husband were in a panic about something. Something had happened. In ten minutes' time I followed the same route home. I said to myself, "Let me see what is happening." But there was no police car. There was absolutely nobody around.</p>
