  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Is it the soul that must surrender to the Cosmic Self?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. The soul has to surrender to the Self â€” the Self which, in Indian terms, is called Param Atman, which is unmanifest. This Self does not take human incarnation, nor enter into creation; where as the soul accepts a human body and accepts limitation, imperfection and ignorance. Each human being has an individual soul. This individual soul, which takes a human body, is not all-pervading, omniscient or omnipotent. The Self is. The soul, in its upward evolution, can some day merge into the Self and become as powerful as the Self.</p>  </div>
