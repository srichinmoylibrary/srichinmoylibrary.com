<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your role and everybody's role is to become a divine instrument of the Supreme. In order to become a divine instrument of the Supreme, each individual needs something more than he needs something else. In each individual case, one particular divine quality is of paramount importance. In your case, purity is of paramount importance. Your lack of purity can destroy your aspiration, your dedication, everything. But if you can have purity, you can run fast, faster, fastest. Purity is the fastest road, whereas impurity is not only the slowest road, but it is actually the backward march. And the backward march leads not only to frustration, darkness but to destruction-night. So develop purity and try to run the fastest.</p>  </div>
