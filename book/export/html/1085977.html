  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: What is the sound of the aspiring heart?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The sound of the aspiring heart is constant self-giving. This self-giving is God-becoming. While offering himself, the supreme lover has to feel this sound as something indispensable in his relationship with. God the Supreme Beloved.</p>
<p>We have to feel that the sound of the aspiring heart is embodying the eternal treasure which is God's manifestation on the strength of his identification. And at the same time we have to feel that the heart not only embodies the Supreme Beloved in us but is itself the Beloved. Sound is the child in us, the lover in us, that is running toward the Supreme Beloved. This child is always full of life energy and always running towards the Goal, its Father and Mother.</p>  </div>
