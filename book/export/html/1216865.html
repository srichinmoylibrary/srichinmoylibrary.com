<p>I arrived in the Ashram only to hear all about the trip I was about to take to France. Three or four old friends of mine work in Paris. They are my admirers. They came back to visit the Ashram just before me, and told everybody about the concert I was going to give in France — even what kind of posters we had. So my Ashram friends knew all about the concert even before I arrived.</p>
<p>One of my friends told another friend that everybody wants to become world famous. He said everybody pretends that he has conquered desire, but it is only pretense. He said to his friend, "I am sure Chinmoy also had that desire. But in his case, God has satisfied his desire."</p>
<p>Recently that man moved to Holland. Now he teaches physics at a university there.</p>
