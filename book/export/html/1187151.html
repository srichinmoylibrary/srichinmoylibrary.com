<p>The sweet rain of truth<br /> Unconditionally helped him fly<br /> Into the highest Abode of Divinity<br /> Where God was waiting for him<br /> With His Immortality's Smile.</p>

<p>Do not be sad<br /> To see your mind's sunset.<br /> Behold the perfection-splendour<br /> Of your heart's sunrise.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187154" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1503</h1>
  
 

<p>Every day my heart sings<br /> A new song of gratitude,<br /> And this new song<br /> Increases<br /> The joy of my perfection-delight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187155" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1504</h1>
  
 

<p>God's Compassion-Eye<br /> And<br /> His Forgiveness-Heart<br /> Are planning something for you:<br /> Your desire-mind<br /> Is soon going to surrender<br /> To your aspiration-heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187156" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1505</h1>
  
 

<p>What the world needs from you<br /> Is your heart's abiding faith<br /> And not<br /> Your mind's towering philosophy.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187157" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1506</h1>
  
 

<p>As long as we claim to be seekers<br /> Of the infinite Truth,<br /> As long as we claim to be<br /> God-lovers,<br /> There can be nothing<br /> As important as obedience<br /> In our inner life and our outer life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187158" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1507</h1>
  
 

<p>Inner obedience<br /> Is infinitely more difficult<br /> Than outer obedience,<br /> For to achieve inner obedience<br /> One has the formidable task<br /> Of fully conquering doubt.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187159" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1508</h1>
  
 

<p>Enslaved by words,<br /> You immediately fall.<br /> Emancipated by deeds,<br /> You triumphantly rise.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187160" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1509</h1>
  
 

<p>In order to achieve<br /> Transcendence-perfection<br /> In your life of aspiration<br /> And dedication,<br /> Every day you must be ready<br /> To brave inner and outer hurdles.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187161" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1510</h1>
  
 

<p>My Beloved Supreme,<br /> I want to be a sincere, devoted,<br /> Surrendered and perfect instrument<br /> Of Yours.<br /> I shall overcome all the hurdles —<br /> Insincerity, insecurity, impurity,<br /> Disobedience and ungratefulness —<br /> That I may encounter along the way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187162" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1511</h1>
  
 

<p>Great thoughts surround me<br /> With God's breathtaking Heights.<br /> Good thoughts reveal<br /> God's infinite Beauty through me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187163" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1512</h1>
  
 

<p>Your Master's name is inspiration.<br /> Your Master's name is aspiration.<br /> Your name is dedication.<br /> Your name is manifestation.<br /> His names and your names combined<br /> Create a most significant gift<br /> For mankind.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187164" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1513</h1>
  
 

<p>As soon as I see<br /> Any of my inner barriers,<br /> One by one<br /> I shall break them<br /> Into a million pieces<br /> For my aspiration-life's<br /> Self-transcendence.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187165" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1514</h1>
  
 

<p>A heart of purity<br /> Sees that its life<br /> Is at once<br /> Inside mistrusting humanity<br /> And frustrated humanity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187166" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1515</h1>
  
 

<p>I am ready to touch the feet<br /> Of hesitation and fear,<br /> For they are protecting me<br /> By delaying the fulfilment<br /> Of my undesirable desire-bound life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187167" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1516</h1>
  
 

<p>Postponement, I love you.<br /> In my desire-life<br /> You are preventing me<br /> From touching the breath<br /> Of the abysmal abyss.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187168" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1517</h1>
  
 

<p>If you really dislike<br /> The dividing lines of your jealousy,<br /> Then quite soon<br /> They will reach their vanishing point.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187169" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1518</h1>
  
 

<p>If you are striving<br /> To elevate your life,<br /> Any obstacles you meet<br /> Must be destroyed.</p>
<p>If you are going<br /> To ruin your life,<br /> Any obstacles you meet<br /> Are your true saviours.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187170" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1519</h1>
  
 

<p>You are still<br /> In your unmanifested perfection.<br /> How then can God allow you<br /> To enjoy companionship<br /> With the Immortals?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187171" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1520</h1>
  
 

<p>Transcendence is perfection.<br /> Perfection is transcendence.<br /> When we transcend our capacities,<br /> Immediately we get an inner joy,<br /> An inner thrill,<br /> Which is another name for perfection.<br /> No perfection can ever be achieved<br /> Without self-transcendence.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187172" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1521</h1>
  
 

<p>Your Master asked you<br /> To sit in front of him —<br /> Such an easy task!<br /> And what did you do?<br /> You allowed your unaspiring vital<br /> And your doubting mind<br /> To ascribe some motive<br /> To his simple and blessingful request.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187173" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1522</h1>
  
 

<p>Fulfil your Lord's Requests<br /> With a soulful cry<br /> And<br /> A fruitful smile<br /> And say, "This is what He wants.<br /> I am going to please Him<br /> In His own Way."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187174" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1523</h1>
  
 

<p>Who has freed his life<br /> From bondage-chains<br /> By accepting falsehood<br /> For his safety's sake?<br /> None!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187175" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1524</h1>
  
 

<p>Just offer your Lord Supreme<br /> Your inner obedience.<br /> You will definitely be able to win<br /> The Godward race.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187176" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1525</h1>
  
 

<p>Outer obedience and inner obedience<br /> Must go together —<br /> Two legs we need<br /> To walk, march and run<br /> Towards the ultimate Goal.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187177" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1526</h1>
  
 

<p>On your mark,<br /> Get set,<br /> Go!<br /> In pin-drop silence<br /> God's Eagerness-Heart<br /> Is waiting for you<br /> At the finish line.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187178" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1527</h1>
  
 

<p>He is cherishing the idea<br /> That obedience is not necessary for him,<br /> Since once upon a time<br /> He served his Lord<br /> And did Him a big favour.<br /> What a deplorable mistake!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187179" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1528</h1>
  
 

<p>Are you blind?<br /> Can you not see<br /> That by fulfilling your Lord Supreme<br /> You have increased<br /> Your own inner and outer capacities?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187180" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1529</h1>
  
 

<p>If you mount<br /> On the wings of meditation,<br /> You will see no division-skies<br /> And no destruction-clouds.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187181" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1530</h1>
  
 

<p>On the strength of your mutual oneness,<br /> You and your Master<br /> Together have pleased God.<br /> Your Master gave you God's Message<br /> And this Message was fulfilled<br /> In and through you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187182" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1531</h1>
  
 

<p>If you believe in your own<br /> Ultimate perfection,<br /> If you believe in the necessity<br /> Of transcendence,<br /> Then you have to have a permanent name<br /> In the inner world<br /> And in the outer world,<br /> And that name is obedience.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187183" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1532</h1>
  
 

<p>Now that he has turned his back<br /> On his unaspiring past,<br /> He soulfully hears<br /> The symphony<br /> Of his heart's God-fulfilling dreams.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187184" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1533</h1>
  
 

<p>Be careful!<br /> The disobedience-force that today<br /> Does not allow you to listen<br /> To your Master's<br /> So-called 'insignificant' requests,<br /> Tomorrow will have the capacity<br /> To inwardly take you<br /> Thousands of miles away from him.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187185" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1534</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Each time I do not obey You,<br /> Each time I do not please You,<br /> Each time I do not fulfil You,<br /> I clearly see that I am feeding<br /> A devouring tiger deep inside me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187186" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1535</h1>
  
 

<p>You fool!<br /> Do you think your aspiration-heart<br /> Will be scared to death<br /> If it sees<br /> Your mind's thought-bullies?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187187" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1536</h1>
  
 

<p>He mistakenly thought<br /> That he would escape,<br /> That somebody else would fall<br /> Into the vital-tiger's den.<br /> Alas, soon he was found<br /> Inside the cave of destruction<br /> Which he himself had created<br /> Through his disobedience.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187188" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1537</h1>
  
 

<p>No wonder I see you<br /> As a picture of perfect self-deception.<br /> I see you have gladly allowed yourself<br /> To be caught in the currents of desire.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187189" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1538</h1>
  
 

<p>You will always remain<br /> Unfamiliar to defeat<br /> If you carry a smile<br /> That touches every heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187190" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1539</h1>
  
 

<p>Overcome your weaknesses<br /> On the strength of your sincerity<br /> And obedience.<br /> Your sincerity will save you,<br /> Your obedience will illumine you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187191" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1540</h1>
  
 

<p>Do you want to make progress<br /> Or do you want to crawl<br /> In your spiritual life?<br /> If you feel the necessity<br /> To walk, march and run,<br /> Then obey your Inner Pilot<br /> Every day, every hour, every minute.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187192" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1541</h1>
  
 

<p>My soul is the poet in me.<br /> My heart is the poetry in me.<br /> My Beloved Inner Pilot<br /> Is the Reader in me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187193" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1542</h1>
  
 

<p>I desired to become great<br /> On the human level.<br /> My desires killed me.<br /> I aspire to become good<br /> On the divine level.<br /> My aspirations are illumining me<br /> And fulfilling me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187194" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1543</h1>
  
 

<p>An ungrateful heart<br /> Is the darkness<br /> Of man's life-torturing<br /> Inner poverty.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187195" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1544</h1>
  
 

<p>You can plumb the depth<br /> Of your inner light<br /> Only if you come out<br /> Consciously<br /> From the abyss of your lifeless<br /> Nothingness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187196" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1545</h1>
  
 

<p>Every day ask yourself<br /> Whether or not<br /> You want to see your highest divinity.<br /> If the answer is yes,<br /> Then it is worth staying in the spiritual life<br /> To realise God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187197" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1546</h1>
  
 

<p>The chosen instruments<br /> Of the Lord Supreme<br /> Will always feel<br /> That they are not indispensable.<br /> The very moment<br /> They feel that they are indispensable<br /> Is the beginning<br /> Of their spiritual downfall.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187198" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1547</h1>
  
 

<p>Can you imagine!<br /> God has given up<br /> His Infinity's Power<br /> To play with me<br /> Inside my insecurity-cave.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187199" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1548</h1>
  
 

<p>I am now enjoying<br /> My supreme surrender-freedom.<br /> Thousands of years have worked on me<br /> For this most precious moment.</p>

<div id="node-1187200" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1549</h1>
  
 

<p>You can be a supreme authority<br /> On divine victory<br /> If your mind<br /> Has a ceaseless thirst<br /> And your heart<br /> Has a sleepless hunger<br /> For God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187201" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1550</h1>
  
 

<p>A doubting mind<br /> And<br /> A sleeping body:<br /> These are the two universal sicknesses<br /> Of humanity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187202" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1551</h1>
  
 

<p>In the inner world<br /> Doubt is unmistakably<br /> The most powerful enemy —<br /> The enemy that makes us doubt<br /> Our Lord Supreme<br /> As well as our own capacities.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187203" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1552</h1>
  
 

<p>Unless you are totally freed<br /> From the prison<br /> Of your antic attitude<br /> Towards God's<br /> Compassion-Forgiveness-Flood,<br /> How can you ever have<br /> A heart of satisfaction-sun?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187204" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1553</h1>
  
 

<p>On my way to Heaven<br /> Do you think I will ever forget<br /> To carry<br /> My Heaven-indifference-proof shield?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187205" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1554</h1>
  
 

<p>Every morning<br /> My mind and I wander<br /> Upon the shores of delusion.<br /> Every evening<br /> My heart and I sing hymns<br /> At Heaven's Gate,<br /> Yet we are not proud.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187206" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1555</h1>
  
 

<p>If you have not yet fulfilled<br /> The Requests of your Beloved Supreme,<br /> Then now is the time<br /> For you to forget about the useless past.<br /> Just voice forth:<br /> "I will do it, I am doing it."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187207" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1556</h1>
  
 

<p>Today's difficulty-race<br /> Is making your body, vital and mind cry.<br /> Tomorrow's victory-crown<br /> Will not only make those three happy,<br /> But also will make three more members<br /> Of your inner family happy:<br /> Your heart, your soul and your God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187208" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1557</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> What You need, I also need.<br /> "True, My child.<br /> Unfortunately,<br /> I am meeting with My Needs,<br /> While you are not.<br /> But do not worry.<br /> I will definitely show you<br /> How to do it."</p>

<p>When you are cheerfully<br /> Able to offer<br /> Your achievements to God,<br /> You become a life of aspiration,<br /> And the rest of the world<br /> Will undoubtedly derive benefit<br /> From your achievements.</p>

<p>What have inner disobedience<br /> And outer disobedience<br /> Done for him?<br /> He has gone back to his old life,<br /> Where he is once more wallowing<br /> In the mire of ignorance.</p>

<div id="node-1187215" class="section-2">

<p>How can God play His Cosmic Game,<br /> His divine Lila,<br /> If He is all the time<br /> Finding fault with His human children?<br /> Then there would be no Game.</p>

<div id="node-1187216" class="section-2">

<p>O fear, doubt, anxiety and insecurity,<br /> When are you going to learn<br /> That you are<br /> The unfortunate soldiers<br /> Of ignorance-king?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1187217" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1566</h1>
  
 

<p>Sincerity and obedience<br /> Are the obverse and reverse<br /> Of the same coin.<br /> As a truth-seeker<br /> You have to feel<br /> That you are that golden coin.</p>

<p>His complacent self-sufficiency<br /> Makes him feel<br /> That the progress he has made so far<br /> Is more than enough for him.<br /> He feels no necessity<br /> To increase his inner hunger<br /> Since at every moment<br /> He is pleased with what he has<br /> And what he is.<br /> What an unfortunate seeker!</p>
