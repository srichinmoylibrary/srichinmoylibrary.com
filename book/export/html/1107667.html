  <h1 class="book-heading">My peace-education-life</h1>
  
 

<p>Peace I find when I am lost inside God’s Compassion-Eye.<br /> Peace I become when I am lost inside God’s Forgiveness-Feet.</p>
<p>Mine is a mind-jungle totally empty of peace.<br /> Mine is a heart-garden flooded with peace.</p>
<p>The divine in us embraces peace.<br /> The human in us longs for peace.<br /> The animal in us destroys peace.</p>

<p>President Gorbachev, the peace-dreamer, peace-bringer and peace-server of this century, has urged again and again: “What we need is Star Peace and not Star Wars.”</p>

<p>I heave a sigh when my mind becomes a victim to searing conflicts.<br /> I become a singing bird when my life becomes the breath of peace.</p>
<p>My heart’s God-love-beauty has peace.<br /> My life’s God-surrender-fragrance is peace.</p>

<p>The dream-flooded and soul-stirring words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ring forth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I still believe that one day mankind will bow before the altars of God and be crowned triumphant over war and bloodshed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Devotedly I chant the Name of my Beloved Lord Supreme.<br /> Bountifully my Beloved Lord Supreme enchants my life.</p>

<p>My soul’s peace-smiles and my heart’s peace-tears together cover endless miles unobstructed.</p>

<p>Infinity is the Source of my soul’s peace-smiles.<br /> Eternity is the Source of my heart’s peace-tears.</p>
<p>Peace is infinitely more than the birthless and deathless promises of my mind.<br /> Peace is in the ever-blossoming hopes of my heart.</p>

<p>I wish to cite the momentous utterance of U Thant, the third Secretary-General of the United Nations, who was widely revered for his innate spirituality and deep wisdom. He said: “There is no peace in the world today because there is no peace in the minds of men.”</p>
<p>God comes to me, compassionately and unconditionally, and gives me Peace.<br />Man comes to me, immediately and ruthlessly, and takes away all my peace.</p>
<p>God comes and man comes.<br />When God comes, I swim in the ocean of infinite Delight.<br />When man comes, my very earth-existence is devoured by the unquenchable thirst and insatiable hunger of sorrows.</p>
<p>But love mankind I must, for mankind is unmistakably an extension of my own reality-existence. The lofty realisation of Mother Teresa, the twentieth century’s unparalleled server of bleeding humanity, echoes and re-echoes in the inmost recesses of my heart: “Works of love are works of peace.”</p>

<p>I ask God,<br /> “My Lord, is there any way I can embody<br /> and treasure Your Peace forever and forever?”</p>
<p>God says,<br /> “My child, there is a way.<br />     Just illumine your mind more, infinitely more.<br />     Feed your heart more, infinitely more.<br />     Energise your life more, infinitely more.<br />     Lo, in you My Infinity’s Peace has found its Eternity’s Abode.”</p>

<p>Peace is today’s soul-seed-world.<br />Peace is tomorrow’s life-tree-world.</p>
<p>But the peace of tomorrow must be built upon the solid foundations of today. What are those foundations? President Woodrow Wilson, the champion of the League of Nations, has a most significant message for the world community in this connection. He advises us that lasting peace can never be the fruit of a war where one side defeats the other. “It must be a peace without victory,” he proclaims.</p>
<p>We can look to the soul-stirring words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to clarify our peace-goal even further: “This is the peace that we are seeking: not an old, negative, obnoxious peace which is merely the absence of tension, but a positive, lasting peace which is the presence of brotherhood and justice.”</p>
<p>O world, you will not be happy and satisfied if you come and visit God’s omnipotent Power-Head, but you will be completely happy and supremely satisfied if you come and visit God’s omnipresent Peace-Feet.</p>
<p>Man thinks his mind’s love for world-power and his heart’s love for world peace can live together. Indeed, this is the height of man’s stupidity.</p>
<p>Up until now, God has been pleading with the human mind to study the world peace course. But now God is forcing the human mind to study the world peace course.</p>
<p>The moment the division-mind desires to live in the heart of oneness-peace-world, God will immediately declare His supreme Victory on earth.</p>
<p>One minute of world peace is ten hours with God.</p>
