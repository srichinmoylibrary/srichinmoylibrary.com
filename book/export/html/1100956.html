<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only to shed soulful tears. Imagine your soul — imagine, imagine! Imagination is a reality in itself. You will imagine your soul as a most beautiful, most beautiful, most beautiful child — or whichever way you want to imagine it. If you can shed bitter tears in front of the soul, the soul will rectify all the mistakes that you have made.</p>  </div>
