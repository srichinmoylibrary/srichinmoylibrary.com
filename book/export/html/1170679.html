<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you realise God, it is as though a most beautiful flower has blossomed inside you. When you try to reveal and manifest God, you bring that flower out to show the world what you have inside you; you try to offer the beauty and fragrance of your heart-flower to the world. After realising God, some people do not care for God-manifestation because it is such a difficult task. They say, "Who cares whether or not others believe that there is a most beautiful flower inside my heart? If they do not believe it, why do I have to prove it to them? I am satisfied with what I have."</p>
<p>But some realised souls, who are more daring, see that there are people who are miserable because they do not know that this beautiful flower even exists. These realised souls want to show the flower, not in order to show off, but out of generosity. Because of their heart's magnanimity, they want to share the beauty of the flower with others. They know that they will not lose this precious flower by sharing it, because it is not something that they possess, but something that they have become. A possession we can lose, but what we are eternally, we can never lose.</p>  </div>
