<p>My Lord Supreme, who is my friend on earth? Who is my enemy on earth?</p>
<p>“My son, I am your Friend, and I am your Enemy.”</p>
<p>How can it be, my Lord Supreme? How can You be my Friend and my Enemy at the same time?</p>
<p>“My son, when I fulfil your aspiration heart, I am your Friend. When I fulfil your desire-life, I am your Enemy.”</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, why do you then fulfil my desire-life?</p>
<p>“I fulfil your desire-life because you insist on being fulfilled in your desire-life. Helpless, I fulfil your desire-life. Again, with My inner Vision I know that your desire-life will cause tremendous frustration in you and for you, and that there shall come a time when you will dive deep within to accept the aspiration-life. Aspiration-life is the life of satisfaction; desire-life is the life of frustration. It is in aspiration-life that you will discover Me as your Friend. It is in your aspiration-heart that you will discover Me as your Friend, your only Friend here on earth and there in Heaven.”</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, is there any way I can increase my friendship with You? Is there any way I can feel deep within my heart my most intimate and inseparable connection with You?</p>
<p>“Yes, My son, there is. From now on, try to control your thought-world. At every moment you are assailed by thoughts. Each time a thought enters into your mind, if it is a good thought or a progressive thought, then enlarge it and, inside the vastness of the thought, try to see and feel Me. Without fail, I shall be inside the vastness of your thought. As soon as a wrong thought, an uncomely, undivine or impure thought, enters into your mind, try either to annihilate it or to transform it into a pure, divine and progressive thought. Each thought acts like atomic energy; it has boundless power. With this thought either you can build a new world or you can destroy the real in yourself. The real in you is your cry for truth, for light and for perfection.</p>
<p>“You can enter into the imagination-world in order to increase our friendship and feel that constantly I love you; and not only that I love you but also that I need you. Imagination is not and cannot be a mental hallucination. It is the precursor of a reality here on earth. Imagination is a reality which abides in its own world. Imagination descends from this imagination-world proper into the reality-world which we see, feel and grow into. Imagine that I am kind. Imagine that you are pure. Imagine that you are an instrument, a choice instrument of My Reality. Imagine that at every moment I am doing everything for you unconditionally. It is on the strength of your imagination that you can feel Me most intimately. And, finally, enter into the gratitude-world. It is in the gratitude-world that you can see My total Satisfaction in you. Inside My Satisfaction what looms large is your own satisfaction, which is founded upon your nature’s transformation, your nature’s liberation from ignorance-night.</p>
<p>“My son, I am your only Friend. A friend is he who constantly fulfils the oneness-world. The oneness-world is the world of self-giving and, inside self-giving, is the truth-becoming, satisfaction-blossoming, perfection-dawning Reality.” </p>
