<p>In my family<br /> There are only three members:<br /> My father, my mother and I.<br /> Father thinks and says<br /> He is great,<br /> Which he actually is.<br /> Mother feels and says<br /> She is good,<br /> Which she obviously is.<br /> And I just know and declare<br /> I am perfect,<br /> Absolutely perfect.<br /> Needless to repeat,<br /> Since everyone knows it.</p>
