<p><em>Madal:</em></p>
<p>Chinmoy, I must admit that you are a spiritual lion. Tell me one thing, what is the thing that you are doing wrong which <em>enervates</em> you after you have had a long meditation?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>Madal, nothing actually <em>weakens</em> me before, during or after a long meditation. To me, meditation is all energy and all life. It is the wild resistance from the unlit vital of some of my disciples, and the opposition of the unaspiring earth consciousness that at times weaken me, my human body, and the human in me when I bring down light into their obscure, unaspiring and resisting natures.</p>  </div>
