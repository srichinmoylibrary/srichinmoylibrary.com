<p>ABSENCE</p>
<p>In man's absence<br /> My fondness-tree proudly grows.</p>
<p>In God's absence<br /> My life-tree helplessly dies.</p>
<p>O man and God,<br /> I tell you<br /> My supreme secret:<br /> Ignorance misses my absence,<br /> Earth cherishes my absence,<br /> Heaven terminates my absence.</p>

<p>With much sweat<br /> I have acquired an iota of faith.<br /> If I ever lose it<br /> My life-boat shall sink.</p>
<p>With much sweat<br /> I have discovered an iota of Light.<br /> If I ever lose it,<br /> I shall become a soulless creature.</p>

<p>CONVERSATIONS</p>
<p>God said to me:<br /> "Son, you deserve God-realisation today<br /> And I am now granting it."</p>
<p>Satan immediately said to God:<br /> "No, not today, God.<br /> Tomorrow You may grant him realisation,<br /> If You are so consumed with that desire.<br /> Tomorrow will be the best time,<br /> I tell You, God."</p>
<p>God said to me:<br /> "Son, of late I have not been pleased with you.<br /> Therefore, I want to delay your God-realisation."</p>
<p>Satan immediately said to God:<br /> "God, I tell You once and for all<br /> That delaying will not satisfy You.<br /> Please cancel Your promise, God, for God's sake.<br /> I am telling You that if he is not ready by this time,<br /> In spite of Your infinite Compassion,<br /> He will never be ready.<br /> This is not only my unmistakable conviction,<br /> But also my immutable realisation."</p>

<p>THE GUESTS</p>
<p>A gold possessor<br /> Is a welcome guest.</p>
<p>A silver possessor<br /> Is an acceptable guest.</p>
<p>A man with no gold<br /> And no silver<br /> Is an unwanted guest.</p>
<p>But<br /> When I went to visit God,<br /> He asked me,<br /> "Son, do you have gold with you?"<br /> Sorry. No, Father.</p>
<p>"I am so happy, son, that you do<br /> Not have gold.<br /> Son, do you have silver with you?"<br /> Sorry. No, Father.</p>
<p>"Son, I am so happy that you do<br /> Not have silver.<br /> Son, what actually have you brought for Me?"<br /> Father, unfortunately, nothing.</p>
<p>"Son, you do have something for Me.<br /> You have brought Me<br /> Your bold nothingness-pride.<br /> Son, give Me your pride<br /> And I give you My All."</p>

<p>MY ADVOCATES</p>
<p>Doubt says to me:<br /> "I want to be your advocate.<br /> When happiness tortures your heart,<br /> I shall bravely defend your cause."</p>
<p>Faith says to me:<br /> "I wish to be your advocate.<br /> When wild miseries torture your mind,<br /> I shall unreservedly defend your cause."</p>
<p>God says to me:<br /> "I shall be your advocate.<br /> When nothingness saddens your mind<br /> And plenitude puzzles your heart,<br /> I shall immediately defend your cause."</p>

<p>PRIVILEGED LIARS</p>
<p>Poets are privileged liars.<br /> Without even seeing the truth,<br /> They tell the world<br /> That they have realised the truth.</p>
<p>Lovers are privileged liars.<br /> After having realised the truth<br /> In fullest measure,<br /> They tell the world<br /> That they are doubtful about the existence of truth.</p>
<p>Seekers are privileged liars.<br /> God repeatedly tells them<br /> That He has His Omniscience, His Omnipotence<br /> For them, only for them.<br /> They tell the world<br /> That they desperately need<br /> What God outwardly has<br /> And<br /> What God inwardly is.</p>
