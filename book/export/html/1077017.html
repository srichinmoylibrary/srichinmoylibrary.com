<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My dear son, many times my soul has blessed your soul with overwhelming love and concern. But when your physical mind and your vital are not in the sovereign height of purity, you see and feel this blessing as an embrace and kiss instead of a loving blessing. The physical mind always tries to give a physical interpretation to the inner reality and tries to convince the outer being in a way that it finds usual and understandable. If the inner love of the Master is misunderstood by the demanding vital, then indeed it becomes a vital dream. If your aspiring consciousness had remained in the plane where the dream took place, then your entire being would have been flooded with Light and Delight, and this experience would have lasted for days.</p>  </div>
