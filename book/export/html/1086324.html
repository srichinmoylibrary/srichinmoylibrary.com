<h2>Question: What is the best way to get rid of undivine thoughts?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, you must feel that the undivine forces are not yours, that they do not belong to you, that you cannot claim them and that they cannot claim you as their own. If you say constantly, "I am a stranger to you," and if you cherish the divine forces and divine thoughts, these forces will claim you as their own and give you shelter when undivine thoughts attack you.</p>  </div>
