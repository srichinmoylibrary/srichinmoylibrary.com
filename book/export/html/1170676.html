<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From your own soulful prayer and from your own deep meditation you will know. In the beginning your meditation will tell you that the height of your wisdom and the height of God's Wisdom are very different. But when your meditation becomes very deep and profound, you will stop having your own way of thinking. Your own way will be illumined or completely eliminated and there will be only one way that you will accept gladly, cheerfully and unconditionally, and that is the Supreme's Way.</p>  </div>
