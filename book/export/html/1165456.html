<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am quite satisfied with my body. Only I wish to develop more strength and more life energy in this body. I do not want to be another Arnold Schwarzenegger or Frank Zane. God has created them with His own Vision-Light, and He has created me with His own Vision-Light. I don't want to interfere with God's Vision-Light. I wish to be God's Chinmoy and not God's Arnold or Frank.</p>  </div>
