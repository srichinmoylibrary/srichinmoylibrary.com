<p>So many times this telephone operator tried and tried to get through to India for me. Finally I told her, "Please cancel my call."</p>
<p>She said, "Yes."</p>
<p>After 15 minutes the phone rang. I said, "I have cancelled it."</p>
<p>She said, "No, Sri Chinmoy, you told me to cancel it, but I didn't listen to you. Now I have got through."</p>
<p>My brother was on the line, and I was very happy.</p>
