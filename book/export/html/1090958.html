<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> These are the divine forces that are trying to transform your physical nature and your physical outlook. When you meditate seriously, the <em>ajna</em> chakra is activated by the Eye of Vision. There the divine forces are working to bring into the body the vision of the luminous future, the Reality of the Beyond. And when you are concentrating on the heart centre, the <em>anahata</em>, these divine forces are trying to make you identify yourself with the vision of Reality which is knocking at your door. This Reality embraces the divine luminosity, divine power and divine consciousness which is your soul's birthright.</p>  </div>
