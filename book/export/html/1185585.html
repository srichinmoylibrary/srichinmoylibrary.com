<p>A long twenty-three years ago my Beloved Supreme Absolute brought me to America to be of most soulful service to Him in the West. He blessed me with His infinite Hope, infinite Inspiration and infinite Aspiration to serve Him in the West.</p>
<p>You are my sweet children. You are my service-plants. You will one day become huge banyan trees. I am not only helping you; I will make you realise the Absolute Supreme and I will manifest Him in and through you at His choice Hour.</p>
<p>You are my choice children. With you and in you I see the perfection of humanity's heart and life. Love the Supreme in me infinitely more. Be devoted to the Supreme in me infinitely more. Lo, yours will be the sleepless joy and breathless satisfaction. Yours will be the complete perfection that humanity has been longing for centuries and centuries.</p>
