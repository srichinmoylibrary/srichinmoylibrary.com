<p>People often wonder how God creates life from nothing. However, the word ‘nothing’ is incorrect here. God does make life out of something and that something is His Light, His Consciousness-Light. The Source of life is Consciousness-Light. Stone life, plant life, animal life, human life, divine life, universal life: everything comes from God’s Consciousness-Light. We all have consciousness, but unfortunately, ordinary unaspiring people are not aware of this. But the deeper we go and the more we become aware of the real consciousness within us, the clearer it becomes to us what life is and where its Source lies.</p>
<p>God creates life through His Will, through His Willpower. The moment God exercises His Willpower, His Vision is fulfilled. His adamantine Willpower can immediately perform any task.</p>  </div>
