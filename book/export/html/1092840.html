<p>In 1939, just two years before the Poet's earth-sojourn ended, he crowned Subhas with the title Deshanayak (leader of the country) and proclaimed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"More than anything else, Bengal needs today to emulate the powerful force of your determination and self-reliant courage....Let Bengal affirm in one united voice that her deliverer's seat is ready, spread for you."</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
