<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What is desire? Desire is something that wants to bind you and wants you to bind others. When you see that you are binding someone, to your astonishment you will see that you are already bound. A desire is something which you have in order to bind others and, at the same time, in order to be bound by others.</p>
<p>When you feel that you have bound somebody else, you feel very happy. But when you see that you are bound by others, you feel miserable. Then there comes a time, after a few months or a few years, when you want to get rid of the person to whom you are bound. But that person doesnâ€™t want to go. So desire leads to frustration and frustration leads to destruction.</p>  </div>
