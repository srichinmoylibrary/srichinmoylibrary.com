  <h1 class="book-heading">God</h1>
  
 
<p>Verily, we are the very image of our Father, God. What a great pity that we have neither the eyes to see nor the heart to feel this sober fact.</p>
<p>We think that God will come to us after He has purified us with endless pain. Perhaps God knows that humanity as a whole will be able to realise Him only after He has poured a different consciousness into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Uncomely blows may be the Divine's plan, absolutely misunderstood.</p>
<p>God tells us that He will gladly stand before us, but there are a few ifs and buts.</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>Sincerity, Humility, Faith and Surrender.</p>
<p>What does ignorance try to teach us?</p>
<p>It earnestly tries to teach us that God is only an imaginary fruit of our mental conceptions.</p>
<p>See God first. Then you will be godlike.</p>
<p>To be truly godlike, talking must give way to becoming.</p>
<p>It is not difficult for a man to speak of God endlessly. But that poor man has to stand agape when he sees even a glimpse of His Light.</p>
<p>You need not go to God. God Himself will run toward you.</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p>The moment you become self-abandonment.</p>
<p>The God who gave us life, gave us the message of fulfillment at the same time.</p>
<p>Even imagined experiences have some power of their own. They enrich our mind with the idea of God's Omnipresence.</p>
<p>When our choice is God and not experience, we get both experience and God.</p>
<p>But when our choice is experience and not God, we get experience; but God is likely to avoid our company.</p>
<p>God is man. Man is God.</p>
<p>This is the only conception that can grow old along with the universe.</p>  </div>
