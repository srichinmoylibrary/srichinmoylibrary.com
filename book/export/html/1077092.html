  <h1 class="book-heading">The meaning of life</h1>
  
 
<p>Inter-American University, San Juan, Puerto Rico<br />October 17, 1968</p>
<p>Life is God’s Transcendental Blessing to His Creation. What is more important than God’s Blessing? God’s Concern. What is more important than God’s Concern? The absolute Fulfilment of God’s Will.</p>
<p>Life is man’s experience of wisdom and faith. Wisdom without faith is the bondage of futility. Faith without wisdom is the smile of stupidity. Faith and wisdom can go together. Faith awakens us to see the Truth. Wisdom helps us to live the Truth.</p>
<p>The outer world is a play of conflict between the fleeting and destructive thoughts of man’s mind and the constructive and lasting will of man’s soul. The inner world is a play of harmony between the mind’s surrender and the soul’s acceptance.</p>
<p>Life is will. There is only one will that mediates between God and man. That will is at once the descending cry of concern and compassion and the ascending cry of love and helplessness.</p>
<p>Life is man’s conscious attempt to see God face to face.</p>

<p>First try. Then cry. If necessary.<br /> First give. Then take. If necessary.<br /> First run. Then stop. If necessary.<br /> First be the doer. Then be the talker. If necessary.</p>

<p>Thought, human thought, rules the world. But mere thinking is of no avail.</p>

<p>When I think, God is my frustration.<br /> When I cry, God is my consolation.<br /> When I try, God is my salvation.<br /> When I will, God is my illumination.</p>

<p>We must love God first if we really love life, for God is not only the Source but the very Breath of life. Love of God costs nothing, absolutely nothing, but is worth much. Our mind knows this truth. Our heart practises this truth. Our soul embodies this truth.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim of the human life is liberation. Liberation is the choice of man and the Grace of God. Liberation is man’s total freedom and God’s constant responsibility.</p>
<p>You cry because you have no plans to make your life meaningful and successful. He cries because all his plans have come to a lame conclusion. I cry because I do not want to have any plans. What I want is to be seated all the time at the Feet of the Supreme, who is at once the Vision and the Reality.</p>
<p>My life has three doctors: Dr. Love, Dr. Devotion and Dr. Surrender. Dr. Love cures my mind’s narrowness. Dr. Devotion cures my heart’s impurity. Dr. Surrender cures my life’s ignorance.</p>
<p>My life has three Gods: God the Existence, God the Consciousness and God the Bliss. God the Existence eternally lives in me. God the Consciousness constantly grows in me. God the Bliss immortally lives with me.</p>  </div>
