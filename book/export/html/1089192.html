<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Whenever I get the opportunity I travel to offer my prayers for peace.</p>
<p><em>Governor Takada:</em> It is my great pleasure and honour to welcome you to Nagasaki, one of only two cities that suffered from the atomic bomb.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, the places that have suffered the most also have the capacity to offer the most good to the world. Here in Japan are the two places that have suffered the most destruction from the atomic bomb. Now from Hiroshima and Nagasaki oneness is being offered to the world. When something is destroyed, there is a surge of inspiration to rebuild it. Right after the destruction a new hope, a new dawn comes. The new dawn is now blossoming in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>  </div>
