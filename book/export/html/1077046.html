<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can derive much benefit from writing down your dreams in the morning provided that they are good dreams, illumining dreams, encouraging dreams, fulfilling dreams. Each dream is like a flower on a tree. Each flower adds to the beauty of the tree. When you have a dream, you have to feel that your life-tree has borne a flower, a flower of joy, a flower of gratitude, a flower of beauty or a flower of peace, which can be placed at the Feet of the Supreme.</p>  </div>
