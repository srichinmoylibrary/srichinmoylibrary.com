<p>At one point in the first race Pratyaya made me feel that the goal was very near. She told me to go straight, but actually I had to make another turn. Then, in the last race, she screamed, "Just cross the road and you can see the end!" But the end was not in sight.</p>
<p>Databir also gives me false encouragement. In the second race today he was saying, "The end is very near." O God, I had to run about two hundred metres, and only then I saw the finish line way ahead of me.</p>
<p>Of course, these two and all those who cheer for me are only trying to encourage me. In a sense they do the right thing when they say these kinds of things. Encouragement comes and makes me feel that the goal is just in front of my nose.</p>
