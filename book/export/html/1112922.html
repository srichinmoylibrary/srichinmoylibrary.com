<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Life itself is magic, that is true. But you get only a vital satisfaction from magic. I'm not discouraging you; it is I who wanted you to do magic. But I won't ask you to show magic for twenty-four hours, no. I'll ask you only for an hour. Life itself is the greatest magician because it shows us a little bit of power and peace.</p>  </div>
