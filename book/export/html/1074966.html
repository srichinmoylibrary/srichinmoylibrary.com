<p>O Saviour-Christ,<br /> Please tell me,<br /> What did you mean<br /> By your strongest affirmation:<br /> 'I and my Father are one'?<br /> Tell me in what sense you and your Father are one.</p>
<p>"O Dear brother,<br /> Of all people, how is it that You, my wise brother,<br /> Do not understand my simple message?<br /> On earth I am my Father's Face,<br /> In Heaven I am my Father's Eye.<br /> In that sense we are one, inseparable.<br /> This is what I meant when I said:<br /> 'I and my Father are one.'
