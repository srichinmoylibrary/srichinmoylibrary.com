<p>Today I had so much pain in my left knee in addition to the stiffness of my body. But when you are in the battlefield, you cannot disappear. Even if your shield has gone, you have to fight.</p>
<p>Whose body is perfect? Nobody can say that his health is perfect â€” nobody! In my case, I am dragging my left leg because of my knee problem. Then the other day, while trying to lift 2,000 pounds in the standing calf raise, such a sudden, sharp pain I got on the left side of my buttock.</p>
<p>Now it is only two weeks to my weightlifting performance at York College. I have to be very careful. Perhaps God wants me to take rest!</p>
