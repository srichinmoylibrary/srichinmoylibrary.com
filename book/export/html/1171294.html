  <h1 class="book-heading">Interviewer: Are you taking any training in weightlifting?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do train. Every day I spend three hours exercising. One hour I spend doing stretching exercises. Then for two hours I lift heavy weights.</p>
<p>As I said, the acceptance of life in its various branches is my philosophy. Otherwise, I could not have done so many things. I entirely depend on God's Grace. Because of His Grace, I have been able to write so many songs and so many books, and to visit so many countries.</p>  </div>
