<p>My young friend, it gives me great pleasure to hear your question. The supreme sacrifice is self-sacrifice for a noble cause. To fulfil God, if necessity demands, you may have to embrace death. To uplift humanity, if necessity demands, you may have to forego your own Immortality. The supreme sacrifice is this. Let us try. It is worth aspiring for.</p>  </div>
