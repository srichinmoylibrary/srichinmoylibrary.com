<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not a technique, actually. First one has to realise the Truth; then automatically one can enter into these worlds. I can enter into these seven planes of consciousness on the strength of my inner realisation.</p>
<p>It is like this. When one is very rich, one can have seven houses at his disposal. But when one is very poor, he can have only one house. In the spiritual life also, when one is just beginning, one can have a free access to only one plane of consciousness. Then, as he becomes more advanced, it is always advisable to go to the higher worlds one by one. But when he becomes an expert in the inner life, he can be like a bird flying from one branch to another branch. As there are seven higher worlds, there are also seven lower worlds. These lower worlds one should not go into unless and until one has realised the Highest. We enter into the lower worlds for the purification of our own nature and the earth-consciousness.</p>
<p>But first things first. First we have to realise the Highest with our own sincere aspiration and dedication. Then God will give us the capacity to enter into these higher planes of consciousness. Once we have achieved Peace, Light and Bliss in abundant measure, we can easily enter into these planes. Either we enter into these worlds or they come to us and enter into us. When we enter into these worlds, we bring down their Light, Peace and Bliss according to our capacity, receptivity and necessity. But when they enter into us, they give us only what they would like to give us. Each world has Peace, Light and Bliss and each one also has some special divine quality of its own. When these worlds come into us, they give us their speciality in their own way. When we enter into them, we select. It is like when we enter into a store and select the food that we like best.</p>
<p>So there is no technique; there is only aspiration. But again, we donâ€™t pray to God to enter into these worlds. We should only think of our conscious self-dedication to the Will of God. What we should do during our prayer and meditation is make a conscious attempt to enter into His Will. If He wants us to enter into these worlds, let Him carry us. We should pray and meditate only to realise Him. Once we can please Him, He will give us all that He has and all that He is.</p>  </div>
