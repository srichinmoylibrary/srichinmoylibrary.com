<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, at that time you have to feel that I am not doing it. At that time, your consciousness, your heart, were extremely receptive. When you are receptive, then one of my beings will try to show you something that I am going to do on the physical plane in the immediate future. Your receptivity has touched my heart, so my heart is trying to give you a kind of reward. In a particular way, I am doing something new, something special for you. But I have to give credit to your receptivity to start with. If you were not receptive, I could not have taken you to that level. It is a very, very good experience.</p>  </div>
