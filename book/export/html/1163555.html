<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's Law is operated by His Compassion-Light and man's law is operated by his judgement-might. Judgement-might is human law, but Compassion-Light is God's Law. When I do something wrong, human law tries to punish me, but punishment is not the ultimate answer. In the case of God's Law, when I do something wrong, for example when I steal, the Compassion of the Supreme will touch the root and cause me to realise that stealing is wrong, and that I should work for what I need and get it in a proper manner. So, God's Compassion works in such a way as to help us change, while human law cannot change human nature. It is only Divine Law, which is illumining, that can change and transform human nature. Human law is an immediate response to what you have done-it is action and reaction. Divine Law will enter into and transform the root of the ignorance.</p>  </div>
