  <h1 class="book-heading">Is it the soul that makes the decision in selecting a new body in each incarnation?</h1>
  
 
<p>Yes. It is the soul that makes the decision in selecting a body, but with the direct approval of the Supreme or the Self. The choice is made to give the soul the opportunity to manifest more and more of its inner divinity in each incarnation and to fulfil the Will of the Divine here on earth.</p>  </div>
