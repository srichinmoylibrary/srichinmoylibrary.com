<p>The BBC came and interviewed me for a long time at the inauguration ceremony. Then they wanted me to run with the children. So I ran with the children.</p>
<p>From the beginning to the end my place was fixed: last. When I started, I had barely covered 100 metres when the children were at 400 metres. They were so fast!</p>
<p>One lady was wheeling her child in a perambulator. She was ahead of me. Then something happened at around 300 metres, and she fell down. I felt miserable!</p>
<p>Afterwards, the father of the girl who had stood first in the competition begged me to be in a photograph with his daughter. She had defeated me badly, so he was very proud of her. The father was the photographer, and he took a very nice picture.</p>
