<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is what I feel about you. You are Eternity's singing bird. This is the song I composed a few days ago about you.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> You have music to this?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have music also. My students would be so grateful if they could sing this for you.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> You play instruments also. You play forty-six instruments or something.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Jack of all trades, master of none, none, none! So, this particular song, if you could kindly allow my students to sing for you...</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Of course! How many are there? How many students did you bring?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to forgive me, I think there are seventeen or eighteen. One of my students has come from France. He is the conductor. He is the greatest admirer of yours. His name is Olivier Greif. I have given him the name Haridas.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> He is the boy I know from Tanglewood. He studied with me last time. He is young.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He is a young man, a very young conductor. And he has been shining in France of late. So this is the song. First they will sing the melody which I have composed, and then they will sing in rounds.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> An arrangement?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, they have made an arrangement. Only the melody is mine.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> How wonderful! Where are they? Please let them come up.</p>  </div>
