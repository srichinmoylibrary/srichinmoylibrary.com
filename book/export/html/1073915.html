<p>After some time, Suren began telling people that he would sue Ganapati’s father if his wife was not returned to him. By now, the poor woman was missing him too, but she could not decide whether or not to go back to him.</p>
<p>Ganapati’s father thought that since she missed her husband, the best thing would be for her to go back. So he gave her a very large sum of money and asked her to go back to her husband.</p>
<p>That was the last time Ganapati ever saw her. He was about eight years old at the time.</p>
<p>She had been extremely, extremely kind and affectionate to Ganapati — just the way her husband had been.</p>  </div>
