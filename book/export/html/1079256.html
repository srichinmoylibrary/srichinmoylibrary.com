<p>The ten lectures in this book are part of a fifty-state lecture tour Sri Chinmoy was invited to give in 1974. The talks in this third series were delivered in February and March of 1974. The questions in this book were put to Sri Chinmoy by students at the universities where he spoke.</p>  </div>
