<p>While I was watching the race, seven or eight runners recognised me. One of them said, "Sri Chinmoy, you make us feel stronger!"</p>
<p>Then Gary Muhrcke, the winner of the first New York Marathon, came up to me and said, "I'm sure many people are running from your club."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, many, many."</p>
<p>Then Norb Sanders came up. I didn't recognise him; he has grown a beard now. He was asking me about my knee pain.</p>
