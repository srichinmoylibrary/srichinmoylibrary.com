<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> These beings are fought with occult power. They do not have physical force, but they can manifest physically. For instance, they can damage the legs of chairs. We fought with occult and vital power, subtle vital power, not on the physical plane. We fought entirely with energy. Yet, people heard the sound for several blocks. No human being could produce that sound â€” only vital beings. They are beings without physical form, but subtly they can take any form they want. They do not have human appearance, but they do have a subtle appearance.</p>  </div>
