<p>Yesterday I went with X and Y to get a machine. In the store, X saw on the owner's desk two small paintings on a card. X is a great art-lover. He brought the card to me and said, "Look, Guru, your paintings!" He was positive, a hundred per cent sure. I was ninety-five per cent certain that it was my painting. But when we turned the card over, there was somebody else's name on it. I looked at it and said, "How can it be?" YS also felt it was my painting, but somebody else's name was written on the card.</p>
