<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Life is like that. Sometimes there are things that I don't like, but I know that they are good for me. I like Indian food best, but I do eat other kinds of food. Similarly, some people will like tennis or volleyball best, but they will still run a few miles a day, in the same way that a runner might play a few games of tennis.</p>
<p>It is all a matter of interest. Somebody may have interest in only one item. Again, he may be interested in two or three things. I may like one kind of food best, but if I eat the food that you like, I am not going to die; and you are not going to die if you eat the food that I like. It is only that each individual has developed different interests. If someone does not like to run, he may still run, but he may not be as good as someone who runs all the time with real enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Spiritual people often like running because it reminds them of their inner journey. The outer running reminds them that a higher, deeper, more illumining and more fulfilling goal is ahead of them in the inner world, and for that reason running gives them real joy.</p>  </div>
