<p>The other day a disciple gave me a videotape that he wanted me to watch. On two consecutive nights I watched. It was so fascinating! I saw so many new things about power that, according to me, are all true.</p>
<p>Power, I think, does not believe in truth. Truth tries to believe in power, because truth wants to abide in each and every human being, in each aspect of existence on earth, in all creations. In all creations, truth wants to live peacefully and self-givingly. But power only mutilates truth. There is no truth left; it is all power. When power reigns supreme, poor truth trembles.</p>
<p>But God exists, and we do believe in the existence of God. God cannot be separated from Truth. Truth and God are the obverse and the reverse of the same coin. I am sure there shall come a time when Truth and God will be successful. Until then, man-made power, man-originated power, may lord it over us.</p>
