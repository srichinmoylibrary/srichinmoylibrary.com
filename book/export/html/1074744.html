<p>He preached the gospel of purest love.<br />   He was misunderstood.</p>
<p>He preached the gospel of sweetest devotion.<br />   He was misunderstood.</p>
<p>He preached the gospel of quickest surrender.<br />   He was misunderstood.</p>
<p>He preached the gospel of slowest repentance.<br />   He was misunderstood.<br />              YES,<br />        This time<br />   He was misunderstood<br /> Far beyond the power of his receptivity.<br /> He became the worst victim<br />   Of the world's wild derision.</p>
