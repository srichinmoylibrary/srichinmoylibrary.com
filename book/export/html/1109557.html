<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you do good meditation, my heart is dancing with joy and pride. When you do bad meditation, three things operate in me. The animal in me tells me to bring an iron rod and do the needful: beat your heads. The human in me says, "Don't look at them; just go away." The divine in me says, "Where are you going? Since you have taken responsibility for their lives, you have to look at them; you have to show equal concern, affection and compassion to the bad ones as to the excellent ones. They too are your children." So I do the divine. I am ruled by three things, but the divine always wins out. The divine in me will eternally win out. But when you don't have a good meditation, I feel sad. I expect all of you to get one hundred out of one hundred.</p>  </div>
