<h2>Question: Does it sometimes happen that when a person can't assimilate any more light, he just starts expressing it like a cup full to the brim that starts overflowing?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the cup is full to the brim, then naturally it will spill. Daily you are getting something from your prayer and meditation, and even while you are walking along the street, you are spreading this. But while spreading, you are not losing anything. It is like perfume that you keep right inside you. You are not actually using it. You are only keeping it, but it is offering its fragrance.</p>  </div>
