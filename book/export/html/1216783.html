<p>In the elevator a lady said to me, "You're the smartest-looking guy I ever saw." I had on my white track suit and my Tiger running shoes, which matched the track suit.</p>
<p>Her husband said to her, "Don't forget, you're married to me."</p>
<p>The wife said, "Correction! You're married to me!"</p>
