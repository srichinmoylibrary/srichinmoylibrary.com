<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one way and that way is through prayer. When we need something, it means that we don't have it right now. So what do we do? We pray to God to grant it to us. If we don't have patriotism, we have to pray to God to grant us patriotism. It is only God who can eventually grant us the boon. There is no other way.</p>  </div>
