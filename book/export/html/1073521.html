  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Do you do any knee exercises?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> No, because my knees are so bad. When I came to Houston as a freshman I couldnâ€™t take more than one jump a meet. After one jump I was limping, and I had to rest my knee. I have a lot of scar tissue between the muscle and tendons. I have tried chiropractors, doctors, even faith praying. Finally I worked myself up to being able to do more than one jump. But as a freshman, one jump was all I could do.</p>  </div>
