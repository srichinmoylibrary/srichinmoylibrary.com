<p>We went to see Brazil's world-famous statue of the Christ. On the way back, I wanted to buy a belt, but they only had a holster. I said I couldn't buy it because it was for a gun. They removed the holster piece, but still kept the price very high, so I didn't buy it.</p>
<p>I walked out of the store and entered into a bus, leaving behind something I had bought in another shop. O God, the owner of the shop came running to the bus to give me the things that I had bought at another store â€” even though I hadn't bought anything from his shop.</p>  </div>
