  <h1 class="book-heading">My love of light</h1>
  
 
<p>My love of light is my spiritual will. Within it is the power infinite. I give fear no place in my life. My love of light is God's Smile of satisfaction. God's supreme Love manifests in me and through me to transform my human problems into my divine opportunities.</p>
<p>My animal human love is my unnatural experience and uncertain possibility. My divine human love is my natural experience and certain inevitability of my living in the eternal Now.</p>
<p>My love throbbingly says: "God is all Blessing."</p>
<p>God's Love smilingly says: "My child is all gratitude."</p>
<p>Love radiates the life of harmony, brightens the joy-consciousness and sharpens the sword of intuition. Love is always ready to meet man's every soulful demand. Love conquers all that is unlike God. It is, indeed, supreme over all.</p>
<p>Love gives me my importance in the cosmic Vision of God. Nobody remembers me save my love. My sole treasure is love. Love's treasure is God's Heart.</p>
<p>Love is the undeniable truth of my identity as God's son, chosen son. Love is the unique combination of Heaven's freedom and earth's discipline. In Heaven's freedom is earth's emancipation. In earth's discipline is Heaven's manifestation.</p>
<p>No time-born desire can rend my love of light. My love of light flies beyond the widespread net of death. Mine is the love that has the birthless origin and the deathless end.</p>  </div>
