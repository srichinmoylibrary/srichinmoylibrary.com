<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, in the beginning this sound must be avoided, but there comes a time when your inner being is surcharged with indomitable strength. At that time the sound has to be accepted, challenged and transformed. If anything in us or around us is not transformed, then our own transformation will remain incomplete; neither earth's transformation nor God's Satisfaction will be complete.</p>  </div>
