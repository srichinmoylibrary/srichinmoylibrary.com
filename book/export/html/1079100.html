<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I leave the body, I will go to the soulâ€™s world and enjoy a rest. And from there also, as from here, I will not allow sincere disciples to make friends with ignorance, to mix with ignorance. Here, at the foot of the tree, I am begging you not to mix with ignorance. There I will sit on the topmost branch of the tree of Eternal Life and shout down. As I bark at you from the foot of the tree so that you will not do the wrong thing, from there I will do the same; only the place will be different.</p>  </div>
