<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, although their arguments are tenuous, some disciples do argue with their Masters. What is your fate in this respect?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, my fate is great. My disciples are fully conscious that their arguments are weak and unsubstantial. Further, they are wise enough to know that their devoted surrender to my knowledge, will and dispensation will lead them much faster to their goal than any mental arguments, no matter how well-founded.</p>  </div>
