  <h1 class="book-heading">A serious situation with Kanu</h1>
  
 
<p>The day I first met with President Gorbachev — 29 May 1990 — Kanu was dying. I was in Ottawa, Canada. My meeting with the President was supposed to take place at the Governor General’s residence. But the whole day I was only thinking of Kanu, instead of thinking about the world’s greatest man. How many times from Canada I called Mridul!</p>
<p>And after my meeting with President Gorbachev was over, I rushed to the telephone to find out about Kanu.</p>
