<p>This morning I was walking at St. John's University. Two women were also walking on the track. I was wearing some Nike shoes. One lady said to me, "I love your shoes! Are they comfortable?"</p>
<p>"They are very comfortable," I replied.</p>
<p>The other one said, "Every day I see you wearing a different pair of shoes. Do you run a sneaker store?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, no, I do not."</p>
<p>Then I asked Databir, "Do you have any brochure?" Usually Databir keeps brochures about our activities in his car, but today he did not have any. I wanted to show these two ladies that I was not the owner of a sneaker store!</p>
