<p>My Lord Supreme, my Justice-Light Supreme,<br /> I have so many things to tell You,<br /> And I have so many things to ask You,<br /> My Lord Supreme, my Justice-Light Supreme.<br /> But You are never available;<br /> You are never approachable.<br /> Will You ever be available,<br /> Will You ever be approachable,<br /> My Lord, My Eternity's Lord Supreme?</p>
<p>"My child, My dear child, My sweet child<br /> And My fond child,<br /> My Compassion-Height is speaking to you.<br /> I shall be available only when you give Me<br /> Your purity's heart-lotus.<br /> I shall be approachable only when you give Me<br /> Your humility's life-grass."</p>
<p>My Lord, my Lord, my Lord,<br /> Do You have anything to tell me?<br /> Do You have anything to ask me?</p>
<p>"My child.<br /> I have only one thing to tell you:<br /> I loved you, I love you<br /> And I shall forever love you unconditionally.<br /> My child, I have only one thing to ask you:<br /> When will you claim Me<br /> As your own, very own,<br /> To make Me happy in My own Way?"</p>
