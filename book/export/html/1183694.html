<p>When my mother was leaving the body, a very close relative of mine saw in a dream that my father was coming from the soul’s world in a golden chariot to receive her and take her to Heaven.</p>
<p>When my father died, one of my uncles who was away in the city saw another uncle of mine and a few other people who had departed from this world coming to take my father in a golden boat.</p>
<p>If our dear ones and friends who are in the soul’s world maintain their same sweet feelings for us, then, at the time of our passing, they come to receive us and help us to enjoy a life of bliss in Heaven. In the case of almost all religious and spiritual people, the relatives do come.</p>  </div>
