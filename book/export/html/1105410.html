<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Realisation is self-discovery and God-discovery. When one realises God, or the highest Truth, one becomes inseparably one with humanity's cry and Divinity's Smile. When he identifies himself with humanity, he cries for humanity because humanity is hungry; and when he identifies himself with Divinity, then he becomes happy because he has got the opportunity to feed humanity. Oneness with Heaven, oneness with earth — conscious, complete, inseparable and eternal oneness — is called realisation.</p>  </div>
