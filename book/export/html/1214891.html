<p>Let us keep going. We must not give up. Although the dragon-thoughts of frustration assail us, we must not give up! There is definitely a goal, and this goal must needs be ours. We must not give up!</p>
<p>Although Heaven does not feed our heart’s cry regularly, although earth does not entirely support our spiritual journey, still we must not give up!</p>
<p>Let us invoke the presence of our indomitable courage-fount to help us conquer the feelings of loneliness and unworthiness. We must not give up!</p>
<p>Although the world does not appreciate us, although the world does not see the beauty and the light in us, we must not give up appreciating the world. Indeed, this world of ours is also an instrument of God. Like us, it considers God-realisation, God-revelation and God-manifestation as its bounden duty. Therefore, we must appreciate the world. After all, what is appreciation? Appreciation is self-expansion. Self-expansion is oneness-awareness, and oneness-awareness is truth-distribution. We must not give up!</p>
<p>Although we do not have a sunny present, although we had a foggy past, although we suspect inclement weather in the near future, we must not give up!</p>
<p>With our mind’s resolution, our heart’s determination and our soul’s illumination, we shall eventually succeed in life. Success is our choice. Progress is God’s choice. Man chooses to become. He becomes confidence-lion within and confidence-elephant without. God chooses to give. He gives us His universal Light constantly, unreservedly and unconditionally. He gives us His transcendental Delight constantly, unreservedly and unconditionally.</p>
<p>We must not give up! Let us prepare ourselves for God’s choice Hour. We must not give up!</p>
