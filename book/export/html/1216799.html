<p>The Governor of the Virgin Islands wrote me a very nice and gracious letter, starting with "Honourable Sri Chinmoy." In the letter be appreciated me deeply. He also sent an album with his autograph. He is a Puerto Rican, and I am sure that he knew of me.</p>
<p>His assistant — a tall, strong-looking man — read out the Governor's letter at the end of our public concert. The whole time he was reading, his entire body was shaking. Afterwards, he asked to have not one, but two or three photographs taken with me.</p>
