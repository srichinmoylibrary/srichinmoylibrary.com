<p>From New York to London everything went well. The stewardesses were extremely kind to me in every way. I can give them one hundred out of one hundred. The funniest thing is that they served pizza for vegetarians. They gave me three pieces and they wanted to give me more! Plus it was real pizza.</p>
<p>In London, I went to transfer for the flight to Bombay. Again, it was British Airways, and I got the upper deck once more, so I was very happy.</p>
<p>When I went to my seat, there was an Indian lady, middle-aged, on my right. It was executive class, so there was plenty of room between the seats. I put my small bag in front of me.</p>
<p>The lady said to me, "You cannot do that!"</p>
<p>I asked, "Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I am not feeling well, and I need plenty of room to stretch my legs."</p>
<p>The bag was right in front of me, and she wanted to put her legs there!</p>
<p>A few minutes later she called the stewardess. "I need a couple of pillows," she said. She already had one pillow, and so the stewardess brought her another. Then their fight started.</p>
<p>The lady, who was Gujrati, said, "I asked you for a couple of pillows, and you have only brought me one!"</p>
<p>"But you already have one pillow," the stewardess pointed out.</p>
<p>"I am not feeling well, so I need lots of pillows," said the lady.</p>  </div>
