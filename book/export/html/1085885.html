  <h1 class="book-heading">Speed</h1>
  
 
<p>In everything we need speed. Today's speed is taking us to a particular destination, but tomorrow's speed has to be faster. That speed will take us to another destination. Every day we must increase our speed to arrive at a specific destination.</p>
<p>Today's speed can take us to a particular destination, but with that same speed in the inner world, we will not be able to arrive at another destination. We have to increase our speed. And again, when we want to arrive at a new destination, we have to increase our speed once more.</p>
<p>In our outer life, we can run a marathon at a constant speedâ€”a six-minute or seven-minute pace. Mile after mile you can go at the same speed. But in the inner world, each time you arrive at a new destination, you have to increase your speed in order to arrive at the following destination. Otherwise, you are not allowed to arrive at a new destination with your old speed.</p>  </div>
