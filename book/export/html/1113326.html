<p>I was working on the checks in Amrita-da's room when Nolini-da came in. "Chinmoy, there is an urgent express letter from the Mother. Go immediately to Abhay Singh. Tell him that Mona can accompany Bhai up to Madras in Abhay Singh's car." I was about to go to Abhay Singh's when Amrita-da said to me: "Chinmoy, where are you going? Bhai is going to Germany. Where are you going?"</p>
<p>Rose-di, who was also in the room, immediately said: "Chinmoy will go deep within."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "That is what all our young boys and girls must do."</p>
<p>Amrita-da said: "In that case, I have passed my examination. I am no longer young. I have already gone deep within and am trying hard to come out. But something or someone is preventing me from coming out."</p>
<p>Everyone laughed and laughed, including Nolini-da. I immediately left for Abhay Singh's.</p>  </div>
