<p>In one store I was about to buy something for $20, but the lady said, "$21."</p>
<p>I said, "It is written here-$20."</p>
<p>She said, "There is tax!"</p>
<p>Then she asked, "Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>I said, "India."</p>
<p>She said, "In India there is no tax?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes; there is."</p>
<p>She asked, "Then why are you surprised?"</p>
<p>I said, "But this is on sale."</p>
<p>She said, "When something is on sale, there will always be sales tax."</p>
