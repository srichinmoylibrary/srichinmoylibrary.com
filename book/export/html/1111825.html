<p>Today I ran on the course for our four-mile race at Breezy Point before the other runners. While I was running, I passed an elderly couple, and the husband started joking with me, saying, "Oh, a four-minute miler?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, a four-minute miler."</p>
<p>When I was coming back from the turnaround point, the wife was asking Savita about me. The lady said, "That's that older runner."</p>
