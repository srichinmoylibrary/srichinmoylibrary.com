<p>My Lord Supreme, I am praying to You To bless all the marathon runners With Your sweet and fond Marathon-Love. My Lord, they desperately need Your Compassion. My Lord, I am also praying to You To bless our self-giving organisers. Self-giving is the right word, my Lord. They always serve You lovingly And self-givingly, And at times sleeplessly. My Lord, I am also praying to You To bless profusely the helpers And also the well-wishers Of this marathon. May all the runners run Smilingly and happily While covering the entire distance.</p>
