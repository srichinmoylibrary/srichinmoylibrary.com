<p>When Swami Vivekananda arrived in Calcutta after his triumph in America, there was a big meeting. In front of thousands of people, his brother disciple, Swami Brahmananda, touched his feet and garlanded him.</p>
<p>Vivekananda said to him, "What are you doing, what are you doing?" Brahmananda replied in Bengali, "You are my elder brother, so you are like my father. That is why I am bowing to you."</p>
<p>Then Vivekananda touched Brahmananda's feet and said, "The son of the Guru is like the Guru himself."</p>
<p>So both of them were bowing to each other in front of thousands of people.</p>  </div>
