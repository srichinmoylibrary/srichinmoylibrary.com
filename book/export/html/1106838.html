<p>The slow and long years of humanity’s hope-heart shall begin to transform into humanity’s fulfilment-life.</p>
<p>The beauty of world-peace was a sweet dream.</p>
<p>The fragrance of world-peace shall begin to become a fruitful reality.</p>
<p>At long last the body shall offer its readiness, the vital shall offer its willingness, the mind shall offer its eagerness and the heart shall offer its oneness to the soul’s God-Light-Manifestation and God-Delight-Satisfaction-tasks here on earth.</p>
<p>Earth’s heart is smiling.<br />Heaven’s Heart is singing.<br />Earth’s breath is singing.<br />Heaven’s breath is dancing.</p>
<p>I am saying to my Absolute Lord Beloved Supreme: “Father, my Father, I now have You.”</p>
<p>My Absolute Lord Beloved Supreme is saying to me: “Child, my Child, you now I am.”</p>  </div>
