<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the Western world you have angels to protect you. In India we have three major deities: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Then we have, according to us, as many minor deities as there are human beings. What we call deities in India, here you call angels. But the members of the Trinity — Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva — are infinitely more powerful than ordinary presiding deities and ordinary angels. I know the Western angels very well, and also I know the Indian deities.</p>  </div>
