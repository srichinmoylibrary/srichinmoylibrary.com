<p><em>Madal:</em></p>
<p>Chinmoy, it seems that the scientist and the spiritualist enjoy a continual <em>acrimonious</em> argument over the existence or non-existence of God. Why do they do so?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>Alas, Madal, I know, I know; both the scientist and the spiritualist enjoy <em>bitter</em> arguments. They are in habit of doing so because they both feel that they alone are right. I must add that according to the inner development of these two rivals, each one is right. Let us not worry, the real seeker in the scientist will one day come forward and then it will not be difficult for the scientist to shake hands with the spiritualist.</p>  </div>
