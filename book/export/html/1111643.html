<p>I usually finish my running before our races start so that I can enjoy them. Abadh is always far ahead; he does not die. But second is always Abarita, and he always dies while he runs. Kailash and others struggle, but they don't actually die. Jason never even struggles. I don't see him even getting properly tired during a race.</p>
<p>When Kalatit runs, he looks like he has some bitter thing in his mouth. His whole face is miserable.</p>
<p>Gayatri is also miserable, absolutely miserable, when she runs. She does not have the misery of tiredness; she is just miserable.</p>
<p>In every race Nilima gives her life-breath at the end. Today she and Karabi were sprinting so fast at the end. They were chasing Nirjhari. Then, in the last two metres, Nilima gave up.</p>
<p>Whenever Nayana sees me, she smiles. Hashi tries to smile, but Chetana does not even try. She surrenders.</p>
<p>Today Garima was very good. When she saw me, she folded her hands and bowed to me. The other day I made complaints that she did not even seem to recognise me while she was running. So this time when she saw me, she bowed.</p>
