<p>When I was out walking, just across from Agni Press, about five young boys around twelve or thirteen years old came right up in front of me and stood there with folded hands.</p>
<p>One of them said to me, "O great man, I bow to thee!"</p>
<p>I said to the boy, "I bless you."</p>
<p>The boy was so startled: "What! You bless me!"</p>
<p>I said, "If you are bowing to me, then why should I not bless you!"</p>
<p>Then the boys ran away.</p>
