<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I love them very, very much. Needless to say, they remind me of my Indian brothers and sisters. I have been to many places here in China. When I look at the Chinese people, I strongly feel this oneness between India and China.</p>
<p>Many years ago, your Premier Chou En-lai went to India, and Prime Minister Nehru and Chou En-lai became very, very close friends. Indians call China '<em>Chin</em>', and India, or Hindustan, is 'Hind'. So Indians had a slogan, "<em>Chin Hind bhai bhai,</em>" which means "China and India are brothers." Throughout the length and breadth of India, people sang this song so soulfully, "<em>Chin Hind bhai bhai.</em>" Hindustan and China are great friends, real friends; they are two brothers.</p>  </div>
