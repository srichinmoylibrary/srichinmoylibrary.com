<p>I was running on my course near Jones Beach. There were five cyclists in a single line, all perhaps in their thirties, wearing uniforms. One by one, as they passed by me, they said, "Hi, Sri!" Each one said exactly the same thing. I was on my third mile and they were going quite fast when they saw me. How did they recognise me?</p>
