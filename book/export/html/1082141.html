   <div id="node-1082142" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">God’s Glance and God’s Grace</h1>
  
 

<p>God’s Glance is the arrow<br />     Of brightest flame.<br /> It is the birth of love<br />     In human frame.</p>
<p>And ever largest in Him<br />     Is His Sea of Grace<br /> For souls to be the waves<br />     Upon His Face.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082143" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My life and my soul</h1>
  
 

<p>My life, a tragic record of pride,<br /> My life, a doll for ego’s smile,<br /> My breath is lost in the howling Night.<br /> My hope is orphan, my cry futile.</p>
<p>Lo, my soul, a mounting flame of Will.<br /> It brushes quick the tears from my eyes.<br /> My soul’s victory over my life<br /> Is the only triumph that never dies.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082144" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My fear</h1>
  
 

<p>I tremble in every limb, with fear I dine.<br /> My soul becomes a rending surge of pain<br /> The moment human eyes are locked with mine.<br /> Pangs shoot through me, but all in vain.</p>
<p>Too fast my giant hopes are thinning out.<br /> My heart, a stranger to God’s ivory Look.<br /> To free myself from my dingy past I cry out.<br /> That’ll be the twelfth of Never; the hell I brook.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082145" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Never I accept myself</h1>
  
 

<p>Never I accept myself,<br /> My limitations I resent.<br /> I want to be the ‘That’.<br /> I want to be God’s true descent.</p>
<p>I pine for another chance.<br /> I know self-pity gets man nowhere.<br /> I take full charge of my life.<br /> I hurl my hope ahead all-where.</p>
<p>Ever I picture myself<br /> As an eternal winning soul.<br /> I know not how to drift.<br /> Within my ken my lofty Goal.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082146" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">God’s Grace</h1>
  
 

<p>The One-in-All and All-in-One—<br /> This truth imparts the Spark of Life.<br /> And what is His swift-bending Grace?<br /> The Vision of Unity face-to-face.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082147" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Secrets</h1>
  
 

<p>I love the secrets of Wisdom-Sun;<br /> They lead my blossoming soul to the One.<br /> I love the secrets of ignorance-night;<br /> Through them the Face of Dream I sight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082148" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Money</h1>
  
 

<p>Money is no bondage stark.<br /> Neither is man’s name or fame.<br /> The son of God is far<br /> Beyond the ken of blame.</p>
<p>Behold! Money, name and fame<br /> Become his faithful slaves<br /> The moment the rain of blows<br /> From his wild senses he braves.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082149" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Life</h1>
  
 

<p>What truly is life?<br />     A golden chance<br />     With Truth to dance,<br /> Killing fear and strife.</p>
<p>Fulfilment belongs<br />     To God alone.<br />     Man is no stone.<br /> He offers, he longs.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082150" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Man and his love</h1>
  
 

<p>He who has shown his love has been fed.<br /> He who has amassed his love has failed<br /> In his role to be the Smile of God.<br /> He who has fulfilled love has been hailed.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082151" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My life</h1>
  
 

<p>I try a smile—<br /> It comes off never.<br /> My life is my soul’s<br /> Fatal fever.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082152" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">God’s wealth versus man’s wealth</h1>
  
 

<p>One God or two —<br /> It matters not.<br /> Does He exist?<br /> This has to be sought.</p>
<p>If He has life,<br /> Where does He live?<br /> When will He learn<br /> Just take-and-give?</p>
<p>What has poor God?<br /> Man has desire,<br /> Man has failure,<br /> Man has death dire.</p>
<p>God has silver Grace,<br /> Compassion pure.<br /> He is His Heart,<br /> Forgiveness sure.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082153" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Immortality</h1>
  
 

<p>You can prevent anything<br /> In the land of Reality,<br /> But never, never the birth<br /> Of Immortality.</p>
<p>What is unreal? Nothingness.<br /> And what is Reality?<br /> The embrace of God’s Thought-Waves<br /> With His Eternity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082154" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My soul’s victory</h1>
  
 

<p>Before my fantasies were all vague.<br /> Slowly they have now taken shape.<br /> My golden tomorrows are dawning fast.<br /> No more I’ll be a human ape.</p>
<p>I snatched my Goal out of death’s embrace.<br /> Ecstasy unbarred shoots through my life.<br /> My glance has pinned falsehood to ground.<br /> God’s own Breath now beats against my face.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082155" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">God and man</h1>
  
 

<p>God’s Grace is man’s divinity.<br /> Man’s failure is His humanity.<br /> God tells, always a perfect balance<br /> Is the key to His Omnipresence.<br /> Man tells, his life is the soul of God—<br /> All day and night he can sleep and fraud.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082156" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">The date</h1>
  
 

<p>When I behold the face of temptation wild,<br /> My tongue dries up, clings to the roof of my mouth,<br /> Falsehood’s colourful eyes hold me hypnotized;<br /> Abandoned, no west, no east, no north, no south.</p>
<p>The One has beaten into my soul a deep<br /> Feeling of shame for my acceptance of fate.<br /> One day I’ll enjoy God’s Grace to the hilt,<br /> But impatience tortures me to know the date.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082157" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Who is the chooser</h1>
  
 

<p>It is not we who choose<br />     The Lord Supreme, our Goal.<br /> He Himself within us dawns<br />     To pierce our age-long dole.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082158" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">How to change humanity</h1>
  
 

<p>To change humanity<br /> First your own erring shape of soul recast.<br /> Anon your eyes shall find<br /> Nothing around remains unchanged at last.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082159" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">All triumphs yours only then</h1>
  
 

<p>Be you a flood of sincerity.<br /> No triumph will be denied to you.<br /> Your heart shall own Eternity,<br /> Your life shall wear God’s golden Hue.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082160" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Our death and immortality</h1>
  
 

<p>Stark death was born with us, following our feet<br /> When we beheld the light of day.<br /> But our actions’ blue-gold fruit the earth will eat<br /> Even when death our bodies does slay.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082161" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Editor&#039;s note</h1>
  
 
<p><em>The following twenty-seven poems first appeared in a pamphlet entitled “My Flute” printed in 1972.</em></p>  </div>
<div id="node-1082162" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My birth is sleep my life is night</h1>
  
 

<p>Unknown my life shall die, unknown.<br /> I breathe unseen my ceaseless moan.</p>
<p>My birth is sleep, my life is night.<br /> I drink an empty hope’s delight.</p>
<p>Silence-sea and dancing waves of Grace<br /> Long lost have I in my backward race.</p>
<p>And now my escaping breath I see<br /> Captured by strangling Eternity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082163" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">I am my haven’s king</h1>
  
 

<p>I cry<br /> Because I know not when to try.</p>
<p>I fear<br /> Because I see temptation’s spear.</p>
<p>I doubt<br /> Because I am lost within, without.</p>
<p>I hate<br /> Because I‘ve closed my beauty’s gate.</p>
<p>I love<br /> Because I breathe below, above.</p>
<p>I dance<br /> Because my Goal no more a chance.</p>
<p>I sing<br /> Because I am my haven’s King.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082164" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">I prayed</h1>
  
 

<p>I prayed without feeling.<br />     My Father slept.<br /> I prayed without crying.<br />     My Father left.</p>
<p>I prayed without loving.<br />     My Father died.<br /> I prayed without ceasing.<br />     My Father cried.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082165" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">I declare</h1>
  
 

<p>I declare ever what is true —<br /> My heart is God’s revealing Light.<br /> My soul is God’s fulfilling Might.<br /> My life is God’s transforming Hue.</p>
<p>I declare ever what is pure —<br /> This world of ours has much to say.<br /> Our climbing earth God’s promised Day.<br /> Our glowing Goal—eternal, sure.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082166" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">To my Mahapurush</h1>
  
 

<p>I cry beneath my fount of orphan tears.<br /> Your Spirit’s Eye shall salve my sighing years.<br /> In me shall breathe your Love, your Sacrifice-Soul,<br /> O my Mahapurush, to the end of my journey’s Goal.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082167" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Editor&#039;s note</h1>
  
 
<p><em>“Mahapurush” means a “Great Soul.”</em></p>
<p><em>Jyotish Chandra Chaudhury of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry, India, breathed his last on 10 March 1966, at 9:20 a.m.</em></p>  </div>
<div id="node-1082168" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Devotion</h1>
  
 

<p>Devotion<br />     Is the cry<br />           That compels God<br /> To seize the aspirant<br /> With the very madness of Love.</p>
<p>A piece of candy,<br />     Lo, the child is won.<br /> An iota of devotion,<br /> God, the true and real God,<br /> Is captured.</p>
<p>Sweeter than honey,<br />     Purer than flowers,<br />           Deeper than love:<br /> The flame-waves of devotion-light.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082169" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Attachment and detachment</h1>
  
 

<p>Attachment is my teacher:<br /> “God lives in a cave.”<br /> I learn.</p>
<p>Detachment is my teacher:<br /> “God lives in a Palace.”<br /> I learn.</p>
<p>Attachment demands my body’s breath,<br /> The life of the howling finite.</p>
<p>Detachment offers my soul’s promise,<br /> The Light of the beckoning Beyond.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082170" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">As and so</h1>
  
 

<p>As the prayer, so the Grace,<br /> As the weeping heart, so the bending Face.</p>
<p>As the sacrifice,<br /> So the price.</p>
<p>As the birth of knowledge-rain,<br /> So the death of ignorance-chain.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082171" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">The human soul and the soul divine</h1>
  
 

<p>The human soul is the kiss of night;<br /> The soul divine is the bliss of day.<br /> Like eye and sight, like nose and smell,<br /> Inseparable and one are they.</p>
<p>The one feels God a tearing sigh,<br /> And life empty of truth, futile.<br /> To the other, God is undying Hope,<br /> And life is Truth’s all-loving Smile.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082172" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">The Guru</h1>
  
 

<p>I</p>
<p>The human teacher shows you how to read.<br /> The teacher divine sleeplessly reads for you.<br /> The one leads your mind to wisdom’s portal,<br /> The other opens your soul to the sky-vast blue.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>The Guru is he who shows the Way;<br /> His heart is Love, his mind is Light,<br /> His body is Grace in the realm of night.<br /> Silence and Power sustain his Play.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082173" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Earth-bound hearts</h1>
  
 

<p>Vain are the ways<br /> Of human cries.<br /> Strange are the moulds<br /> Of earthly hopes.<br /> Queer is the dream<br /> Of climbing skies.<br /> In earth-bound hearts<br /> Divinity gropes.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082174" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Destruction’s rod</h1>
  
 

<p>O north, O South!<br /> O east, O West!<br /> I have no cry,<br /> I have no nest.</p>
<p>O ceaseless fall,<br /> An unfed hope,<br /> A fearful sigh,<br /> A tightened rope.</p>
<p>A living hush,<br /> My imagined God,<br /> Without, within,<br /> Destruction’s rod.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082175" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Because it must</h1>
  
 

<p>I sit beneath<br />     The fountain of tears.</p>
<p>My heart is heavy<br />     With growing fears.</p>
<p>My life is dyed<br />     With sighing years.</p>
<p>I take my food—<br />     Venom or dust.</p>
<p>My life will live<br />     Because it must.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082176" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Man and God</h1>
  
 

<p>Man’s dream is God;<br /> God’s Fulfilment, man.<br /> Man’s solace is God;<br /> God’s Hope is man.</p>
<p>Man is God crying;<br /> God is man struggling.<br /> Man’s strength is his ignorance;<br /> God’s Strength is His Grace.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082177" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Life and death</h1>
  
 

<p>     What men call life<br /> I call ambition’s fight<br />     Against the strife<br /> Of blind ignorance-night.     What men call death<br /> I call the soul’s repose<br />     In God’s secret Breath<br /> At the long journey’s close.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082178" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Delight you need</h1>
  
 

<p>Delight you need?<br /> Sacrifice you feed.<br /> Precious is love<br /> Below, above.<br /> And precious more<br /> Surrender’s door.<br /> Breathe in the One —<br /> Won Golden Sun.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082179" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">How to conquer</h1>
  
 

<p>Lo, how to conquer evil thoughts?<br />     Easy! One thing just try —<br /> Imagine you are the ocean vast,<br />     You are the boundless sky.</p>
<p>Your evil thoughts are fish and birds,<br />     Their lords are ocean and sky.<br /> Fear not! The slaves are only slaves;<br />     Their revolt a fruitless cry.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082180" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Ignorance vast we hug</h1>
  
 

<p>Our life abides within;<br /> Our outer sheath is a cloak<br /> Ignorant of Truth sublime.<br /> Outside the more we block,<br /> The deeper within we go.<br /> We all are nature’s slaves,<br /> Ignorance vast we hug.<br /> Even death our Spirit braves<br /> Alas! in vain for us.<br /> We cry to live in chains<br /> With blind personality.<br /> Before us the sombre main.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082181" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Thou and I</h1>
  
 

<p>Thy Rapture shines unchanging<br /> Through my heart never still.<br /> I see with my drowsy eyes,<br /> Thou with Thy mighty Will.<br /> I pine for fame unknown,<br /> Thou for my freedom vast.<br /> O mind! now cease, now cease.<br /> Nought save the One shall last.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082182" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My foe</h1>
  
 

<p>     My foe is none but I.<br /> All future I reap from deeds of mine.<br />     If I receive not aid<br /> From me, no soul will make me shine.<br />     The evil forces lie<br /> Within, around my symbol sheath.<br />     They seize my knowledge-sun,<br /> And tear my mind with dragon teeth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082183" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">No eyes have we</h1>
  
 

<p>Thou art the All and beyond the All,<br />     This truth we fail to believe.<br /> Our ego never sees Thy Will;<br />     To ignorance vast we cleave.</p>
<p>Revolts of ours defy Thy Smile<br />     That leads all souls without<br /> Within to Thy Sea of rapture-fire<br />     Where drowns our clay’s blind shout.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082184" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">All-presence am I</h1>
  
 

<p>Although I dwell in poverty,<br /> Matchless all joy of mine remains.<br /> Upon my heart His Bounty rains<br /> From His flame-white Eternity.</p>
<p>To none I sell my teeming thoughts;<br /> By me my trance is seen alone.<br /> My heart shall never tremble or moan,<br /> All-presence am I, in me no noughts.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082185" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">The flame of aspiration</h1>
  
 

<p>The wings of my longings are undone,<br />     All my desires are hushed.<br /> The flame of aspiration shines—<br />     Smiles now my heart abashed<br /> To feel the Formless in Form divine,<br />     To see nought save the One<br /> That, neither male nor female, yet<br />     Broods ever, our Parent-sun.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082186" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Dream</h1>
  
 

<p>The sky with sun and moon and stars<br /> Leans down today to clasp my soul.<br /> Their boundless love and peace sublime<br /> Lead me to Freedom, snow-capped goal.</p>
<p>I hear the hymn that bars decay<br /> And makes my bosom ever green<br /> With faith and ardent inmost call,<br /> I have become the Freedom-Sheen.</p>
<p>My bird of dawn is on the wing,<br /> Its wonder-goal within its ken.<br /> The sombre death now weeps in awe<br /> Alone in his secret, eyeless den.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082187" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">I and my name</h1>
  
 

<p>I sing and sing,<br /> And play and play<br /> To see the Face<br /> Of Eternal Day.</p>
<p>My friend is Hope,<br /> My friend is Light.<br /> If night there be,<br /> My days are bright.</p>
<p>God’s Grace is my name.<br /> Through ages long<br /> My soulful breath<br /> Shall flame His Song.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082188" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Hope</h1>
  
 

<p>Time and distance<br /> Are caught by hope.<br /> Hope is the glance<br /> That burns the rope</p>
<p>Of howling night.<br /> Hope lost, gloom grows,<br /> Dark poison-blight:<br /> Destruction flows.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082189" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My dying soul</h1>
  
 

<p>Two running ears,<br />     One howling tongue,<br /> Two trembling knees,<br />     One bleeding heart,<br /> Two weeping eyes,<br />     One struggling breath,<br /> Two surrendering arms,<br />     One dying soul.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1082190" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">When I am gone away</h1>
  
 

<p>When I am gone away,<br /> Remember me, O children sweet,</p>
<p>No, not because I failed,<br /> No, not because I cried,<br /> No, not because I tried,</p>
<p>No, not because I saw my Lord in you,<br /> No, not because I served my Lord in you,<br /> No, not because I fulfilled my Lord in you,</p>
<p>No, not because I was your Pilot true,<br /> No, not because I was your ‘Infinite’ blue,</p>
<p>O, but because my life was all gratitude,<br /> Gratitude, gratitude<br /> To you, to you, my children sweet, to you.</p>
