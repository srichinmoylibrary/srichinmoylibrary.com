<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are absolutely correct in saying that the believers of God must grow in God’s Grace daily. A true believer of God feels that his very existence on earth, his inner and outer achievements and fulfilments are entirely due to God’s Grace; also he is truly fortunate to see that his so-called personal efforts, too, are an act of God’s Grace. At every moment he feels that without God’s Grace he is nothing and with God’s Grace, he is everything.</p>
<p><em>Mr. George Riddell:</em> Listen, that last one is definitely in line with much of Christian preaching and I find that what you say is very similar to the pronouncements of the Christian churches. I am not familiar with the Moslem or the Hebrew religion, but it seems to go through all religion and probably through the Hindu religion in India and various other religions throughout the East.</p>
<p>Now, this Grace, I was wondering if, according to Yoga, will this Grace be flowing from God all the time, or would this Grace flow directly to a particular man from God, or does it flow through other mediums between God and man? When a man feels that he is receiving Grace, does he know that he gets it directly from God, or does he get it through these other mediums? I think I have made myself clear.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the aspirant is of a very high calibre, he can get this Grace directly from God. Otherwise, the beginner needs a helper, a teacher or a guide in order to bring down God’s Grace into him. The Grace of God is all the time descending in a constant shower, but the beginner is not conscious of this fact. And ordinary human beings are totally ignorant of the fact that there is such a thing as Grace. They think, “As you sow, so you reap.” This is true to some extent, but there is also God’s Grace which can expedite our life’s journey and at the same time negate, nullify our wrong actions.</p>
<p>So to come back to the question, it depends on the individual, where he stands. But again, we have to know that God’s Grace is something which we badly need in our day-to-day life, in our outer life as well as in our inner life. God’s Grace is our real meal, the energising, fulfilling meal. The Bible has taught us that man does not live by bread alone, and we, the seekers of Truth, add to it that man can live and does live by God’s Grace alone.</p>  </div>
