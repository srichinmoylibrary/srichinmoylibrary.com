<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to deal with each person daily in a specific way, but the most important way is the way of compassion and forgiveness. It is not only the boss or the superiors in an office who have the authority to show compassion or forgiveness to the workers of lower rank. No, no, no! Each and every worker has the divine right or supreme necessity to forgive others and to show compassion to others both inwardly and outwardly. By exercising and by offering compassion and forgiveness, we will develop many, many more divine qualities in ourselves. Each divine quality is like a most beautiful, most luminous and most fruitful gift we get from our Lord Beloved Supreme.</p>  </div>
