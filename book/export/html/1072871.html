<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He had special concern for Peter. He made him head of the church because he had to have a leader. So the leader got perhaps a little more. But when it was a matter of real realisation, he could not give it. He could not give it because his disciples were not receptive enough.</p>  </div>
