<p>When I lifted the German tennis champion, Max Wunschig, he was very happy. Afterwards, he was examining my biceps. Then I started examining his biceps. His biceps were larger than mine.</p>
<p>Then he was saying, “No, no, it is not your biceps that are doing this but your mental power, mental power.”</p>
