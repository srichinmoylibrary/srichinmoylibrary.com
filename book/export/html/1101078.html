<h2>Question: I come from Auroville and I was wondering if you are carrying on the mission of the Mother and Sri Aurobindo?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am carrying on the mission of the Supreme. The entire creation belongs to the Supreme, and the Supreme out of His infinite Bounty has granted me an iota of light and has commanded me to be of service to Him in aspiring humanity. So when I serve Him, I serve everyone: Sri Aurobindo, the Mother, Lord Krishna, the Buddha, Sri Ramakrishna and all others. When I serve the Supreme, I serve all the spiritual Masters that have ever come into the world.</p>  </div>
