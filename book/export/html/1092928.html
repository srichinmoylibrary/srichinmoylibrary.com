<h2>Author's note</h2>

<p>I wish to offer my deepest gratitude to the wisdom-flooded authors of the following books on Netaji, which my aspiration-heart eagerly devoured during the writing of this book. I tender my most heartfelt thanks to the members of Netaji's own family, Sarat Chandra Bose and his wife, Bivabati, and Sisir Kumar Bose and his wife, Krishna, who have so faithfully and lovingly preserved Netaji's writings and added their own illumining and revealing insights. Without them and their Netaji Research Bureau, the immortal legacy of Netaji would surely have passed into oblivion.</p>  </div>
