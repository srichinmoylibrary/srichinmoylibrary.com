<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One thing that bothers them is earth’s ungratefulness; but worse than that is earth’s non-acceptance. Ungratefulness they expect; this is the earth-consciousness. No matter what you do, people are ungrateful. But what happens is that today someone is ungrateful and then tomorrow also he will not accept the light. Each time light is offered, earth rejects it. So what is the Master going to do? But if someone shows gratitude, then his strength increases, his receptivity increases, his capacity increases.</p>  </div>
