<p>God looks exactly like us. In your case, when you see God He will look exactly like you. When somebody else sees God, God will look exactly like that individual. When any member of your family sees God, He will look exactly like that particular person. As soon as you see God you will say “He looks like me!” God’s Eyes, His Face, everything of His will look the same as you. The only difference will be that He is infinitely more beautiful than you because your own most illumined part is infinitely more beautiful than your least illumined part. Although at that time you will be able to recognise Him and claim Him as your very own, somebody else may not be able to recognise Him because He has come to you and nobody else. You will be able to recognise God as yourself, but with infinite Beauty, infinite Light, infinite Peace, infinite Bliss. That is how you will see God and how you will know Him when you see Him.</p>  </div>
