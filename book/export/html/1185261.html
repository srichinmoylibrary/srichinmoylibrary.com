<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this case we have to know how far we have already walked along the path of spirituality — that is to say, our own development. One becomes an expert gradually. When one wants to be a dancer, he cannot learn all the steps overnight. But the day comes when the dancer can do many things at a time while dancing. For an ordinary person this would be simply impossible. When someone is just learning to drive, he is lost. But when he becomes an expert driver, everything is under perfect control. Similarly, when a seeker becomes advanced and can meditate well every day, naturally he is growing in inner purity and inner strength. Then, when he enters into the hustle and bustle of daily life, inside himself he feels the living presence of his own inner being which helped him meditate well early in the morning. Even while he is answering all the professor’s questions or talking to his boss, inside he will feel the presence of a divine child who is surcharged with light, peace and bliss.</p>
<p>But this cannot happen overnight. In the spiritual life if one practises daily, regularly and soulfully, one is bound to develop this inner capacity. Then one will feel this inner presence guiding him and even if he is speaking about earthly, mundane things, he will not lose it.</p>  </div>
