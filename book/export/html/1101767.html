<p>My Lord,<br /> You do not sleep.<br /> You meditate and meditate;<br /> You work and work.<br /> I am Your child.<br /> Will I ever be<br /> As great and as good<br /> As You are?<br /> "My child,<br /> I never thought that you could be<br /> Such a fool!<br /> How can there be any difference<br /> Between Father and child?<br /> Is the child not the creation<br /> Of the Father?<br /> I am conscious of what I have<br /> And what I am.<br /> Unfortunately, you are not.<br /> This is the difference<br /> That forces you to swim<br /> In the seas of inequality<br /> And unworthiness."</p>
