<p>Our heart is ingenuous. Our mind is ingenious. Our body is ignorant. Our eyes are infants. Our vital is a roaring tiger. Our soul is an orphan. With its birth, its parents have thrown it down to earth from the pinnacled sphere to found the Life Divine upon the clay with the assistance of the heart, mind, vital, body and senses.</p>
<p>Alas, except for the heart, all the members of our family look down upon the soul and say, "O fool and beggar, away you go to your own clime! No need have we of you. We are quite content with this sweet earth of ours." Alas, the true ruler is ruled by its eyeless pigmy subjects.</p>  </div>
