<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately the heart's feeling and the mind's way of operation are two different things right now. The heart feels on the strength of its identification, whereas the mind will first try to measure or scrutinise everything. The feeling of the heart and the mind's capacity to scrutinise are not the same thing. The mind scrutinises and the heart feels. When the mind surrenders to the light of the soul, heart and mind become one and the mind accepts the feeling of the heart as a reality. But now the mind mocks and laughs at the feeling of the heart; it says it is all unreal, hallucination.</p>  </div>
