<p>King’s College Cambridge CB2 1ST 13th November 2000</p>
<p>Dear Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>It was a great pleasure and honour to welcome you to King’s College last week, and to be able to share in your tribute to Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p>I’m sure that everyone who was present felt something of the special bond uniting you to Aurobindo, a spiritual relationship that has been so fruitful for the cause of peace in the world, and that will continue to be an inspiration to many.</p>
<p>I was touched by the reverential participation of your students in our Chapel service. Also the College staff were appreciative of their co-operativeness and efficiency in setting up and clearing away afterwards.</p>
<p>Your kindness to me personally was humbling. Praise to the Spirit in which and by which we are set free and made one!</p>
<p>With every good wish for your work in the future.</p>
<p>George Pattison Dean of Chapel</p>  </div>
