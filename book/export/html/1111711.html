<p>Karabi is wonderful. Yesterday she saw me while I was running, but I didn't see her. She was in her car, coming back from the Queens College track. She gave a full description of what I was wearing.</p>
<p>After running five miles I was returning, near Main Street. According to my standard, I was going fast. But a middle-aged lady said to her friend, "His nose is running faster than his legs!"</p>
<p>It was true that my nose was running.</p>
<p>So the other lady said, "Yes, you go and join him and try to run."</p>
<p>Inwardly I thanked the second lady.</p>
<p>In the morning what kind of appreciation I get! These people's souls want to talk to me.</p>
