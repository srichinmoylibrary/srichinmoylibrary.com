<p>Today was Nancy Barr's birthday. I saw her when I was doing hill work on 150th Street. She was also doing hill work. She ran and ran with me. I was going up when she was going down, and she was going up when I was going down. I didn't know it was her birthday at the time, but later I found out.</p>
