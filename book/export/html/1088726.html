<p>Father, with you I am going to complete 640 individuals who have inspired and uplifted the consciousness of mankind, and I am so happy, so grateful to you for giving me an opportunity to be of dedicated service to you.</p>
<p>My immediate goal is to lift 700 individuals who have inspired mankind in all kinds of ways, in all walks of life. But my ultimate goal is to love God the Creator and serve God the Creation, sleeplessly and unconditionally, until I breathe my last. This is my ultimate goal.</p>
<p>(<em>After the programme, Sri Chinmoy reflected:</em>)</p>
<p>Tonight I will be lifting up 26 doctors and nurses. Body, vital, mind, heart and soul — everything — should go together. We are now in the spiritual world. And in three hours' time I will deal with the medical world.</p>
<p>The spiritual world and the medical world go together so we can become better instruments of our Lord Supreme in body and spirit. The medical world helps us conquer death in its own way, and then through our prayers and meditations we try to conquer death in our own way.</p>  </div>
