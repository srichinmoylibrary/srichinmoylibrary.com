<p>His strength obviously comes from a source much greater than he is. It’s a very powerful force that he’s tapping into.</p>
<p>It’s not what Sri Chinmoy says that makes him so powerful; it’s his example. His example is one of tremendous discipline. He is the only real spiritual leader doing bodybuilding, and he is setting an excellent example for athletes.</p>
