<h2>Question: I read before I go to bed. How can I maintain a certain level of consciousness during my sleep?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you read spiritual books written by spiritual Masters, then their divine consciousness is bound to enter into you and there is every possibility that you will be able to maintain a spiritual level of consciousness during your sleep. But instead of reading, if you meditate most soulfully, then there is almost a certainty that you will be able to maintain a higher, deeper, more illumining and more fulfilling level of consciousness while you sleep.</p>  </div>
