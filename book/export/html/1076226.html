<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have been offering this message, but who is going to listen to us? The spiritual Masters are telling the Indians, “You don’t have to enter into the Himalayan caves in order to realise the truth. You have to realise the truth amidst the hustle and bustle of life. Now come and enter the battlefield of life. Face the world. Be a hero.” We have to conquer our limitations here in the battlefield of life, in the world and amidst its multifarious activities.</p>  </div>
