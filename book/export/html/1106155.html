<p>After I lifted 303 1/2 pounds, I sat on my blue chair in the meditation room to watch the video. Immediately Lord Krishna stood in front of me and garlanded me. The garland was all white and very, very long. Mother Kali stood beside me, smiling and dancing. She was so proud. Then they came and stood next to me and watched the video.</p>
<p>Later that night, at the celebration, some disciples also presented me with a long, white garland. It was very beautiful, but Krishna’s garland had been much longer.</p>
