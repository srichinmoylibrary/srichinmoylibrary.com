<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good. In one of my essays in <em>Blossoms of the Heart</em> I say: "There are two choice hours for my God to visit me: Once when my soulful life is without haste; once when my life's mounting flame is without rest."</p>
<p>It is true that God is within us all the time, within our heart, but in the physical mind we have to remind ourselves of God's existence. When our consciousness becomes receptive, then we have a visiting hour with God. God's visiting hour with us comes first, when our life is at peace and second, when there is great aspiration in our life. When both these conditions are present, God visits us sooner than at once.</p>  </div>
