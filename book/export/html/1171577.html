SCA 1090-1095. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions at Annam Brahma restaurant on 8 November 1997.</p>
<h2>Question: Today I felt inwardly attacked and it was very difficult for me.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are all attacked every day. I am attacked more than you are. I place all the attacks at the Feet of my Lord Beloved Supreme. You also should do the same. When an attack comes, grab it and place it at the Feet of the Supreme. This is the only way I save myself. There is no other way to solve any problem or to counter any attack.</p>  </div>
