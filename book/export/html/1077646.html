<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The clarity of Truth has to come directly from the soul. Otherwise, if we utilise the mind in order to determine the clarity of Truth, we will be disappointed. We feel that since we are developed human beings, our main instrument is the mind. It is the mind that will enlighten us. But we are mistaken. Our real instrument is the soul. Unfortunately, because we do not know how to use the soul in our day-to-day life, we use the mind. The mind first gives us a subtle message; then when we go deeper into the mind, the mental suggestion becomes a conviction. From this conviction we get some clarity.</p>
<p>But our mental conviction does not last. Half an hour later or two days later, this very conviction turns into illusion. Then our limited clarity is lost. Real clarity comes when we feel the divine Love and the divine Presence constantly, when we feel a living flame inside ourselves which constantly illumines our doubts and the dark ignorance within and around us.</p>
<p>If you want to feel the clarity of Truth, please always try to see the burning illumining flame within you. Or at least try to feel that there is Someone who is always ready at every moment to offer you a divine message. Inside this message you will see the clarity of Truth. Then it is up to you to utilise this clarity in your life of aspiration. There are many people on earth who have not heard the inner message. For them utilising the clarity of Truth is out of the question. But there are many who have heard the inner message and have found the clarity of Truth. Yet they find it difficult to apply what they have learned in their day-to-day life because of their lack of faith in themselves. They see the Truth, but they feel that this Truth is so vast that it will devour them if they try to utilise it. This is absurd. Truth cannot devour or destroy anybody; it only energises, illumines and fulfils us.</p>
<p>Please go deep within and try to listen to the message of your inner being or see and feel the burning flame which is constantly trying to illumine the unlit part of you. Then the clarity of Truth will be at your disposal and the application of Truth will also be at your command.</p>  </div>
