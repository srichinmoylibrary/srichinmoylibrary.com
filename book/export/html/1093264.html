<p>When my father was teaching Chitta how to do everything, my father used to play a trick on my brother. My father used to pretend that he was a fool. He used to say wrong things deliberately so that my brother could catch him.</p>
<p>Then he would play another trick. My brother would ask him a serious question and my father would answer in three or four different ways. He would give two or three wrong answers and one correct answer would be mixed in with them. Then my brother had to find the correct answer.</p>  </div>
