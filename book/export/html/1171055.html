<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Kindly imagine a large swimming pool with many people swimming. When you see the people swimming in it, immediately you jump in. But when you are alone in front of the swimming pool, you become afraid. You are afraid that if something happens, no one will be there to save you. At home when you meditate, you have to think of the Centre when other people are meditating. Then you will be able to throw yourself into your meditation without any fear.</p>  </div>
