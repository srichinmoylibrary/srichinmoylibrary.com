<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can get God to answer all your prayers if you just tell God soulfully that you are tired of steering your life-boat all by yourself and that you would like Him to give you a hand. I assure you that out of His infinite Bounty not only will God steer your life-boat for you, but also He will bring the Reality-Shore much nearer.</p>  </div>
