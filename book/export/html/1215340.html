<p>Most of the time people say "Good morning" to me first. On very rare occasions I say "Good morning" first. Sometimes the cars stop quite abruptly so that the people inside can say "Good morning" to me.</p>
<p>The other day, one man came out of his house just to tell me that our celebrations are coming.</p>
