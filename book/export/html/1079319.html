<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the strength of my own highest realisation I wish to say that the Christ was, is and shall always be an avatar. Avatar means the direct representative of God-God in human form. An avatar embodies God's Vision and Reality all at once. With him, Vision and Reality go together. The Christ, Sri Krishna, the Buddha, Sri Ramakrishna, all came from the same Source, but had different names. This moment I call Him Krishna because I like the Krishna form; the next moment I like the Buddha form and I call Him the Buddha; and then I may call Him Ramakrishna or Christ. But they are all eternally one.</p>  </div>
