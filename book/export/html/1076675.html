<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To be very frank with you, I have not the slightest idea of running a Centre here. But, if some of you are interested, after the meeting is over, then I will speak to you. Yesterday, after the meeting was over in Ireland, a few sincere seekers came up to me. We have a Centre in London. There, a young boy named Patrick, who has become my disciple, said that he had three or four friends in Ireland. From London he informed his friends who are studying at Dublin University that I was going to give a talk in Ireland. After the meeting was over, they came up to me and said, "Here we would like to have a Centre under your guidance." They are really sincere and with them we have formed a Centre at Dublin, Ireland. Here also, if you want me to open up a Centre, then kindly see me after the meeting is over.</p>  </div>
