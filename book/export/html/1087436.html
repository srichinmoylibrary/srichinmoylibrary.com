<p>You can learn so much from tennis. Whenever I play, please watch very soulfully.</p>
<p>When I strike the ball, see how the ball surrenders and goes wherever I want it to. Each time I strike the ball, please identify yourself with the ball, and feel that you are surrendering to the will of the Supreme in me. Inwardly you can say the word "surrender." And no matter in which direction I hit the ball, unconditionally it goes there. So feel that you are making your surrender unconditional.</p>
<p>Then when I am serving, please feel that you are serving the Supreme in your Guru. Whenever I serve, please feel that you are serving the Supreme in me with utmost love and devotion.</p>
<p>If you can do these two things, you will get tremendous joy and make tremendous progress when you are watching me play tennis.</p>
