<p>There was a very spiritual man who was also extremely interested in reading. He used to read voraciously. He had a wife and two sons. Since he did not work at a regular job, it was difficult for him to meet with the expenses of his family. He had only a small plot of land, which his sons used to plough and grow rice on. This was their main source of income.</p>
<p>The spiritual seeker used to buy books like anything. His wife was dead against it. She would say to him, "You buy books, and we can't even eat properly."</p>
<p>On one particular day he bought a book for twenty rupees. His wife was furious. "Now we won't be able to eat for two days!"</p>
<p>Her husband said, "No, God will take care of us. Since he has given us mouths, he will bring us food also."</p>
<p>His wife was very skeptical. "This is your spirituality! You read and you talk."</p>
<p>On the following day the seeker received a registered letter. He opened it to find that somebody had sent him forty rupees. The letter said, "Here are forty rupees. Last night I had a dream. I don't know who you are, but in my dream a most luminous person came and told me to send you forty rupees. The luminous being gave me your name and address and said that you were close to him. Since you are very spiritual, he wanted me to send you this money right away. I am sending it registered, in case my dream was not true."</p>
<p>The seeker accepted the letter and his son said, "See, my father is right."</p>
<p>"Your father is right?" said the wife. "It is my worries which made everything all right."</p>
<p>The husband said, "At least there should be something to keep everything all right. It may be your worries, or my prayers, or God's Compassion for us, or my children's luck. But as for me, I feel I know who is responsible and who alone will always be responsible, and that is my Beloved Lord."</p>
