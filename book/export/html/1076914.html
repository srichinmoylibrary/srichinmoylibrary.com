<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How do you know that they have not received the Grace of God? Someone is suffering here, let us say; somebody has been suffering for a couple of months. At the same time, he prays to God most soulfully. I wish to say that this particular person who is suffering would have suffered for perhaps ten years. We do not know how long a person is destined to suffer by his own karma. Even during the suffering if one prays, meditates, contemplates, he will see that the suffering is bound to diminish or the duration of the suffering is being diminished.</p>
<p>The law of karma right now is beyond human comprehension, but if one lives all the time in God's infinite grace, then God will not only perfect that particular devotee and aspirant, but will show him the process of the Divine Grace: how it operates, when it operates and where it operates in a particular disciple.</p>  </div>
