<h2>Editor’s preface</h2>

<p>Prefacing a request for new spiritual questions, I heard Sri Chinmoy remark that although he had answered thousands, he was quite sure there were many, many more that had never been proposed. Now, normally, during the course of my day — and I am sure that this is true of others as well — countless confusions occur in me which are inwardly directed to and illumined by my Master; but right there on the spot, we were all dumbfounded.</p>
<p>So, therefore, did I take it upon myself to transcribe the more appropriate of these perplexities, and I am thrilled by the thought that now, by my Master's kind attention, a few pieces might be added to the great puzzle of life.</p>
