<p>My Lord Captain,<br /> How far am I from realisation?<br /> "First ask Me, My child,<br /> How far you are from aspiration."<br /> My Lord Captain,<br /> How far am I from aspiration?<br /> "First ask Me, My child,<br /> How far you are from purity."<br /> My Lord Captain,<br /> How far am I from purity?<br /> "First ask Me, My child,<br /> How far you are from sincerity."<br /> My Lord Captain,<br /> How far am I from sincerity?<br /> "First ask Me, My child,<br /> How far you are from simplicity."<br /> My Lord Captain,<br /> How far am I from simplicity?<br /> "My child, the distance between<br /> You and your simplicity<br /> Is exactly the same distance<br /> As between what you want<br /> And what you need."<br /> My Lord Captain,<br /> I know I want many, many things.<br /> But I do not know what I actually need.<br /> "My child, you need only one thing:<br /> You need Me and nothing else<br /> And nobody else.<br /> You also have to know what actually happens<br /> When you want something<br /> And you need something.<br /> When you want something,<br /> You want to be the possessor.<br /> When you need something,<br /> You want to be possessed.<br /> The day you want to be possessed by Me,<br /> Only by Me,<br /> Your realisation of Me,<br /> Your complete oneness with Me,<br /> Will be within your easy reach.<br /> So, My child, let Me be your possessor.<br /> You be My conscious and<br /> surrendered possession.<br /> Lo and behold,<br /> You have become your realisation-supreme."</p>
