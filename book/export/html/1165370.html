<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two types of emotions: divine emotions and human emotions. The development of human emotion leads to destruction, but the development of divine emotion leads to illumination, and this illumination is nothing but satisfaction. What is divine emotion? Divine emotion is our oneness with the transcendental Soul and our oneness with the universal Heart. Conscious, inseparable oneness is the divine emotion.</p>  </div>
