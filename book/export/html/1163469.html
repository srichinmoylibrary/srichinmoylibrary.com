<p>Shivaji was succeeded by his eldest son, Shambhuji. The Moghul Emperor Aurangzeb was determined to subdue the son of his old adversary and regain control of Maharashtra. In 1689, Moghul troops captured Shambhuji and tortured him mercilessly. When he refused to become a Muslim or to reveal where the Maratha treasure was hidden, they blinded him and cut out his tongue. A few days later, Shambhuji was executed. The brutal death of Shambhuji caused all the Marathas to unite under the leadership of Rajaram, Shivaji's second son, and to renew their heroic efforts to resist the Moghul domination of India.</p>  </div>
