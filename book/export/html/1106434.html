<p>For the last few days I have not been taking even 600 calories, but I am unable to lose weight. Something has gone wrong. I am stuck at 161 pounds.</p>
<p><em>April 1999</em></p>
<p>A new type of exercise</p>
<p>Today I lifted my 200 pounds simultaneously two times. The second lift was excellent. It went smoothly, then there was another push.</p>
<p>Now it is becoming boring. I need a different type of exercise to get joy.</p>
