<p>There was a time when I prayed to God for all the things I wanted. God heard me and gave me a soulful cry.</p>
<p>There was a time when I prayed to God for all the things I needed. My God heard me and gave me a soulful smile.</p>
<p>There was a time when I prayed to God only for the Truth. He heard me and gave me a soulful embrace.</p>
<p>There was a time when I prayed to God neither for realisation nor for liberation, neither for Infinity nor for Eternity, but for the fulfilment of His own Will. My God heard me and gave me His Breath.</p>
<p>There was a time when God wanted me to be His desire.</p>
<p>I touched His Feet and I became.</p>
<p>There was a time when God wanted me to be His aspiration.</p>
<p>I touched His Heart and I became.</p>
<p>There was a time when God wanted me to be His realisation.</p>
<p>I touched His Soul and I became.</p>
<p>There was a time when God wanted me to be nothing but reality.</p>
<p>I touched His Dream-Boat and I became.</p>  </div>
