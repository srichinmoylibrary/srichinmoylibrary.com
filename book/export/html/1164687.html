  <h1 class="book-heading">A seeker</h1>
  
 
<p>A seeker is a divine hero. His is the life of conquest, outer and inner. In his outer life he conquers teeming temptations every single day. In his inner life he conquers devastating doubts every single day.</p>
<p>A seeker is he who fulfils his soulful promises both to Heaven and to earth. His self-giving role fulfils his promise to Heaven, His self-ascending role fulfils his promise to earth. To give is to become. To ascend is to become. He gives what he has and what he is, and eventually he sees and grows into the universal Reality. He ascends with his heart's devotedness-cry and his life's detachment-smile, and thus he eventually sees and grows into the transcendental Reality.</p>
<p>Unlike most human beings, a seeker knows and feels that every moment is God's choice Hour. He wants to manifest on earth at every moment good thoughts, illumining ideas and fulfilling love. He wants to manifest God-thought, God-will and God-love here on earth. At the same time, he wants to offer his heart's soulful gratitude unreservedly to Heaven, for he knows that all his achievements here on earth are due to direct inspiration and blessingful guidance from above</p>
<p>A seeker-hero equally loves both God the Creator and God the creation. He loves God the Creator with his heart's ever-mounting cry. He loves God the creation with his life's ever-serving readiness. His heart is inseparably one with the Vision of God the Creator. His life is inseparably one with the manifestation of God the creation.</p>
<p>A seeker is a hero-warrior. He conquers himself in order to become man the blossoming God. He conquers God the infinite Compassion in order to become God the fulfilling man on earth.</p>
