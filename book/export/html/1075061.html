  <h1 class="book-heading">490. He</h1>
  
 

<p>He is so indecisive.<br /> He has been meditating<br /> For thirty-three long years;<br /> But still he has not given himself<br /> A spiritual name.</p>
<p>He is so possessive.<br /> He wants to know the names of his<br /> Spiritual great-grandchildren<br /> Who are still sleeping in Heaven.</p>
<p>He is so obsessive.<br /> He wants world-perfection<br /> This very moment.<br /> He feels his own perfection<br /> Can delay;<br /> No harm,<br /> His big heart can wait<br /> And sleep in Eternity's Life.</p>
<p>He is so progressive.<br /> He asks God<br /> To beg him to create<br /> A new world, a world infinitely better<br /> Than God's own world.</p>
