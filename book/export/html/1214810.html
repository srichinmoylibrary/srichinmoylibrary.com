<p>Why do I want to be free?<br />   If I want to be free<br />   Because the rest of the world is bad,<br /> Then God will ask me<br /> To create another world of my own<br />   Since His creation has failed me.   But if I want to be free<br />   So that I can be of greater service<br />   To my sisters and brothers,<br />   To God's entire creation,<br /> Then God in me selects the hour,<br /> And at that choice hour<br />   The aspiring human in me achieves<br />   Freedom from life's ignorance-night.</p>
<p>If I want to be free<br /> To love the world,<br />   To be part and parcel of the world,<br /> Then God is all eagerness<br />   To grant me freedom.<br /> But if I want to be free<br /> Because the world is full of ignorance,<br /> The world is nothing but a devouring tiger,<br />   Then God feels that I am not the right person<br />   For Him to grant freedom to.<br /> He will grant me freedom<br />   Only when He sees that this freedom<br />   Is for dedicated service,<br /> For the transformation of the Human race.</p>
