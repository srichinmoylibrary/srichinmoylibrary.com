    <title>Question: Guru, before going to bed lately, I&#039;ve been praying just to have a silent sleep, because I don&#039;t like to have bad dreams. Should I keep on doing this, or should I just let dreams come that come?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First meditate on the heart and feel the real presence of light. Then take this light and throw it into the dark abyss of the navel for purification. Then you cannot have any bad dreams because your vital will be illumined.</p>  </div>
