<p>My Captain, I want success.<br /> "Then, My child, open your hands."<br /> My Captain, I want progress.<br /> "Then, My child, open your heart."<br /> My Captain, I want perfection.<br /> "Then, My child, open your life."<br /> Captain, my Captain, how is it that<br /> I am unable to open my hands?<br /> "I cannot tell you why,<br /> But I am extremely happy<br /> That you are unable to open your hands."<br /> Captain, my Captain, how is it that<br /> I am unable to open my heart?<br /> "I cannot tell you why,<br /> But I am extremely happy<br /> That you are unable to open your heart."<br /> Captain, my Captain, how is it that<br /> I am unable to open my life?<br /> "I cannot tell you why,<br /> But I am extremely happy<br /> That you are unable to open your life."<br /> My Captain, why are You so cruel to me?<br /> Do You not want my success?<br /> Do You not want my progress?<br /> Do You not want my perfection?<br /> "My child, I do want your success,<br /> I do want your progress<br /> And I do want your perfection.<br /> But you are such a fool<br /> That you want your success,<br /> Progress and perfection<br /> Without wanting Me first.<br /> Your success, progress and perfection<br /> Will never be able to give you real satisfaction<br /> Unless you have Me first in your life.<br /> "Your surrender-oneness-mind,<br /> Your surrender-oneness-heart,<br /> Your surrender-oneness-life to Me<br /> Can alone give you ceaseless joy,<br /> breathless joy<br /> And limitless joy.<br /> If you have Me first as your constant<br /> Oneness-Possession-Treasure,<br /> Then only will your success<br /> Be My Eternity's Seed,<br /> Your progress, My Infinity's Flower<br /> And your perfection, My Immortality's Fruit."<br /> My Captain, at Your Forgiveness-Feet I sit.<br /> To Your Compassion-Eye I bow.</p>
