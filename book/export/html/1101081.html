<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, certainly. The practice of Kriya Yoga undoubtedly hastens and expedites the process. Like other branches of Yoga, Kriya Yoga will also expedite the spiritual journey. It really depends on the individual seeker. If you like Kriya Yoga more than other Yogas, then you are at perfect liberty to practise Kriya Yoga. If somebody likes some other form of Yoga, then naturally he will practise this Yoga. No matter which Yoga you follow, if it is sincere and genuine and self-giving, it is bound to expedite your goal.</p>  </div>
