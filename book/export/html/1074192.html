<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Usually fairies like many colours. They like gaudy clothes, all different colours: green, red, black. But angels donâ€™t like gaudy colours. They like subtle, ethereal, delicate colours. Their beauty is very ethereal, simple, shining. If you see an angel, you really feel something. But if you see a fairy, it is like going and mixing with a child.</p>  </div>
