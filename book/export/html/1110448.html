<p>Love is the mother of stupendous ecstasy and deepest pangs, and also she is the daughter of emotion. But no love is simultaneously as ambrosial and as venomous as self-love.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Love in France is a comedy; in England a tragedy; in Italy an opera seria; and in Germany a melodrama."</p>
<p>— Marguerite Blessington</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And love in India is self-dedication.</p>
<p>Love is all-where. It is the common messenger of God and man. Tagore writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We know that we are born of love — our relationship is of love, and we feel that our father and mother are the true symbols of our eternal relationship with God.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To quote one of his most beautiful lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One word keep for me in thy silence, O world, when I am dead: ‘I have loved.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is but love which is never anxious of satisfying itself. And it is love alone that runs across the giant breast of Death, and perhaps beyond.</p>  </div>
