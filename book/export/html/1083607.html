<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is all Freedom. He has every right to change His mind provided He knows that this change is going to be an improvement, a better accomplishment and a more fulfilling manifestation of Light on earth. When you change your mind it is because your mind is restless and it cannot achieve anything substantial. But when God changes His mind He proves to Himself and others that His Capacity is endless.</p>  </div>
