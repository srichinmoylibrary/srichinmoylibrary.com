<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, she has been my mother. Over the centuries, most of my family members, specially the boys, have been fortunate to be blessed by the Avatars and great spiritual Masters. Some of us came with Sri Krishna, some with Jesus Christ, some with Sri Chaitanya and some with Sri Ramakrishna.</p>  </div>
