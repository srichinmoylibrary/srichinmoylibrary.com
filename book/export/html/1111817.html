<p>In our 24-hour race this weekend, Kim was the nicest runner; she was nice all the time. Next was crazy Nathan. Every time he passed me, he had to say some crazy thing. But he was also very nice.</p>
<p>Once Nathan said to me, "Do you have a moment?" At that point I was walking and he was running. He continued, "I want to sing song for you."</p>
<p>I said, "That is fine."</p>
<p>His song was, "Oh, what a wonderful sponsor you are. I will owe it all to you." Then he sang it again. He had set a very nice tune to it, so I thanked him.</p>
<p>The funniest thing Nathan said was about meditation and contemplation. He asked me, "Do you meditate while you are walking and running?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He said, "I thought so. I can't meditate, but I contemplate." I said, "That is the highest state. That means you are higher than I am."</p>
<p>He looked at me and said, "It can't be higher than meditation." His wife is also very nice, but she does not act so crazy.</p>
