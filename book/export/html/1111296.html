<p>The management of the race was far from perfection. Sometimes the water stations were on the right side of the street, sometimes they were on the left side. It didn't bother me, because my disciples were supplying me with ERG. But others I saw. Sometimes they were running on this side of the street and they had to cross to the other side.</p>
<p>And a horrible thing! They allowed the vehicles to run along the same route. After eleven miles it was so difficult to run. When we had only six miles left, we had to run in the city of Athens. There it was infinitely worse.</p>
<p>You are running this way when, all of a sudden, from the side street cars will enter. Policemen hold the runners and let the cars pass. Here we are dying to reach the destination one minute sooner, and the policeman will say: "Stop!"</p>
