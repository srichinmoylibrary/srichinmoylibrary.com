<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can keep our outer education from being an obstacle to our inner education by allowing the inner education to come to the fore and illumine the outer education.</p>
<p>The outer education is world-information; the inner education is self-realisation. It is only self-realisation that can illumine and transform world-information and take world-information into another world, which is known as the experience-world.</p>  </div>
