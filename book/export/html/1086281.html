<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the highest spiritual point of view there is no outer explanation. Most of the people who will come, I feel, will not be truly advanced seekers. It is only that I am executing the Supreme's command. But on the physical plane and on the mental plane I can say that some people can meditate for only five minutes when they try to meditate for, say, an hour. If these people were asked to meditate only for five minutes, then they would not be able to meditate at all. So during these seven hours, instead of only five minutes, some people will have all together an hour or forty-five minutes of deep meditation.</p>  </div>
