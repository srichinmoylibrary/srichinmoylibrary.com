<p>Worship is God-reaching aspiration within, God-manifesting devotion without.</p>
<p>The human in us secretly expects the worship of patronage-fulness. The divine in us sincerely waits for the right moment to expect fellowship-oneness.</p>
<p>Worship man. Imperfection-frustration will chase you. Worship God. Opposition-destruction will surrender to you.</p>
<p>We worship. Unconsciously we worship fear-torture. Consciously we worship courage-rapture.</p>
<p>We worship. Unconsciously we worship jealousy-seed. Consciously we worship friendliness-fruit.</p>
<p>We worship. Unconsciously we worship doubt-kingdom. Consciously we worship faith-freedom.</p>
<p>We worship. Unconsciously we worship ignorance-night around us. Consciously we worship wisdom-light within us.</p>  </div>
