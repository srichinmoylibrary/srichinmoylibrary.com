<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there is a special way and is called “conscious aspiration”, and this conscious aspiration should come from the body; from the physical, the vital, the mental, the psychic and the soul. Of course, the soul has been all the time aspiring. The physical, the vital, the mind and psychic have to be aware of this aspiring consciousness, and when we consciously aspire in all different parts of our being we will be able to accelerate the achievement of liberation.</p>  </div>
