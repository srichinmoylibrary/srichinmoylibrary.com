<p>When Tagore came to Pondicherry to see Sri Aurobindo, he practically ran six or seven metres to embrace Sri Aurobindo, according to the people who were there. But Sri Aurobindo was Sri Aurobindo. He did not allow Tagore to embrace him. Then they had a most significant interview. Afterwards, on his way back in the boat, Tagore said, “I can clearly see Sri Aurobindo has got what he has sought for. I saw him.”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
