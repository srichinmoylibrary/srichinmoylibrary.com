<p>This is a cock and bull story. When I was a child in Chittagong, my family usually had two servants — one young and one old.</p>
<p>After tonight's concert, one boy came up to meditate with me after the concert. While we were meditating together, his soul said, "Madalia, you cannot recognise me?"</p>
<p>Not only did he use the nickname from my childhood, Madal, but he said it with an endearing term. I said, "Who can call me by my Chittagong name with this kind of endearing term? In my house, even my sisters and brothers didn't call me that, and here this young German boy is addressing me this way!"</p>
<p>Then the soul said that he had been our servant in Chittagong and he gave his former name. Then vividly I could see and remember him. I had heard that he had died, and now I see that he has taken a new incarnation in Germany. I was looking into his eyes and his soul recognised me.</p>
