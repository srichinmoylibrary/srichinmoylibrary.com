<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They do inform me, but sometimes the soul will know only five minutes or half an hour before. It is not that the soul will know twenty years before. And sometimes it happens that an accidental death is caused by a very powerful hostile force, and in this case the soul itself may not know. Somebody has stayed on earth seventy or eighty years, and a terrible hostile force has attacked, but the soul is not aware. The soul is supposed to be always conscious, but sometimes when it mixes with the physical and the mind, the soul is unable to operate with eternal and inseparable oneness with the Supreme. The soul is covered layer by layer, and it becomes difficult for the soul's light to come forward.</p>  </div>
