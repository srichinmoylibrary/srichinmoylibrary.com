<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, you can live with God instead of with your mother and father. Although God is in Heaven, He is also on earth in the form of your father and in the form of your mother. He feels that if you live here on earth with your parents, you are staying with Him. He has two houses. He wants you to stay in one house with your parents. It is a very beautiful house. The other house He is still building; it is not yet complete. When His house is complete, then God will ask you to live in that house.</p>
<p>God is bound to come to you when you are in real difficulty if you pray to Him every day. If you pray to God every day, then you will see God's most beautiful Form. When you see a beautiful child or flower, you say to your mother, "Look how beautiful!" But when you see God face to face, you will be surprised because He is infinitely more beautiful than You can imagine.</p>
<p>To pray to God, you don't have to ask your parents for anything. In order to buy shirts or shoes or anything else, you need money. But in order to see God, you don't need money; you only need prayer. Prayer is so easy. It is like drinking water. Just pray and you will get Him. When you get Him, He has everything: He can give you millions of dollars; He can give you tremendous Joy; He can give you anything. Please pray to God and you will get everything you need.</p>  </div>
