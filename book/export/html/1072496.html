<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are using the expression, “When I am asleep,” but when you are sleeping, how do you know what is happening? When you are sleeping, you are not aware. Only afterwards, when you get up early in the morning can you know that you have been energised. One day you will feel energised and fresh when you wake up; another day you will feel very weak and tired. But only spiritual Masters can feel what is happening to them during sleep, because they can easily keep the soul separate from the body, and the soul can observe the body. A spiritual Master can totally separate sleep from his wakeful consciousness. I can be sleeping soundly, but I will be fully conscious of what I am doing, and can see what is going on around me. From the spiritual point of view, I am totally awake. My body is sleeping at the same time that my consciousness is awake.</p>
<p>You don’t know what is happening while you are sleeping. When you get up early in the morning and you are energised, you have to feel that at night while you were sleeping, or just before you went to sleep, some divine forces were able to come to the fore from within. That’s why you feel extremely energetic the following day. Or it may happen that you have received extra unconditional divine Grace from above. If you do not feel energised, wrong forces may have entered into you, or you did not aspire at all. That is why you are lethargic.</p>
<p>It is a very good practise to meditate before you go to sleep for at least half an hour. And people who have vital problems, emotional problems, should please concentrate on their navel centre for purity before they go to sleep.</p>  </div>
