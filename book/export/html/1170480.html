<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ignorance is so bad! In some cases we do cherish ignorance; in other cases we do not, but somebody is making us feel that we are cherishing ignorance. A child may not like to eat a certain food, but the mother keeps on begging him to eat it or forces the food into the child's mouth, saying, "It is very tasty; it is good for you." Finally, the child becomes sick of hearing the mother and says, "Yes, it is very nice."</p>
<p>You have already made your choice between ignorance and wisdom, but somebody is making you feel that you are cherishing ignorance.</p>  </div>
