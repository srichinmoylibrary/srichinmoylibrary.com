<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In some cases, some of the workers in the United Nations are specially chosen by some higher forces to work at the United Nations. Again, in some cases it is mere chance. But if one works devotedly and soulfully, no matter what brought him to the United Nations or how he came to the United Nations, then by virtue of his selfless service he becomes a chosen instrument of the soul of the United Nations.</p>  </div>
