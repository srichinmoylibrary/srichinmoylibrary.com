  <h1 class="book-heading">Peace requires effort</h1>
  
 
<p>We are badly mistaken if we think that peace will miraculously enter into our lives unconditionally. The Secretary-General's guiding eye tells us that to achieve peace we need both fearless persistence and endless faith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Let us not forget that peace does not come accidentally or automatically. The impressive progress we are making to end a number of conflicts is the result of hard effort, in some cases over many years. The United Nations has been at the forefront of that effort."</p>
