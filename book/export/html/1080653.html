<p>Dear Sri Chinmoy,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for a pleasant afternoon. Your hospitality was greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><em>(From comments to her daughter)</em></p>
<p>I felt a very, very warm feeling from everybody getting together. Everyone was very generous and hospitable and I felt at home. The restaurant was tremendously clean; everything was spotless. I felt the question and answer time was very good and all the questions that were asked were good for me. I also found the Primer informative as to the nature of Guru's path.</p>
