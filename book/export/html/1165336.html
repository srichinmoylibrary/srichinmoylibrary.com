<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme is using His law of karma. Suppose the parents have done something seriously wrong to this girl in a previous incarnation. Now the soul says, “All right, in this incarnation I am going to purify you. I will linger and linger and linger. You will have to pay the penalty for your wrong action. In this incarnation I am taking revenge.” If the soul knows that the patient is not going to be cured, and if the family members know, then at that time it is revenge.</p>
<p>Either the soul is enjoying the experience, or it is waiting for the right moment to leave, or it is just having an experience. We feel that the person is really dead, but who knows what kind of experience the soul is having? Instead of five minutes, this can go on for five years. Anything is possible. Again, it may not be a healthy experience, but the soul wants to go through it. Ordinary human beings often do something for many years just to show the world that it is possible, but that very thing need not be encouraging or inspiring.</p>  </div>
