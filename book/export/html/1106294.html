<p>There is a great bodybuilder whose name is Clarence Bass. Every Friday, for three hours, he used to answer questions free of charge. You could call him on the telephone and he would answer. So a few times Databir called him and one of the other boys has also called a few times. Alas, when Clarence Bass began getting so many questions, he said he would charge. His free advice stopped!</p>
