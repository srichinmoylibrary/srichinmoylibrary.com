<p><em>(Rama, Lakshmana and the ministers and elders.)</em></p>
<p>RAMA: What am I going to do? I have to keep my promise. Lakshmana is dearer than my life, but a promise is a promise.</p>
<p>LAKSHMANA: Rama, do not feel sorry. Do not weep. You have to keep your promise. You must kill me according to your promise. I will be happy to be killed by you. There can be no greater joy than to be punished by you. There can be no better death than to be killed by you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: O Rama, since it was your promise that you would put to death any intruder, I wish you to banish your brother from the Kingdom. This punishment is equivalent to killing him.</p>
<p>RAMA: For me to live without my brother Lakshmana is also my death. To be away from him, not to see him around me, is my worst death.</p>
<p>LAKSHMANA <em>(bowing):</em> Brother, Father, you are my All. I want the world to see that you are the Incarnation of Truth. You have established the Kingdom of <em>Dharma.</em> Your promise and your life can never be separated. They are one and inseparable. I am now leaving the palace. I will go and meditate on the bank of the Sarayu, and when the time comes I shall jump into the river and give up my life.</p>
<p>RAMA: O joy of my heart, O love of my heart, O power of my heart, you are leaving me. You are embracing death. Because of your constant sacrifice, this world knows me. And in the other world, I will also be known because of your sacrifice. I will be adored and worshipped. O brother of my heart and soul, O brother of eternity, you have followed me everywhere; wherever I have gone you have followed me like my own shadow. When Father sent me into exile, when I had to bring Sita back from Ravana, you followed me. But now, O Lakshmana, I shall follow you. I shall follow your life-breath. You go and reserve my place in the other world, in the world of the Beyond. I am coming.</p>
<p><em>(Lakshmana bows to his brother and begins to leave)</em></p>
<p><em>(Rama sings.)</em></p>
<p><em>Deshe deshe cha bandhabah</em><br /><em>Tantu desha na pashyami</em><br /><em>Yatra bratha sahodara.</em></p>
<p>RAMA: In all countries there are wives, in all countries there are friends, but I shall not find a brother like Lakshmana anywhere in this world.</p>  </div>
