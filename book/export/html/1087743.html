  <h1 class="book-heading">Softness</h1>
  
 
<p>Softness includes affection, love, sympathy and the feeling of oneness. It is not just using polite or kind words. No! One has to be totally plastic. One has to all the time feel others' sufferings as one's very own. Sympathy has to be the first and foremost thing in one's life, sympathy and the feeling of oneness. There cannot be anything greater than the feeling of oneness and this feeling of oneness starts with softness.</p>  </div>
