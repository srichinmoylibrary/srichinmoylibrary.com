<p>“Lord, reform Thy world, beginning with me.” This is a prayer of a Chinese Christian, which President Roosevelt quoted at a press conference in 1941.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, I know. I know that my nature’s transformation is the answer to the world’s transformation.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, I know. I know that my heart’s purity and my life’s humility comprise my soul’s magnanimity.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, I know. I know that my love of You is my journey. I know that my surrender to You is my Destination.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, I know. I know that in my desire-world I am the abyss of nothingness. I know that in my aspiration-world I am the sea of fulness.</p>
<p>Yesterday, my Lord, I came to You proudly and haughtily. Today, my Lord, I have come to You devotedly and unreservedly. Tomorrow, my Lord, I shall come to You soulfully and unconditionally. Lord, my Lord, when I speak to the world about You, it is not my personal opinion. It is the revelation of my sweet oneness-relation with You.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, do make me see and feel that my heart’s perfection-cry has to be continued and transcended.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, do make me see and feel that my life’s satisfaction-smile has to be renewed daily and pursued.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord.</p>
