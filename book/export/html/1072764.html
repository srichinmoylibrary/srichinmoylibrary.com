<p><em>The original Bengali poem presented in this volume was written by Chinmoy in Pondicherry, India, on August 14th, 1945 — the day before Sri Aurobindo's Birth Day. Chinmoy was then thirteen years old.</em></p>
<p><em>The poem became a song in New York on July 8th, 1995 — fifty years later. It is the longest song of all Sri Chinmoy's musical compositions.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy began translating this Bengali song into English on June 9th, 1996. He completed the translation on August 4th so that it might be released on August 15th.</em></p>  </div>
