<p>Amrita-da: "Chinmoy, you have done a great service to Nolini by writing a most significant poem.</p>
<p>"Chinmoy, don't think that people are not jealous of Nolini. There are many people in the Ashram who are extremely jealous of him. I pity them. God alone knows when they will realise, let alone reach, his height. But to be sure, you and I are not jealous of Nolini. To me Nolini is not only my elder brother and adviser, but also my eternal friend.</p>
<p>"Chinmoy, how old are you?"</p>
<p>"I am thirty."</p>
<p>"You are not even half my age!"</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>A service-flame and a service-sun</em>, Agni Press, 1974<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/sfss-3</p></small>    </div>  </body>
