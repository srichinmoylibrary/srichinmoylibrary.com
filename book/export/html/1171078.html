<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I eat something, do I not feel at that time strength or joy? If I eat the right thing, then immediately I get joy and energy. Again, if I eat something not good for my health, then immediately I know. So if I pray and meditate sincerely early in the morning, then I will feel some energy, some strength, some joy. If I can feel these qualities during my prayer and meditation, it is definitely progress.</p>  </div>
