<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dearest child, one can never experience delight from ordinary worldly things or events. Spiritual delight is something that we eventually achieve or grow into on the strength of our highest aspiration and deepest dedication. What one experiences from ordinary worldly things is transitory pleasure or, on rare occasions, a kind of incomplete or human joy. Complete joy is not to be found in material things. Why? Material things are not consciously and constantly aspiring to become divine and perfect.</p>  </div>
