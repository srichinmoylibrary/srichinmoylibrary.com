<h2>Question: What is the difference between jealousy and admiration?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If somebody achieves something and you are jealous, you will definitely know it. You will feel that you are ready to stab that person. Jealousy is just like a knife. When you are jealous, you yourself become a naked sword. If you are given the chance, then in total darkness you will stab the person. During the day you are afraid that you will be caught, so you try to hide it. Inwardly you try to conquer your jealousy because you feel that either in the inner world or in the outer world you will be caught red-handed.</p>
<p>But if it is sincere admiration, then you have a feeling of an ideal in your life. You can't do what some other person has done, but you admire him and his action. That means that you have a spontaneous feeling to achieve or grow into the very thing that he has achieved. This is your sincere admiration.</p>  </div>
