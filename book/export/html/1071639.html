<p>Bat, my bat,<br /> With your strange peculiarity-light you see at night,<br /> And we see during the day.<br /> Therefore you and men are equal.<br /> Let us try to increase our capacities.<br /> You try to see during the day<br /> And we during the night.<br /> God is merciful. Let us pray;<br /> He will grant us His deathless Ray.</p>
