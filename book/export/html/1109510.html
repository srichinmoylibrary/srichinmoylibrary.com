<p>George Bernard Shaw has warned us, "Beware of the man whose God is in the skies." But our God is everywhere. He is not only in Heaven, He is also here on earth. He is with us, He is within us and He is for us. We do not have to enter the highest regions of consciousness to see God: our inner cry will bring to the fore our inner divinity, which is nothing other than God.</p>  </div>
