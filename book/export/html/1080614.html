<p><em>On 11 September 1986 Sri Chinmoy once more visited Leonard Bernstein at the Dakota Building, where the Maestro lived in Manhattan. First they met privately in Mr. Bernstein's study and then came into the living room to hear a performance by the Sri Chinmoy choir. Following are excerpts from the meeting.</em></p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Aren't you ladies beautiful! Why don't the men have robes, too? They have to have ties and look like bank clerks, and the women look so ravishing in saris. Six years ago there were 40 of you, and now you are just a select few. <em>(Jokingly)</em> Did the others defect, or is it just that you are the choice ones?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They are the choicest. We have not fired anybody.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> So nobody defected; nobody went over to the other side. Well, Master, where do you want me?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please sit here.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Then I cannot see the conductor. Oh good, now this is fine. I have to feel your biceps now, Sri Chinmoy! You do one-arm weightlifting. I have received a whole book on your weightlifting.</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> He has lifted 300 pounds with one arm.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> 300 pounds! Through meditation and the love of God, of course!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Love of God and prayer.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Well, this is extraordinary! You have been rehearsing all night?</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> This time we had a few days.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Oh good! The last time I remember you stayed up all night.</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> It is amazing that you remember that.</p>  </div>
