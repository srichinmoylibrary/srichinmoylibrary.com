<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can easily know if we are following God's Will or if we are motivated by our own desires and propensities. When we do something, if we can offer the result of our action with the same joy, the same cheerfulness, whether it is success or failure, then we know we are following God's Will. If we are not disturbed if we fail and if we do not expect to be extolled to the skies if we succeed, if we can take each action as an experience that the Supreme is having in and through us, then it is God's Will we are carrying out.</p>  </div>
