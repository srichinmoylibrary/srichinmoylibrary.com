<p>When I went to the World Masters Games held in Puerto Rico in September, on the registration form I wrote down my nationality as Indian. But the officials cancelled it and instead put Puerto Rican. That is how I became Puerto Rican and held the Puerto Rican flag during the march past.</p>
<p>Every day I got such tremendous joy and inspiration from the Masters Games. I enjoyed them like anything! They really created a Kingdom of Heaven on earth. The inspiration from the Games will last for some time. Now I want to break my own records. My goal is transcendence.</p>
