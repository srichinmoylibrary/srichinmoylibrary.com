<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is everywhere but if you want to see Him immediately, then look for Him inside your own heart and nowhere else. He looks exactly like you but in an infinitely more beautiful form. He wants to appear before you the same way your soul wants Him to.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>I am telling you a great secret: you are a fantastic Dream of God</em>, Agni Press, 1974<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/gsdg-20</p></small>    </div>  </body>
