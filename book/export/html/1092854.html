<p>Even regarding Netaji's plane crash and death, Nehru's own public pronouncements contradicted each other. Either Nehru suffered from uncertainty-nights or perhaps he deliberately wished to mould reality-day in his own way!</p>
<p>More than ten years after Netaji's plane crash, Nehru announced at a huge gathering that Netaji was definitely not alive. Later Nehru went to Japan to see Netaji's ashes.</p>
<p>On another occasion, Nehru declared that he was "fully satisfied" that the actual date of Netaji's death was 13 May 1962! Not long after that, Netaji's nephew, Amiya Nath, requested Nehru to order an enquiry into Netaji's death by the Justice of the Supreme Court. Nehru agreed that it was "absolutely necessary to come to a conclusion with regard to the authenticity of Netaji's death."</p>
<p>From where to where! Alas, in 1964 Nehru passed on. God alone knows if Nehru deliberately misrepresented the truth or if he himself was a captive of uncertainty.</p>  </div>
