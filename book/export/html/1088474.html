<p>We are all under the laws of Mother-Earth. Mother-Earth is under the laws of Heaven. Heaven is under the express Law of God. But our doubt, our cherished doubt, is under its own law. Its law is frustration, and in frustration destruction looms large.</p>
<p>Why do we doubt? Because we are wanting in proper understanding. There was a great spiritual saint named Kabir, who said, "Listen to me, brothers. He understands who loves."</p>
<p>If we love, then we understand; and if we understand the truth, then we have neither the opportunity nor the necessity to cherish even an iota of doubt in our day-to-day existence.</p>  </div>
