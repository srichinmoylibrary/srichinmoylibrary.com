<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way is for you to see beauty in her all the time. What you see within her will automatically come forward in her life. Her outer life will be an expression of her inner life. You have sown the seed of beauty in her. Now allow it to germinate and water it always.</p>  </div>
