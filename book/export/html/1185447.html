 <p>
TFM 5. These are excerpts from an interview broadcast on 24 January 1976.</p>
<h2><em>Steve Powers:</em> I'd like to introduce you to a special guest. His name is Sri Chinmoy. I welcome you, Sri Chinmoy. My first question is: When did you feel that you wanted to devote your life to spirituality?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I was quite young, I felt deep within me an inner urge to realise God and to be of service to God.</p>
<p><em>Steve Powers:</em> Do you think that is in every person?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is within every person, but one has to cultivate this reality. It is like a muscle. If you take exercise, then you develop the muscle.</p>
<p><em>Steve Powers:</em> Why is that not more natural to us? Shouldn’t that just come naturally?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It comes naturally, but the difficulty is that we have been wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance for millennia. Then there comes a time when we start walking along the right path. Once we are well established in our path, it becomes normal and spontaneous.</p>
<p><em>Steve Powers:</em> Why do we have so many problems finding that path? Especially in our society today, people are awfully confused. People do not know which way to go, what to believe in, what not to believe in, what is the truth, what is not the truth, what is good and what is evil. And there is such tremendous input into our minds of new ideas that it’s difficult for us to know what is good and what is not.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, most people are living in the mind. In the mind, the question of good and bad thoughts, divine and undivine thoughts, plays a considerable role. But if we live in the heart where we find oneness and identification, then we go beyond duality. We suffer from confusion and live in confusion because we live most of the time in the mind — the doubting mind, suspicious mind, intellectual mind, sophisticated mind. If we can live in the heart — the loving heart, the aspiring heart, the oneness-heart — then this confusion will not arise.</p>  </div>
