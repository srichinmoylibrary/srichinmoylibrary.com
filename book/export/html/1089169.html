<p><em>Animesh Harrington:</em> When you start running again, you will have to run against Steve Jones and other top runners. Do you think you can get down to the 2: 07 mark?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> Absolutely yes!</p>
<p><em>Animesh:</em> And the world record?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> I would like to break it.</p>  </div>
