<p><em>Mr. Jim Knight:</em> Ladies and Gentlemen: Sri Chinmoy Kumar Ghose, the Spiritual Director of the Aum Centres of Puerto Rico and New York, has come to Puerto Rico for the fifth time. A man with profound insight, with abundant spiritual wisdom, with a glowing heart to serve the Supreme and humanity, Sri Chinmoy was born thirty-six years ago in Bengal, India. He spent his childhood and youth in a spiritual institution in South India where he practised the spiritual discipline and prepared himself for his divine mission. He was prompted by the Divine within him to come to the West and share his spiritual realisation with the sincere seekers of the Supreme.</p>
<p>So in 1964 he came to the United States. He has lectured on Indian philosophy and Yoga to many groups both large and small: schools, churches, synagogues and other interested groups. In 1965 he began the publication of his spiritual writings in a small monthly journal, entitled AUM, which dealt with the Indian spiritual discipline and the higher Light and Wisdom of Yoga.</p>
<p>In July, 1965 he came to Puerto Rico on a lecture tour and it was here that the first Aum Centre was established. The following year the Aum Centre of New York City was established. Since then Sri Chinmoy has been helping the disciples of both Centres, besides helping groups in different cities such as Washington, D. C., Miami, Florida and Jamaica, West Indies. He comes to visit his Centre in Puerto Rico every few months and we have the pleasure of having him here this morning. He will be glad to answer any questions and we are going to do that in just a few moments. First of all, let's give you the address. The Aum Centre here in San Juan is located at Miramar Avenue, Stop 11, Santurce..</p>
<p>Now this morning we have Sri Chinmoy here in the studio. He will give us an example of a prayer chant in Sanskrit to start the program.</p>
<p>[Sri Chinmoy sings a Shloka from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, you have been listening to Sri Chinmoy Ghose chanting a prayer, which, to those of us in the western world, was quite foreign. We are going to get into that and find out what that was about and we have very many questions to ask Sri Chinmoy this morning.</p>
<p>With us in our studio we have Miss Dorothy Eisaman, Mr. and Mrs. Jose L. Casanova, Miss Carmen Suro, Mr. Ramon Torres Pena, Mr. Ed Belville and acting with me this morning in the process of asking the questions, is Mr. George Riddell.</p>  </div>
