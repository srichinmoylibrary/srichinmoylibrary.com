 <p></p>
<h2>1. The Guru</h2>

<p>The Guru sees in his disciple the very image of God; so he is all sacrifice to the disciple. The disciple sees and feels in his Guru the only shelter of his limitations; so he is all love for his Guru.</p>
<p>The Guru's love for his disciple is his strength. The disciple's surrender towards his Guru is the disciple's strength.</p>
<p>The Guru is at once the source of the disciple's achievements and a most faithful servant of the disciple's love.</p>
<p>The Guru has only one compassionate weapon: forgiveness. The disciple has three naked swords: limitation, weakness and ignorance. Nevertheless, the Guru wins with great ease.</p>
<p>To achieve realisation by oneself alone is like crossing the ocean in a raft. But to achieve realisation through the grace of a Guru is like crossing the ocean in a swift and strong boat, which ferries you safely across the sea of ignorance to the Golden Shore.</p>
<p>O disciple, do you know the most foolish customer on earth? He is your Guru and your Guru alone. He buys your ignorance and gives you knowledge; he buys your impotence and gives you power. Can you ever imagine a more foolish bargain? Now learn the name of your Guru's foolishness: compassion and nothing else.</p>  </div>
