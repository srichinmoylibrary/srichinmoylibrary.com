<p>Perfection: what is it? It is an ever-transcending reality. Perfection is to reach Divinity's feet with humanity's heart. Perfection is to change the lifestyle of the finite world and to manifest the life-style of the Infinite.</p>
<p>Perfection is not self-justification. Perfection is not self-proclamation. Perfection is not self-annihilation. Perfection is God-invitation, God-adoration and God-satisfaction.</p>
<p>Perfection is to have sterling faith in God's constant Compassion. Perfection is to have staunch faith in man's crying aspiration.</p>
<p>Who says that perfection on earth is self-delusion? Perfection is God-glorification in man.</p>
<p>Who says that perfection is a far cry? No, it is nearer than the heart-beat, nearer than the life-breath.</p>
<p>Something more: perfection embodies God the aspiring, evolving, transcending, illumining and fulfilling man.</p>
