<p>You are telling me<br /> That something is wrong with your life,<br /> But you do not know<br /> What it is.<br /> I tell you what you must do now.<br /> Just be happy<br /> And remain happy,<br /> For the supreme discovery<br /> You have already made:<br /> The front door and the side door<br /> Are already kept open.<br /> By whom?<br /> By God Himself.<br /> He is desperately looking<br /> For your return.</p>
