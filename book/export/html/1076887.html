<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one wants to work for the world, in the world, then no matter how high he goes, he will be granted the opportunity to come back; not only the opportunity but the assurance of the Divine that he can come back because God wants him to work for the world and manifest the Divine here on earth.</p>  </div>
