<p>Many times at the Indian Consulate I wore suits and jackets that did not fit me at all because somebody used to give me his old clothes. His name was Arthur Gregor. He was a senior editor at Macmillan Publishing Company and a friend of Samie and Eric. He was much taller than I was and almost twice as large, so his clothes were much too big for me. But necessity knows no law. I did not have money to buy winter jackets or proper suits and it was so cold. He was so nice to me. He had another Guru, but he had such admiration and respect for me.</p>  </div>
