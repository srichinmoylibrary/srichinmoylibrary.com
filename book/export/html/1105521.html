<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you have many things to do, at that time you remind yourself so that you won't forget something. On earth you have twenty things to do at a time, so you constantly remind yourself of the thing that you consider most important in your life. Otherwise, the important thing you will miss. And sometimes you forget even the most important thing, while the most unimportant thing you do. If you feel that you have many, many things to reach in the spiritual life, then naturally there will be tremendous confusion and you will forget. But instead of reminding yourself, feel that there is nothing else for you to do except the most important thing. If you feel, "There is only one thing to do: to surrender to the Will of the Supreme," then why will you have to remind yourself twenty-four hours a day to do it? The Christ revealed the supreme secret when he said, "Let Thy Will be done." In the spiritual life, you should feel that surrender not only is the most important thing, it is the only thing.</p>  </div>
