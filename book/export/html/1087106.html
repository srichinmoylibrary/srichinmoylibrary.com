<p>After overpaying for the jacket, I went to a bakery. I told the lady to give me a dozen cookies. She said, "I am sorry. We only have eleven."I said, "Fine, then give me eleven!"</p>
<p>She could have easily pretended that she had given me twelve. Who is counting? But some sincere people do exist. That's why we are still alive.</p>
<p>Eight or nine months ago I drank some tea in that bakery. The lady still remembers. She always says, "You don't want tea?"</p>
<p>This is that famous shop that always burns down. Previously there was another owner. He used to shake hands with me and give me everything half price.</p>
<p>Whatever the item was, he used to give me half for free.</p>
