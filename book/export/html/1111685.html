<p>This morning when I was returning home after running five miles, all of a sudden somebody's soul came to me and asked for special blessings. I said, "All right. I am dying now, but you need blessings." So I blessed the person. Then I said, "I hope you do really well in the 12-hour walk."</p>
<p>Two seconds later I just raise my eyes, and I saw that same person right in front of me. It was Sunanda the great. She is the only one whom I saw while I was running today. Her soul had come to me one second earlier.</p>
