<blockquote>
<p>"It's never too late to have a happy childhood."</p>
<p>Tom Robbins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement is absolutely true. Here and now, anybody-no matter how old he is-can have the happiest childhood, provided he does not drag along his past and he does not invite the uncertain future. He has to depend entirely on the newness of his hope and the fulness of his promise to himself. Then he can easily have a happy childhood once more.</p>  </div>
