<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each individual has two beings: the demanding vital and the surrendering heart. A conflict between the two is happening daily in you. At the end of the day, if you are conscious, you will know how many times you consciously took the side of the heart and how many times you took the side of the vital.</p>  </div>
