<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> During my deep meditation many times, like a bird, I go from here to there. I live in New York but I go to Jamaica, West Indies; I go to Puerto Rico and so many other places. My disciples see me there then as clearly as you see me here now. It is a matter of a few minutes. The soul's minutes are different from our minutes. In one second the soul can do hundreds of things, whereas in one second I can only move my finger. I can just move a yard or so. But if the soul really leaves the body, then naturally the body cannot stay without it. If the bird flies away from the cage, then the cage is useless. It is only when the bird stays in the cage that we go and see the cage.</p>  </div>
