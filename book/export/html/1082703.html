<p>When Sri Ramakrishna's days were numbered and he was lying ill at Cossipore, some of the disciples could not bear the agony of their Master's passing. Even Naren went away for a few days to console himself. Nag Mahashay also stopped coming. He was sulking because he knew that the Master had the capacity to cure himself but he was not using this capacity. He said, "It seems that the Master wants to suffer. What can I do? I do not want to see him suffering like this." So he stayed away.</p>
<p>One day Sri Ramakrishna said to Nag Mahashay's friend Suresh, "Ask your doctor-friend to come and see me. He has not been here for a long time."</p>
<p>So Nag Mahashay went to Cossipore. Sri Ramakrishna said to him, "Now, Doctor, cure me!"</p>
<p>Nag Mahashay immediately wanted to use medicine and so forth. He even thought of trying to draw the disease from Sri Ramakrishna's body into his own.</p>
<p>But Sri Ramakrishna read his mind and said, "Oh no, you have the capacity to cure me, but Mother does not want me to be cured." He only wanted his doctor-disciple to come and visit him before he left this world.</p>  </div>
