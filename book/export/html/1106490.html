<p>Today when I was doing 50 one-arm pushes with 500 pounds, the machine was making such a horrible noise! Unmilan says it is quite safe. But I felt I was pushing not only 500 pounds but also my two 400-pound dumbbells. The whole thing is one unit and it was moving each time I pushed against it. The machine was giving me such a hard time!</p>
