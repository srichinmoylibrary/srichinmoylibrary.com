<p>There are seven hundred verses in the Gita. I had the good fortune to see a man in India who recited the whole of the Gita in an hour and a half, from the beginning to the end. And he said to me that previously he could do it in an hour. However, reciting is one thing, repeating is one thing, but following the teachings of the Gita is something else. The man who recited the whole of the Gita by heart perhaps did not follow any of the teachings of the Gita. In the third chapter of the Gita we come to know that too much eating is not good. It is better to have fresh and not stale food. But this man was a voracious eater and he used to eat rotten, spoiled food. So, he read the Gita but he did not follow the Gita.</p>  </div>
