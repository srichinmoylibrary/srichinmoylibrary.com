<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, there is no physical life on any of the planets. When it is a matter of this kind of existence that we have, it can be created only from the five elements that are found on earth.</p>
<p>There are beings on other planets, but the beings are not physical. They can assume different forms. If you project your physical and mental vision you will see them as human beings, but if you touch them you won't be able to feel their substance.</p>  </div>
