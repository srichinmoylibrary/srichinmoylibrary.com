  <h1 class="book-heading">84. Question: Is there a connection between the third eye and intuition?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there is a connection, but the third eye is infinitely superior to intuition. The third eye is like the sun and intuition is like a few flames. With intuition we can get an immediate answer to a question. With the third eye one can look forward and backward, one can see past, present and future. All is at its disposal. The third eye has the power to transform the past through its adamantine will power. Intuition does not have this power, but the two are good friends.</p>  </div>
