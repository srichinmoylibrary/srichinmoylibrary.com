<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, most of them are Christians in the West. I also have some Jews. There are Catholics, Protestants, Jews and a few others from other religions. All religions can come to my teachings because this is something interior. In the way we practice meditation, it does not interfere with religion. If it is a true religion it cannot say anything against meditation because any true religion advocates God-realisation and Truth. You can realise God in your own room or in the street but you have to realise Him.</p>  </div>
