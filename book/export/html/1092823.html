<p>Gandhi-ji's supreme philosophy is "Truth is God." Once he realised what the real truth actually was, he desperately tried to abide by the truth. Most of the time he was crowned with success. To give an example, in the beginning he thought Subhas did the wrong thing by leaving India. Then he came to realise that Subhas did the right thing. In the beginning he found it difficult to appreciate Subhas Bose wholeheartedly. In later years he appreciated Subhas with all his heart.</p>
<p>Gandhi-ji's adherence to truth we notice right from his school days. He always told the truth. According to him, the soul-force is infinitely more important than any other force. Not only did he realise this, but also he tried to inspire each and every Indian with the loftiest doctrine, India's immortal motto <em>Satyameva jayate</em> (Truth alone triumphs). This, indeed, is Mahatma Gandhi, the inner breath, and Mahatma Gandhi, the outer life.</p>  </div>
