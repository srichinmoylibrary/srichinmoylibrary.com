<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day it changes. One day Nathan, one day Casey, one day Peter, one day somebody else; and that somebody else may be Bob himself. The biggest joke in God's creation is he who feels that he can do everything without being assisted by anybody, not even by God. In this world the biggest joke is he who feels that he can do even one particular thing without God's help. According to me, when one thinks that one can do something without God's help, he is the biggest joke.</p>  </div>
