<p>Only a highly advanced soul like U Thant can achieve detachment-light. Most illumining was U Thantâ€™s intrepid detachment from the fruitless trivialities of human life. To our deep sorrow, some unlit human beings took his detachment-light for insouciance-night. Again, to our deep joy and satisfaction, they eventually realised their grave folly.</p>  </div>
