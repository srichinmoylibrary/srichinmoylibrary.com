<p>There was a great, great, great poet of ancient India named Kalidasa. As in English literature the author Shakespeare is an immortal figure, even so, in the firmament of Indian literature, Kalidasa is definitely an immortal figure. He wrote his plays and poems in Sanskrit. His most beloved epic poem is <em>Megha Dutam</em>, "The Cloud-Messenger."</p>
<p>Kalidasa lived during the reign of a good, kind, benevolent and powerful king named Vikramaditya. To encourage inspiring, illumining and divine activities in his court, he appointed nine extraordinary figures, who were known as <em>navaratna</em>, the nine gems. They were experts in various fields, such as medicine, astronomy, painting and so on. Kalidasa happened to be one of those nine gems. He was the <em>asthana kavi</em>, the poet of the royal court.</p>
<p>Kalidasa received wisdom-light from Mother Kali; that is why his name was Kalidasa â€” the servant of Mother Kali.</p>  </div>
