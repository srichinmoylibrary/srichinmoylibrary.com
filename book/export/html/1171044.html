<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are happy, sincerely happy, then from the Christmas vacation you will receive so much. Here on the Christmas trip there is less competition, less ego-fighting, because there are only 100 or 150 people. During celebrations there are 1,000 people, so there is lots of ego-fighting, even before I arrive at the function. People compete to see who will be sitting closer and who will be in the last row. Many, many things are happening in the competition-world. Here on the Christmas trip, many of these things do not go on. I compose songs and do other things, and I involve you people. During celebrations there are many, many things that I am not directly involved in, so there are more problems.</p>
<p>In my case, the other ten months’ joy is no match for the joy that I get during these two months at Christmas time. But again, that ten months’ unhappiness devours my two months’ joy. It does not last even until June. When we come back, it is February, March and then April, and when we come to May, my joy is finished! I am absolutely bankrupt. By then, everything has gone away. I keep the joy inside my heart-pocket, but then I withdraw so much that it goes away.</p>
<p>On the Christmas trip I also have responsibility, but it is not as heavy as it is in America. During the rest of the year there is so much pressure. At every second there are quite a few elephants on my shoulders. Here I do not have to carry those elephants, because they have no money-power to fly. At Christmas time I fly here and there, but the elephants wait for me. Then, when I go back, again they jump on my shoulders.</p>
<p>On the Christmas trip we have the opportunity to get joy, and also the soul of each country is eager to give us joy. This morning I saw how beautiful it is here. There is so much freshness! The mind becomes not only clear, but also pure, when we see this freshness. And the people here are harmless and simple.</p>  </div>
