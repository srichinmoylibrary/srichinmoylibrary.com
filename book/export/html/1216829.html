<p>Because of Milka Singh's position, not a single person had any gratitude for him. Even the 91-year-old man who had been sitting in the office with him when I first came in was cursing him.</p>
<p>The old man said he had come in first in his event but that the judges had made a mistake and given the first prize to somebody else.</p>
<p>The old man was short, quite fat and odd-looking. His eyes were frightening.</p>
