<p>Today I lifted my 200 pounds in each arm simultaneously absolutely the highest. According to my physical height, I cannot go any higher. How can I go beyond my height? Once my knees are locked, I cannot straighten my body any more.</p>
<p>You will see that this lift has now become very smooth. There is no jerking. And, unlike before, there is hardly any screaming.</p>
