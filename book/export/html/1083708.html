  <h1 class="book-heading">Silence and music</h1>
  
 
<p>Silence is the source of everything. It is the source of music and it is music itself. Silence is the deepest, most satisfying music of the Supreme. Silence is like a stream that goes to one place and becomes a river, or to another place and becomes a brook, or to the sea where it is totally expanded.</p>
<p>Consciousness will offer us the Music of the Supreme. What is the Music of the Supreme? It is the constant elevation of our consciousness. God-realisation itself is the supreme Music. The meaning of God-realisation is conscious oneness with the rest of the world and with God. Each seeker is one with God, but he is not conscious of it. We use the term 'God' at random. Even an atheist, who does not believe in God, will use the term 'God.'</p>
<p>Where is God? Someone will say He is in Heaven; someone else will say He is somewhere else. One moment He is here; the next moment He is not in our vicinity but is somewhere else. This is our conception of God. But this is wrong. We must feel, "God is where I am." The deeper within we go, the clearer it becomes that it is He who has tied us together and bound us with His inner Oneness. One supreme tune is being played, and this tune is the tune of universal oneness.</p>
<p>God is the Supreme Musician. It is He who is playing with us, on us and in us. We cannot separate God from His music. The universal Consciousness is constantly being played by the Supreme Himself, and is constantly growing into the Supreme Music. God the Creator is the Supreme Musician and God the creation is the supreme Music. The musician and His Music can never be separated. The Musician Supreme is playing his Music Supreme here in the universe. His creation is being fulfilled. The Music Supreme feels its fulfilment only when it consciously becomes one with the Supreme, the Creator Himself.</p>
<p>God's existence and universal music can never be separated. When God spreads His Arms, it is His Music. When He stretches His Legs, it is His Music. When He opens His Eyes, it is all His Music. In His Arms we see the music of Infinity's Benediction; in His Feet we see the music of Eternity's Compassion, and in His Eyes we see the music of Immortality's Illumination. These three-Benediction, Compassion and Illumination make God what He is: Perfection, perfect Perfection.</p>
<p>The difference between a song and a piece of music is this: the song is the rose, the piece of music is the garden. The song is usually of the heart and for the heart. The music is of the entire being and for the entire being.</p>
<p>The excruciating pangs and universal pathos of music is the beauty of the earth-heart.</p>
<p>The transcendental music of liberating Light and immortalising Delight is the beauty of the Heaven-Soul.</p>  </div>
