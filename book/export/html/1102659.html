<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The most effective way to inspire others is through your own aspiration. If you become the embodiment of aspiration, then automatically others will be inspired. Again, you have to know that not everyone is ready to be inspired. You cannot go into the street and tell the whole world, "I have discovered peace, light and bliss. You can also find it by praying and meditating." If you say that, the world will just laugh at you. So you have to dive deep within to get an inner feeling regarding whom you should approach. When you feel from within that so-and-so would at least listen to what you have to say, then only can you offer your inspiration. So first try to discover from within who will accept your message, your love, your truth and your concern. Then, when you find the right person, there is every possibility that you will succeed in inspiring him.</p>
