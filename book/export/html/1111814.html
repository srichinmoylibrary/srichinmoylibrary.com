<p>As I was finishing a seven-mile walk from my house to Flushing Meadow Park, I was passing by the fountain in the park. An elderly man said to me, "Great walker, can't you appreciate the rainbow?"</p>
<p>So I turned around and saw that there was an extremely beautiful rainbow in the fountain. For at least fifty metres I was walking very slowly, watching the rainbow. Then immediately I remembered, "O God, my timing!"</p>
