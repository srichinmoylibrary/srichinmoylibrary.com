<p>“God, I wish to tell You a secret. Tell me that You won’t tell it to anyone.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Gary, I promise to you that I will not tell a thing to anybody about your secret.”</p>
<p>“Sure? Will You keep Your Promise?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely.”</p>
<p>“God, my Guru has told me that in my last life I was the father of my grandfather, and that is why my grandfather and I love each other so much. God, can You tell me like my Guru, who I was in my last life?”</p>
<p>“Your Guru has already told you about that. Since I have to tell you the same thing, I shall get no credit from you. I wish to surprise you by telling you about your future. I wish to tell you that you will become a very good friend of your Guru’s. He will be your best friend on earth.”</p>
<p>“Will he be my best friend?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he will.”</p>
<p>“God, You have told me such a nice thing. I thank You not once, but one hundred times.”</p>  </div>
