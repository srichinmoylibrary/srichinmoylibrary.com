<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can maintain continuous aspiration only by feeling that there is someone who needs you infinitely more than you need yourself. If somebody is in need of you, then naturally you will try to help that person out. That person is the Supreme Himself. When you feel that He needs you, then your sympathetic heart goes toward Him.</p>  </div>
