<p>Our prayer for Calvin Smith was fruitful. He stood third in his race in New York and also that was his best timing for the entire year. Usually he does not do well in just 50 or 60 metres. So God listened to our prayers. Bhashwar has taken a very nice picture of Calvin Smith. Look at his innocent smile â€” how simple and childlike it is! His whole face radiates with his simplicity-smile. His smile comes spontaneously.</p>
