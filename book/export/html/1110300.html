<h2><em>Professor Zell Kravinsky:</em> What is the fastest way to know God and feel His special Concern for us?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, there are many ways to realise God. The two main ways are the way of the mind and the way of the heart. The way of the mind is infinitely more difficult than the way of the heart because of the nature of the human mind. The mind doubts, the mind suspects, the mind contradicts, the mind limits. Alas, there comes a time when the mind doubts its own understanding, its own capacities, its own faith in higher realities and even in God.</p>
<p>The way of the heart, on the other hand, is the way of love, devotion and surrender. We love God, we devote ourselves to God and we surrender our will to God's Will. The way of the heart is the way of a child who entirely depends on the mother's unconditional affection and concern. In the spiritual life, the fastest way to make progress is the way of unconditional surrender. Unconditional surrender means to please God in His own Way. It is easy to say that we shall please God in His own Way, but it takes years of prayer and meditation. Slowly, steadily and unerringly the seeker strives to develop the capacity to surrender his will to God's Will. At every moment he has to practise in thought and deed the supreme prayer that the Saviour Christ taught humanity: "Let Thy Will be done."</p>
<p>If we pray and meditate soulfully and selfgivingly, if we feel that we love God only and need Him only at every moment, and if we dare to claim Him as our own, very own, then we are bound to feel His special Concern for us at every moment in our multifarious activities.</p>  </div>
