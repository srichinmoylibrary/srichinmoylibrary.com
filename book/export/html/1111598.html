<p>Today I ran three good races. It is all due to my disciples' encouragement. All those who were in the bus and others who accompanied me to New Jersey deserve my absolutely most powerful gratitude. Because of their silver inspiration, gold aspiration and diamond sacrifice, I was able to accomplish what I have done today. So these people deserve gratitude — G-R-A-T-I-T-U-D-E — in the purest sense of the term.</p>
