<p>Lord, why am I suffering so much?<br /> "You are suffering<br /> Because you are a sleeping body."<br /> Lord, why am I suffering so much?<br /> "You are suffering<br /> Because you are a demanding vital."<br /> Lord, why am I suffering so much?<br /> "You are suffering<br /> Because you are a doubting mind."<br /> Lord, why am I suffering so much?<br /> "You are suffering<br /> Because you are an unaspiring heart."<br /> Lord, why am I suffering so much?<br /> "You are suffering<br /> Because you are an unillumining soul."<br /> Lord, is there any way I can be happy?<br /> "Yes, you can.<br /> Just tell your body<br /> That its boss is your dynamic vital.<br /> Just tell your vital<br /> That its boss is your searching mind.<br /> Just tell your mind<br /> That its boss is your surrendering heart.<br /> Just tell your heart<br /> That its boss is your fulfilling soul.<br /> Just tell your soul<br /> That its boss is your<br /> Dream-transforming<br /> And<br /> Reality-immortalising God."</p>
