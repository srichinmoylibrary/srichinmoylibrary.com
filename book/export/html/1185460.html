    <title>&lt;em&gt;Caller:&lt;/em&gt; I was trying to give some healing to my father who was not too well, and I felt some energy moving in my hands. Am I right to feel that this and other kinds of experiences that I&#039;ve had may be coming from God?</title>

<p><em>Steve Powers:</em> You're asking about healing? I guess first we have to establish whether you believe that there is a force of healing.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do believe in the force of healing.</p>
<p><em>Steve Powers:</em> And the source of the force?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The source of the force is God, the all-Good. God is omnipotent; again, He is all Love. So it is from His Love that the healing power comes into existence.</p>  </div>
