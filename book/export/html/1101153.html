    <title>Question: You say that when we are suffering we should try to feel the presence of the Supreme. But one of the reasons human beings suffer is that we feel separated from the Supreme. So where does one begin that effort?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you cannot think of the Supreme, then think of your physical mother or any relative or friend of yours with whom you have established a connection over the years. Since you were a child, there is bound to be someone with whom you have established your oneness. When you are suffering, imagine that individual is standing right in front of you.</p>
<p>I always say that imagination is a reality. The person you are imagining may not even be alive. When I suffer physically, mentally or in any way, immediately I see my physical mother right in front of me, although she is in the other world. You can say that in my case it is different because I have free access to my mother, but you definitely know someone who was most compassionate or most affectionate to you. The Supreme you may not know; you have not seen Him. But some other person you have seen many, many times in your life. If that particular person who has been so compassionate and affectionate stands in front of you, then I tell you, that person will in no way suffer less than you are suffering.</p>
<p>When disciples who have a close connection with me suffer physically or mentally, at that time I suffer much more than they do. Outwardly I may give a smile or just say, "Everything will be fine; it will go away." But afterwards, before I even take two steps, I enter into the soul of that person and do the needful. If the person has established a close connection with me, I may not look at that person again in order to show how sincerely concerned, sincerely caring and compassionate I am. But immediately I will work inside the soul and the heart of that person. At that time how much I suffer on their behalf!</p>
<p>So if you can imagine the presence of the person who is closest to you in front of you, sympathising with you with utmost sincerity, then definitely you will feel less pain. It may be more than one person; there may be ten or twenty individuals standing in front of you and sympathising with your suffering.</p>
<p>If somebody dies in your family and a few relatives come and sincerely try to console you, if they share your sufferings, your sorrows and your loss, then you feel much better. Some may not be able to come physically, but still you can remember them and know that if they were physically present, they would show the same kind of consolation, the same kind of oneness.</p>  </div>
