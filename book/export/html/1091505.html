<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation helps us to live from moment to moment. Again, in moment to moment the Eternal Now exists. The Eternal cannot be separated from each moment. This is a moment and here Eternity is all around. Eternity comprises the present, the past and the future.</p>
<p>Inside Eternity is the moment; again, inside the moment is Eternity. It is like the ocean. Inside the ocean are countless tiny drops. Again, each tiny drop holds the essence of the vast ocean. We take a drop and immediately we have the consciousness of the vast ocean, because the drop embodies the vast ocean. And so each moment cannot be separated from Eternity and Infinity. Meditation is the only way to feel the oneness of the finite with the Infinite.</p>  </div>
