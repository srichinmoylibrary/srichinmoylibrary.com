<p>One girl was with me all the time during the three-mile race. I was breathing so heavily, but from her there was no noise at all. She was the silent Brahmin. I felt miserable that I was disturbing her consciousness. She was the better runner, so she should have gone ahead, but she stayed right by my side.</p>
<p>Then, when we were 800 metres from the finish, she disappeared. But I could not go any faster.</p>
