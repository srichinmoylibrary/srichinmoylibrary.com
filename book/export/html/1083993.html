<p>He wanted to become<br /> A great athlete,<br /> God fulfilled his pigmy aim<br /> And smiled at him.</p>
<p>He wanted to become<br /> A great poet.<br /> God fulfilled his pigmy aim<br /> And shook hands with him.</p>
<p>He wanted become<br /> A great Yogi.<br /> God fulfilled his pigmy aim<br /> And blessed him.</p>
<p>He wanted to become<br /> A true lover of humanity<br />           And<br /> A true server of God.<br /> God fulfilled his giant goal<br /> And embraced him,<br />     Powerfully,<br />     Proudly<br />           And<br />     Supremely.</p>
