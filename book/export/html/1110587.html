<p>The poet Keats said, "A thing of beauty is a joy forever." But what is that thing? That thing, from the spiritual point of view, is our soul. The soul is eternally beautiful. God expresses Himself in the physical through beauty, pure beauty, beauty without a blemish. This beauty is not merely skin-deep, but it is in the soul. Here the soul is expressing itself through the physical form.</p>
<p>About one hour ago, X brought me these most beautiful roses. I told her that the roses were beautiful but that she is more beautiful than the roses. This was not my flattery. What I wanted to say was that her soul is infinitely more beautiful than the beautiful roses.</p>
<p>Beauty is something that can be cultivated constantly in our outer nature. This beauty we can cherish in our outer and inner life as God's choicest blessing. Just because God, our Father, is beautiful, because He is All-Beauty, we have every right to become like Him. So we want to possess the beauty of the soul in our outer life and we want to become really beautiful.</p>  </div>
