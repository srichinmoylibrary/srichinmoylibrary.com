<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite normal. When we achieve something great, we get joy. At that time, our negative qualities disappear. Joy has tremendous strength, and when we are flooded with strength, negative forces cannot attack us. Inside joy is a divine force, and this divine force can easily silence the undivine forces.</p>  </div>
