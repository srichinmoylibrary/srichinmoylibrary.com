<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> TV itself is not at all a hindrance, but to watch it when you should be meditating or doing something for your spiritual life shows a lack of wisdom. There are many things that may distract you or prevent you from following the spiritual path or the inner life, and TV is one of them. But it is you who are the master of your possessions. You have to deal with them according to the dictates of your soul.</p>
<p>If you have a TV in your room, it is you who must use the TV; you must not allow the TV to use you. So long as you are the master of your possessions, so long as you can discipline your life and say, "Now I have to go and meditate or go and listen to a spiritual talk, which is much more important than watching a TV show," then TV will not hinder your spiritual life. As long as you have strong self-discipline, you are safe. If you have no aspiration, even if you have no TV, you will still find excuses not to attend meditation. But if you are just weak, if you have a TV, you will be unnecessarily tempted. We always have to see the consciousness of the possessor.</p>  </div>
