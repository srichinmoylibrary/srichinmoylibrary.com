<p>Captain, my Captain,<br /> Do I have to give up everything<br /> In order to claim You<br /> As my own, very own?<br /> "My sweet child,<br /> First claim Me as your own, very own.<br /> To your wide surprise<br /> You will discover<br /> That besides Me you have nothing<br /> of your own<br /> To give up,<br /> For your very existence-life<br /> Is My blessingful Possession.<br /> You will also discover<br /> That I am your Eternity's Dream-Boat,<br /> Plus, you are My Immortality's<br /> reality-passenger.<br /> Our destination is the Blue-Gold Shore<br /> Of My Infinity's Nectar-Delight."</p>
