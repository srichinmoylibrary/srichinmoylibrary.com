<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now the physical body must come from physical parents. But a day will come, most of the spiritual authorities say, when parents will not be required to bring a soul to earth in a physical body. In the occult plane it will be done. And the soul will come into existence with a luminous body. The world is evolving gradually to this point.</p>  </div>
