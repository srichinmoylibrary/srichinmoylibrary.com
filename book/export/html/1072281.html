<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the strength of my prayer and meditation I try to enter into the material consciousness and become part and parcel of the weights that I lift. When I deal with matter, I try to become inseparably one with it. So when I lift up the weights, I feel that my life-breath has entered into the metal plates and that from the metal this life-breath has entered back into me. This is how I try to establish my oneness with the weights. In this way I feel life in the weights and the weights feel life in me. Otherwise, if I just touch them, they do not reciprocate, and we do not offer our life-breath to each other.</p>  </div>
