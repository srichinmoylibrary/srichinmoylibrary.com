  <h1 class="book-heading">Creativity</h1>
  
 
<p>Each person is meaningless and fruitless if he or she does not enter into the field of creativity. Without inner and outer creativity, man is nothing but a great failure, not only in the eyes of humanity, but in the Eye of God, too. Each soul is endowed with creativity. But the soul finds it extremely difficult to convince the mind, the vital and the physical that they can consciously co-operate with the soul, that they all can create together and fulfil the Divine here on earth.</p>
<p>Creativity does not mean that one has to write poems or articles, or compose songs. Creativity means one's inner concern for the expansion of what he is or what he has. When one consciously wants to go beyond his capacity and beyond his achievement, only then do we find real creativity, only then can creativity have its proper value, worth and purpose.</p>
<p>Where does one find the source of creativity? If one wants his creation to be permanent and eternal, then that creation must come from the soul — not from the mind, not from the vital, not even from the heart. In the heart, in the mind, in the vital and even in the gross physical, one can also see creativity, but the achievements of that creativity can never be lasting. It is only the soul's creativity that can be abiding. So creativity can be in the physical, in the heart, in the mind, in the soul — anywhere. But if it is in the inner life, the soul's region, then only can the aspirant be truly happy.</p>
<p>Each moment man can create in the inner world. He can easily bring his creation to the fore through his constant inner urge. Without creativity, man is no better than an animal. With creativity, man can divinely claim that he is God's true and worthy son. One who really creates something, inner or outer, but especially inner, is God's true Pride. Creativity man must cherish; creativity he must adore.</p>  </div>
