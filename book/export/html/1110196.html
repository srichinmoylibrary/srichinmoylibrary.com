<blockquote>
<p>A Government is made and unmade by the will of the people.</p>
<p><em>On the Wings of Thought</em><br /><em>by Ranasinghe Premadasa</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is a government? A government is a man-made garment. This man-made garment can be attractive or unattractive, expensive or inexpensive. He who is wise will naturally put on a lovely garment not only to please himself but also to please others. This garment he can make and remake until he sees perfection in it and derives complete satisfaction from it.</p>  </div>
