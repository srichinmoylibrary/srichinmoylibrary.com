<p>At the beginning of the flight they gave us two forms to fill in. The middle-aged gentleman beside me didn't have a ballpoint, so he asked the lady whose child was crying if he could borrow her pen.</p>
<p>Immediately the lady said, "No!" But that was not enough. Then she stood up and started insulting him.</p>
<p>Then I said to the man, "You can use my ballpoint."</p>
<p>The man said to me, "This lady and I used to be married, but now we are separated. Do you know why we are separated?"</p>
<p>I said, "I don't know anything, and I don't want to know."</p>
<p>But he didn't listen to me. He just continued, "That child is not mine, but she claims it is."</p>
<p>I said to myself, "Oh, I have to hear this kind of thing!"</p>
<p>Then the lady started screaming at him- using such foul language. O my God!</p>
<p>I put away my ballpoint and pretended I had to go to the bathroom. For more than ten minutes I stood near the bathroom door. Finally I went back to my seat, but the fight was still going on! So again I left, all the time praying to God that this story would end. When I came back the second time, it had stopped.</p>
<p>I was so lucky not to get involved. Such a foul tongue the lady had!</p>
