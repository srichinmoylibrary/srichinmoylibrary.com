<p>“God, my Guru is very, very nice and kind and sweet to me. Every day I speak a lot to him inwardly. But when I see him once a month, I forget to ask him even one single question. Why am I so stupid?”</p>
<p>“Andrea, you are not stupid at all. When you see your Guru, you become so happy and delighted and excited. Your Guru, does he not answer all your questions inwardly?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, he does. He answers my questions most kindly and lovingly. God, tell me frankly, is my Guru pleased with me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he is.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because you think of him, you pray to him, and you love him. Also, this morning he has told Me that he is very pleased with you.”</p>
<p>“God, when you see my Guru next time, please tell him that I love him.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I shall without fail.”</p>  </div>
