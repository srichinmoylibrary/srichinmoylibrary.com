<p>John Landy was very, very nice to us at the World Veterans' Games. They say he was looking and looking at me while I was in a meditative consciousness.</p>
<p>Then, after he gave his speech, I went over to shake hands with him. He was the second man to break the four-minute mile. I said that I had always admired him.</p>
<p>He said he was very grateful to me for bringing a moment of peace to his country, and he thanked me deeply.</p>
<p>Earlier, I had met Herb Elliott. He holds twenty-seven records. He also was very, very nice.</p>
<p>So two immortal Australian runners I have met!</p>
