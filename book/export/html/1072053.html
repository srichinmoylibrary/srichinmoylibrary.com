<p>What is misery? Emotional misery is the result of desire in the mind. There is also physical misery. This misery is caused by the nerves when they are tensed. When one does not have faith in oneself, it is the beginning of one's misery. When one loses faith in one's master, he feels within the damaging breath of misery.</p>
