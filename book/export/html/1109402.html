<blockquote>
<p>"A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds."</p>
<p>— Bacon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A spiritual man not only finds opportunities, but also constantly creates more and more opportunities. His opportunity is composed of his inspiration-light and his aspiration-height. With his opportunities he realises God, he serves God, and he fulfils God.</p>  </div>
