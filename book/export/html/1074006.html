  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Does happiness in the outer being reflect the inner consciousness?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. If it is sincere happiness, not false happiness, then it does reflect the inner consciousness. Here the consciousness itself reaches a high degree of perfection. But if what you call happiness is actually a form of so-called earthly pleasure, then it can never reflect the inner consciousness.</p>
<p>We have to know what we mean by happiness and pleasure. Most of the time the majority of human beings consider pleasure as happiness; but pleasure and happiness are actually two different things. When we have pleasure we feel that our pleasure is immediately captured by frustration and inside this frustration we see a real sense of destruction. But when we have happiness we see there is a constant and conscious expansion of the real reality within us.</p>  </div>
