<p>When I was little, my mother used to give me money if I had eaten my food. If Madhuri takes most delicious things to Radha and tells her it will give her more strength, then Radha will become bigger than Madhuri. Then Madhuri can defeat her. If Madhuri feeds her, Radha will become three times as fat as her mother. Then it will be easy for Madhuri to defeat her.</p>
<p>During the New York Marathon, Radha saw me twenty times. Her stride was useless, but she had such determination to go ahead of me. She was absolutely grinding her teeth, and she did defeat me.</p>
