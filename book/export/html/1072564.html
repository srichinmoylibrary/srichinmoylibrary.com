<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, your aspiration can easily cut through and diminish all your psychological difficulties. You can best apply and increase your aspiration in this regard by feeling constantly your gratitude-heart for the mounting aspiration that Godâ€™s infinite Grace has already given to you.</p>  </div>
