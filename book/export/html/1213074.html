<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, do you have any sycophants in your spiritual community?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, unfortunately I have had a few self-seeking flatterers. But in the course of time they came to realise that their flattery did not have the desired effect. Now, to my great joy and utter pride, they have totally given up their profession.</p>  </div>
