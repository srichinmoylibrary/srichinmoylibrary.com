<p>The day before yesterday the manager of the Bali Beach Hotel said that he had seen three holy men in his lifetime.</p>
<p>He saw the Dalai Lama from a distance when he came to Indonesia. He also saw the Pope from a distance.</p>
<p>Then he said that I was the third spiritual figure he had seen. Only with me he could talk and take pictures!</p>
