<h2>I.</h2>

<p>The other day I interviewed three God-Realised souls: X, Y and Z.</p>
<p>I said to X, "Please tell me what happened when you met God for the first time."</p>
<p>"When I met God for the first time, He immediately fell in love with me. But I doubted. I hesitated to bask in the infinite effulgence of His Light. I suspected. I suspected my inner vision."</p>
<p>I said to Y, "Please tell me what happened when you met Got for the first time."</p>
<p>"Because of my long forgotten Self, God shed endless tears of joy when I met Him for the first time. I kissed and kissed His Feet of endless Compassion."</p>
<p>I said to Z, "Please tell me what happened when you met Got for the first time."</p>
<p>"When I met God for the first time, with His Eyes He immediately fed my hunger of millenia. I fed Him with my heart's endless cry."</p>
<p>Now the three God-Realised souls said to me, "You have interviewed us. Now you have to tell us what happened when you met God for the first time."</p>
<p>I was more than ready and eager to tell my Yogi-Friends about my first meeting with God. But God immediately commanded my silence and demanded my surrender.</p>
<p>After some time, God on my behalf said to my Yogi-Friends, "When he and I met for the first time, we stabbed each other. Yes, we stabbed each other."</p>
<p>"Stabbed with what?"</p>
<p>"With love, love, and love. Is it not true?"</p>
<p>"God, what am I going to do with You? You are telling a lie. I stabbed You with my brooding ignorance. You stabbed me with Your ever-compassionate and all-liberating Love."</p>
<p>God said, "No sir, you have totally forgotten about our first meeting. What am I going to do with your feeble memory?"</p>
<p>"You are my Lord of immediate Forgiveness. You are my Lord of eternal Concern. You are my Lord of constant Compassion."</p>  </div>
