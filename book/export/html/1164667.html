  <h1 class="book-heading">My happiness</h1>
  
 
<p>Yesterday I was happy because I faithfully followed my own star.</p>
<p>Today I am happy because I bravely live my own life.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I shall be happy because I shall unconditionally listen to and fulfil my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>From now on I will have no happiness unless I champion the right to be entirely and constantly God's, God's alone.</p>
<p>Here is the secret of my happiness: I keep the mouth of my little self closed and the heart of my big Self open.</p>
<p>O strength of mine, you have made me happy by saying that I have the capacity to move forward to the farthest destination. O weakness of mine, you have made me happy by saying that I have the opportunity to improve and become the most perfect instrument of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>I am happy, genuinely happy, not because God is mine but because I am God's and God's alone.</p>  </div>
