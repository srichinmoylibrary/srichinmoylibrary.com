<p>What a difference between the days when ran in India and now! I don't know whether should laugh or cry. The best thing is to laugh at age, but perhaps age is laughing at me.</p>
<p>When I ran the 100 metres in India, I used to run much, much faster. Now, nothing moves.</p>
<p>My left leg moves as if it were carrying a dead elephant — it is lifeless.</p>
