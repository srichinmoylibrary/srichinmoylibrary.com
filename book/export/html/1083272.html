<p>The other day a novelist friend of mine said to me that he will not be able to write any more novels, for the standard of human character has gone unbearably low. Such being the case, I asked him to write about the character of the cosmic gods. He immediately said, "First of all, their character is in no way better than the human character. They also had lots of affairs. Secondly, if I write on them, then I have to depend more on imagination than on actual fact. Sorry, I shall not write on the cosmic gods either." I told him that if he was not going to write on human beings or cosmic gods, then I would write on his character. On hearing this, he gave me a blow right on my nose and said, "Stop, for God's sake, stop. Tomorrow I shall start writing on human fools and divine rogues." O human fools, O divine rogues, please, please forgive my wise novelist friend.</p>  </div>
