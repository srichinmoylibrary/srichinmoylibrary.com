<p>When I arrived at the airport in New York from Puerto Rico, I was carrying two small bags, one on each shoulder. L. and R. were watching me from the other side of the glass partition. I saw them, but they could not come inside.</p>
<p>One of the porters recognised me, saying, "Sri Chinmoy, you are such a great man! You have to carry two bags?" He wanted to carry my bags for me, but they were such tiny bags! He was not a runner, I am sure, since he was quite fat, so I don't think he knew me from our races. I was looking at my shirt to see if 'Sri Chinmoy' was mentioned anywhere, but it wasn't. How did he recognise me? God alone knows!</p>
