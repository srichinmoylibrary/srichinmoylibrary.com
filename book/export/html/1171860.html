<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the husband and wife have different teachers, it is like going to the same goal along two roads. Problems will arise if the husband says that his road is clear, sunlit, whereas the wife's road is full of obstacles. Then trouble will start. But if the husband says, "I like this road and you like that road. So you go your own way, I will go my way, and we will reach the same destination," then it is all right. If the husband does not try to convert the wife and the wife does not try to convert the husband, that is the right thing. But when a feeling of comparison or competition enters, then all is lost.</p>  </div>
