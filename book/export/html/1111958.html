<p>So many times I have seen Madhuri running in the street and invited her to come into the car with us, but she doesn't see me.</p>
<p>Today I was in the car near my 1200-metre mark, almost at Main Street. The car was going slowly, but Madhuri was running without her glasses, so she was doubly blind. She didn't see me.</p>
