<p>In his animal life<br /> He was happy<br /> Because<br /> There was no human observer.<br /> In his human life<br /> He is happy<br /> Because<br /> He is always at the Feet<br /> Of God the constant Forgiver.<br /> In his divine life<br /> He will be happy<br /> Because<br /> He will always play<br /> With God the unconditional Lover.</p>
