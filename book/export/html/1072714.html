<h2>Question: What is the difference between ecstasy, bliss and delight?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ecstasy is something which we usually feel in our higher emotional or illumined vital. Bliss is something we feel in our aspiring, devoted heart. We also feel Bliss in the searching mind. Delight is something we feel from the soles of our feet to the crown of our head: it is the entire being that enjoys delight. Delight we feel throughout the body when we are spiritually dedicated, totally dedicated, and when we listen unconditionally to the dictates of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Again, when we speak of the highest kind of delight, the supreme Delight, we mean something more. Here we can say, along with the Vedic seers: “From Delight we came into existence. In Delight we grow. At the end of our journey’s close, into Delight we retire.”</p>  </div>
