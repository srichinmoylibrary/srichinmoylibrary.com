<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we came into the world we felt that temptation was more important than actual realisation. It is as though two coins were put in front of us. One was a counterfeit or false coin; the other was authentic. But the counterfeit coin was more charming on the outer plane than the real one. So we were attracted by the one that was outwardly charming, while we ignored the genuine one.</p>  </div>
