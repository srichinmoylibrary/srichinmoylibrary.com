<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Tension is in the mind, nowhere else. Inside the heart there is no tension. Even inside the knees or legs there is no tension; there is only pain. Real tension is inside the mind.</p>
<p>Tension goes away to a great extent if you can breathe in and out very slowly. If you can imagine that you are taking one full minute to breathe in and another full minute to breathe out, even though in reality it may not be true that you are taking that long, then your tension is bound to be released.</p>  </div>
