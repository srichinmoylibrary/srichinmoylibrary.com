<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I see that the United Nations organisation has a definite role in enlightening the life of mankind. But it is not the outer music that will do the needful. Only it is the inner music, the music of the heart, that continuously feels and makes others feel that we are of the One and for the many. The many are our extended and expanded reality. Not the instrumental music, not the vocal music, but the psychic music of the United Nations can and will enlighten the face of mankind.</p>  </div>
