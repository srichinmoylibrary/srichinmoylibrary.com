<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One cannot always tell absolutely if something is coming from the mind or the heart. But if we know that something is coming from the heart, we should always listen to the heart, for the heart is childlike and pure. Unfortunately, the mind thinks that the heart is childish and does not want to listen to the heart. It cares only for its own knowledge and not for the heart's wisdom. Needless to say, we should always see the world through the heart.</p>
<p>Something from the heart does not have to go to the mind. That is, the heart need not communicate through the mind or through anything else. The heart is very eloquent in its own right. If I enter into a room and just see someone, I can immediately know all about him. The other person does not have to say a word to me outwardly; his heart tells me everything in a fleeting second. My heart is speaking to him and his heart is speaking to me. In this case, the heart is not using the mind at all to communicate. It is speaking its own language.</p>
