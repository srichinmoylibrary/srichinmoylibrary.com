SCA 988-999. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 23 December 1990 in Hawaii.</p>
<h2>Question: Can the old scriptures still help us?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, the old scriptures can still help us, although not all the messages of the old scriptures will be helpful. The world is progressing fast, very fast. Sometimes the old rules and old visions may not or cannot be manifested on earth any more. Again, some old scriptures shed universal light and eternal truth. Some messages of the old scriptures are eternal, while others are not. Some messages were meant only for that age. Those messages cannot and should not be applied now. But those messages which are eternal do help us.</p>  </div>
