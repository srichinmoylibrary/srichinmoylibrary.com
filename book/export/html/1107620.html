  <h1 class="book-heading">Art is</h1>
  
 
<p>Art is patience. Patience is the willingness of the artist to listen to his inner dictates. Patience is the willingness of the artist to speak lovingly, soulfully and calmly.</p>
<p>Art is open-mindedness. Open-mindedness is absolutely natural in the artist’s divine relationship with the world around him.</p>
<p>Art is vision. Vision is the pure quality of the seeker’s heart and the sure quantity of the seeker’s mind.</p>
<p>The human artist knows that his art is his inspiration-lamp, aspiration-flame and imagination-sun. The divine artist knows that his art is his concentration-power, meditation-peace and contemplation-bliss.</p>
<p>The human artist plays only with today’s existence-night and not with tomorrow’s existence-day. For him, the tomorrow-train never arrives. The divine artist plays with the purity-sea and the beauty-waves of the Eternal Beyond.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s art was the awareness of infinite possibility. Today’s art is the active devotedness to infinite practicality. Tomorrow’s art will be the soulful and fruitful oneness with infinite inevitability.</p>
<p>The artist who likes his art idealises his art. The artist who loves his art idolises his art. The artist who becomes inseparably one with the beauty and purity of his art multiplies the manifestation of his realisation-sun. </p>
