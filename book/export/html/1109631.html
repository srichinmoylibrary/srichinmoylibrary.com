<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I appreciate philosophy and philosophers because this world is full of suffering. Philosophy tells us that suffering is nothing; it is only a kind of game that God is enjoying. Philosophy gives us the message of another world. This world is full of problems, pain and suffering. So I appreciate philosophy and philosophers because they give us the message of another world and that world, according to philosophy, is not at all painful. If you go there, you will be able to see for yourself. Philosophers do not actually go there, but they feel that this other world is without pain, without suffering. At present, this other world is unknown. So, I like philosophers because I like the message of the unknown, the message of the unknowable.</p>  </div>
