<h2>Question: It seems the Christ never meditated but all of a sudden became very high. Is this true?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. The Christ definitely meditated. What do we know about the past? The Christ stayed on earth for thirty-three years and even so there is a gap of about ten or twelve years where history does not know what he did. During this time he was in India and other places, and he definitely meditated.</p>  </div>
