<p>I have received dinner invitations<br /> From God and man,<br /> From Heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Earth will feed me<br /> With earth's food: doubt and fear.</p>
<p>Heaven will feed me<br /> With Heaven's food: faith and courage.</p>
<p>Man will feed me<br /> With man's food: depression and frustration.</p>
<p>God will feed me<br /> With God's Food: Light and Delight.</p>
<p>Doubt and fear will not be able to feed me regularly;<br /> Therefore I don't need them.</p>
<p>Faith and courage may be a bit slow in feeding me,<br /> But I shall gladly wait.</p>
<p>Depression and frustration will poison me<br /> With their food. No harm!<br /> I know perfectly well<br /> That I shall not remain always dead.<br /> For I clearly see that God's Food,<br /> Light and Delight,<br /> Is fast approaching my eternally real hunger.</p>
