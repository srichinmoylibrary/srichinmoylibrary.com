<h2>Meditation in Zurich</h2>

<p>In Zurich over five hundred people came to the meditation. The seekers in Zurich were so good. They took prasad with real devotion — <em>devotion</em> is the right word. I am always deeply moved that when seekers in the audience in San Francisco take prasad after a public meditation, they show tremendous respect. Here in Zurich it was truly like our San Francisco experience. With such devotedness, hundreds of people took prasad.</p>  </div>
