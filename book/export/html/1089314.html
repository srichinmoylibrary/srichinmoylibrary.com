<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now, unfortunately the Cosmic Law and the human law have never been one. Only it is the bounden duty of the human law to see the light in the Cosmic Law. First it has to see infinite light in the Cosmic Law and then it has to consciously allow itself to be guided and illumined by the Cosmic Law. The Cosmic Law is nothing but God's ever-transcending Vision and God's ever-fulfilling Manifestation.</p>  </div>
