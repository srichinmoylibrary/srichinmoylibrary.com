<p>There are two fruits: one silence, the other din. The wise pine for the former; the ignorant long for the latter. Those who dwell in silence say that the world is not a dream; it is a self-assertive reality. Those who are devoured by din say that the world is more transitory than a rope of sand. Both parties are adamant in their assertions.</p>
<p>A terrible dispute arose between my heart and my mind over who was right. According to my heart, silence is far superior to din. According to my mind, silence is no match for din. They made me the judge. As I was ignorant of the truth, I went to my soul with a tremulous tongue.</p>
<p>My soul consoled me and said, "Your heart is the pinnacle of wisdom and your mind is the abyss of ignorance. I give you two seeds. One is Immortality, the other is transformation. Sow the first seed in your heart and the second in your mind. In no time, you will find that their terrible fight will end in a fond embrace."</p>  </div>
