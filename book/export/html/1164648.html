<p>Intuition does not expose. Intuition does not impose. Intuition only brings forward the hidden reality. It brings to the fore the message of cosmic harmony.</p>
<p>Intuition is not merely to see the Truth faster than the fastest. Intuition is to throw ourselves into the love-light and oneness-light of self-discovery and God-discovery .</p>
<p>He is a fool who cries for joy in the outer world.</p>
<p>He is a greater fool who does not bring to the fore the joy of the inner world.</p>
<p>He is the greatest fool who does not do the first thing first-who does not invoke God the constant, eternal Joy first and foremost.</p>  </div>
