<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Towards the end of the meditation there are two things that I usually do. When I stand up and look at the seekers, I give them my last self-offering. This last self-offering is an inner shower, an inner rain. My soul brings down God's Compassion, especially His Compassion-Delight, from above. During the last few minutes I actually grow into a torrential rain. I literally see myself as rain. Only this rain does not create problems for the seekers. On the contrary, it helps them run as fast as they want.</p>
<p>When I put on the garland, it is not in any way an act of demonstration. I do not take it because I have worked very hard in the battlefield of life and deserve it. No, this garland I take as a garland of gratitude. I place it around my neck only to show that this garland is not mine: this garland is yours. I happen to be there acting as a leader, playing the role of the leader. You can say a self-imposed leader, if you want. But this leader is only receiving the garland on behalf of the group. During the meditation each individual member has added to the leader's self-offering. So I wear this garland on behalf of all the seekers. I am also a seeker. Although only one garland is at our disposal, this leader knows perfectly well that it is everybody's. I take the garland as a token of my gratitude to each of you, to the Supreme in each individual seeker.</p>  </div>
