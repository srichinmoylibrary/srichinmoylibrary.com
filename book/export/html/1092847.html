<p>In Subhas and Nehru we see an uneven exchange of gifts: Subhas offered Nehru his sincere respect and brotherly love; Nehru offered Subhas something a little less filial. The tortured President writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I find that for some time past you have developed tremendous dislike for me. I say this because I find that you take up enthusiastically every possible point against me....</p>
<p>"On my side, ever since I came out of internment in 1937, I have been treating you with the utmost regard and consideration, in private life and in public. I have looked upon you as politically an elder brother and leader and have often sought your advice."</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
