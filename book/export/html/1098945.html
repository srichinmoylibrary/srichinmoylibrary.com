<p>When I went with Eric for the first time to visit his parents, it was Thanks-giving and so they were all eating turkey. His mother was begging me to eat it, but I politely refused.</p>
<p>Then she said, “Had I been your mother, would you not have listened to my request?”</p>
<p>I replied, “Even if you had been my mother, I would not have listened to you. Your other requests I shall definitely fulfil, but I cannot eat meat.”</p>
<p>The second time I went with Eric to see her, she did not beg me to eat meat. Eric’s mother was like a real mother to me. I used to call her my mother. She was so kind to me. Her name was Caroline Hughes. She took me to quite a few stores. Some of her friends asked her, “Who is this?” Very bravely she said, “This is my Indian son.”</p>
<p>Eric’s father was practically lame. He had a television set and from his chair he pressed something and the television worked. I said, “How can it be?”</p>
<p>Now I have the same kind of remote control.</p>  </div>
