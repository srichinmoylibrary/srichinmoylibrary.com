<p>Subhas wrote a most significant letter to Sarat Chandra, the novelist of the Himalayan heights. In this letter, he said to the novelist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"People misunderstand my deepest affection and admiration for our Deshabandhu. They think that we are his totally blind devotees. I wonder if they care to know how many times I have argued with him loudly and widely? But one thing I can tell you is that if he ever needed me for anything, in no time I would be found at his feet! At this point I would like to add that his wife, Vasanti Devi, our dearest mother, the mother of all mothers, was the only one who could put an end to all our arguments and quarrels. Happily, proudly and instantly, all the parties used to bow to her affection-love-concern-compassion-wisdom-sea."</p>
