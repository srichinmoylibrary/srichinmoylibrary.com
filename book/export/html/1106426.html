<p>Today at the tennis court I practised on twenty different machines. These things I have already done before. I strongly feel that there should be something new to draw public attention. I do not want to do the ones that I have already done. It becomes monotonous.</p>
<p>I thought of lifting up a globe of the world. It could be on top of my lifting machine. Around the globe, three people would be standing holding peace torches. This lift will be so symbolic. Now I shall have to find someone to make it.</p>
