<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Through aspiration you can do it. Even if you do two hundred paintings badly, still you have the aspiration to do something good. You are not painting for money or for any other earthly motives. If one is a really sincere seeker, his aspiration gives life to his art. But how many artists will you find who are sincere seekers? Most artists keep aspiration totally outside their art. Naturally, they will not succeed in making their art spiritual.</p>  </div>
