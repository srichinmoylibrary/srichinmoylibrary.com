<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to hold God or if you try to grasp Him, then you are bound to be insecure. You have to know your proper relationship with God. You are God’s child; let us say, His chosen child. Suppose you and God are together at a particular place and right in front of you is a deep hole. If you are holding your Father’s hand, when temptation arises you may release your hold and try to grab that temptation. At that time, you will fall into the hole. But if you allow your eternal Father to hold you, then even if temptation assails you, He will hold you so tightly that you will not be able to fall into the abyss of ignorance.</p>
<p>Insecurity comes only because your heart knows that your grasp on God is weak, and when temptation comes you will release Him and fall. But if you feel that God is holding you, then you will not feel insecure because you know that God has infinite strength to hold you fast inside His Heart. Once God captures you, you can’t go away at all; and that is what you want. Since you have become spiritual, your goal is to be utilised by God according to His Will; you don’t want to utilise God at your sweet will. So you have to remain calm and quiet and let God capture and use you in His own way. God is utilising you; He is utilising you with His Illumination. If you want to use God for your own purpose, then temptation will come to you and ask you to utilise it. And when you try to utilise temptation, you will just be devoured by temptation.</p>
<p>From now on during your prayer and meditation, please try to offer yourself to God as His instrument, and do not try to get God as your instrument. When you make God your instrument, you will not know how to play correctly; today you will play God the instrument and tomorrow you will play ignorance the instrument. But if you are the instrument, then God will play perfectly in His own divine way. If you can make yourself a truly surrendered instrument, then there can be no insecurity in your heart.</p>  </div>
