<p>Three days ago I was walking, and X and Y were following me in the car. I was near my two-and-a-half-mile mark on Main Street — in the middle of a big intersection — when a young man stopped his car abruptly and got out. He said, "O Guru, I am one of your new disciples!"</p>
<p>Master and disciple were in the middle of a big intersection — with cars this side and that side.</p>
<p>I asked, "What is your name?"</p>
<p>He said, "Michael. I am in the Blue Centre." He was so happy to see me; he was jumping with joy.</p>
<p>He said, "Yesterday I was at the tennis court."</p>
<p>The night before, new disciples had been invited to the tennis court.</p>
