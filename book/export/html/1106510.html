<p>Yesterday what was I doing? I was at PS 86 for eight hours, so today all my inspiration has disappeared. Today is inspirationless! This is the third day I have not warmed up properly. A shower is my warming up. I must not do these things. How long can Godâ€™s Grace last?</p>
<p>While I was watching the video of my morning lifts, I told Garima to come very close to the television screen, otherwise she would not be able to see the actual lift.</p>
