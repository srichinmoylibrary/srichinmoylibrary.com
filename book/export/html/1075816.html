<p><em>(Pondicherry. Aurobindo's house. The Mother looking up the </em>Arya/ accounts, etc. Amrita comes in with a heap of the morning mail Placing it on Aurobindo's table, he lingers.)/</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(Looking at Amrita)</em> Yes, Amrita?</p>
<p><em>(Amrita had the standing instructions of Aurobindo that he should remind him of the matter for the </em>Arya/ a week before the day fixed for going to press.)/</p>
<p>AMRITA: I am reminding you about matter for the <em>Arya</em>, please. Just seven days left.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Oh yes. Thank you. I'll set about it forthwith.</p>
<p>AMRITA: But once you sit at your desk you will forget everything else and go on till you finish. Why not dispose of the post first?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Very well. You are always business-like. That's all to the good.</p>
<p><em>(Running his eyes through the letters, one by one, he writes marginal notes, and stops short at one.)</em></p>
<p>Here's a reader of the <em>Arya</em> asking me how I, a literary man and a politician, could become all on a sudden an out-and-out philosopher! It has struck him rightly. I must write to him that I knew precious little about philosophy before I did the Yoga and came to Pondicherry, How did I manage to do it and why? Because X proposed to me to co-operate in a philosophical review — and my theory was that a Yogi ought to be able to turn his hand to anything ...</p>
<p>AMRITA: But it has never struck me as strange. Your articles, even your speeches, were at no time unmixed politics or pure literature. They have always been a happy blend of all the three, each at its best — I mean, politics, literature and philosophy, although the fire of love of country and her freedom predominated,</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: But hasn't the <em>Arya</em> a different complexion altogether?</p>
<p>AMRITA: Undoubtedly.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Then you concede that he is justified in asking me...</p>
<p>AMRITA: I do. Oh, that the man in question could see you filling page after page without halting anywhere, as if your very fingers were inspired!</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: But that is exactly the truth! Strange to say, a Power comes directly into the fingers, as if it did not have to pass through anything else! Just now I said that a Yogi should be able to turn his hand to anything. Well, the word "hand" can be applied in a very literal sense where the <em>Arya</em>-articles are concerned .</p>
<p>Now take these letters and make up replies from my marginal notes. Let me now start work.</p>  </div>
