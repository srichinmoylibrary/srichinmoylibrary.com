<p>The man who asked for 75 rupees said, "You should not give him the whole amount since he is unable to take you the whole way."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the three who had brought me from Madras wanted a share of this man's 75 rupees. They said, "You have to give us something because we found you a passenger."</p>
<p>The two drivers had a serious argument because the second driver didn't want to give them anything. He said, "I am saving you because you can't drive into Pondicherry."</p>
<p>I said, "No, you are not saving them. You are saving me." Then I begged him to take the 75 rupees and just drive me home.</p>
<p>When we arrived, I gave him 80 rupees.</p>
