<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Both the husband and the wife must feel that the husband is the son of God and the wife is the daughter of God, who is both Father and Mother. The Source is God the Father and God the Mother, and they are Godâ€™s children. They are supposed to play their roles devotedly and soulfully in the cosmic Drama of God.</p>  </div>
