<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can easily know whether we are meditating well or not just by the way we feel about the world around us. Right after our meditation if we have a good feeling for the world, if we love the world or see the world in a loving way in spite of its imperfections, then we can know that our meditation was good. Also, if we have a dynamic feeling right after meditation, if we feel that we came into the world to do something and become something good, this indicates that we have done a good meditation. The feeling that we have come into the world to do something does not mean we are feeding our human ambition. No! The moment we try to feed our ambition, it will entangle us like a serpent. We have come into the world to do what God wants us to do. We have come into the world to become what God wants us to become. What God wants us to do is grow into His very Image. What God wants us to be is His dedicated instrument. During our meditation if we get the feeling that God wants us to grow into His very Image and be His dedicated instrument, and if this feeling is translated into action after our meditation, then we can be sure that we were meditating well.</p>
<p>The easiest way to know if we have had a good meditation is to feel whether peace, light, love and delight are coming to the fore from within. Each time light, love, peace or delight comes forward, the whole body becomes surcharged with that divine quality. Each time one of these qualities comes to the fore, we are bound to feel that we are remembering a forgotten story. This story was written by the seeker in us; it was not written by somebody else. It is our own creation, but we have forgotten it, and it is meditation that brings it back. When we remember this story we are overjoyed that we have created such a beautiful story, which is nothing but our own life-story.</p>
