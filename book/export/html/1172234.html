<p>"God, I know that You are extremely proud of me."</p>
<p>"Why am I so proud of you?"</p>
<p>"I know for sure that You are extremely proud of me!"</p>
<p>"Please tell Me why."</p>
<p>"You are proud of me because I do not frighten You; I do not challenge You; I do not even compete with You. Here I am telling just a few reasons. Naturally, I know that You are proud of me for such unusually good qualities and I strongly feel that I deserve Your Pride!"</p>  </div>
