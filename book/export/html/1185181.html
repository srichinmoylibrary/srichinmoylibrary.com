 <p>
TRNS 6-10. On 19 November 1995, Sri Chinmoy recounted these five stories about Sarada Devi, the consort of Sri Ramakrishna. Sarada Devi was known as the Holy Mother to the disciples of Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<h2>The Master's earthly and heavenly behaviour</h2>

<p>One day, a new seeker lodged a serious complaint with Sarada Devi against a senior disciple. He said, "The senior disciple told me that one should not stay very close to one's Master for a long period of time. From the Master's earthly behaviour, the disciple may lose faith in the Master. Therefore, it is advisable for the disciple to leave after a short time if he wishes to maintain faith in the Master."</p>
<p>The Mother said, "Do not listen to him. If you take someone as your Master, you can never separate your Master's earthly behaviour from his Heavenly behaviour. Everything is always the same in his inner life and in his outer life."</p>  </div>
