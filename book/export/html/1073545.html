<p>“God, Chinmoy is my Guru. I wish to know the name of his Guru.”</p>
<p>“Chinmoy’s Guru’s name is God.”</p>
<p>“That means You are his Guru.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am his Guru.”</p>
<p>“That means You know more than Chinmoy does.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know much more than Chinmoy.”</p>
<p>“Much?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know much more than Chinmoy does.”</p>
<p>“Let me see: God, I wish You to smile exactly the way Chinmoy smiles.”</p>
<p>God smiles. “Yes God, really Your smile is exactly like Chinmoy’s smile. Now I want You to make Your Eyes as big, powerful, and frightening as Chinmoy’s eyes.”</p>
<p>God shows His big, powerful and frightening Eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes, I see. You have the same eyes as my Guru Chinmoy has. God, tell me frankly, is it true that You know much more than my Guru?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know much more than your Guru Chinmoy, and I have much more than he has. He has learned everything from Me, and I have given him everything that he now has. I also have the power to take away everything from him if he wrongly uses it.”</p>
<p>“God, don’t be so nasty. Chinmoy is so kind to me, so nice to me. I love him. We all love him. God, don’t You ever take away anything from him, please, please!”</p>
<p>“I will never take anything away from Chinmoy, I promise to you, Christine.”</p>
<p>“God, I thank You. I thank You, I thank You. My mother also will thank You deeply if You keep Your Promise.”</p>
<p>God offers to Christine His Smile of sweet Delight and Compassion.</p>  </div>
