<p>The lady who owned the meeting place that we used in Berlin came up to me after one meeting. She told me that I am a great man and that she was so grateful that I had come to her place.</p>
<p>She said, "You are an artist and I am an artist. You are a greater artist, but I would like to give you this painting of mine. I am giving it to the artist in you and not to the spiritual Master."</p>
<p>I said, "It is very beautiful."</p>
<p>She was so thrilled.</p>
