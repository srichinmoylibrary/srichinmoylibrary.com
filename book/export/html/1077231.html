<p>If we take life very seriously, we do not always get the best out of life. Sometimes spontaneous joy is the only answer to keep life going. When the two souls, Emil and Dana, became one on their wedding day, they danced until dawn â€” long after their guests had become too tired to keep up with their marathon exuberance.</p>  </div>
