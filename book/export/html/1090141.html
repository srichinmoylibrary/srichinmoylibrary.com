<p>My occultist friend<br /> Told me that he could run<br /> Faster than a deer.<br /> Naturally, I was flabbergasted.</p>
<p>My yogi friend<br /> Told me that he could<br /> Make himself stronger<br /> Than an elephant.<br /> Naturally, I was fascinated.</p>
<p>My avatar friend<br /> Told me that he became<br /> A faithful dog<br />     To carry my message to God<br />     And God's Message to me.<br /> Naturally, I was happy and grateful.</p>
