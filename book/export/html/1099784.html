  <h1 class="book-heading">My first friendship with the muse</h1>
  
   <div id="node-1099785" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Thy love to bind</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord, kidnap my heart, I humbly pray.<br /> Alas, mine is the life of a ruthless knave.<br /> I must die; no one must mourn and toll the knell.<br /> Without Thy Light my goal an error grave.</p>
<p>Eyeless desires and I together live.<br /> The human souls frown at my moping mind.<br /> My famished heart pines for Thy Bounty-height.<br /> Awaken my Will, my Lord, Thy Love to bind.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099786" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">I need the eye</h1>
  
 

<p>My heart shall be as pure as Aurora's tears.<br /> My wild vital must change its volcano-choice.<br /> To hound my golden thoughts my vital horse<br /> In vain endeavours; in me His Ecstasy-Voice.</p>
<p>I try, I cry, I sigh, but all in vain.<br /> O Lord of my bleeding heart, I need the Eye<br /> That sees the lives of the Present, Future, Past.<br /> O doubt, aside you stay from my mission's sky!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099787" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">The seed</h1>
  
 

<p>I am the seed and root and boughs,<br /> I am the aspiration-tree.<br /> In me abides the deepest deep.<br /> My goal I build; I am ever free.</p>
<p>My secret will absorbs my life,<br /> My hidden treasure I share with earth.<br /> Her sleepless pangs in me now breathe.<br /> For her my freedom vast, my birth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099788" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Quick march</h1>
  
 

<p>     Quick march, quick march within,<br /> To change the fate of mortal life.<br />     In you abides the Light<br /> That pierces ignorant human strife.     A deathless birth divine<br /> Shall bare your hidden Sun-bright heart.<br />     Sole hope of the earth are you;<br /> Ere long your mystic journey start!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099789" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">I am Thy servant</h1>
  
 

<p>I am Thy servant of-servants, humble, low,<br /> Truly I care not who Thou art, O Lord!<br /> Thy Grace I invoke, only Thy Grace sublime<br /> In Thee alone I find my bosom's cord.</p>
<p>My mind craves not for fame, O Thou Unknown,<br /> Nor for Thy boundless Power, Knowledge-Sun.<br /> My Lord, my first and last desire serene —<br /> Make me Thy Vision's golden deathless son.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099790" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My nature old</h1>
  
 

<p>My nature old in me creates<br />     Stark doubts and ire.<br /> It carries me into the cave<br />     Of blazing fire.</p>
<p>Away my spirit flies too fast<br />     And when to earth<br /> Returns, alas, the earth again will<br />     Torture my birth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099791" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">I smile</h1>
  
 

<p>I smile to make<br /> Thee smile.<br /> I weep to make<br /> Thee weep.<br /> All deeds of mine invoke<br /> Thy nameless, sun-vast sweep.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099792" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My longings</h1>
  
 

<p>My longings make me poor and weak,<br />     They hear not my secret Will.<br /> Ever they hate my quest supreme,<br />     Away they take my thrill.</p>
<p>A day shall come, I know it well,<br />     When all desires of mine<br /> Will seek Thy Grace and Thee alone.<br />     I then in Thee shall shine.</p>
<p>I will be above the fruits of deeds.<br />     Thy blue Compassion-Eye<br /> Will guide my heart and soul, my all.<br />     In Thee my past shall die.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099793" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My days and nights</h1>
  
 

<p>My days and nights are fast asleep,<br /> Long lost am I in their bosoms wide.<br /> The gloom and pangs of unknown caverns<br /> Within, without my heart abide.</p>
<p>My life-river is hushed in awe,<br /> And all my acts in vain now end.<br /> No mighty Soul to soothe my heart;<br /> My sinking breath without a friend.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099794" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">A tortuous stream</h1>
  
 

<p>A tortuous stream our only fate,<br /> A sluggish evolution's flow<br /> We feel from morn to eve of our life.<br /> Who says the One in us shall grow?</p>
<p>Covered we are with Nothingness;<br /> The ignorance breathes deep in our heart.<br /> No hope of dawn in our Stupor-breast;<br /> Before our heart-beat gleams death-dart.</p>
<p>We dwell upon the barren surface;<br /> Alas, we never go within.<br /> The Supreme's Bliss remains unknown;<br /> Around us sports a dreadful din.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099795" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Thy wisdom</h1>
  
 

<p>Thy Wisdom fills my heart.<br /> Everything, everywhere,<br /> Present, future, past<br /> I am — and all I bear.</p>
<p>My rapture knows no bounds;<br /> My sombre eyeless dole<br /> Beyond the ken of all.<br /> It is I who build my Goal.</p>
<p>My life's ignorance-dream<br /> I drive toward Thy Will.<br /> I alter now the course<br /> Of my bosom's goalless rill.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099796" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My secret and sacred bird</h1>
  
 

<p>My secret and sacred bird now flies<br /> To meet the Spirit's vacancy.<br /> All chaos of life today dissolved;<br /> In me a surge of ecstasy.</p>
<p>Gold flames within my longing heart<br /> Invoke the cosmos' Parent-Sun.<br /> A tapestry of Truth unseen<br /> Bursts forth within; the Play is begun.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099797" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">O Mother sweet</h1>
  
 

<p>The flowers of love and joy<br />     In my bosom-garden bloom.<br /> To seize Thee, O Mother Sweet,<br />     Oft-times I face my doom.</p>
<p>I seek my refuge in Thee alone,<br />     In Thee my battle of life,<br /> In Thee my welkin, stars and sun,<br />     My heart of joy and strife.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099798" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">The sport</h1>
  
 

<p>The sport of fruitless infelicity<br /> Captures my mind's ignorance-dream.<br /> Be off, be off, O satisfied desires!<br /> It is you that ruin my quest supreme.</p>
<p>I am the traveller, ignorant of Dawn;<br /> Never, alack, have I tasted Bliss.<br /> Before my heart the dart of eyeless Night;<br /> I am lost in the jaws of boundless Abyss.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099799" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My life-desert</h1>
  
 

<p>I want not what I need,<br /> I roam in eyeless Night,<br /> Ignorance sports with me,<br /> With me I ever fight.</p>
<p>The riddle of my life-desert<br /> What soul of Might can solve?<br /> Alack, I am undone!<br /> Before me death-doors revolve.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099800" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Long lost</h1>
  
 

<p>My faults are countless, yet<br />     With joy I see the faults of all.<br /> I kindle thus my pyre,<br />     Ever to hear death's constant call.</p>
<p>My soul is far, too far;<br />     In fruitless thoughts of clay I live.<br /> Long lost my mission vast;<br />     In eyeless chasm I now must grieve.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099801" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">If I can</h1>
  
 

<p>     If I can perfect my faith<br /> Thy Grace is sure to come.<br />     The more I give to Thee<br /> The more I absorb Thy Balm<br />     That heals my bosom's pangs.<br /> Without Thy Love supreme,<br />     Nothingness all I am —<br /> A dark and barren dream.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099802" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My poor and doleful heart</h1>
  
 

<p>A loafer am I; no thoughts awake my mind.<br /> To lance my drowsy brain, I needs must try.<br /> Ah, sloth is my lot, and yet, my Lord Supreme,<br /> I hope and hope in Thy Sky of Grace to fly.</p>
<p>I shall now kindle my poor and doleful heart<br /> To reach in joy Thy creation's highest height.<br /> No more my ire shall fight with Thee, no more.<br /> My surrender's life dwells far above ego's night.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099803" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">A little more</h1>
  
 

<p>A little more we desire, a little more.<br />     Our bosom's argent door<br /> Is wide open, O Mother. Come now, come!<br />     Make us Thy victory's drum.</p>
<p>Thy Will our life of surrender shall declare.<br />     Through us Thou wilt break the snare<br /> Of eyeless, heartless, goalless earth entire,<br />     And change its destiny dire.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099804" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My thirst</h1>
  
 

<p>     My thirst for Joy supreme<br /> Appeased, and now remain I mute.<br />     My Lord, my Lord Supreme,<br /> My dreams now play with Thy Golden Flute.     I drink with Thee Thy Bliss;<br /> Thy Will, Thy Vision-Sun are mine.<br />     To lift the earth-bound life<br /> Into the skies, my vow divine.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099805" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My mission</h1>
  
 

<p>To drive me mad many a man is apt.<br /> To spot my snow-white heart their only choice.<br /> Futile is their outcry; and I must make<br /> My heart sleepless to hear Thy Nectar-Voice.</p>
<p>My love shall be the Noon of burning delight.<br /> I shall now hug earthly ignorance and dole<br /> To feed the human souls with ceaseless might<br /> And lift the earth to show her zenith-goal.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099806" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My bosom pines</h1>
  
 

<p>I build castles in the air; the Grace divine<br /> Never descends to cure my doleful heart.<br /> I house wild thoughts; I feed wrong deeds undivine.<br /> I must now shift my mind from the busy mart.</p>
<p>O Peace supreme, for you my bosom pines.<br /> In you alone my will shall meet the One.<br /> Out of harm's way my golden thoughts shall dwell.<br /> My life is growing into my inner Sun.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099807" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My life welcomes</h1>
  
 

<p>To be a good altruist is not my aim.<br /> Thy high decree is my only choice august.<br /> All things shall run to waste; but not Thy Grace<br /> That runs through all our limbs of eyeless dust.</p>
<p>Thy Grace descends; my heart is freedom's bliss,<br /> Never to play with the black and binding clay.<br /> No death can bind my climbing faith divine;<br /> My life welcomes the pride of Eternal Day.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099808" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">The giant gain</h1>
  
 

<p>My heart of love sheds tears for my searching mind.<br /> Its effort to cure the mind now ends in vain.<br /> With flaming words my mind to awaken I try.<br /> Alas, my failure the devil's giant gain.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099809" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">They frown</h1>
  
 

<p>They frown at me when I wander and dote.<br /> For strength above I look, within I look.<br /> To breathe vengeance is to kill Thy solar Law,<br /> Therefore all evils of earth I needs must brook.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099810" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">I am not</h1>
  
 

<p>No, I am not ahead of all;<br /> Neither behind all souls, I know.<br /> My sense of worth tortures my mind.<br /> With me my bleeding heart's ceaseless flow.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099811" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My solace</h1>
  
 

<p>O Lord of my love, Your ruthless absence has now<br /> Broken asunder my feeble heart. No cure!<br /> My pride august is exiled in oblivion's cave.<br /> The dance of utter ruin is my solace sure.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099812" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">His Feet I kiss</h1>
  
 

<p>The King of my heart today is come,<br /> His Feet I kiss with blissful eyes.<br /> For Him my heart, my soul, my all,<br /> His Feet of Light my paradise.</p>
<p>I shed my tears of love and joy<br /> To see and know His secret Play.<br /> His Love is power of boundless realms,<br /> In Him must shine my mind of Day.</p>
<p>His victory through me He will announce;<br /> Through me He will change the poverty dire<br /> Of nether land and eyeless earth.<br /> My zenith-goal His Love of fire.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099813" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My sacrifice</h1>
  
 

<p>I nothing want but my all to give.<br />     My sacrifice ends not in vain.<br /> A sweet return I know shall come<br />     When I am above all loss and gain.</p>
<p>All pure souls into one must fuse.<br />     True Love shall only then be known.<br /> The Golden Gate that hides<br />     The One reveals His wealth, His own.</p>
<p>Undying desires of man<br />     His high and Golden Goal do vend.<br /> Thus does he fail to dwell<br />     In boundless Immortality, his End.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099814" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Doubt we drink</h1>
  
 

<p>     We sport with doubt,<br /> And thus our strength we kill.<br />     Ah, doubt the poison<br /> We drink in utter thrill.     Our ego shows<br /> Our heart the path of lies,<br />     And leads us all<br /> Where eyeless darkness flies.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099815" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">The life immortal</h1>
  
 

<p>The life immortal must<br />     Be this life of ours.<br /> Limitless progress, Joy<br />     Must feed our hours.</p>
<p>The selfless Will that knows<br />     No feeble fears<br /> Is our only guide and Eye<br />     To end our tears.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099816" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Desires of mine</h1>
  
 

<p>     Desires of mine<br /> Limit my possibility.<br />     They allow me not<br /> To hasten my Lord's Infinity.     The darkness blind<br /> In secret covers my Knowledge-Sun.<br />     Alas, in me<br /> The game of death has now begun.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099817" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">To give to Thee</h1>
  
 

<p>     To give to Thee<br /> Many a thing have I,<br />     But of Thee I need<br /> Thy golden wings to fly.     The sod of my thoughts<br /> Through my offering-light<br />     Transforms its pangs,<br /> Transforms its bondage-night.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099818" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Our fruitless longings</h1>
  
 

<p>Our fruitless longings never know<br />     What danger great they hug.<br /> They ever are fond of barren things;<br />     In them, alas, our graves are dug.</p>
<p>O acts that lead us all to Night,<br />     Today once feel our power.<br /> No one remains ever in hell;<br />     In all abides God's Hour.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099819" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">The bird of peace</h1>
  
 

<p>The bird of peace in me abides;<br />     The distant Sun<br /> Embraces its wings with matchless bliss.<br />     My play is begun.</p>
<p>The Unborn is born within my heart.<br />     The pangs of earth<br /> Now reach my life's delight extreme,<br />     My Golden birth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099820" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My mind is the guide</h1>
  
 

<p>My mind is the Guide,<br /> Hence down I fall.<br /> Desires and thoughts<br /> Make me a ball.<br /> With me they play<br /> From morn to eve.<br /> Attachment flies<br /> In me; I heave<br /> A sigh in vain.<br /> This truth I know:<br /> If I on Thee<br /> Depend, Thou wilt sow<br /> The seed of Fire<br /> In my blind misery.<br /> Lord, with all<br /> My faults, seize me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099821" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Mahakali</h1>
  
 

<p>     O Mother, come, do come.<br /> My sleepless loving heart shall bow.<br />     Thy Feet that shake the world<br /> Shall be my only choice from now.     My slumber pines to-day<br /> To hear Thy stern and unique voice.<br />     Do conquer, Mother sweet,<br /> My haughty mind's deafening noise.     Thou art the source of all,<br /> In Thee abides my promised Hour,<br />     To fulfil my soul's desire<br /> Thy Feet of love, O Mother of Power.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099822" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">All-presence am I</h1>
  
 

<p>Although I dwell in poverty,<br /> Matchless all joy of mine remains.<br /> Upon my heart His Bounty rains<br /> From His flame-white Eternity.</p>
<p>To none I show my teeming thoughts,<br /> My trance is seen by me alone.<br /> My heart shall never tremble or moan;<br /> All-presence am I, in me no noughts.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099823" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Journey</h1>
  
 

<p>Onward, upward my heart proceeds.<br /> I, the finite, perceive the One.<br /> His soulful boundless Heart of Love<br /> Awakes my bosom's inner Sun.</p>
<p>Impossible deeds of yore to-day<br /> Have reached their lofty wonder-goals.<br /> My heart is changed, my world is changed,<br /> I love all souls and own all souls.</p>
<p>I inspire the world to forget its woe,<br /> I long for its inner cry to increase,<br /> The far no more remains afar;<br /> Now fast approaches my mind's release.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099824" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">To blot out the past</h1>
  
 

<p>To blot out the past from my bosom's tablet firm<br /> Ever I try in vain.<br /> The past a burden to all my longings pure,<br /> Silent is my Knowledge-main.<br /> Its golden waves that bear the thrill unknown<br /> I never see and feel.<br /> I fight and fight with Dragon Night,<br /> Long lost my Spirit's thrill.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099825" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">No end</h1>
  
 

<p>No end to my fruitless dreams;<br />     I build in me my heaven sweet.<br /> O binding and blinding life,<br />     Never for you my Beloved's Feet.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099826" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">I see Thy golden wings</h1>
  
 

<p>I see Thy golden wings<br /> That shelter all our souls.<br /> I see Thy Luster-Heart<br /> That feeds our earthly roles.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099827" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">O Sun unplumbed</h1>
  
 

<p>O Sun unplumbed! O Father, Comrade sweet!<br /> Thy sweetness vast now tortures me, my heart.<br /> My heart's glowing gates no more invite<br /> The teeming doubts and brooding fears of earth.<br /> The truth of Joy within, without me flies.<br /> The Voice that speaks within the core of the Sun<br /> Shall love and fulfil my secret and sacred choice.<br /> In Matter's body dawns the Spirit's Height.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099828" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">I smile for Thee</h1>
  
 

<p>I smile for Thee, but where art Thou?<br /> I weep for Thee, but where art Thou?<br /> All contraries of my sorry life<br /> To Thee I offer; to Thee I bow.</p>
<p>Wilt Thou remain beyond my reach?<br /> Even beyond the reach of my love?<br /> No, never art Thou very far.<br /> I am Thy Heart, I am Thy Dove.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099829" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Of what is made Thy heart?</h1>
  
 

<p>When stars and moon are mute in trance<br />     My bosom pines for Thee.<br /> My love for Thee smashes my pride<br />     Of dumb eternity.</p>
<p>I hear at times Thy golden flute,<br />     But beyond my reach Thou art.<br /> My sacrifice in vain will end.<br />     Of what is made Thy Heart?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099830" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Our thoughts</h1>
  
 

<p>Nothing is sweet, but bitter all.<br />     Of woe the world is made.<br /> Our thoughts, a bed of naked thorns;<br />     In us a sombre shade.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099831" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My vital and my mind</h1>
  
 

<p>Inside a field of thorns am I.<br /> To quit its grasp in vain I try.<br /> My vital wild and my drowsy mind<br /> Are daily fed by Ignorance blind.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099832" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">My inner race</h1>
  
 

<p>O Lord, Thy Smile serene<br /> Remains to me unseen.<br /> Yet every hope of mine<br /> Calls Thee, Solace divine.</p>
<p>My sorrow none to share,<br /> No soul for me to care.<br /> I have lost my inner race.<br /> Nowhere shall I see Thy Face.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099833" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">How long am I to wait?</h1>
  
 

<p>How long am I to wait, how long,<br />     To see the golden Child<br /> Who sports ever in my sky-breast<br />     To fulfil my longings mild?</p>
<p>The fight of life is dire I know.<br />     Yet His victory's dawn is sure.<br /> He thinks little of danger, death;<br />     His smile my only cure.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1099834" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">To-day my human mind</h1>
  
 

<p>To-day my human mind is fearless, calm.<br /> To-day my heartbeats sing His Song divine.<br /> In me I find the nectar of lucid dreams.<br /> I shine in all; all souls in me now shine.</p>
<p>We all are truly greater than acts of ours.<br /> We are the fond and deathless Will of the One.<br /> All spotless thoughts abide within our minds;<br /> All trifling deeds with ease of heart we shun.</p>
