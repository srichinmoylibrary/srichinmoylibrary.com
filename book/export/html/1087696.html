<p>The stories in this book, many based on historical incidents or traditional tales from India's past, offer an illumining glimpse at some of the experiences that helped shape the consciousness of Mother India. The stories have been adapted and retold by a master storyteller whose spiritual insights will benefit Easterners and Westerners alike.</p>  </div>
