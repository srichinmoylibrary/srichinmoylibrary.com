<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can live in the heart the moment you think that you do not have any mind. First think that you have two rooms: one is the heart-room and the other is the mind-room. Now it is up to you whether you will stay in the mind-room or in the heart-room. You don’t have to stay in the mind-room at all. You are wrong if you say, “I have only the mind-room and I must stay there; otherwise, I shall have to stay in the street.” There is another room for you to stay in.</p>
<p>Right now you are staying in one room which is dark. This room will not always remain dark. Today it is dark, but tomorrow it will be illumined. We must do the first thing first. First we have to remain always in the heart-room and then, with the light from the heart-room, we must enter into the mind-room and illumine it. So for the time being, have nothing to do with the mind-room. Later, when you have light, the mind-room need not be neglected.</p>  </div>
