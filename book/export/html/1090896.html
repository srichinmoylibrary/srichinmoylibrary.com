<h2>Question: When is the best time for meditation if you want something like peace, for example?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you need peace, meditate early in the evening, between six and seven. Nature, as it offers its salutations to the setting sun, will inspire you, comfort you and help you.</p>
<p>If you need power, meditate at twelve noon. The blazing sun and the most dynamic hour of the day will help you.</p>
<p>If you need joy, meditate early in the morning between five and six. Mother Earth, with her sweetest love, will help you.</p>
<p>If you need patience, meditate in the evening. Meditate sitting at the foot of a tree. Meditate on the tree. Its sacrificing consciousness will help you.</p>
<p>If you need love, meditate at midnight at your own picture. Your Inner Pilot will help you.</p>
<p>If you need purity, meditate on your incoming breath and your outgoing breath early in the morning before you leave your bed. Your soul will help you.</p>  </div>
