  <h1 class="book-heading">Grace</h1>
  
 
<p>Before realisation we think that our personal effort, our aspiration alone is responsible for our spiritual progress. At that time there is no such thing as Grace for us. But after realisation we come to see that there is no such thing as aspiration. Our progress is all due to divine Grace.</p>
<p>In the ordinary human life there is no end to our desire. Today we want one car, tomorrow two cars, the day after tomorrow three cars: our desire goes on and on. In the world of aspiration and realisation there is also no end. From an iota of Peace, Light and Bliss, we try to get a large quantity, then an abundant measure, then an infinite measure. But we have to know who has inspired us to leave the world of desire and enter into the world of aspiration.</p>
<p>Among the members of my family, my friends and all the people in the whole world, why is it that only I am aspiring? Who inspired me? Who compelled me to aspire? It was the divine Grace of the Supreme that inspired me. How is it that my brother is not praying and meditating but I am crying to realise God? It is because the highest power, the divine Grace is operating in and through me. Aspiration I have because God gave it to me. It is all His Grace.</p>
<p>The sun is shining. It is up to us to open all the windows and all the doors in order to receive the light. Naturally, if we open up the doors and windows, then the sun will come in. Similarly, the divine Grace is constantly showering down from above. Let us try always to receive it with our heartâ€™s door wide open.</p>  </div>
