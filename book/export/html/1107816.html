<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To feel that kind of sensation is very good. It means that your body, vital and mind have become one with your heart's prayer. At that time the body is not thinking of eating or sleeping, the vital is not thinking of jumping, the mind is not doubting. When the body, vital and mind become one with the heart's cry, you feel that sensation it is very good. The body does not want to sleep, the vital does not want to jump, the mind does not want to doubt; all of the being is supporting the heart. It is not an actual physical sensation you are getting but a kind of subtle joy and delight.</p>  </div>
