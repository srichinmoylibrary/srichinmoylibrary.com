<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Originally God created countless, infinite Sanatans, but one Sanatan said to God, “Father, I don’t want to be with all my brothers and sisters. I want to be left all alone. I wish to enjoy my individuality and personality; so please let me be alone.” God said to this particular son, “Wonderful, My son, you go and enjoy your individuality and personality. But I tell you, there will come a time when you will become tired of your personality and individuality. At that time, you will beg Me to allow you to go back to your brothers and sisters to enjoy their concern instead of your individuality and personality. And I will let you do so.”</p>  </div>
