<p>He cannot be bribed.<br /> He cannot be fooled.</p>
<p>He cannot be shaken.<br /> He cannot be broken.</p>
<p>He cannot be ignored.<br /> He cannot be misunderstood.</p>
<p>Bribe Him,<br /> And your future is lost.<br /> Fool Him,<br /> And your future is lost.</p>
<p>Shake Him,<br /> And your future is lost.<br /> Break Him,<br /> And your future is lost.</p>
<p>Ignore Him,<br /> And your future is lost.<br /> Misunderstand Him,<br /> And your future is lost.</p>
<p>Where is your future?<br /> In His Heart.</p>
<p>What is your future?<br /> His Will.</p>
