<p>During our Games Day, I went out for a run and got lost. I saw a girl ahead of me, but I said to myself, "What am I going to ask her? I don't even know the name of the school or the street. Maybe I should say, 'Have you seen hundreds of people playing tennis and other games?'"</p>
<p>I decided just to run by her. Then I noticed that she was wearing a name tag. So I went back and asked her what Centre she was from.</p>
<p>She said, "Connecticut."</p>
<p>Then I asked, "How long have you been a disciple?"</p>
<p>She answered, "One month."</p>
<p>The disciple directed me back to the school. I had to make a few turns, but it wasn't far. So you see, you should all wear name tags. Then, if any of you ever get lost or something happens to you, you will know whom to ask for help.</p>
