  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: What should a householder’s attitude be towards working in the world?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The householder’s attitude should be all-loving, all-serving and all-illumining. The householder should feel that the outer world is only an expansion of his or her own world; it is not isolated from his world. The householder should feel that the vast world and the world that he himself embodies or represents must go together. The microcosm and the macrocosm, the finite and the Infinite, must go together.</p>  </div>
