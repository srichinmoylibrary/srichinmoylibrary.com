<p><em>(Harish Chandra, Shaivya and Rohitashwa have travailed a few miles. All of a sudden they hear a frightening voice. They turn around only to see Vishwamitra approaching them in the greatest hurry imaginable.)</em></p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Stop, Harish Chandra! I had not the slightest idea that you were a rogue of the deepest dye. No doubt you have made a generous gift. But what about the <em>dakshina</em>, the sacerdotal fee? I believe you are an Aryan. I believe you are an Indian. Have I to remind you of the simplest religious practice that any gift offered to someone must needs be followed by <em>dakshina</em>? Tell me why and how you have managed to forget such a simple thing. Shall I call you the worst possible fool, or the worst possible rogue? I think the latter you rightly deserve.</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: O sage, at your feet I placed everything that I had. Nothing have I now. Please give me a fleeting month. At the end of the month I shall offer you my humble <em>dakshina</em>.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Harish Chandra, remember your promise. When this month comes to an end I shall approach you and demand my absolutely legitimate due.</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: O sage, by your grace, by God’s Grace, I shall be worthy of my heart’s soulful promise. At the end of the month please bless me with your august presence and collect your due.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: All right.</p>  </div>
