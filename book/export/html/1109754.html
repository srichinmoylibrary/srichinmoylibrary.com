<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are athletes who are far, far better than we, infinitely superior to us as athletes. But when it is a matter of inner aspiration, they have none. It will take them hundreds of incarnations to realise God, whereas we have the opportunity to realise God even in this incarnation.</p>  </div>
