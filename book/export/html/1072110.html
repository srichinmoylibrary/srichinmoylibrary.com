<p><em>Yogi:</em> A liberated soul usually does not care for God-manifestation on earth. He feels that once he is liberated, his role in the cosmic drama is ended. A realised soul cries for God-manifestation. He feels that once he is realised, his role in the cosmic drama has properly begun. A liberated soul is freed from the meshes of ignorance, and at the same time is extremely careful of wild ignorance. A realised soul has discovered his own inner divinity which is flooded with God's all-seeing vision and all- fulfilling reality. A liberated soul usually uses God according to his own capacity. A realised soul uses God only when asked by God Himself. The human and the unreal in us cease in liberation. The divine and the real in us begin in realisation.</p>  </div>
