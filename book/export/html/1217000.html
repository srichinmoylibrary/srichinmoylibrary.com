<p>Coming back from Seattle, I was flying first class. But even that didn't save me!</p>
<p>First of all, after I sat down in my proper seat, they wanted me to move because they had given the same seat number to another passenger. They said, "You have to move because your seat number was issued in New York."</p>
<p>Finally, when I insisted, they took the other person's ticket and changed it.</p>
<p>Then, in two cases they had separated husband and wife. A man was seated next to me, but his wife was three rows behind. She came over to me and said, "Would you change seats with me?"</p>
<p>I went to her seat right away. Then, when the plane was about to start, another man came up to me and said, "Please, this is my wife here. Could I sit with her?"</p>
<p>So I changed seats again. This was my first-class experience!</p>
