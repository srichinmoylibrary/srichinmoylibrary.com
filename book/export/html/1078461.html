<p>IT REALLY HAPPENED</p>
<p>It really happened:<br /> God asked me to come down<br /> And work for Him on earth.</p>
<p>It really happened:<br /> I begged Him not to throw me<br /> Into the Truth-devouring,<br /> Light-devouring earth.</p>
<p>It really happened:<br /> God told me that my service-light<br /> Was badly needed for earth-transformation,<br /> And that I was supremely chosen<br /> By His own Height supreme.</p>
