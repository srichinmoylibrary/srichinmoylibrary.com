<p>My Lord, do prove to me<br /> That You love me.<br /> "My child, how?"<br /> My Lord, if You can make me<br /> And keep me happy<br /> Only for an hour every day,<br /> Then I shall feel<br /> That You really love me.<br /> "My child, do prove to Me<br /> That you love Me."<br /> My Lord, how?<br /> "My child, if you can make Me<br /> And keep Me happy<br /> Only for five minutes every day,<br /> Then I shall feel<br /> That you really love Me.<br /> My child, if you can please Me,<br /> I shall make you and keep you happy,<br /> Not only for an hour every day<br /> But for the entire day."<br /> My Lord, I want to make You happy,<br /> But please show me the way.<br /> "My child, just give Me<br /> Your unconditional surrender<br /> For five minutes every day.<br /> My child, I want to keep you happy<br /> Throughout the entire day.<br /> Just show Me the way."<br /> My Lord, just give me<br /> Your Infinity's Affection<br /> And<br /> Your Immortality's Love.</p>
