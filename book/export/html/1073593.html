<blockquote>
<p>"There are more pleasant things to do than to beat up people."</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali, on the occasion of one of his retirements</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the only pleasant thing to do in this world is to shake hands with people and not break the great jaws of people and send them to Heaven.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073595" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"When I was kidnapped, my parents snapped into action. They rented out my room."</p>
<p>Woody Allen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who knows, perhaps they celebrated. Perhaps they thought you had found a better place and a better environment.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073596" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give."</p>
<p>Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the thing that we give in order to make a life? A constant feeling of oneness with each and every human being. This constant feeling of oneness can truly make a life that will satisfy not only one individual or a few individuals, but the entire humanity.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073597" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Kindness is like snow; it makes everything it covers beautiful."</p>
<p>Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like kindness, a smile from the heart not only purifies the human mind but also illumines the human heart.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073598" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Give not from the top of your purse, but from the bottom of your heart."</p>
<p>Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the top of my purse, what I give is my superiority.</p>
<p>From the bottom of my heart, what I give is my universal unity.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073599" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Between two evils, choose neither; between two goods, choose both."</p>
<p>Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, my mind's impurity and my heart's ingratitude are two veritable evils. Therefore, I shall accept neither.</p>
<p>To me, my mind's purity and my heart's gratitude are both good. Therefore, I shall unmistakably and immediately choose both.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073600" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"The world needs more warm hearts and fewer hotheads."</p>
<p>Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hotheads have played their role. They are on the verge of destroying the world. It is high time for the warm hearts to come to the fore to save the world, illumine the world and fulfil God's Dream in His creation.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073601" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Some pursue happiness- Others create it."</p>
<p>Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ninety-five per cent pursue happiness. Only five per cent create happiness. Again, among that five per cent, only one or two per cent have become sleeplessly and breathlessly happy by virtue of their inseparable oneness with God's Will.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073602" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Everybody should believe in something. I believe I'll have another drink."</p>
<p>Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also believe in something. I believe God the transcendental Emperor is deliberately playing the role of God the universal Beggar.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073603" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"The power of love and caring can change the world."</p>
<p>James Autry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There can be nothing more beautiful, more truthful, more inspiring and more illumining than this loftiest divinity-flooded utterance.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073604" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Boy, the things I do for England!"</p>
<p>Prince Charles, on sampling snake meat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boy, how few demands England makes on me! How few demands the entire world makes on me!</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073605" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Music with dinner is an insult both to the cook and the violinist."</p>
<p>G. K. Chesterton</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, a deplorable experience for both the eater and the performer.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073606" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody."</p>
<p>Bill Cosby</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To please everybody is an impossible task. It is a thankless, birthless and deathless task. But just to try to please everybody, I am establishing my friendship with impossibility's frown.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073607" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"When I was a boy, I was told that anybody could become president. I'm beginning to believe it."</p>
<p>Clarence Darrow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I was a boy, I was told that everybody has the capacity to realise God. Now I wish to add that this truth is more real than any other truth created by God and, at the same time, this truth is more devastating than any other truth manufactured by man's mind-factory.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073608" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Man is a god in ruins."</p>
<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, God is a man longing for His perfect manifestation on earth.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073609" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"The excellent is new forever."</p>
<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Self-transcendence is always newness par excellence. It is Eternity's beginningless Cry and Infinity's endless Smile.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073610" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Make yourself necessary to somebody."</p>
<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who is that somebody, if not an extension, a true extension, of your own unaware self-reality?</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073611" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"I improve on misquotation."</p>
<p>Cary Grant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I improve on the author's forgiveness.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073612" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"I do not take a single newspaper, nor read one a month, and I feel myself infinitely the happier for it."</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear President, how I wish I could be a perfect follower of yours! Do we learn anything from the newspaper?</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073613" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"When I hear the word 'culture', I reach for my gun."</p>
<p>Hans Johst</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I hear the word 'culture', I immediately invoke the world-culture-saviours and vision-revealers of the past, present and future for their compassion-flooded indulgence-presence.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073614" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">21.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Forgive your enemies, but never forget their names."</p>
<p>John F. Kennedy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not think I will ever be able to forgive anybody adequately if I do not forget their names first, for I am afraid that, more than their wrong actions, their destructive names will destroy my hard-earned peace of mind.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073615" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">22.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"What this country needs are more unemployed politicians."</p>
<p>Edward Langley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What all countries need are more unconditional self-givers and more peace-lovers.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073616" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"There is no such thing as inner peace. There is only nervousness and death."</p>
<p>Fran Liebowitz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the beginning of creation, only one thing has been hiding successfully and that thing is peace. Like other things that are hidden, peace shall one day successfully be brought to the fore for the complete satisfaction of our peace-hungry world.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073617" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"I talk to myself because I like dealing with a better class of people."</p>
<p>Jackie Mason</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The outer man in me talks to the inner man in me because there are many things that the outer man has to unburden.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073618" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Let us move on to the stars. Who can hamper our ascent?"</p>
<p>Sarojini Naidu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An indomitable aspiration-heart will never face any difficulty in climbing up the ever-transcending and ever-illumining perfection and satisfaction-heights.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073619" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">26.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Much has been done at present, but vastly more remains to be done."</p>
<p>Jaiprakash Narain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All those who want to achieve something, either for God the Creator or God the creation, must feel the same, for they all sail in the same boat-the boat that wants to reach God-manifestation-shore on earth.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073620" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">27.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"I drink to make other people more interesting."</p>
<p>George Jean Nathan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I speak to empty my mind's ignorance-sea so that others can avoid having ignorance-seas for themselves.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073621" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">28.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"One should not come to America for the first time!"</p>
<p>Jawaharlal Nehru</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O non-Americans, the heart and soul of America are welcoming you. Come, with your openness-heart, to be inseparably one with America's ascending heart of hope and manifesting soul of promise.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073622" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">29.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Living with a saint is more gruelling than being one."</p>
<p>Robert Neville</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The striving for perfection is almost an impossible task, but when perfection is reached, it is not only everlasting, but also universal.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073623" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">30.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"It is easier to be gigantic than to be beautiful."</p>
<p>Nietzsche</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inner beauty has the strength of ten giants!</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073624" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">31.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"The earth has a limit, The mountain, the sea; The deep thoughts of kings are Without boundary."</p>
<p>The Panchatantra</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything that is in the outer life and in the outer world is, unfortunately, limited. But once you enter into the inner world, you discover everything in infinite measure.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073625" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">32.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"He was a wise man who invented God."</p>
<p>Plato</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, that wise man is not alive, otherwise, every limb of his would have been butchered by God-haters.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073626" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">33.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"See everything. Overlook a great deal. Improve a little."</p>
<p>Pope John XXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See everything as God's creation.</p>
<p>Overlook, as often as you can, the faults of others.</p>
<p>Improve a little more your faith in the God-aspiration and God-dedication of humanity.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073627" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">34.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"It's never too late to have a happy childhood."</p>
<p>Tom Robbins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement is absolutely true. Here and now, anybody-no matter how old he is-can have the happiest childhood, provided he does not drag along his past and he does not invite the uncertain future. He has to depend entirely on the newness of his hope and the fulness of his promise to himself. Then he can easily have a happy childhood once more.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073628" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">35.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"I have a new philosophy. I'm only going to dread one day at a time."</p>
<p>Charles Schulz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My new philosophy is that the power of fear has to be completely conquered by the light of faith.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073629" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">36.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"A friend is a present you give yourself."</p>
<p>Robert Louis Stevenson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The God-Friend has come to me as an unconditional boon and not as a conditional present.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073630" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">37.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"He who gives all, keeps all."</p>
<p>Rabindranath Tagore</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, the giver is something more than one who simply gives. The giver is always enriched infinitely more by God, the All-Fulfiller.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073631" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">38.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Come what may, India's message must be delivered to America!"</p>
<p>Rabindranath Tagore</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O immortal soul Tagore, O immortal soul Rabindranath, another Bengali heart is trying to fulfil, devotedly, soulfully and untiringly, your wishful command.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073632" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">39.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Nothing is said that has not been said before."</p>
<p>Terence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This philosophy forces me once more to enter into a tiny cave at the foot of the Himalayas instead of helping me to climb up Mount Everest.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073633" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">40.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Any fool can make a rule."</p>
<p>Henry David Thoreau</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas, had I known this infallible statement before, then I would not have made so many absurd rules for my discipline-incarnate disciples!</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073634" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">41.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Be careful about reading health books. You may die of a misprint."</p>
<p>Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Health food advocates are deeply pained that their wild critics have not only sightless eyes, but also proper hunger-lacking stomachs.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073635" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">42.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up."</p>
<p>Paul Valéry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, the best way to transform your dreams into realities is to cheerfully obey God's Compassion-Command-Eye.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073636" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">43.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"There is no human problem which could not be solved if people would simply do as I advise."</p>
<p>Gore Vidal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas, my ignorance does not permit me to know who you are and where you are. Otherwise, I would have immediately telephoned you for your all-cure advice for all my born, unborn and untold problems.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073637" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">44.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Any good deed never goes unpunished."</p>
<p>Gore Vidal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor fool, the Creator is running very fast towards you to meet with you and shake your hand most powerfully.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1073638" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">45.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"If there is a God, we must see Him; if there is a soul, we must feel it. Otherwise, it is better to be an atheist than to be a hypocrite."</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God has to be seen face to face. God has to be spoken with person to person. We must believe first. Then we must feel and live the reality that we believe in. If we do not believe in the reality within and consciously try to manifest it in our outer life, then we are not only fooling ourselves and others, but also lowering humanity's God-inheritance-prestige.</p>  </div>
