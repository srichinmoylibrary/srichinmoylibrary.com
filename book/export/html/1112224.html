<p>Yesterday my pace was 18:40 per mile walking. Today it became 17:30 â€” so I am progressing. And yesterday somebody insulted me very badly. I was struggling and struggling. After my two-mile mark, each stride was agony. An elderly white man passed by me and said, "Why don't you go to a lunatic institute?" He was very serious. It was not a joke. His voice was full of contempt. I thanked him.</p>
