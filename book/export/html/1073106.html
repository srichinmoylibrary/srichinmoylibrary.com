<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. The spiritual significance of independence is always the same for each nation. But one nation can receive much more Light from above and offer much more sacrifice to God than other nations, on the strength of its inner cry to become one with the universal Reality and the transcendental Vision.</p>  </div>
