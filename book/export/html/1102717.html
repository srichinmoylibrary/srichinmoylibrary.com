<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God originated Himself out of His own Silence. He was One, but He wanted to become many in order to divinely enjoy the cosmic Game. You cannot enjoy a game with only one person. If you want to play a game, you need more players. So the Creator multiplied Himself and became the creation.</p>
