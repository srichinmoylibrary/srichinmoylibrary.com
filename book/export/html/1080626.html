<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Last night when I learned that I would be fortunate enough to meet with you, I was immediately inspired to compose a soulful song in your honour. It was at the eleventh hour.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> I am very grateful.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> And this morning I was inspired to compose another song. Unfortunately, they did not have a chance to learn it, so I have to sing it.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> That's very, very sweet. I'm very, very touched. You shouldn't have. I feel totally unworthy of this.</p>  </div>
