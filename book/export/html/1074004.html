<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual heart embodies not only the individual consciousness but also the universal Consciousness. We have two hearts. One heart is a tiny muscle and the other is the possessor of the universal Consciousness. The spiritual heart is much larger than the universal Consciousness. This may be difficult for you to believe right now, but once you realise God, you will see that the universal Consciousness is perfectly housed in your spiritual heart.</p>  </div>
