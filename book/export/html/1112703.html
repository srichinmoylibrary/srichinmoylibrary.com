<p>At around ten o'clock at night I ordered food: coffee, french fries, chilled soup and plain salad. A black girl said, "Please tell me what kind of dressing you want."</p>
<p>I said, "I don't know. Any dressing."</p>
<p>Then she asked me, "How old are you?"</p>
<p>I said, "Fifty."</p>
<p>Then she said to me, "Grandpa, I am sending you Russian dressing. I will send you to Russia."</p>
<p>I said, "How I wish I could go to Russia!" This was our joke.</p>
<p>When I ordered, they told me that in half an hour they would send the food to my room. After an hour had passed I phoned and said, "Please cancel my order; it is getting late." But they said they had just sent it. Finally the food came, but unfortunately it was not good.</p>
<p>When they gave me the bill I just signed it without looking at it. In the morning I saw that it had come to $17.50! Why? There was a service charge.</p>  </div>
