    <title>Question: Is it possible to reach a form of realisation from a very straight back ground? It is hard to keep trying to stay with it. Is it possible, although it is difficult?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is not the sole monopoly of an individual or of some selected individuals. If somebody has a sincere inner cry, then sooner or later, at God’s choice Hour, that particular person is bound to realise God and reach the highest Height. God’s Compassion-Light can easily nullify one’s deplorable background. If someone has a sincere inner cry, then definitely he will be able to realise God, no matter what his or her background is, or how much difficulty he has gone through in life before he accepted spirituality. It entirely depends on how sincerely one needs God. If one sincerely needs God, then eventually in one’s spiritual march one will realise God.</p>  </div>
