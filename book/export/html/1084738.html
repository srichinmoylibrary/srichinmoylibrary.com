<p>CALL NOBODY YOUR OWN</p>
<p>Call nobody your own.<br /> Look, your own doubt-son<br /> Has deserted you.<br /> Look, your own jealousy-daughter<br /> Has strangled you.<br /> Look, your own impurity-husband<br /> Has buried you.<br /> Only call God your own:<br /> Look, He has resurrected you:<br /> He is feeding you,<br /> He is energising you,<br /> He is immortalising you.</p>
