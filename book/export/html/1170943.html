<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, the spacecraft was touching the planet on another level. It did not disturb them. Simply taking pictures does not disturb them, but if people start living there, then it will disturb them. Just taking a picture does not disturb them, because photographs are not able to catch those beings. But if human beings go there and colonise, then definitely the beings will feel that we are disturbing them. Then we will be in trouble.</p>  </div>
