<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Philosophy will die in your mind only when your heart most sincerely cries for the death of philosophy. Here, death is not actually the right word. We must go beyond the domain of philosophy; we must transcend philosophy. When we transcend philosophy, we enter into the domain of spirituality. Inside spirituality, beauty, love, light, joy and power loom large. At that time, the philosophy that comes from the mind is automatically going to be illumined and changed. Otherwise, philosophy as such does not usually die; it lingers in the mental world. But if you want to go beyond the mental world, then you have to enter into the spiritual life.</p>  </div>
