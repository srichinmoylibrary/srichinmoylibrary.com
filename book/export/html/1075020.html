<p>She jumped and jumped<br />   Before the Lord.<br /> She ran and ran<br />   Before the Lord.<br /> She dived and dived<br />   Before the Lord.</p>
<p>Finally the Lord<br /> Jumped with His jumper-seeker<br /> Only to break His knees,<br /> Ran with His runner-seeker<br /> Only to damage His heart,<br /> Dived with His diver-seeker<br /> Only to break His head.</p>
<p>Lo,<br /> The jumper reached<br />   The Height of the Supreme.<br /> The runner reached<br />   The Length of the Supreme.<br /> The diver reached<br />   The Depth of the Supreme.</p>
