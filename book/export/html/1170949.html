 <p>
SCA 481-530. These questions on the soul were answered by Sri Chinmoy on 27 November 1996.</p>
<h2>Question: When I was in the hospital after my accident, I had what you called an experience of my higher self. Was it a one-time event, or will I have this experience again?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can have the same experience again, if so is the Will of God. But I know that you have had experiences much higher than the one you had at the hospital.</p>  </div>
