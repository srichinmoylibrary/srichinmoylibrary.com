<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No matter where the Supreme is, His Compassion-magnet is pulling us, but we are afraid of being caught by this Compassion. We are very clever. When His Compassion touches us, the mind says, “It is all feminine and passive; it has no power. It is not His Compassion, it is His weakness. He needs us badly.” That is what the physical mind says. Then the tricky vital will say, “Oh no, no, no. There is some motive behind it. I am beautiful, or I have a lot of money, or I am a great artist, so He wants me for something.” This is what the tricky vital will say. And the impure heart will say, “He will take away all my good qualities and give them to undeserving people.” Only the pure heart, which has the capacity to identify itself with the Vast, will say, “No, He has given me the opportunity, the golden opportunity, to fulfil myself and to fulfil Him.” That is what the pure heart says, but how many people have that kind of pure heart? Very few people have that kind of pure heart.</p>  </div>
