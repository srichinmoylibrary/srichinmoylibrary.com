<p>So you are carrying us into the lore of the Katha Upanishad! Wonderful. That was not the fault of the King of Death. If I come to your house without making a previous appointment or without your knowledge and do not find you at home, I can’t blame you, can I?</p>
<p>Nachiketa’s father, Vajasravasa, said, “Thee I give to Death.” But the King of Death did not say, “O Nachiketa, I am waiting for thee, for thee alone.” Yama was busy at that time with someone else.</p>  </div>
