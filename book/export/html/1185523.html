<p>A real miser saw a sign on the door of a restaurant:</p>
<p>“No tips here. Tips are forbidden here.”</p>
<p>He was very happy to read it. He came into the restaurant and had a wonderful, delicious meal. Then he said to the waitress: “I am so glad that you have mentioned at the door that tips are forbidden here. This is the first time I have seen a restaurant that has that kind of sincere and bold policy.”</p>
<p>The waitress said: “Yes, tips are forbidden. No tips here. True! But where is here? You read the sign at the door, at the entrance, but here on your table you don’t see that kind of notice. So you may revise your opinion. Tips are not required at the entrance, but since America is the land of freedom, you may exercise your freedom wherever you can.”</p>  </div>
