<p>In the human world there are three things that last forever. At least, so do I think. These are: fear, one's sense of unworthiness and a doubting and suspicious mind.</p>
<p>In the divine world there are three things that will undoubtedly forever last. These are: faith, courage and love. If a disciple has these three things, then he does not need anything else.</p>
<p>Fear, anxiety and doubt: these are immortal, but in a negative, destructive way, whereas faith, courage and love represent or embody Immortality in a positive way. The human in us will one day transcend itself and accept the divine in us with all its faith, courage and love.</p>
