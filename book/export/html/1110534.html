<p>Sahana Devi<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was a singer of the supreme heights. She had a most glorious singing voice. She was extremely fortunate because she was so closely connected with Tagore. She was a student at Tagore’s Santiniketan, and she sang for him many, many times. Tagore was deeply enamoured of her soul-stirring voice. She also composed many songs.</p>
<p>Dilip Kumar Roy was responsible for bringing Sahana Devi to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. When Dilip-da joined the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1928, he inspired Sahana-di to do the same. Tagore was very upset when Sahana-di left Santiniketan. When she went to the Ashram, he sent an unforgettable message: “Had I been an Emperor, like the Moghul Emperors, I would have sent my army to bring you back from the Ashram.”</p>
<p>During my Ashram days, I basked in the sunshine of Sahana-di’s affection.</p>
