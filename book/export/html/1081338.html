<p>One day Sri Ramakrishna went to Girish's Star Theatre to see "The Life of Sri Chaitanya," a play which Girish wrote and directed. Sri Ramakrishna was accompanied by two or three of his attendants, including M. (Mahendranath Gupta), who was his biographer. Since Girish was the director of the theatre, M. went to him and said, "Sri Ramakrishna has come. Do you think you can give him a free ticket? Otherwise, we shall pay."</p>
<p>Girish said to M., "I can give him a free ticket, but not those who are accompanying him. The others will have to pay." M. gave the news to Sri Ramakrishna and Sri Ramakrishna alighted from the carriage. As soon as he saw Girish, Sri Ramakrishna bowed to him. Then Girish Ghosh bowed to Sri Ramakrishna. Once more Sri Ramakrishna bowed to Girish.</p>
<p>Girish said to himself, "This will never end!" and so he took Sri Ramakrishna to a nice place in the theatre hall which was reserved for expensive tickets. After making sure that Sri Ramakrishna was comfortable, Girish went home because he was not feeling well.</p>
<p>That was his third meeting with Sri Ramakrishna.</p>  </div>
