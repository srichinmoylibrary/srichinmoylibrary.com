<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The thing is, we have not to feel that God is there in Heaven and we are here in hell. God is all-pervading, so I have not to leave the earth to go to Him.</p>
<p>At the end of this lifetime, when I pass through the tunnel of death, I will shed the five sthulas or sheaths and pass through the physical world, the vital world, mental world, and psychic world and then to the region of the soul's consciousness, where I will take rest in my own highest consciousness for as long as the Supreme needs. Then, when the Supreme wants, I will again enter into the manifestation to serve Him.</p>
<p>For all of us, this is not our first incarnation, nor can it be our last.</p>  </div>
