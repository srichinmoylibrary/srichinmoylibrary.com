<p>When I see my disciples running now, many times they are 600 metres or one mile ahead of me. But I used to be right behind them or even ahead of them.</p>
<p>They have to admire how much patience I have. When you lose capacity, you have to give credit to your patience.</p>
<p>â€” 28 April 1985</p>  </div>
