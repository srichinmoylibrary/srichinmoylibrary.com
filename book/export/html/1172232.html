<p>"My Lord, how is it that You have made me perfect and nobody else? When are You going to make others perfect like me?"</p>
<p>"It is such a time-consuming job, but I will eventually do it. Meanwhile, since I have spent so much time making you perfect, do you not think I deserve a little bit of rest?"</p>  </div>
