  <h1 class="book-heading">Courage</h1>
  
 
<p>In one of the Upanishads, it says that the soul is not to be won by the weakling. Courage is absolutely necessary in the spiritual life. The very acceptance of the spiritual life demands enormous courage. It is only a divinely courageous soul, only a divinely inspired soul, that can swiftly reach the highest Goal.</p>
<p>This courage is not the courage of a haughty, rough person who will strike others to assert his superiority; it is totally different. This courage is our constant awareness of what we are entering into, of what we are going to become, of what we are going to reveal. We have to jump courageously into the ocean of spirituality, but we have to know that we are not jumping into the sea of uncertainty. Uncertainty and spirituality never go together. When we speak of courage, we have to know that courage means certainty.</p>
<p>It is not by hook or by crook that we are going to have God-realisation; it is through constant self-offering. Self-offering is the most powerful weapon, for it is in self-offering that true courage lies. When we know, feel and realise that God is ours and we are God's, we get spontaneous courage streaming forth.</p>
<p>God and you are eternally one, each fulfilling the other. If you have indomitable courage or the soul's Willpower, you can fulfil the Supreme and the Supreme can fulfil you. This you feel on the strength of your all-giving, all-sacrificing inner courage.</p>  </div>
