<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul is actually a vehicle which carries us into different worlds. There are seven higher worlds and seven lower worlds. When we live in the consciousness of the soul, we go to the highest world. But, unfortunately, most of us donâ€™t live in the soul; we live in the vital or in the gross physical. That is why we are suffering. If we can remain in the soul daily for just two hours, then we will see that we are a totally different person.</p>  </div>
