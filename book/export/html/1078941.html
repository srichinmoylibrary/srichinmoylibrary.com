<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know what kind of thoughts you are talking about. You cannot confuse divine thoughts and progressive thoughts with destructive thoughts. If you have some divine thoughts, then you can build your spiritual palace on these thoughts. Again, thought can only take you so far. But when it is will-power, you have to know that this will-power has tremendous strength. Will-power comes directly from the soul; it is the soulâ€™s light.</p>  </div>
