<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The thing that holds you back is fear, which has no meaning at all. If you want the wealth which the ocean holds deep inside itself, you have to dive within. Fear and wealth don't go together. Only if you have inner courage can you receive the inner wealth. It is fear of the unknown and unknowable that prevents you from diving deep within. But what is unknowable today becomes merely unknown tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow it becomes known. The vastness of Truth can never destroy you. It can only embrace and fulfil you.</p>  </div>
