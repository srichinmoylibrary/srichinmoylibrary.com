<p>Today I saw one of my disciples running, about 200 metres ahead of me. Then my ego came forward and I said, "Just because her husband defeats me, that doesn't mean that she will defeat me."</p>
<p>So I ran past her, and then I ran practically 200 metres more.</p>
<p>Afterwards, a policeman smiled at me and spoke to me in Spanish.</p>
