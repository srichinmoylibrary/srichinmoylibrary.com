<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God gets the most joy when a seeker claims Him as his very own on the strength of his full awareness of what God is to him. When a seeker feels that God is his most illumined and perfect part and that he is part and parcel of God, then God gets most joy. When he feels that his undivine or unlit part will be transformed totally and that it is only a matter of time before he himself will grow into his highest, most illumined part, which is God, at that time God gets the most joy. Even a seeker's undivine part is God, for God is everything. But a seeker wants to grow into his divine part in order to become God.</p>
<p>Let us take his head as the absolute perfect God and his feet as the imperfect God. So he wants to transform his ignorance-feet into the wisdom-light that is his head. He does not want to remain at the foot of the perfection-tree; he wants to climb up to the very top. If one takes God as his own highest and most illumined part, if one feels that right now he is part and parcel of the highest Reality but that he has still to become conscious of it, grow into it and then manifest his ultimate Height — if one feels this — then God gets the most joy.</p>  </div>
