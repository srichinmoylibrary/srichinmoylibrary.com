<p>Robibala's wedding. Robibala and her bridegroom came to pay their respects to Nolini-da. Nolini-da said: "I wish you all the good things of the world. Both of you are the Mother's children. Be happy, be dynamic and be true to Her."</p>
<p>Then they came to Amrita-da. Amrita-da said to them: "Ah, you are happy, I am happy, everybody is happy. Do you know why? In case you do not know, I shall tell you: two have become one, which is very unusual."</p>  </div>
