<p>Once there was a king who asked his minister to bring to the court as many people as possible who could tell him fascinating dreams. He wanted to get joy from hearing their dreams. He said, "There are so many people who have had inspiring and challenging dreams. I will reward them if they tell me their wonderful dreams. Bring hundreds of dreamers to the palace!"</p>
<p>The minister said, "But your Highness, it will take days to hear all of their dreams."</p>
<p>The king said, "No harm. From now on I will spend every minute listening to people's dreams."</p>
<p>The following morning the minister brought in front of the palace seven hundred donkeys. He said to the king, "O King, I went to these donkeys and asked them what their special talents were. All these donkeys told me that they can sing and play music well. Now I am very curious to hear them, and you also must be very curious to hear them."</p>
<p>"You won't like the music or get joy from it," said the king.</p>
<p>"Why not?" asked the minister. "The hundreds of idle dreamers you have asked for are in no way better than these donkeys. These donkeys at least are useful to others since they carry all kinds of loads. But these idiots I am going to bring tonight are absolutely useless people. Their dreams have nothing to do with reality. It is all fabrication. Do you not think that those dreamers are worse than these donkeys? Why do you want to bring useless people to your court? Only if you bring useful people will your subjects be proud of you. Otherwise, what will people think of you?"</p>
<p>The king said, "You are wise. Let us not invite those dreamers to the palace. Now take away your donkeys."</p>  </div>
