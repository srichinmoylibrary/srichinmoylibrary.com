<p>The other day in Hawaii, we were eating at the Pancake House. A man and his wife were sitting in the next booth. The man was talking about the Sri Chinmoy Marathon.</p>
<p>I looked at Ranjana to say that I was facing him, but he didn't know it was me. Ranjana was whispering to Lavanya about it, but the man still didn't recognise me. He must have been reading someone's T-shirt.</p>
