<p>Nolini-da entered Amrita-da's room and said: 'We must not believe anything X says. He has created such problems for the Mother."</p>
<p>Amrita-da said: "Unfortunately you and I — especially I — have been taking that oath for a long time. Every day I promise myself that I will not believe him and every day I fail to keep my promise."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "I am sure one day you and I will succeed. For who wants to suffer unreservedly and undeservedly?"</p>
<p>Amrita-da said: "In your case, undeservedly is the right word; in my case, unreservedly is the right word. Let us really try not to believe anything that he says or does. He is such a disgrace to our Ashram!"</p>  </div>
