<p>When I was waiting to pay in one store, I saw a shopping bag with "India Day" written on it. It also had a picture of India's Taj Mahal.</p>
<p>The saleslady said to me, "Do you come from India?"</p>
<p>I answered, "Yes."</p>
<p>Then she said, "Oh, here is your Taj Mahal," and gave me the bag.</p>
