<p>OUT OF PITY AND OUT OF COMPASSION</p>
<p>When<br /> Persistence deserted him,<br /> Defeat-King came to him<br /> Out of pity<br /> And embraced him.<br /> Otherwise, Defeat-King would have remained<br /> Quiet, absolutely quiet.<br /> Therefore it is not proper<br /> To curse the poor well-intentioned<br /> Defeat-King.</p>
<p>When<br /> Devotion deserted him,<br /> Ignorance-Queen came to him<br /> Out of compassion<br /> And garlanded him.<br /> Otherwise, Ignorance-Queen would have remained<br /> Silent, absolutely silent.<br /> Therefore it is undivine<br /> To accuse the poor well-intentioned<br /> Ignorance-Queen.</p>
