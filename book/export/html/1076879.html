<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To some extent, it is difficult for the western mind to approach, or should I say, appreciate Eastern philosophy. But when the question if inner illumination and self-realisation come in, then I find that Westerners have no difficulty in approaching the inner life, that is to say, their self-discovery.</p>  </div>
