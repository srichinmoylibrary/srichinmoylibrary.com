<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to grab the mind and offer it to the heart. Then the mind will be illumined; it will be obedient. Now the mind is ruling you, but when the mind has been brought under control and offered to the heart, you will rule the mind. When the mind is illumined, it will be able to work most powerfully, in a most fulfilling manner. You are not discarding the mind; you are only trying to take the mind to a proper place, and that is the heart, the heart’s illumination. When the illumination of the heart enters into the mind, the mind becomes a most powerful instrument. The vital also can be used most dynamically when illumined by the light from the heart.</p>
<p>God is constantly transcending, going beyond Himself. He is the Consciousness of the infinite Beyond, which is all the time transcending its own Infinity. With our mind we can never understand this. That is why we do not use the mind to enter into the deepest level of Consciousness. We try with our intuition-light, our intuitive light, or with our aspiration’s light to realise the Highest.</p>  </div>
