<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The philosophy for the New Millennium will be: do not see faults in anybodyâ€™s life; do not see the faults in your own life. Only force yourself to see all the good things you have done, all the good things you are planning to do and all the good things that others have done. In the next millennium, the goal of philosophy will be only to see the light in oneself and the light in others. Then only will you be able to expedite the arrival of world-peace and world-oneness.</p>  </div>
