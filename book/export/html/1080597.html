<h2>Biographical note</h2>

<p><em>Leonard Bernstein (1918-1990) was a musical phenomenon-a composer, conductor, pianist, teacher and mentor to countless musicians around the world. As a composer, he wrote works in widely different styles, juxtaposing a romantic intensity with jazz and Latin American elements. His best known works include symphonies, such as "Jeremiah" (1944) and "The Age of Anxiety" (1949), ballets, such as "Fancy Free" (1944), and scores for musicals, among which are "On The Town" (1944), "West Side Story" (1957) and "Mass" (1971), in memory of his friend, President J. F. Kennedy.</em></p>
<p><em>In 1943, when Bruno Walter, guest conductor of the New York Philharmonic, fell ill, the 25-year-old Bernstein stepped in and became an overnight success. In 1955, he became the first American-born conductor of La Scala Opera in Milan. In 1958, at the age of 40, Bernstein was appointed the youngest-ever Musical Director of the New York Philharmonic. He held this post until 1970, conducting over 1,000 performances.</em></p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein conducted orchestras the world over and had especially long and fruitful relationships with the Israel Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic.</em></p>
<p><em>He was an innovator whose boundless energy, staggering versatility and rare musical genius went forth in many directions. Through his music, Leonard Bernstein also became an eloquent spokesman for world peace. On 25 December 1989-just after the collapse of the Berlin Wall-he conducted Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in East Berlin and West Berlin.</em></p>  </div>
