<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He has to give up drugs, he has to give up smoking and he has to give up drinking. There are quite a few other things that are spiritually unhealthy as well, but these are the most damaging.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> When one does this then one becomes better at meditation, is that right?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One becomes a much more receptive vehicle of light.</p>  </div>
