  <h1 class="book-heading">Prayer and meditation</h1>
  
 
<p>Prayer is man's soulful cry for God. Meditation is man's fruitful smile in God.</p>
<p>Prayer is personal, also universal. Meditation is impersonal, also transcendental.</p>
<p>Prayer is petition, also adoration. Meditation is absorption, also perfection.</p>
<p>Prayer needs God's Compassion-Shower. Meditation needs God's Illumination-Tower.</p>
<p>I pray for Immortality in mortality. I meditate on Infinity in Eternity.</p>
<p>Prayer is night crying for light. Meditation is light searching for delight.Prayer reminds us of our hidden sins. Meditation reminds us of our forgotten sun.</p>
<p>Through prayer God says, "My child, I am waiting for you. Come and see Me."</p>
<p>Through meditation God says, "My child, wait for Me. I am coming to see you."</p>
<p>Prayer is the purity that counts. Meditation is the luminosity that mounts.</p>
<p>My prayer-teacher shows me the beauty of soulfulness. My meditation-teacher blesses me with the duty of oneness.</p>
<p>Prayer soulfully reveals man's faith in God. Meditation smilingly reveals God's faith in man.</p>
<p>My God is mad because nowadays I do not pray either in the morning or in the evening. My God is sad because nowadays I do not meditate sleeplessly and unconditionally.</p>

<p>God? Who, you?<br /> God? Who, he? No!<br /> God? Who, I? No!<br /> Who, then, is God? God is my prayer-purity's quest.<br /> Who, then, is God? God is my meditation divinity's nest.</p>
