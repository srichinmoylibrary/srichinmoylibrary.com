<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends. Suppose you feel that It Is a very Important matter and that the person is talking in a rude, undivine manner. At that time say to the person, "Please be calm and quiet and talk politely. I am ready to hear you." But if the person is only coming to harass and bother you, at that time you have every right to tell him to leave. If it is only casual talk and the person becomes unnecessarily rude and unkind, at that time tell him to leave you.</p>  </div>
