<p>Now comes the story of my eternal friendship with the rickshaw world. My brother said, "You have so much money. For God's sake, do not argue with the poor rickshaw-wallahs."</p>
<p>I said, "I promise I will not argue with them. I will tell them, 'Whatever you say'."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I would say to the rickshaw-wallahs, "Whatever you say, I will give," they would say, "No, you have to tell."</p>
<p>What could I do? I said, "Last time I gave you ten rupees per hour. This time I am ready to give you fifteen rupees per hour, and each time I hire you, it will be for two hours. So I will give you thirty rupees."</p>
<p>The rickshaw-wallahs were overjoyed: thirty rupees they would get. I told them, "Now, only do me a favour and do the right thing."</p>
<p>Usually four or five rickshaws would be right in front of my house. I would say, "I need only one," but each day at least four would be waiting. Then I had to choose among them. When I chose one, I got the 'blessings' from the others. They would say nasty things to me, and they were ready to beat up the one that I chose. But how could I take four rickshaws?</p>  </div>
