<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First let us see if those great souls choose to take incarnation on Indian soil. And if they do, it is not a matter of prestige to be able to offer these souls to the world. It is a matter of joy, a matter of happiness and a matter of inner accomplishment when one country can offer something good to the world.</p>  </div>
