<p>I met God in the morning.<br /> I asked Him if He would take away<br /> All insecurity from my heart.<br /> He smiled.</p>
<p>I met God at noon.<br /> I asked Him if He would take away<br /> All doubt from my mind.<br /> He smiled.</p>
<p>I met God in the evening.<br /> I asked Him if he would take away<br /> All depression from my vital.<br /> He smiled.</p>
<p>I met God at night.<br /> I asked Him if He would take away<br /> All suffering from my body.<br /> He immediately embraced my body.</p>
