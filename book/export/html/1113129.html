<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that time I see God and I communicate with God. The sense of separativity goes away and the lover and the Beloved become totally one. I enjoy infinite Peace, Light and Bliss. In samadhi, we do not see God as something to be achieved or something foreign to us. His whole Consciousness inundates us to such an extent that we don't feel that God is somebody other than ourselves. At that time, we feel that we have become totally one with God and that He and we are absolutely one. So, when I go into samadhi, I enjoy infinite Peace and Joy and Love in the inner world.</p>  </div>
