<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not receive it; the Supreme receives everything. When you inwardly offer your good feelings or your bad feelings, they go to Him. Whenever any disciple does anything good or bad, it goes to the Supreme in me. If it is something really important, my inner beings will definitely tell me. Otherwise, the Supreme Himself will tell me. Anything that is of real inner value, spiritual value, will never be kept hidden from me. But sometimes what our mind thinks is something very significant, most important, the Supreme does not take as significant at all. These things I do not have to know. But anything that is significant in the Eye of the Supreme will always be known by me or by my inner beings.</p>  </div>
