<p>In the race, a 16-year-old boy named Stanley could easily have gone ahead of me. But when I started walking, he also started walking. Then he started appreciating our races like anything. He said our races were much better. He said, "Here there are no split times, no mile markers. There is absolutely nothing!" He also said he liked our T-shirts, especially our half-marathon T-shirt.</p>
