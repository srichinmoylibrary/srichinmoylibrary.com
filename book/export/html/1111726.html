<p>This morning around six-thirty I was doing interval work. At one point I had stopped running at the end of my block and I was walking. The German lady who lives nearby came up to me, grabbed my shoulder with her left hand and massaged my arm down to my elbow. Then she shook hands with me — her left hand and my left hand. She said, "Too cold, too cold!"</p>
<p>Then she said, "You have two dogs."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>She said, "Good, very good."</p>
<p>I asked her, "What is your dog's name?"</p>
<p>She said, "Vila."</p>
<p>This lady is always walking her dog. So its name is Vila, like the tennis champion Vilas.</p>
