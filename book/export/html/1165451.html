<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As soon as I reach my goal, I get a sense of satisfaction. I feel that this sense of satisfaction has come directly from my Inner Pilot, for I know it is not my capacity that is responsible for my success. It is His Grace that unconditionally acts in and through me. Therefore, right after the achievement, I offer gratitude soulfully and unconditionally to my Inner Pilot. My happiness I express through my most soulful gratitude.</p>  </div>
