<p>Today I was bargaining in one store in Bukittinggi. The saleslady held up her hand twice, and I thought she wanted two times 500 or 1,000 rupiah. I said, "No, 200."</p>
<p>I said to myself, "I will fight!"</p>
<p>Finally I said, "I will pay 500 rupiah," and I gave the lady 500. Then she returned 200 to me.</p>
<p>At first I thought I may have given her 5,000 rupiah by mistake, but it was 500. So I was fighting for more than she was asking for!</p>
