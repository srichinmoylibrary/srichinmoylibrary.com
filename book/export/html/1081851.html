<p>My vital life<br /> Has failed God;<br /> Therefore my God<br /> Has disappeared.<br /> Lord, I do not blame You.<br /> In Your case,<br /> I would have done the same.</p>
<p>My soul-life has<br /> Pleased God;<br /> Therefore my God<br /> Is here.<br /> Lord, I need not praise You.<br /> In Your case,<br /> I, too, would have done the same.</p>
