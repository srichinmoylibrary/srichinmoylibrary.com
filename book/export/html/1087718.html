<p>Late one night, the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb asked one of his personal attendants to bring him a glass of water. He wanted to have something to drink and also he wanted to wash his face, ears and nose before beginning a special midnight worship. The attendant was half asleep and went out of the room in a terrible hurry to fetch the water. While returning with the water, by accident he fell on the Emperor and almost kicked him. When he realised what he had done, the attendant immediately knelt down in front of Aurangzeb and begged for forgiveness.</p>
<p>The Emperor said, "Forgive you? Why do I need to forgive you? This is only a silly accident. I am planning to ask Allah to give me more inner wealth, so in which way are you inferior to me? In which way are we different? We are both beggars."</p>  </div>
