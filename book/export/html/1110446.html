<blockquote>
<p>A life of nothing’s nothing worth, From that first nothing ere his birth, To that last nothing under earth.</p>
<p>Tennyson <em>Two Voices</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But let us sing just the opposite with regard to the life of Tagore:</p>

<p>A life of fulness’ fulness worth,<br /> From that first fulness ere his birth,<br /> To that last fulness beyond earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Our lives,” Tagore says, “are famished for want of neglected joys within our reach, while we are pursuing chimerical impossibilities.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He writes elsewhere something about life which is very significant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In our life we have one side which is finite, where we exhaust ourselves at every step, and have another side, where our aspiration, enjoyment and sacrifice are infinite.”</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
