<p>Einstein the professor at times wanted to enjoy his role as a musician more than his role as a lecturer. What he had within he wanted to mete out. What he had within was joy and what he wanted to give out was also joy. At times, the musician in him was inundated with divinely illumining ecstasy. Therefore, he felt that music would be the right thing to offer to his students, who badly needed joy. Once, instead of delivering his scheduled lecture at Geneva University, he surprised and delighted his audience by giving a violin concert instead. Explained Einstein, <em>“It will perhaps be pleasanter and more understandable if instead of making a speech I play the violin.”</em></p>  </div>
