<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When people think of the Christ Consciousness, I do not know which consciousness they are thinking of. But they are not reaching or realising the Christ Consciousness; they are realising the Son consciousness. The Son consciousness means infinite joy, infinite love, infinite compassion and infinite oneness.</p>  </div>
