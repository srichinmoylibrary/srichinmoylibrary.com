<p><em>[Matsyendranath's ashram, two and a half years later. The Scene is the same as before, but everything is dry and parched. Gorakshanath is sitting in meditation. Enter two starved-looking peasants.]</em></p>
<p>1ST PEASANT: O great Yogi, will you not lift this curse from our countryside? We are starving; our children are starving; all around us everything has become a barren desert where once before there was beauty and plenty.</p>
<p>2ND PEASANT: Why do you punish an entire country for the fault of your Guru or of his disciples? Is it fair? Is it right? Do lift your curse, O great Yogi, and free us from this terrible scourge.</p>
<p><em>[No response from Gorakshanath. Exit peasants, dejected. Sound of trumpets and noise approaching. Enter attendants, followed by King. ]</em></p>
<p>KING: <em>[taking the dust of Gorakshanath's feet]</em> Gorakshanath, do lift this curse from our unfortunate country. What have we done to deserve such a fate? You are ruining us, destroying us, and because of your great occult powers we cannot prevent you. Gorakshanath, have pity. All my subjects are either dying or leaving the country, and my treasures are being exhausted only to buy food and water.</p>
<p><em>[The King pauses. No response from Gorakshanath.]</em></p>
<p>Gorakshanath! <em>[pause]</em> Gorakshanath, you rogue, you are destroying my kingdom! How I wish I could destroy you in return!</p>
<p><em>[Exit King, followed by his attendants. Gorakshanath continues meditating. Enter Matsyendranath.]</em></p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: My son, I am so happy to see you again.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: <em>[prostrating at Matsyendranath's feet]</em> Forgive me, Master. I am ashamed of what I have done to these people, to this entire country.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: You have not done anything wrong. These people were all corrupt. They deserved this kind of punishment. It will help them to lead a better life.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: But I did not know that. I did not do it to help them. I was angry, and I merely wanted to punish them. My action was bad because my motive was bad.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: My son, you are wrong. Your soul knew that they deserved punishment, otherwise it would not have allowed you to become unreasonably angry. What you have done is right.</p>  </div>
