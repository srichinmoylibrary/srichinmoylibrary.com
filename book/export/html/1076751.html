<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is very kind of you. My name is Chinmoy Kumar Ghose. I was born in Bengal and I was brought up in South India. So this is my name, my Bengali name.</p>
<p>Today we are discussing religion. Until we know what religion is, we will not understand spirituality. And until we understand spirituality, we cannot understand yoga. Until we have understood yoga, we cannot think of God. Tomorrow I shall be speaking on spirituality and then I shall give a few more talks on “The Aim of Life” and “What is God’s Plan? ” and the principal Yogas: Karma Yoga, the path of Action, Bhakti Yoga, the path of Love and Devotion, and Jnana Yoga, the path of Knowledge and Wisdom. These are the things I would like to deal with during my stay in Puerto Rico.</p>  </div>
