<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Around ten o'clock in the morning an old man was walking along the street with an umbrella. The umbrella was not open; he was just carrying it like a cane. A young man saw him and said, “You are an old man. Now have you become blind too?”</p>
<p>The old man got mad at him and said, “Why do you ask if I am blind?”</p>
<p>The young man said, “Why do you have to carry an umbrella? It is not cloudy; it is not going to rain. And the sun is not too bright, either. So why do you have to carry an umbrella?”</p>
<p>The old man said, “You fool! I am killing three birds with one stone.” Now, one by one you have to tell me how he was killing three birds with one stone.</p>
<p><em>J.:</em> The old man could have used the umbrella for a cane. And in case it started raining all of a sudden, or if the sun came out really bright, he could use it to cover himself.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Marvellous, marvellous! This answer is perfect. The old man was killing three birds with one stone. He was using the umbrella as a cane because he was an old man and his legs were weak. And if the sun got too bright or if it rained all of a sudden, then he would have protection. Good! You are all intelligent people.</p>  </div>
