<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One gives his time to God because he sees that, unlike him and unlike others, God is the Alpha and the Omega. He is the beginning; He is the end. He is this; He is that. And, at the same time, He transcends what He eternally is.</p>
<p>God is all-pervading; He is everywhere. Whatever we do, whatever we say, whatever we grow into is nothing short of an expansion of His own Reality-Existence. Right at the outset we have to know that He alone exists. Just because He alone exists, no matter what we do, we know that our action is motivated by Him and also finds its result in Him. Not only that, but He is the One acting in and through us. Our action fulfils itself, our capacity is increased and our realisation is strengthened only because He exists and He is. Therefore, either consciously or unconsciously, either cheerfully or dolefully, God has to come into the picture.</p>
