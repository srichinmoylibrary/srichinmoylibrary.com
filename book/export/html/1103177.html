<p>My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme,<br /> My mind did not help me at all<br /> To realise You.<br /> My heart helped me in every way<br /> To realise You.<br /> And now my heart is the only one<br /> That is helping me<br /> And will forever help me<br /> To manifest You completely<br /> Here on earth.<br /> Therefore, I have found my true friend<br /> In my heart,<br /> And my heart has found a true friend<br /> In my life.<br /> And my heart, my life and I<br /> Know that there is only one Friend<br /> To please,<br /> And that Friend is You, my Lord â€”<br /> You, with Your Compassion-Eye,<br /> You, with Your Forgiveness-Heart.<br /> My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme!</p>
