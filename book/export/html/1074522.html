<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, it would be wise on your part to know what divine power is. If you think the divine power is something used by God at His sweet Will to punish and to destroy and to keep everyone under His control, then you are badly mistaken. Divine power is the power of light, the feeling of oneness, inseparable oneness, with Godâ€™s universe and with God. This is real divine power. And this divine power you can acquire only through constant and conscious self-offering. If you offer yourself consciously and constantly to the Inner Pilot within you, then immediately you will get divine power.</p>  </div>
