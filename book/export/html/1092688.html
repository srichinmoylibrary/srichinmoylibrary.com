<p>A soldier who was present on the unforgettable occasion when Netaji swore this oath carries us into the emotion-flooded atmosphere of the moment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the time came for Netaji to take his oath, a great hush descended upon the hall. It was a solemn moment. Netaji started with a firm voice. Then it began to quiver with emotion.... Suddenly he was sobbing; tears rolled down his cheeks. There was dead silence. No one could help him. All were helpless.</p>
<p>"The tension was terrific. Someone cried out, <em>'Netaji ki jai'</em> -'Victory to Netaji!' The cry was taken up, to echo and re-echo in the lofty hall."</p>
