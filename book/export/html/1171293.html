  <h1 class="book-heading">Interviewer: I understand that you are a champion weightlifter.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have lifted a lot. About two months ago I lifted 200 pounds with each arm simultaneously and it was shown on about seventy television stations.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Where do you get all your strength?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My strength is all from God's Grace and God's Compassion.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Because of your meditation?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because I pray and meditate. But when I pray and meditate, I do not ask God to give me the strength to lift.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Do you think it is God's Gift?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely. If it were not God's Gift, how could I do so many things?</p>  </div>
