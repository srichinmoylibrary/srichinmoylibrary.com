  <h1 class="book-heading">Transcending insecurity</h1>
  
 
<p>In the spiritual life, if one can maintain oneâ€™s height permanently there is no insecurity. Today an individual may do the best meditation and his spiritual Master may be partial to him; but tomorrow if that person does not maintain his standard the Master will have no hesitation in saying that his meditation was the worst of the worst. Again, if the seeker achieves a permanent standard of excellence and does good meditation all the time, he can never be insecure, because he will know that he is an expert in that field. But until one becomes the best, one is insecure.</p>  </div>
