<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you become one with God's Will, at that time the name of God's song will be your own name. When I become one with God's Will, the name of God's song will be my name.</p>
<p>When you become one with God's Will, the song that God sings is your universal Self. Any song that God sings in you and through you is your universal Self. God's universal Self and your universal Self are the same. If you can identify yourself with God totally and inseparably then you, not as an individual but as the universal Self, will become God's song. At that time, you, the universal Self, will be the name of God's song.</p>  </div>
