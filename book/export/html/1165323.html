<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this world everybody has a profession or vocation of his own. But an anthropologist also has to become a seeker if he wants to know anything about the soul. When he seeks light, truth and bliss, naturally he is bound to get them. No matter which profession he follows, when he becomes a seeker, he will be able to feel the presence of the soul and see the soul. Then he will be able to execute the will of the soul, even in his profession.</p>
<p>He has become an anthropologist because he studied that subject. Similarly, if he prays and meditates, he will also get the result of his inner study. An anthropologist he has become by studying something in the outer life. A seeker he will become if he practices something in the inner life. When he gets peace, light and bliss in abundant measure, he will easily be able to come into contact with the soul. Then he can do anything. With the light of the soul he can fulfil all his dreams in the field of anthropology.</p>  </div>
