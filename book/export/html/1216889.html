<p>I wanted to telephone New York from my hotel room in Morocco. The telephone operator said to me, "What is your name?"</p>
<p>I said, "Ghose."</p>
<p>Then she asked, "What is your room number?"</p>
<p>I told her. Then the lady said, "The person in that room is not Ghose. It is Chinmoy."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, that is my first name."</p>
<p>She said, "Are you the Guru of the group?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, I am the Guru of the group."</p>
<p>Then she was satisfied and she placed the call for me.</p>
