<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It does not work in that way. I paint only when I am inspired. Recently I have not painted at all; I am paying attention to music. Otherwise, sometimes I have done a few thousand paintings in a day. On one particular day last year, I did over 16,000 in 24 hours.</p>  </div>
