<p>I was at my 1400-metre mark. Dipali’s soul came to me. Her soul was telling me, warning me, that she has to reduce her mileage and also be more careful with regard to her running — careful is the right word.</p>
<p>I said, “All right, I shall tell her.” My eyes were half-closed. Then, three or four seconds later, I saw one girl with folded hands. I was on the pavement walking and she was in the street. I said, “Who is this?” I opened my eyes wide and I saw Dipali. First I saw Dipali and then I saw Snigdha. Snigdha and I greeted each other.</p>
<p>Every day I take an oath that I will not look at anybody; I will only remain in my highest meditation. Then, as soon as I go out, I see someone this side and someone else that side. They are expecting my greetings.</p>
