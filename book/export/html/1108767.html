<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My students will run, and I will be running inside their devoted hearts. I have run marathons quite a few times, but now my knees are injured and I find I can run only on soft surfaces like a cinder track or grass. But I shall run in and through my students. They are my inspiration, my joy and my pride. I am their spiritual father. When the father grows old and can no longer run, he still inspires his children to run because he knows that running is good.</p>
<p>Here we are running for world peace. I started this movement about ten years ago and I am behind it. God, our Inner Pilot, gave us the inspiration to serve Him in this way. There are so many ways to serve God and love God, but He wanted us to serve Him by bringing peace to the fore. This world of ours has everything save and except peace. Politicians try to bring about world peace. Peace-dreamers and peace-lovers try to bring about world peace. Each one has a different way. You have one way, he has another way, I may have still another way. But we are all aiming towards the same goal.</p>
<p>We are seekers. As seekers, we will always try to do the right thing for humanity because we feel that all human beings are our brothers and sisters. So as a seeker, I will try to be of service to you by bringing peace into your entire being, and definitely you will also do the same for me.</p>  </div>
