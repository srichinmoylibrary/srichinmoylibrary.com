<p><em>OB 1</em>: Sri Chinmoy composed and dictated this poem to a disciple, N, on 24 May 1998. Later he remarked the poem represents his life. He expressed the wish for all his students to learn it by heart.</p>
<p>The poem was read out at a function and disciples were invited to enter a contest to illustrate the poem. That contest was held at P.S. 86 in Queens, New York the following week-end.</p>
<p><em>OB 1,4</em>: The Bengali words <em>Ananda fuara</em> could be translated as “fountain of delight”.</p>
<p><em>OB 1,8</em>: Madal went to Pondicherry in 1944, to become a permanent resident of Sri Aurobindo’s Ashram.</p>
<p><em>OB 2</em>: On 20 June 1998 — the day before Father’s Day — after a recording of the author reciting the poem was played, Sri Chinmoy offered this commentary at P.S. 117 in Queens, New York. The commentary (albeit abridged and revised by the editors) was also published posthumously in the book "Live in the eternal Now", with the title "To have a sweet family" (LEN 10).</p>  </div>
