<p>Once I went to Long Island and saw a dumbbell that weighed only 110 pounds. They said, “We will give this to you free if you can lift it.” I could easily have lifted it off the ground, but I didn’t do it. I just bought a chair that folds on both sides and the pulley that I use.</p>
<p>That weight was only 110 pounds. But in Hawaii, the previous day, somebody came and took away 500 pounds, and now they had 600 pounds out. You go to the weightlifting stores and have such fun!</p>
