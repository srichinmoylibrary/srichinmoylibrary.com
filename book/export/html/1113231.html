<p>"Chinmoy, have you read Subhash Bose's autobiography?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I have read it."</p>
<p>"Then tell me, which year did he strike this Professor Oaten?"</p>
<p>"I am sorry, but I don't remember the year. But I can easily find out for you. Let me go to the library."</p>
<p>I was about to leave for the library when he said: "Where are you going? It is raining too heavily!"</p>
<p>But my zealous vital did not listen to him. I went to the library and found that the year was 1916. I gave him the information and he noted it down with joy. He wanted to insert it in his book of reminiscences.</p>  </div>
