<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I think I was five or six years old. I was very upset also because when I went there to get ready for the play, they put a garment on me that looked like a sari. In the Mahabharata days, the warriors used to wear garments like that. Anyway, I protested vehemently! I said, "No, I am not a girl, I am not a girl!" Then I began to cry. All the other actors were wearing loose dhotis, but mine looked like a sari. I said that I wanted to wear whatever the other actors were wearing. But they did not listen at all. So I was crying and crying. Then, when I went on stage to perform, I got so frightened that I started crying again. I gave so many people such joy because the prompter was saying the line, Arjuna was whispering to me what to say and still I did not say the line. I gave joy to everyone!</p>  </div>
