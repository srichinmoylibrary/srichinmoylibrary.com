<p>Many times it happened that Mahavira was persecuted by inconscient people. Sometimes they would cover him with dirt while he was in deep meditation, or they would pick him up and drop him to try to disturb his trance. But Mahavira never retaliated. For him, <em>ahimsa</em> or non-violence was the highest religion. He used to preach,</p>
<p>"Towards your fellow creatures be not hostile; that is the Law of Him who is rich in control."</p>  </div>
