<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to feel that you are not the body, you are not the vital, you are not the mind, you are not the heart, but you are the soul itself. In order to have this experience you have to feel that you need God and God needs you. You need God to raise your consciousness as high as possible â€” high, higher, highest. God needs you to manifest Himself in and through you here on earth.</p>  </div>
