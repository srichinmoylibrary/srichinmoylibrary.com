<p>An astrologer predicted that his mother would die in a few months’ time. The Master laughed and said no.</p>
<p>“How do you know, Master? My mother lives in Philadelphia. How do you know?”“I know.”</p>
<p>Finally the astrologer gave him the date. In a week’s time she would die. The Master told him, “Let us see whether she dies in a week or not.”</p>
<p>While the mother was walking in the kitchen, she fell down. The big toe on her left foot was hurt, but not severely. However, the old lady made a scene. She cursed the son’s Master. She said, “If he really cared for me, then how could it be possible for me to stumble in the kitchen and break my toe? Either he is very inconsiderate or it was God’s Grace that prevented me from having a more serious accident. In any case, he does not deserve to have my son as his disciple. ”</p>
<p>The son felt confused. Then he came to the conclusion that if the Master had real power, how was it that he could not avert this catastrophe? Protection should be complete and perfect. So he left.</p>
<p>A few months later he came back, full of remorse. The Master forgave him, and gave him special attention and finally told him, “You are ready. I want you to run a Centre in another state.” But he thought the Master was cleverly trying to get rid of him. He said to the Master, “Why do you have to get rid of me? Let me get rid of you.” Once again he left the Master.</p>  </div>
