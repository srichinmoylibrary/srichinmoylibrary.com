<p>From his childhood days to his last living moments, every fibre of Netaji's being was imbued with the unshakable mission to free his Motherland. Colonel Habib-ur-Rahman was the only colleague who was with Netaji on the plane that crashed during takeoff from Taipei on 18 August 1945. The Colonel said that Netaji spoke to him from his hospital bed just minutes before he passed behind the curtain of Eternity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Habib, I feel I shall die soon. I have fought for India's freedom till the last. Tell my countrymen India will be free before long. Long live free India!"</p>
