<p>Unlike those of a good many luminaries of the world, Nehru's was a reputation that did not rise and fall like the flash of a skyrocket. With his passing behind the curtain of Eternity, India's heart was smitten with excruciating pangs and slow-healing sorrows, while America was deprived of two far-flung embracing arms. To America, Nehru was a fount of inspiration and an unforgettable international. To Nehru, America was a towering achievement, a great boon to the world at large.</p>
<p>In Nehru we see a divine dreamer and a torch-bearer of Truth.</p>  </div>
