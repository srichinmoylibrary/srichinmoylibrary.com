<p>Quite recently, after Carl Lewis again became the world’s fastest human, I was inspired to get some more lessons from him. As usual, most lovingly and compassionately he taught me. He said that my hands must go farther back in order to get a longer stride and greater speed. He also told me that I must relax my neck and face, which were stiff and tight, and that I need more flexibility in order to make progress. Carl Lewis, my Sudhahota, my coach, the world’s fastest speed, how I wish I could make you happy with my progress and also proud of me!</p>
