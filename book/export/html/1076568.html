<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Mere achievement of complete surrender does not assure self-realisation in this lifetime. There are other factors that must enter into the picture; God’s choice hour and the aspirant’s receptivity in its fullest measure and the full readiness of the entire being, to name only a few, are required for realisation to dawn on the aspirant. Again, I wish you to know what complete surrender means. It means that the aspirant’s surrender is joyful, soulful, spontaneous, unconditional, constant, forever and forever.</p>  </div>
