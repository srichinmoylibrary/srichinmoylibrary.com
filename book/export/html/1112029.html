<p>I had an experience near Queens Boulevard at four o'clock this morning. Just near the top of the hill a respectable-looking lady was waiting for the bus. She saw me coming toward her, from about 20 metres away. I was walking so ferociously that she got frightened and ran away. I felt sorry, so I called out to her, "Don't be afraid of me!" Then she came back to the bus stop.</p>
