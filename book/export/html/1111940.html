<p>Today I ran the three-mile fun run for Queens Day in Flushing Meadow Park.</p>
<p>After running one mile at a seven-minute pace, I drank water. I was walking very nicely for 100 metres. After two miles again I started.</p>
<p>At two and a half miles I said, "Go, go!" to Lavanya. At first she didn't see me, because I was so far ahead. Then she went ahead of me.</p>
<p>My timing was better than my best three miles, but when our boys measured the course, it was 100 metres short.</p>
<p>In the morning I had played 30 or 40 games of tennis. Then I took so much exercise. And I hadn't eaten for the previous two days. These are all my excuses why Lavanya finished 100 metres ahead of me.</p>
