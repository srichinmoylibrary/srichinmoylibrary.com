<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> We come from different worlds, but there is something that binds us together. Thank you, thank you very much. I am very grateful to you and very grateful to your followers who sing with such humbleness and ecstasy in their faces. It shows what you've given them.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy (introducing the choirmaster):</em> She is their teacher. She is the one who guides and leads the group.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Yes, yes, I know.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Could they have a group picture with you?</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Yes, yes.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This morning I was reading that you can do a head balance for 15 minutes. Poor me, I cannot do it for more than even a minute! Prime Minister Nehru wanted to show you that he could do it better. The Prime Minister could not see, perhaps, that you could do it infinitely better.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Today I don't do it as well as I could when I had my teacher. Now I'm much older, but I still do my headstand.</p>
<p><em>(Picture is taken.)</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Sri Chinmoy, I am very grateful to you. Thank you for coming. I hope we shall meet many times. Do you go back to India from time to time?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Occasionally, for a few days. I was brought up in a spiritual community â€” the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in South India. I spent twenty years there practising yoga and meditation.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> It is extraordinary to find this in the middle of New York City. You must sometimes feel that you are in a crazy civilisation.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have accepted it as my own. As I said before, I feel it is my bounden duty to be of service to the hustle and bustle of New York.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> This civilisation must be very grateful to you, even if they don't know it. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Again we shall meet. Thank you.</p>  </div>
