<p>On the Boston "Fifty Oneness-State-Songs" running course, the fifth and sixth miles were all uphill. In the beginning it was all downhill. But what benefit was it, since in the beginning I was fresh? Then coming back it was all uphill. Just when I was tired and exhausted, at that time I had to go up.</p>
