<p>The sixteen-year-old King then wanted to conquer Chittagong. He felt that Chittagong was a beautiful place, but the Muslim ruler Pathan was no good. The young King knew that the soldiers of this ruler were extremely powerful. So he said, "We shall have to play some tricks."</p>
<p>He asked one of his men to go to Pathan's soldiers and ask why they were fighting for the Muslim ruler, since Pathan was so bad. If they were fighting just for money, then the young King would pay them more. Let them leave the Muslim King and be his soldiers.</p>
<p>The enemy soldiers said, "If you can give us a higher salary, we will leave King Pathan immediately." So the young King gave them a higher salary and took them away. Then he declared war against the ruler of Chittagong and easily won. He became the ruler of Chittagong and, for a long time, ruled Chittagong with utmost compassion and justice.</p>  </div>
