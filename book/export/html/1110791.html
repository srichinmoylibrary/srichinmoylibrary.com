<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How can I be a better human being if I do not think of the Source? Who makes me good? Who makes me better? Who makes me best? Somebody who is infinitely better than I am, and that is God. When the necessity arises from within, you can be a good human being; you can help other people. Now, who is supplying you with the inspiration and aspiration to help mankind? God. The moment you want to be a better human being, you have to offer your good qualities: your sincerity, your humility, your love for mankind. These good qualities come from only one being and that is God. If you want to give, first you have to receive from someone who has already in infinite measure. If you do not receive, how are you going to give? How is it possible?</p>  </div>
