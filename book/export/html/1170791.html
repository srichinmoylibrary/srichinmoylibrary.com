<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you cannot remain in my divine consciousness or even think of me, how are you going to offer my light to others? If you remain in my consciousness and receive the inner food that your soul is eagerly trying to give you, then you will be in a position to share it. But if you are not receiving my light at all, if you are not even hungry for light, then how are you going to distribute it? Some people who say they want to give light are themselves not thirsty for light. It is only when you become a dynamo of my light that you can hope to offer my light to others.</p>
<p>If you make real progress in your spiritual life, then the light and the other divine qualities that you are getting from your inner life you will give to your colleagues and bosses spontaneously. Naturally you will manifest your own height â€” not showing off, but just spontaneously expressing it. If you remain in a garden or a flower shop for a few hours, the beauty and fragrance of the flowers will enter into your consciousness and remain inside you. Then, when you go out, the people you encounter will see you as a most beautiful flower. At that time they will see such inner fragrance in your eyes, in your face, in your smile!</p>  </div>
