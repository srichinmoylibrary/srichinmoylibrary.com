<p>Left to myself,<br /> I would once more become<br /> A perfect slave<br /> To my desiring life.</p>
<p>Left to myself,<br /> I would once more become<br /> A good friend<br /> Of my sleeping body.</p>
<p>Left to myself,<br /> I would once more deeply appreciate<br /> My attacking vital.</p>
<p>Left to myself,<br /> I would once more become<br /> An ardent admirer<br /> Of my doubting mind.</p>
<p>Left to myself,<br /> I would once more helplessly cry<br /> With my weeping heart.</p>
<p>Left to myself,<br /> I would once more deliberately ignore<br /> My in illumining soul.</p>
<p>Left to myself,<br /> I would once more remain away,<br /> Far away,<br /> From the ever-blessing Hands<br /> Of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>But oh, I cannot do that.<br /> I shall not do that.</p>
<p>I shall always remain<br /> In the Heart of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>I shall always remain<br /> At the Feet of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>I shall always remain with the Vision<br /> Of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>I shall always remain for the Manifestation<br /> Of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Him to please in His own Way,<br /> I shall become<br /> An ever-climbing tree;</p>
<p>I shall become<br /> An ever-inspiring flower;<br /> And I shall become<br /> An ever-nourishing fruit.</p>
