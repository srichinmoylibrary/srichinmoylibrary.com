<p>My Supreme Lord, the evening has set in. At this hour please tell me how I can please You most soulfully.</p>
<p>“My sweet child, you can please Me most soulfully at this beautiful hour if you can pray to Me for the beauty of eternal peace, if you can meditate on Me for the beauty of inner peace, if you can contemplate on Me for the reality of eternal peace, peace, peace.</p>
<p>“Evening is all peace. I want your entire life to be inundated with peace, and for that what I need from you is a powerful smile and a powerful cry. A powerful smile I want to see in your soulful eyes and a powerful cry I want to see in your cheerful heart.”</p>  </div>
