<p>"Amrita, I have been to Pranab's place for a medical check-up. Dr. Vyas says that I have improved in every way. Even my chest measurement has increased!"</p>
<p>"That is fine," said Nolini-da. "Wonderful, wonderful!"</p>
<p>"But you know, for a long time I have not been able to increase one thing."</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>"My height. No improvement!"</p>
<p>"I know a good cure for it."</p>
<p>"A way to increase my height?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Just raise your heels slowly and secretly, but more secretly than slowly."</p>  </div>
