<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good! I am all pride. All my love and gratitude to you and your wife. I am wearing one of the dhotis your wife made for me. Perhaps she does not feel how grateful I am to her, but God inside her knows how grateful I am for all the things she has made for me. So you and your daughter have to enter into her and make her feel how grateful I am for the clothes she makes for me.</p>  </div>
