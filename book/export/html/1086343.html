<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Forgive me, but you have not yet developed the capacity to meditate lying down. None of my disciples has come to that stage yet. There is still too much inertia in you. My meditation can be as powerful when I am lying down as when I am sitting in front of you. But only when you are realised or on the verge of realisation can you meditate while lying in bed. The tricky mind makes you feel that you are meditating but it is not actual meditation. It is just a feeling of peace or quietude, but not actually meditation.</p>  </div>
