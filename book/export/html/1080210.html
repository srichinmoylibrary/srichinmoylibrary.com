<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the individual seeker feels that the world community, the outer world, is something outside himself, then he will not be able to offer his aspiration to the world community. But if he feels that the world community, the entire world, is within him — inside his body, inside his soul — then he can pray and meditate in order to raise the standard of the world community, which is part and parcel of his own life.</p>
<p>First he has to feel his oneness with the world community, and then he has to feel that the world community is not outside his sphere of existence, it is not something else, or somewhere else, it is within him. When he can feel that, he will be able to contribute much more to the improvement of the world community. Then, anything that he does for the world community is also for his own nourishment, his own success and his own progress. So the most important thing is for him to feel that the world community is inside him, part and parcel of his own aspiring consciousness. Then, his own prayer and meditation will help the world considerably. That is the easiest way to raise the standard of the world community.</p>  </div>
