<p>How do I know<br /> That I shall have a better opportunity tomorrow<br /> To pray to God and to meditate on God?</p>
<p>How do I know<br /> That I shall have the same opportunity tomorrow<br /> To pray to God and to meditate on God?</p>
<p>How do I know<br /> That I shall have any opportunity tomorrow<br /> To pray to God and meditate on God?</p>
<p>How do I know<br /> That God will stay with me tomorrow<br /> In spite of my lengthening lethargy?</p>
<p>How do I know<br /> That God will stay with me tomorrow<br /> In spite of my increasing insecurity?</p>
<p>How do I know<br /> That God will stay with me tomorrow<br /> In spite of my staggering impurity?</p>
<p>Such being the case,<br /> I shall have to depend only on today.<br /> Even today is too much.<br /> Stark temptation and wild frustration<br /> May kill me if I wait for God-realisation<br /> Until the end of the day.</p>
<p>To be sure, there is no tomorrow, not even a today.<br /> All I have is now.<br /> All I can ever have is now.</p>
<p>With now, my preparation begins.<br /> In now, my realisation dawns.<br /> For now, my perfection glows.</p>
