<p>Three times I have had unfortunate experiences with the still camera that takes automatic pictures of my lifts. Once Ramaniya put the film in the camera, but no pictures came out. The camera clicked, but it was the wrong film. Fortunately, this time with my 2,000-pound lift, there was no problem.</p>
