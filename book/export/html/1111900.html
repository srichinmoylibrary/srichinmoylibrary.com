<p>Many, many years ago, before my disciples were even born, I gave up praying and started meditating. Once you enter meditation, you don't get joy from praying any more. But now I shall have to start praying again. I have to pray to God for speed and stamina and also not to get cramps in tomorrow's marathon.</p>
