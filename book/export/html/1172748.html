<p>God does not mind<br /> If you do not understand Him<br /> When He speaks to you.<br /> You can be sure<br /> He is not going to make<br /> His point clearer<br /> Just because you want Him<br /> To make you understand<br /> What He is saying.<br /> His Vision-Light is not<br /> Something to understand<br /> But something to love and love<br /> And eventually grow into.</p>
