<p>All are not born to see.<br /> All are not born to feel.<br /> All are not born to run.<br /> All are not born to dive.<br /> All are not born to fly.<br />            But<br /> All are born to love,<br /> All are born to serve,<br /> All are born to progress,<br /> All are born to perfect,<br /> All are born to transcend.</p>
