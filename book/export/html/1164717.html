<p><em>(Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield.)</em></p>
<p>ARJUNA: Krishna, I have to fight now. I have to conquer my enemies. But Krishna, now that I am in the battlefield, I am nervous. You know I have never suffered from nervousness before.</p>
<p><em>(Arjuna sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Sidanti mama gatrani</em><br />     /Mukham ca parisusyati/<br /><em>Vepathus ca sarire me</em><br />     /Romaharsas ca jayate/</p>

<p>[My limbs give way and my mouth is parched, my body quivers, and my hair stands on end.]</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Arjuna, you must never be nervous. This kind of thing I do not expect from you. You are a great hero, Arjuna. You must not be nervous.</p>
<p>ARJUNA: Krishna, please tell me what you actually want from my life. What do you expect from my life? Please tell me. What do you want from me? I am all yours.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Don't be nervous. I have told you that you are the hero of heroes, the supreme hero. You have to fight. Fight for the right cause. I shall tell you all about the inner life, the spiritual life, the life of perfection, inner and outer. First I shall teach you the life of realisation and revelation. Then I shall teach you the life of perfection.</p>
<p>ARJUNA: Krishna, you came into the world with a special purpose, I know. But please tell me, what is that purpose? I want to know from you.</p>
<p><em>(Krishna sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Yada-hada hi dharmasya</em><br />     /Glanir bhavati bharata/<br /><em>Abhyutthanam adharmasya</em><br />     /Tada 'tmanam srjamy aham/</p>
<p><em>Paritranaya sadhunam</em><br />     /Vinasaya ca duskrtam/<br /><em>Dharmasamsthapanarthaya</em><br />     /Sambhavami yuge-yuge/</p>

<p>[O Arjuna, whenever righteousness declines and unrighteouness prevails, Myself I embody and manifest. For the protection of the good and for the destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment of the inner code of life, I come into being from age to age.]</p>  </div>
