<p>When we used to cycle round the lake at Flushing Meadow Park on our five-mile course, there was a particular bridge. Everybody used to cross over that bridge easily, smiling, but for some reason, I always had difficulty on that bridge. Then I used to blame my bicycle. And my bicycle at that time was the best bicycle available!</p>  </div>
