<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Things do move faster with a young soul provided he is a sincere and dedicated aspirant and listens to his spiritual guide unreservedly; provided also that he has not been burdened with too many worldly experiences.</p>
<p>Here again we have to be aware of one thing: it is not the number of incarnations that impede the soul's rapid journey towards its Ultimate Goal, but the old unlit human habits and propensities which present themselves as great obstacles, since they do not open so easily to the Light for purification and transformation.</p>  </div>
