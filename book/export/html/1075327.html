<p>What to look for<br /> In God —<br /> A sweet smile.</p>
<p>What to look for<br /> In man —<br /> An iota of gratitude.</p>
<p>What to look for<br /> In Heaven —<br /> A flood of compassion.</p>
<p>What to look for<br /> On earth —<br /> An island of peace.</p>
<p>What to look for<br /> In life —<br /> A particle of satisfaction.</p>
<p>What to look for<br /> In death —<br /> A song of immortality.</p>

<p>God has<br /> Surprising news for him.<br /> God will give him<br /> Aspiration today<br /> And<br /> Realisation tomorrow,<br /> Far beyond his expectation<br /> And<br /> Far beyond his imagination.</p>
<p>He has<br /> Surprising news for God.<br /> At last he is ready to offer<br /> Ignorance, his best friend, to God.<br /> He is even prepared to offer<br /> His own self, the desire incarnate, to God.</p>

<p>Two instruments of death:<br /> Fear and doubt.<br /> I employed them<br /> For a long time<br /> To serve me<br /> And<br /> Please me.</p>
<p>They served me<br /> Day in and day out.<br /> I was really and truly<br /> Pleased with them<br /> And<br /> Proud of them.</p>
<p>Recently faith, an instrument of God,<br /> Came to me<br /> Looking for a job.<br /> I immediately employed faith.</p>
<p>To my wide surprise,<br /> Faith chased away<br /> My previous workers.<br /> Now faith alone<br /> Does everything for me,<br /> From morn to eve<br /> And<br /> From eve to morn.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">756. Three times</h1>
  
 

<p>Three times<br /> I looked for a hiding place.<br /> Alas, each time<br /> I failed.</p>
<p>First time<br /> I looked for a hiding place in God.<br /> God did not allow me<br /> To hide inside Him.</p>
<p>He said<br /> I am too restless,<br /> I would not stay inside Him<br /> For good.</p>
<p>He said to me<br /> That I have to<br /> Hide inside Him either<br /> Forever or never.</p>
<p>He knew that I would not<br /> Be able to stay inside Him forever.<br /> Therefore, He did not care<br /> To fulfil my prayer.</p>
<p>Second time<br /> I looked for a hiding place in man.<br /> Alas, it all ended in vain.</p>
<p>Man said to me,<br /> "I shall allow you to hide inside me<br /> On one condition.<br /> You have to offer me daily<br /> A sea of gratitude<br /> And<br /> A sea of plenitude."</p>
<p>I immediately told man<br /> That his demands were extravagant,<br /> Impossible and unthinkable.<br /> I left man with my transcendental disgust.</p>
<p>Third and last time<br /> I looked for a hiding place<br /> Inside Ignorance-sea.<br /> Lo, I have done it.</p>
<p>And nothing need I<br /> Offer my Ignorance-sea in return.<br /> Here I shall hide,<br /> I shall eternally hide.</p>
