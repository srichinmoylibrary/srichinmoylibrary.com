<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, a parent can and must guide a child to a higher consciousness; otherwise what is the use of bringing children into the field of creativity from God? It is deplorable when parents do not want to take the due responsibility to guide, mould and shape the child here on earth for God-realisation and God-manifestation. When it is Godâ€™s Will for the parents to bring children into the world, they must feel that this kind of guidance is their very purpose as parents.</p>  </div>
