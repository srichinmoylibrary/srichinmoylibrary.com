<p>This evening in front of about twenty witnesses I lifted 300 pounds on my stomach ten times. Two years ago I did this kind of thing when we had our Rainbow-Dreamers club. I am sure people can see it is moving. Today I took only 549 calories and my weight is 146 pounds. People say I should be weaker from my dieting, but in my case, dieting makes my stomach strong!</p>
