<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A practical thing is something that comes spontaneously from within and not from without. When you get up in the morning, if the thought comes to your mind to show love or concern for the world, that is a practical idea. How can you transform this practical idea into fruitful reality? In the morning or in the evening, during your regular prayer and meditation, you can add this prayer: "O Lord, I wish this world to be better, more illumining and more fulfilling by Your infinite Grace." If your prayer reaches God, who is the Creator and Sustainer of the world — and it will certainly reach Him if it is sincere and intense — He can easily carry your concern and love for the world into the field of manifestation.</p>
<p>We have been meditating together for fifteen or twenty minutes. During that time our experience of inner peace and love was absolutely practical and tangible. What we get from our meditation you can easily give to others, but the process is an inner process. The best way to carry out this inner process is to approach the Source. We cannot approach each and every human being. But there is Someone who can do this on our behalf, and that is God. If we ask Him to offer peace, concern and love to the world at large, and if He is pleased with our request, then naturally He will do it. It is through daily communion with God that we can best offer the world our love and concern.</p>
<p>Physically we may remain in one place, but spiritually we can spread peace and love throughout the world. Like a bird in the vast sky, our wings are widespread with peace, joy and love.</p>
