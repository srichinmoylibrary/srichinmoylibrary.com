<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to educate the unaspiring parts of one's being is to make them conscious of the supreme necessity of happiness â€” happiness in life and a life of happiness. In order to achieve happiness in life and discover a life of happiness, one must aspire. What is aspiration? Aspiration is God-satisfaction. And what is non-aspiration? Non-aspiration is animal-satisfaction.</p>  </div>
