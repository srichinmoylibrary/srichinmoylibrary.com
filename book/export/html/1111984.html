<p>Whenever I run alone, people talk to me. After God knows how many months, I went out to practise. Bipin and Pulin were following me in the car. After 1300 metres, a little boy came right in front of me in an intersection and said, "Please stop, stop, stop!" So immediately I stopped. Cars were coming on this side and that side, but they had a red light, so I could stop.</p>
<p>He said, "Have you seen my little white poodle? Have you seen my little white poodle?" It was so pathetic.</p>
<p>I said, "I have not seen it."</p>
<p>He said, "You have not seen it?"</p>
<p>Then he started looking for it again.</p>
