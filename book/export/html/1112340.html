<p><em>(Woodrow Wilson and his daughter Margaret, at home.)</em></p>
<p><em>Margaret Wilson:</em> Father, God gave you a very big heart. Your heart cried for world peace. You did not want America to enter into the war, but Germany and circumstances compelled America to become involved. You told the world that, on our part, this was a war to end all war, and you fulfilled your promise. Now, again, you want to manifest your lifelong resolve. You want to avert all future wars. You want peace all over the world; therefore, you are sacrificing your very life-blood to form the League of Nations. You are facing tremendous opposition. To my utter sorrow, you are encountering the worst opposition from your own countrymen. But I feel from deep within that soon you will definitely be able to form the League of Nations. Your divine vision will see the face of supreme reality.</p>
<p><em>Woodrow Wilson:</em> Margaret, my daughter, you have always been my confidante. Today your heart of illumination has consoled me tremendously.</p>
<p><em>Margaret Wilson:</em> Father, it is a great pleasure, a great joy and a great honour to be of help to you.</p>
<p><em>Woodrow Wilson:</em> Daughter, ideas live; men die.</p>
<p><em>Margaret Wilson:</em> Men like you with lofty ideas, never die. Because of their divine ideas, they remain immortal on earth. They are treasured equally by both Heaven and earth. Father, the League of Nations must see the light of day before you leave this body.</p>
<p><em>Woodrow Wilson:</em> How I wish it could be possible! Margaret, right from your childhood you were God-oriented. Now you have decided to go to India and practise spirituality. It is only in the spiritual life, you realise, that God-realisation is possible. I admire your genuine longing for God and bless your devoted heart. But I have one request to make of you. Please tell me that you will fulfil my request, my heart's desire. You will go to India only after I have gone to the other world, not before.</p>
<p><em>Margaret Wilson:</em> Father, I promise that I shall stay beside you like your most faithful shadow until you join the other world. Only then shall I go to India, the land of my heart's dream, the land of my soul's real reality-existence.</p>  </div>
