<p>Rembrandt worked very hard. He blessed the world with hundreds of painting-boons, etching-boons and drawing-boons. His achievements are truly immortal.</p>
<p>His painting, <em>Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer</em>, was sold for more than two million dollars. Alas, what a shocking stroke of cruel fate: penniless he died. A close friend of his offered $85.20 to meet with the cost of the burial.</p>  </div>
