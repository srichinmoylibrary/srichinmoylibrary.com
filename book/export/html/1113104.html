<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this world people strive to attain something because they feel that they will get satisfaction after they attain that particular thing. It is very easy for me to drink a glass of water. But if I drink a glass of water, nobody is going to appreciate me, nobody is going to admire me. In the spiritual life I don't need appreciation or admiration. But I myself will not be satisfied with just drinking water. If I do something more meaningful and more significant, then only I will be satisfied</p>
<p>God-realisation is a most difficult task. But if we realise God, then we shall be totally satisfied. It is for our abiding satisfaction, our everlasting satisfaction, that we want to realise God.</p>  </div>
