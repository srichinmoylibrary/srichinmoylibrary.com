<p><em>(The White House. Truman and one of his advisors.)</em></p>
<p><em>Advisor:</em> So, Mr. President, you have won the election. We all are extremely proud that you have become our President for a second term. We were afraid that you would not win the second election, but you did. All glory to you, Mr. President.</p>
<p><em>Harry Truman:</em> Not in vain did I travel thirty thousand miles. Not in vain did I give three hundred fifty speeches. I have won. That means my Fair Deal has won. Our country, which basically wants and needs the Fair Deal, has won.</p>
<p><em>Advisor:</em> Mr. President, Theodore Roosevelt is immortal for offering his "Square Deal" gift to the nation. Franklin Roosevelt is immortal for offering his "New Deal" gift to the nation and you will be immortal for offering your "Fair Deal" gift to the nation.</p>
<p><em>Harry Truman:</em> Whether or not I am going to be immortal I leave in the Hands of God. That is His business. My business is to become honest. My business is to see that my countrymen lead an honest life. Many businessmen stood against me when I proclaimed the Fair Deal. They were afraid that they were going to lose their businesses. What could I do? I was helpless. My sole purpose is to see the truth and serve the truth. Talking about businesses and businessmen, once upon a time I, too, was a businessman. I ran a clothing store, and I sadly failed. But this time, not in the capacity of a businessman but in the capacity of a truth-lover, and for the purpose of promoting the supreme necessity of truth in the minds and hearts of my countrymen, I am sure I shall succeed.</p>
<p><em>Advisor:</em> Mr. President, you must and you shall.</p>  </div>
