<p>Today while cycling I listened to the Invocation and then one of Swami Vivekanandaâ€™s songs sung by a great Bengali singer. You can see how fast my legs are going in time with the music. When I was under thirty I could have cycled like that, but I do not think I have reached the same speed since then.</p>
