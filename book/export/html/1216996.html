<p>I was coming home on the Concorde. The man who gave me my ticket said it was leaving from Gate 10 at seven o'clock.</p>
<p>Before seven o'clock they made the announcement: "British Airways bound for New York is now boarding at Gate 10." So I went there and gave the lady at the gate my ticket. As usual, she tore off a portion and gave the other portion to me. Then I entered into the plane.</p>
<p>When I got inside, the man checking tickets said, "Wrong plane!"</p>
<p>I said, "How could it be the wrong plane? The man at the ticket counter told me to come to Gate 10, and the lady at the door took my ticket."</p>
<p>He said, "No, you are supposed to go on the Concorde, and this is a regular plane."</p>
<p>I went back to the lady at the gate and said, "Why did you send me into this plane?"</p>
<p>Then she started barking at me, saying, "Who asked you to go there?"</p>
<p>I said, "I gave you the ticket. What do I know about it? If it was not the right plane, you should have told me!"</p>
<p>Then an officer came and scolded her because it was her fault. He told me the correct gate to go to.</p>
<p>My plane was supposed to have left at seven o'clock, but it had been delayed. After that I had to wait several more hours for my flight. The Concorde is supposed to save time, so this is how I saved time!</p>
