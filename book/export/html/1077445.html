<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Strengthen your prayer; pray more. You also have to be physically a little bit stronger. Otherwise, you will not be able to develop more receptivity. In your case, you have to be physically stronger. Otherwise, when more light, abundant light, descends from above, it will be very difficult for you to hold it. So, first your physical body has to be strong enough to receive the light from above.</p>  </div>
