<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not use any mental process to concentrate my physical and mental energies; I only invoke God’s Grace. I consciously pray for God’s Victory in my cheerful self-offering to the weightlifting world. I shall be more than happy and gratified if the results of my self-offering can become a source of inspiration to all those who are interested in weightlifting. But I have always advocated the message of self-transcendence. He who has acted in and through me can easily act in and through others as well, if such is His Will. In the process of His own evolution in and through humanity, God will far transcend the accomplishments He has achieved through me.</p>  </div>
