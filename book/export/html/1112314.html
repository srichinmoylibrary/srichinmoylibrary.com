<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em>: To discover the absolute Truth is not only possible but inevitable. Everybody on earth will one day discover the absolute Truth â€” at God's choice Hour. You will discover it today and I will discover it tomorrow. But every person on earth is bound to realise this absolute Truth; it is not the sole monopoly of anyone. When God feels that we are ready, He will come to us with the absolute Truth. It may take many, many years or many incarnations, but definitely God's Hour will come for us. We do not know when that time will be; but we know that it is bound to come.</p>  </div>
