<p>On Father's Day I asked all of my disciples to meditate once for each year that they had been with me. I am sure they listened to my request. On Father's Day I composed a song. It was translated into twelve languages. The best was an African language. Devadip translated it into Spanish and Haridas arranged it.</p>
<p>I also composed a song on France â€” "Vive la France." The European disciples enjoyed it very much and now they are learning it.</p>
<p>I gave a name to Projjwal's printing press: "Perfection-Glory." There I composed a song dedicated to his press.</p>  </div>
