<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I never approve of this. The inner world is your right hand and the outer world is your left hand. If somebody keeps his room unclean, if he then takes a shower and goes to the Centre, still that person is only half clean. That person will carry the uncleanliness of his house with him. So the best thing is to do both: to keep the house clean and also to observe personal cleanliness.</p>  </div>
