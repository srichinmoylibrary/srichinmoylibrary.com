<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> Yes, I do a double hitchkick. Jesse Owens used to do only one. I was talking to Narada about this. We were watching a movie of his start — how he came up and ran. No one else at the time was doing a hitchkick. That’s why he used to run away so fast. He was 15 years ahead of his time — so far ahead! Unbelievable!</p>  </div>
