<p>I was working in Nolini-da's room near his bed, sitting on the floor. Ranju-da came inside and said to his father: "X. Datta has criticised Rabindranath mercilessly."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "It always happens like that. People are so ungrateful. He and Basu have become well known in the literary world by virtue of Rabindranath's grace. Now look how ungrateful they are! They speak ill of Rabindranath." Then he turned towards me and said: "Chinmoy, I once got a few reprints of my article <em>"Rabindranath, O Uttar Pakkha."</em> Do you know where the article was published?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it was published in <em>Rabindra Bharati</em> and the editor of the magazine is A. K. Ghose."</p>
<p>"Ah," he said, "now it is your turn to retrace them."</p>
<p>It took me about fifteen minutes to find the reprints. He was very happy that I had found them. He said to me: "Why do I waste my time searching for things? Why do I not wait for you? Why do I make the same mistake again and again?"</p>  </div>
