<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You do not have to know any names. In the light of the plane itself you see the reality. If you read sacred books, you will get all the names of the higher and lower planes. Here you are using your mental power and with your eyes you are seeing what is written. But when you go to these planes, you do not use the mind. In this case you see everything with the power of your vision. As soon as you have the power of vision and you see the light, the light itself conveys what plane of existence you are on. So you do not have to know the name; and even if you know it, it does not help because the language that is written in the book is not found written in the same way in the actual plane of consciousness. There it only tells through light.</p>  </div>
