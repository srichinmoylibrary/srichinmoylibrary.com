<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the one hand, each person has his own way of seeing the truth, feeling the truth and becoming the truth. There are many minds, many ways, and there is no basic oneness. On the other hand, two heads are better than one. So the jury system gives us the opportunity to combine the wisdom of many, to unite the wisdom of many, instead of singing the song of separativity and individual supremacy. If the members of the jury believe, as they should, in combining their respective wisdom, then naturally the jury system is an asset.</p>  </div>
