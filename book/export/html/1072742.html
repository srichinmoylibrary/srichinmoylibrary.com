<h2>Question: Does God offer us opportunity at every moment to claim Him as our own?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, God offers us opportunity at every moment to claim Him as our very own. We claim God by identifying ourselves with Him and by offering ourselves at His Feet for His use. God is our life’s eternal Pilot; we shall be God’s Dream- Boat.</p>  </div>
