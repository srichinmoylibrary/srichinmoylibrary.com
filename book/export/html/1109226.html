<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. If one has a sincere inner cry, then God will give him the light of patience. He who has accepted the inner life, the spiritual life, will be given enough patience.</p>
<p>The seekers who are now crying for light know that there are people who have already seen, felt and realised the light, so they are encouraged and inspired. If we dive deep within and follow the inner life, then sooner or later we shall also be inundated with light and peace. Peace of mind is bound to dawn at that time.</p>  </div>
