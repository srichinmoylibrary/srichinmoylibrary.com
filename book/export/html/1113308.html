<p>Ranju-da's birthday. Sannyal-da (Dr. Sannyal) came in and said: "<em>Bonne fÄ™te</em>" to Ranju-da. Indu-di invited him to come to her place to celebrate Ranju-da's birthday. Sannyal-da said: "I shall come on one condition."</p>
<p>"What is the condition?"</p>
<p>"The outer cloak is big but the inner vessel is small. I am ready to come only if you give me very little to eat."</p>
<p>Both mother and son were terribly amused and delighted. Then Indu-di said: "Your desire is granted."</p>  </div>
