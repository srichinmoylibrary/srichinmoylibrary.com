<p>This world is so small. In 1966 a German lady became my disciple in Puerto Rico. She lived right across the street from our first Centre there. From my apartment I could see where she lived. In my book <em>Yoga and the Spiritual Life</em>, there are quite a few questions on the soul that were asked by her. She also translated our Invocation into German. I gave her the Indian name `Abhaya,' which means fearless, dauntless.</p>
<p>One day Nadeshwar, our supreme boxing champion, was saying unkind things about the strength of women. Abhaya could not tolerate it, so she challenged him to a boxing match. She didn't know anything about boxing, but she was very mad.</p>
<p>Nadeshwar said, "Oh no, I can't fight with women."</p>
<p>After that, Nadeshwar kept quiet.</p>
<p>Abhaya moved to Miami a few years later and left us.</p>
<p>At the end of tonight's concert, who should come up to me but Abhaya! I didn't recognise her until she told me her name. She was quite devoted.</p>
