  <h1 class="book-heading">Love: attachment and detachment</h1>
  
 
<p>If human affection is not always reliable, it is also not always harmful.</p>
<p>Foolish is he who thinks that affection should be turned into indifference in order that God might come to him. Alas, he has yet to learn that God is All-Affection.</p>
<p>Affection and attachment need not always go together. An entire rejection of all relations can never be the promising sign of progress towards Realisation.</p>
<p>Controlled desire is good. Better is non-attachment. Best is it to feel oneself removed from the snare of nature.</p>
<p>Suppression is as hostile and undeserving as attachment. It is our non-attachment that is the only master of nature.</p>
<p>Desires and hungers have one common enemy: detachment.</p>
<p>Detachment and not possession should be the bridge between you and the object of your love.</p>
<p>Spiritual detachment intensifies the seeking of our hearts, purifies the vibrations of our bodies, transforms the ignorance of our consciousness into knowledge.</p>
<p>Granted, loneliness is a kind of spiritual disease. But human association can never be its lasting medicine. The only permanent cure for it is Inner Experience.</p>
