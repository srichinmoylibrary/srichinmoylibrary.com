<p>When I pray,<br /> My Lord Supreme tells me<br /> That in Heaven He will grant me<br /> A most beautiful place to live.</p>
<p>When I meditate,<br /> My Lord Supreme tells me<br /> That I have found on earth<br /> The most perfect place<br /> For Him and His Satisfaction to live.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186345" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">702</h1>
  
 

<p>Ignorance-pirate has captured you<br /> Because you did not go to enjoy<br /> Your oneness-picnic<br /> With God's other seeker-children.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186346" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">703</h1>
  
 

<p>You have been persuaded<br /> To the false conviction<br /> That God does not want you<br /> Or need you.<br /> Therefore, your entire life is haunted<br /> By doubt-phantom.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186347" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">704</h1>
  
 

<p>Every day my soul visits<br /> My Lord Supreme<br /> And brings down faith-medicine<br /> From His Salvation-Pharmacy<br /> To cure my insincerity-mind,<br /> Impurity-heart<br /> And insecurity-life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186348" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">705</h1>
  
 

<p>The donkey inside my mind<br /> Lives an indecision-life.</p>
<p>The deer inside my heart<br /> Is always ready with decision-speed.</p>
<p>The lion inside my soul<br /> Enjoys immediate God-ordained<br /> Satisfaction-action.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186349" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">706</h1>
  
 

<p>Your heart's God-reliance<br /> Is a powerful shaft<br /> Of God's death-silencing Truth.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186350" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">707</h1>
  
 

<p>God does not allow my mind<br /> To give talks on perfection<br /> In His Amphitheatre,<br /> But every day He invites my heart<br /> To give talks on aspiration<br /> And dedication.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186351" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">708</h1>
  
 

<p>Now that you have become one<br /> With your soul's silence-light,<br /> You can easily depart<br /> From the doubt-madhouse of your mind.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186352" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">709</h1>
  
 

<p>O my life,<br /> Do not aim for anything else<br /> Save and except<br /> My Lord's Satisfaction-Permanence.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186353" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">710</h1>
  
 

<p>The human mind finds it<br /> Quite impossible to believe<br /> That it is an immigrant<br /> From the ignorance-world.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186354" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">711</h1>
  
 

<p>Now that your heart<br /> Is no longer petrified<br /> By insecurity-monster,<br /> Your life can enjoy<br /> The towering tallness<br /> Of satisfaction-house.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186355" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">712</h1>
  
 

<p>Alas,<br /> My mind has destroyed itself<br /> By thinking.</p>
<p>Alas,<br /> My heart is looking for a hope-plant<br /> Inside my barren life.</p>
<p>Alas,<br /> My soul has become a complete stranger<br /> To satisfaction-delight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186356" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">713</h1>
  
 

<p>His is the formless God.<br /> He meditates and meditates<br /> On God the Light<br /> To illumine him.</p>
<p>Mine is the personal God.<br /> I meditate and meditate<br /> On God the Supreme Beloved<br /> To fulfil me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186357" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">714</h1>
  
 

<p>Now that you have launched<br /> Into the spiritual life,<br /> Just remain faithful.<br /> You will definitely reach<br /> Your golden destination.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186358" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">715</h1>
  
 

<p>My Beloved Supreme,<br /> I may not have many things to give You,<br /> But I do have two things to give You:<br /> A heart of gratitude<br /> And a life of surrender.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186359" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">716</h1>
  
 

<p>Your self-reliance<br /> Is nothing short of God-defiance.<br /> Therefore, you will always be denied<br /> Infinity's blue-gold ecstasy-dreams.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186360" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">717</h1>
  
 

<p>If you want to be perfect,<br /> Then what you need is<br /> Minute-to-minute aspiration.</p>
<p>If you want to be satisfied,<br /> Then what you need is<br /> Year-to-year dedication.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186361" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">718</h1>
  
 

<p>Your mind has been stung so mercilessly<br /> By jealousy-bee<br /> That you are not able to see<br /> Your heart-bird<br /> Inside God's Love-Nest.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186362" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">719</h1>
  
 

<p>Who says you have become nothing?<br /> You have become the dead-end road<br /> Of self-styled satisfaction.<br /> Perhaps you do not realise it,<br /> But that is something -<br /> Something absolutely intolerable.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186363" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">720</h1>
  
 

<p>What am I doing?<br /> I am building my silver dream-boat<br /> To sail my earth-bound human life<br /> To the liberation-shore.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186364" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">721</h1>
  
 

<p>To see God the Light,<br /> To feel God the Light,<br /> To become God the Light:<br /> This is the only goal<br /> Of my meditation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186365" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">722</h1>

<p>O my soul,<br /> Can you please tell me a few words<br /> About God's Eye and God's Heart?<br /> "God's Eye<br /> Is His Eternity's Newness.<br /> God's Heart<br /> Is His Eternity's Fulness."</p>

<p>If every day you put on<br /> The armour of faith,<br /> God will grant you<br /> His most precious gift:<br /> Satisfaction-Delight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186368" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">725</h1>
  
 

<p>Yours is a life<br /> Of self-contradictory hungers.<br /> Yours is a mind<br /> Of continual hallucinations.<br /> Yours is a heart<br /> Of helplessness multiplied by weakness.<br /> What then can anybody expect from you?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186369" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">726</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1186370" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">727</h1>
  
 

<p>There can be no greater absurdity<br /> Than to think that your life<br /> Will no longer be able to succeed<br /> And that your soul<br /> Will no longer be able to proceed.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186371" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">728</h1>

<div id="node-1186372" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">729</h1>
  
 

<p>Only an aspiring heart can feel<br /> That God's Vision-Eye<br /> Is all promise<br /> And that God's Reality-Heart<br /> Is all fulfilment.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186373" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">730</h1>
  
 

<p>When I pray soulfully,<br /> My Beloved Supreme gives me the capacity<br /> To love my inner life infinitely more<br /> Than I love my outer life.</p>
<p>When I meditate sleeplessly,<br /> My Beloved Supreme grants me the capacity<br /> To love Him infinitely more<br /> Than I love my outer life of hope<br /> And my inner life of promise.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186374" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">731</h1>
  
 

<p>The heart's purity<br /> The human hand cannot pollute.<br /> The soul's divinity<br /> The human heart cannot grasp.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1186375" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">732</h1>
  
 

<p>Because his heart is perfected<br /> By gratitude,<br /> He is now blessed<br /> With a liberated life.</p>

  </div>
<div id="node-1186377" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">734</h1>
  
 

<p>You must expose yourself<br /> To only one thing<br /> And that thing is<br /> The divinity-world<br /> Of Heaven's infinite Love.</p>

<p>The visible God daily invites you<br /> To come and eat with Him.<br /> The invisible God silently asks you<br /> To invite Him to eat with you<br /> At least once in your entire life.</p>

<div id="node-1186380" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">737</h1>

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Where can I find You immediately?<br /> "My child,<br /> You can find Me immediately<br /> Inside the hearts of those<br /> Who are selflessly and untiringly building<br /> My Kingdom of Heaven<br /> Here on earth."</p>

<p>When I pray,<br /> I feel that am a beggar<br /> Looking at a rich man's house.<br /> Perhaps, out of compassion,<br /> The rich man will give me alms.</p>
<p>When I meditate,<br /> I feel that I am waiting for<br /> My dearest friend<br /> To do me a special favour.<br /> Since we have established our oneness,<br /> My Beloved Friend will definitely<br /> Do the needful.</p>

<p>Why must you always ask,<br /> "When will I become beautiful,<br /> When will I be free from ignorance?"<br /> If you think that you are ugly,<br /> All your joy disappears,<br /> And ugliness becomes your name.<br /> If you think that you are caught<br /> In the meshes of ignorance,<br /> You become bound, totally bound.</p>

<p>You want to secretly go up<br /> And not look back at anybody else<br /> Once you have reached your height.<br /> But I tell you,<br /> Both realisation and manifestation<br /> Are absolutely necessary<br /> In God's divine Game.</p>
