<p>Jim expects one of his students to be in the Olympics in 1992. He is doing very well in weightlifting. At one point, this boy came up to me with the picture of my 1,600-pound calf raise. He was telling me that he has been practising for four or five years but he cannot lift more than 300 or 400 pounds. He wanted to know how I can do 1,600. He is only about 18 years old, and quite short, but very strong.</p>
