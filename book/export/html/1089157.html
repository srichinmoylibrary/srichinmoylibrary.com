<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are a man of infinite wisdom and light. At every moment sleeplessly you are trying to offer light to ignorant people. Ignorant people must realise that they need light from people who have light. If I am ignorant, I don't want to remain always ignorant. If somebody in the family knows something, then I have to learn from him. You know something. Now your dear ones, your friends and your countrymen must learn from you. There are many students in a class but only one teacher. One teacher speaks, and hundreds of students learn. Then again, each of these students can go to another place and talk about what he has learned of peace and love. In this way hundreds and thousands can learn. So from one it becomes many. But at one point someone has to start the whole thing. One individual has to offer peace before it will spread to two or three. So people like you must be given the opportunity to spread your light, and this is what you are doing.</p>
<p>I am extremely, extremely happy and fortunate to be here with you, and I am extremely, extremely grateful to you for translating this pamphlet. So you can feel my heart of gratitude.</p>  </div>
