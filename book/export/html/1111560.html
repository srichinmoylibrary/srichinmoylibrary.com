<p>Today I ran the 25-kilometre Marathon Tune-Up in Central Park. Quite a few disciples also ran. At the start, Nayana was standing just ahead of me with her husband at the eight-minute pace marker. I said, "Go!" Then, after some time I saw that she fell behind me.</p>
<p>At one point both Peter and Tulasi were asking people at the water stations if they had water, but they had run out.</p>
<p>Kurt Steiner likes me so much because we help the New York Road Runners Club in so many ways. Two or three times during the race he mentioned my name over the loudspeaker. When I finished, he mentioned my time. Niriha was standing with him on the platform taking video. She says that she helped him practise saying my name.</p>
