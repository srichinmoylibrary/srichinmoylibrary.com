<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you meditate deep within, you can hear the soundless sound. Now I am chanting ‘AUM’. Because I am using my outer voice, you can hear it. But there is a way of chanting in silence. When we chant in this way, the sound reverberates in the inmost recesses of our heart. This sound is infinitely more powerful than the sound that I create with my voice. It is beyond your imagination. Your human ears will not hear this inner sound, but your inner ear will hear it.</p>
<p>To produce the outer sound, I have to use some physical force. But the inner sound, the <em>Anahata Nada</em>, does not need any help from anything or from anybody to be produced. It is self-creating. Silence itself holds that sound. Silence is God’s Dream and sound is God’s Reality. The Dream and the Reality always go together.</p>  </div>
