<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Twenty-eight nations have joined our peace-blossoms-family so far. Either the President or Prime Minister or some other very important government leaders have written me that they want to be part of this peace movement. Then I have gone to these places to inaugurate them. I have been to Malta, Nepal, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, to name a few.</p>  </div>
