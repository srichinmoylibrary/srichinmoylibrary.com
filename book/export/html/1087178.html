<p>Yesterday I went to a Greek deli and asked for garlic bread.</p>
<p>The man asked, "Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>I said, "From India."</p>
<p>He said, "That's why you speak like that."</p>
<p>Then I asked him, "Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>He said, "From Greece."</p>
<p>So I said, "We are brothers, we are brothers!"</p>
<p>He was Dividing fault with my pronunciation of 'garlic.' But he himself was speaking broken English.</p>
<p>When I first came to America, I used to feel a little sad when people could not understand me. But now I don't have to repeat words like 'magnificent' and 'table' because people understand me. Americans may criticise me, but the British-even children-don't have any problem understanding me.</p>
<p>In Scotland I find it very difficult to understand the people. Three or four times I have to ask them what they are saying. It is too much, too much!</p>
