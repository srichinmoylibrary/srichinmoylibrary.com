<p>Netaji often showed his oneness-heart to his beloved soldiers. He shared the same austere life and he often used to eat with them. At all times, he insisted on receiving exactly the same treatment as everybody else:</p>
<p>Since Netaji was the Commander-in-Chief, he used to be given four pieces of bread at meal time. One day he happened to notice that the regular soldiers were served only two pieces. He asked them, 'Why are you giving me four pieces when your portion is only two?'</p>
<p>They said, 'You are our leader, so you deserve more.'</p>
<p>'I deserve more?' said Netaji. 'Have I not established my oneness with you all? What kind of justice is it that you get two and I get four? Take them away!'</p>
<p>They removed the extra pieces from Netaji's plate and he happily declared, 'Now I am ready to eat. I cannot have more than you who are my dearest brothers. There should be equal treatment.'</p>  </div>
