<p>Flowers too have a tongue,<br /> They also have joy and strife.<br /> They are the expression first<br /> Of the psychic flame in life.<br /> Each plane owns a colour.<br /> She boons with names to those<br /> That unveil to Her their skies<br /> Rich in oneness of the source.<br /> But those that are still and mute<br /> Nameless, infinitesimal.<br /> Now a thousand flowers<br /> Cherish Her Dawn-ward call.</p>
