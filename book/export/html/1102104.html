<p>"My Lord Supreme,<br /> This time You have to be<br /> Really frank with me.<br /> You know I have hundreds of enemies.<br /> Do You have any enemies?"</p>
<p>"My son, I have only one enemy."</p>
<p>"Only one enemy?<br /> I can kill him immediately!<br /> Just tell me the name of Your enemy."</p>
<p>"My son, My only enemy is your fear,<br /> Your fear of Me."</p>
<p>"Father of eternal Love,<br /> Is it so?<br /> Lo, I have killed Your enemy.<br /> I have no fear of You.<br /> I am all love for You.<br /> I am all gratitude to You."</p>
<p>"My son, I am truly proud of you.<br /> In My case, I shall not kill your enemies;<br /> I shall illumine them.<br /> I shall illumine you, too.<br /> What you want is joy.<br /> This joy you will get<br /> Only when you and your enemies<br /> Are illumined all at once."</p>
