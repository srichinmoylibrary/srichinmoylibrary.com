<h2>Question: Guru, you said that from our meditation we have to face the outer world with the correct attitude. What sort of attitude is that?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You should always have the attitude of a divine hero. A divine hero is not an ordinary soldier who will strike and kill. No, he is a spiritual soldier who will fight for the divine manifestation here on earth, who will act for the sake of the Divine, the Supreme. If you are scared to death when a problem arises, then you cannot be a chosen instrument of the Divine, of the Supreme. Life has to be accepted. This acceptance does not mean mere enjoyment. No, acceptance has particular spiritual significance. There is a kind of meditation that feels that the world is unreal and barren. But I wish to say no, the world is most fertile. The world is not a dream; it is not a chimerical mist. This world of ours is the reality, but this reality is not yet manifested fully. It is our meditation, our inner life, our aspiration, that can hasten the process of divine manifestation in the form of reality. This world embodies divinity, but we deny even this simple truth. What we have to do first is to feel the embodiment of the ultimate Truth in this world of ours, and then to reveal and manifest that ultimate Truth with our dynamic meditation, conscious aspiration and sincere dedication.</p>  </div>
