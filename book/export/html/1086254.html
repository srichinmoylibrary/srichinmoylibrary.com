<p>This is a collective meditation; that is to say, we all meditate together. In the beginning of today's meeting for about half an hour what I did was to bring down peace — sublime and infinite peace. After that, I stood in front of each of you and entered into you to observe what the soul, the inner being, the outer being, the physical, the vital, the mind and the heart wanted at that particular moment. While I was doing this I must say, almost all of you aspired to have something or to grow into something. Your physical mind may not have been aware of your soul's immediate need, but your soul was spontaneously trying to bring to the fore the spiritual need, the inner need.</p>
<p>Sometimes I see that there is no aspiration. Some students do not want anything. It is not that they have everything; it is just that they do not have the inspiration to either draw something from above or to get something from me. With these students I just try to kindle the flame of aspiration. But if I stand in front of someone and see that that particular aspirant wants to have Peace, immediately I bring down Peace from above. If I see someone who wants Light, then I bring down Light. If a third person wants Power, I bring down Power. There are other divine qualities also. According to the aspiration, necessity and receptivity of each individual aspirant, I bring down spiritual, divine treasures from above.</p>
<p>There are some aspirants who get immediate inspiration and aspiration when they see that a great spiritual figure is standing in front of them, inspiring them or guiding them to speed up their spiritual life and spiritual progress. Those who are conscious of the fact that a spiritual person can do and does this act of upliftment in their spiritual life, are consciously benefiting from my spiritual presence.</p>
<p>I wish to add something more. The soul, as you know, right now is encaged; it is inside the body. At times during the aspirant's conscious or unconscious life, it wants to fly from one plane of consciousness to another. That is to say, it tries to go from the second plane to the third plane, and from the third plane to the fourth plane — up, up, up. There are seven higher worlds and seven lower worlds of existence. If I see that the soul of a particular aspirant wants to have that experience of the soul's journey, then I do it for him. Today I have done that here with one particular seeker. And, of course, to each individual I have given my inner wealth according to the individual's aspiration and necessity.</p>
<p>Very often, just for a second during the meditation, the aspirant's soul feels my inner concern, love and blessings for him. Then it is blocked up for five, ten or fifteen minutes; then again it resumes its performance. Or at night, when the particular seeker is asleep, the soul of the person comes to me again to be benefited and to seek my guidance. That is also done.</p>
<p>So these are the major things that I do during the collective meditation. And once you can make a conscious contact with my soul, then you can rest assured that my existence on earth will act like your slave. Once anyone makes real contact with my soul and sincerely wants my help, then I am at his or her service forever. But this contact must be transformed into identification, and from identification into oneness. If a seeker can establish oneness between his soul and my soul, then I shall be always responsible for that particular human being. This is my soul's Assurance.</p>  </div>
