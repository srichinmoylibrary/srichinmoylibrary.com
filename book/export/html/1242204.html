<p>The Reverend George Pattison, Dean of King’s College Chapel, Cambridge University, invited Chinmoy to offer a talk about Sri Aurobindo and a Peace Concert in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Sri Aurobindo’s <em>Mahasamadhi</em>.</p>
<p>Chinmoy’s visit to Cambridge took place on November 1st, 2000. After attending evensong in the Chapel where Sri Aurobindo used to pray, Chinmoy offered the following talk and gave a Peace Concert in Keynes Hall.</p>
<p>This was the second time Chinmoy had been invited by the Dean to observe Sri Aurobindo’s most significant connection with Cambridge University.
