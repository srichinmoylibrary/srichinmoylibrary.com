<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, not at all. It is a matter of previous background and development. If one has been aspiring and meditating in previous lifetimes, then there is no reason why he cannot attain realisation on the strength of his aspiration in his present incarnation. Since we are all progressing towards realisation, in one incarnation or another, this realisation is bound to take place. As I said, it is a matter of the aspirant's spiritual development.</p>  </div>
