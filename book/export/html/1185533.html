<p>A young woman phoned up the police and said that she had lost her most expensive necklace. So the police started investigating. Half an hour later she phoned up the police and said that she had found her necklace inside her bedsheet. But the police said: “It is too late. We have already found two thieves. One has confessed and the other has returned your necklace. We are coming to give it to you.”</p>  </div>
