<p>Joe Michaels is really an impossibility-challenger. He is now running our 1,000-mile race after having suffered from so many heart attacks.</p>
<p>Today he was telling me, "You are supplying us with everything. It is a perfect day; everything is perfect!"</p>
<p>I said, "We are all aiming at perfection. That is why this race is happening."</p>
