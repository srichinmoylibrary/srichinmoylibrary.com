<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you dream of me, it is absolutely true that one part of my being or one emanation of mine is in touch with you. My physical mind may not know and need not know what is happening, but an inner existence of mine is definitely aware of it. And if something very important, serious, significant, dangerous, alarming or illumining has happened, then the emanation or inner being of mine is bound to bring the message into my physical mind either that morning or during the day. But if it is only the kind of divine nourishment that you usually get, then the being need not or will not bring it to my attention. When you dream of me, it is either because I knew of the situation previously and wanted you to have the dream so that you would know or do something special, or it is because of my soulâ€™s love for you.</p>  </div>
