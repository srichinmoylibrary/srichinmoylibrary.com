<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can use the term 'spiritual' in a broad sense to mean the reality that unites all human beings and all human aspirations. It means the reality that wants to fulfil us in a divine way. It means a better, more illumining way of life. The goal of the United Nations is to unite all nations and peoples. Real spirituality cannot be other than this: to see all human hearts and all human lives united in one supreme cause, which is to offer satisfaction to God's creation and God's Vision.</p>
