<p>If Sona sees Kanu with me, he becomes very jealous. He acts as if he were saying, “What right do you have to he with Kanu?”</p>
<p>Even if another person is holding Sona when I am holding Kanu, Sona barks and harks. Then, when he comes to me, he is satisfied.</p>
<p>But, generally speaking, when we got Kanu, Sona accepted his little brother right away. He has sincere affection for Kanu.</p>
<p>When human beings become jealous of someone, they do not maintain their real affection for that person. But dogs are not like that. My two dogs follow each other and play together. Even if Kanu bites Sona, Sona will only threaten him and growl. But he never bites Kanu.</p>
