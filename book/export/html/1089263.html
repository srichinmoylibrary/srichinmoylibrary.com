<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, sometimes they are reminiscences of previous lives. Also, if brothers and sisters are fighting in the family, or if people in the neighbourhood are fighting, the vibrations remain in the atmosphere. Then a child suffers because he is the feeblest, the weakest, in the family. Consciously he does not even know of these fights, but if his parents are fighting or if his brothers and sisters are fighting, these wrong vibrations enter into the child's consciousness, and the child suffers.</p>  </div>
