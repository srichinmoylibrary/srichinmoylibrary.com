  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: What is God’s favourite kind of humour?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God’s favourite humour is when He envisions something and it does not take place the way He wanted. God can do anything, He is omnipotent, but sometimes He uses the natural course. Then if the result on the physical plane, the earthly plane, is diametrically opposite, God enjoys it like anything.</p>
<p>Suppose God wants something to be done on the earthly plane and ignorance-forces delay it or give a totally different result. What does God do? He laughs and laughs. This is His favourite kind of humour. He knows He has omnipotent power, so He can easily do whatever He wants to do. But He has given very limited power to ignorance and to us. Naturally, ignorance never uses its limited power in the proper way and, therefore, the power of ignorance itself only increases.</p>
<p>In the case of human beings, quite often we receive the limited power that God gives us and, because we are truth-seekers and God-lovers, we are able to use the little freedom that He has given in a proper way. When God sees that we are using it properly, He is very pleased with us and He gives us more trust and more power.</p>  </div>
