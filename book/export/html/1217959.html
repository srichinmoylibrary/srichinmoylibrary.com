<p>To know the Truth, I shall have to be conscious of the Supreme. To possess the Truth, I shall have to stay with the Supreme. To become the Truth, I shall have to breathe in the Breath of the Supreme.</p>
<p>How can I serve the Supreme? By practicing His Thought. How can I reveal the Supreme? By practicing His Will. How can I fulfil the Supreme? By practicing His Truth.</p>
<p>My soul's aspiration cries for my Supreme, the Liberator. My life's breath cries for my Supreme, the Transformer.</p>  </div>
