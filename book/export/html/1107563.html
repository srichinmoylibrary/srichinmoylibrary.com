<p>We shall wait. We shall devotedly wait for the right hour. The right hour is the inspiration-hour.</p>
<p>We shall wait. We shall soulfully wait for the right place. The right place is our aspiration-heart.</p>
<p>We shall wait. We shall unreservedly wait for the right Master. The right Master is the Realisation-King.</p>
<p>We shall wait. We shall unconditionally wait for the right Goal. The right Goal is our constant and inseparable oneness with our Source, our Beloved Supreme, founded upon our soulful surrender to Him.</p>
<p>We shall wait. We shall wait in the Creator’s Silence-Beauty. We shall wait in the Creation’s sound-responsibility. We shall wait in Reality’s flower-fragrance. We shall wait in Divinity’s fruit-substance.</p>
<p>We shall wait. We shall be perfect strangers to teeming worries and anxieties. We shall find our roots anchored in God’s Patience-Light. We shall wait. We shall wait for our Beloved Supreme to whisper, “Come in, My sweet children.” We shall wait for our gratitude-heart to respond, “Beloved Supreme, we are all Yours. To please You in Your own Way is the birth, the continuation and the ever-transcending, ever-fulfilling experience of our soul’s journey.”</p>
<p>We shall wait. We shall wait and grow into God’s Compassion-Height.</p>
<p>We shall wait. We shall wait and glow in God’s Patience-Light.</p>
<p>We shall wait. We shall wait.</p>
