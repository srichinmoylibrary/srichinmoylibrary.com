<p><em>(Baroda. Charu Dutta's bungalow. Aurobindo spends a short holiday there. Charu Dutta, Lilavati and Subodh.)</em></p>
<p>CHARU: Chief, to our great good luck we have you with us to-day. This time I have something to confide to you. I have read your <em>Bhavani Mandir</em>. It has moved me to my depths. I have decided to give myself to the service of your great Ideal.</p>
<p>AURO: Very glad, godspeed.</p>
<p>SUBODH: We intend to open a National College in Bengal with you as the Head.</p>
<p>AURO: Believe me, I must go to Bengal if you sincerely want me there.</p>
<p>SUBODH: We hesitate to offer you a remuneration far beneath your notice. Still, poor Bengal would have a princely youth like you for the post.</p>
<p>AURO: My friend, to be able to serve the Mother is itself a high honour for any one.</p>
<p>SUBODH: Your sacrifice has ennobled your country. Your sacrifice will win her freedom.</p>
<p>LILAVATI: Ah, stop, Subodh. <em>(Turning to Aurobindo and handing him a little saloon rifle)</em> Come, Ghosh Saheb, take a hand.[fn:5]</p>
<p>AURO: <em>(Hesitatingly)</em> Sorry, Lilavati. I have never touched a gun. I know nothing about shooting.</p>
<p><em>(At repeated requests of Lilavati, Charu and Subodh, he takes the rifle. Charu explains to him the technique of aiming over a V-sight.)</em></p>
<p>No, Charu is too hasty. Lilavati, you stand by me.</p>
<p><em>(Aurobindo starts firing at the head of a match stick about twelve feet off from him. He repeats it several times, every time with success.)</em></p>
<p>LILAVATI: Ghosh Saheb, wonderful, unbelievable. You have mastered the art of shooting in a trice.</p>
<p>CHARU: If realisation in Yoga does not come to such a man, will it come to bunglers like you and me?</p>  </div>
