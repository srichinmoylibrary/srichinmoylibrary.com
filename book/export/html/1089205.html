<h2><em>Reporter:</em> What were you meditating on when you stood in front of the Peace Memorial?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I was meditating on peace and offering my prayers to God for those people who were killed during World War II. Hiroshima is now a place full of purity and inner beauty.</p>
<p><em>Reporter:</em> From now on, what kind of activities will you do for peace?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want peace, you must pray and meditate every day. Hiroshima is the city where unimaginable destruction took place. The old was destroyed, and now the new has been built. This experience of building the new should continue and continue forever here in Hiroshima.</p>
