<p>Nehru and Netaji Subhas Bose were at once friends and rivals. Then they became enemies. Tagore loved them both. We do not know if he loved them equally or not, but his love for them was genuine. On one occasion, Tagore invited both Netaji and Nehru to come and solve their problems at his Santiniketan, the Abode of Peace. They listened to his request and came to his place. Then Tagore said to them, “I know nothing about politics. I will be so grateful to both of you if you can solve your differences.” Tagore went on, “Please, please, talk and chat. I will be extremely happy if you leave the place with an amicable solution.” Then he left the room.</p>
<p>For three hours they talked and talked. Then they came to Tagore to say, “We have solved all our problems.”</p>
<p>When he heard this news, Tagore became the happiest, happiest person.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
