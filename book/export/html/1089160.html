<p>Now I wish to offer a soulful song to you, our most esteemed Brother-Friend, Mr. Matsumoto. This song I composed, and now some of my students from Japan, America, Canada and France will sing it. The song is written in Bengali, my mother tongue, so first I wish to read out the English translation.</p>

<p>Akishige Matsumoto,<br /> Ceaseless aspiration-fire you are!<br /> In you Japan has discovered<br /> Benevolence-fulness unparalleled,<br /> That sleeplessly shines<br /> In your life's meditation-light.<br /> O flower-blossomed heart of Japan,<br /> India has flung open her heart's door to you<br /> And is beckoning your<br /> aspiration-peace-flooded eyes<br /> And offering her soul's oneness-love.</p>
