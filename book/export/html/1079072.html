<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All those who have accepted the spiritual life are married to God. It is not only women like St. Theresa who are married to God. All, all, all those who have accepted God as their Master, all those who pray to God, are married to God. Here marriage means oneness. Marriage is not only oneness between two human beings, between man and woman; it is also oneness between God and man, oneness between the Creator and the creation. We are all creations of God. The creations and the Creator become one on the strength of love.</p>  </div>
