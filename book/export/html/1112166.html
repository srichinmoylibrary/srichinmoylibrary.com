<p>The manager at USAir is so nice! He has put in writing that I can come to walk or run there at any time.</p>
<p>The other day he saw me running, so he came up to me and said, "Sri Chinmoy, I am so happy you are using our airline."</p>
<p>Then I said to him, "I am so grateful to you."</p>
<p>He said, "You are coming every day and blessing us."</p>
<p>I said, "I wish to give you a piece of good news. Recently some students of mine from various parts of the world came to New York on your airline."</p>
<p>The manager answered, "I know! Dr. Agraha Levine gave me the list."</p>
<p>Then I talked to him about other things, including my meetings with President Gorbachev.</p>
