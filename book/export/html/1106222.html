<p>Jim Smith is dead against my using dumbbells. He said that using a dumbbell with one hand is not good, whereas barbells give better protection. You can see if anything is going to happen.</p>
<p>He was giving a demonstration with a 60 or 70-pound barbell. Then he wanted his best friend Agraha to come and join him. Agraha, poor fellow, was absolutely miserable. First Jim Smith requested him; then it became almost a command. So Agraha went to try.</p>
<p>First Jim Smith told him, “Now lift up the barbell to your knees.”</p>
<p>So Agraha lifted it up to his knees.</p>
<p>Then Jim Smith said, “Don’t look at me. Only look at my shoulders. Now you have to lift it to your shoulders!” The command was coming absolutely from the commander-in-chief. So Agraha lifted it up to his shoulders. Afterwards, his face was totally pale.</p>
<p>Then Jim Smith practically shouted at him, “Now you have to lift it over your head!” It was such a powerful command that Agraha did lift it over his head. They are such good friends!</p>
