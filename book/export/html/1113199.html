<p>Nolini-da said to me: "Chinmoy, today you have to do two things for me. First of all you have to find an article I have misplaced. This article is going to be included in the new edition of my book <em>Narir Katha,</em> which the Ashram Press is going to print. I don't remember the name of the article, but I am sure you will be able to find it."</p>
<p>I searched for fifteen minutes and found the article, which was entitled <em>E Juge Narir Adarsha.</em></p>
<p>"Now, your second task, Chinmoy, is to try to find the third part of <em>Matri Bani.</em> As far as I remember, I wrote it in a grey notebook."</p>
<p>I searched for the notebook in various places, ransacking all the drawer files and bookshelves. But <em>Matri Bani</em> was not to be found.</p>
<p>"Where could it have gone? Where could it have gone?" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>I said to him: "Nolini-da, perhaps you have given it to someone."</p>
<p>He concentrated for two minutes and then said: "No, definitely not! I have not given it to anyone. Look for it. You will find it."</p>
<p>He was right. In five minutes, to his great joy, I did find it.</p>  </div>
