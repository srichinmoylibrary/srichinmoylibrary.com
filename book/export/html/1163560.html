<p>Death, where are my<br /> Divine brothers,<br /> Sri Krishna and the Christ?<br /> Do you know anything<br /> About them?<br /> Did they enjoy your company?<br /> Did you enjoy their company?</p>
<p>"I hate your divine brothers.<br /> They did not say a word<br /> In my favour<br />   On earth.<br /> They spoke only of Eternal Life,<br /> My eternal enemy.<br /> But my big heart forgave them;<br /> I immediately showed them<br /> The way to the highest Heaven.<br /> I must say that<br /> Gratitude did not altogether<br /> Desert your divine brothers.<br /> The pride of the East<br /> And the pride of the West<br /> Both garlanded me<br /> Before they left me<br /> For their Father.<br /> Needless to say,<br /> Their Father and my Father<br /> Are eternally one<br /> And supremely inseparable."</p>
