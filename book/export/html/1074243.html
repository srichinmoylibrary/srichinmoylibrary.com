<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When two planets are not on good terms, when they are fighting, the earth consciousness usually changes for the worse. The inhabitants of earth don’t know why, but they are unexpectedly unhappy or depressed or frustrated.</p>
<p>When the year ends, the earth usually passes through a dark tunnel. It is all depression, frustration. Then, when the new year comes, it brings a new light. Definitely the planets have something to do with it.</p>
<p>Some good planets want the seekers to make fast progress in the new year which is on the earthly calendar. Other planets don’t want this. Human progress in no way can threaten the planets or take away any of their glory. Still, some don’t want to become one with the earth-consciousness. They don’t want human beings to make progress and become fulfilled.</p>  </div>
