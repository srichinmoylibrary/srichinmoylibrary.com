<p>The day before yesterday I was in a boutique in Woodstock, which is my most favourite town. As soon as I entered the store, the young girl in charge said with wide eyes, "Sri Chinmoy? Sri Chinmoy? I know you! I saw you for the first time when I was three years old in Flatbush. My mother lives in Brooklyn, and she has come to your meditations many times."</p>
<p>She gave me the store card and asked me to autograph it.</p>
<p>I said, "What is your name?"</p>
<p>She said, "You don't have to write down my name. Just write your name."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, but I would like to know your name."</p>
<p>She said, "Ayesha."</p>
<p>So I wrote, "Dear Ayesha, with my good wishes," and I signed it. She was so happy.</p>
<p>This world is so small. She used to live in the Flatbush area. I also used to live there. Now she is 16 or 17 years old and lives in Woodstock, which I have visited so many times over the past 24 years.</p>
