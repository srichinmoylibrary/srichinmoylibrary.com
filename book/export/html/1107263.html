<p>O my Pilot Beloved, there was a time when I felt the impossible. You are omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent; nevertheless, I felt Your excruciating pangs inside my unaspiring heart.</p>
<p>There was a time when I saw the impossible. I saw with my own eyes the cosmic gods becoming jealous of me, of my spiritual heights.</p>
<p>There was a time when I heard the impossible. I heard directly from the denizens of the higher worlds that Your complete manifestation will always remain a far cry.</p>
<p>Now there shall come a time when I shall eventually become the impossible. I shall become another perfect God, like You.</p>
