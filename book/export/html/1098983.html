<p>When I think of Sri Aurobindo's protection and the Mother's protection â€” how they protected me, protected me, protected me! Even now, I cannot imagine the extent of their protection. How badly I could have been hurt because of various incidents that occurred during my Ashram life. But time and again they saved me.</p>
<p>Speaking of protection, there was a very striking incident in the life of Dilip Kumar Roy, the Golden Voice. Once he and his friends were in the Kashmir region. They were driving in a car when they met with an accident. Everybody was thrown out of the car. All the other occupants of the car died, but Dilip was protected by Sri Aurobindo. Sri Aurobindo came with a kind of cushion and Dilip fell on Sri Aurobindo. Sri Aurobindo was there to protect him and Dilip remained alive. He had just joined the Ashram at that time.</p>  </div>
