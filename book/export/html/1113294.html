<p>Laljibhai handed a large envelope to Amrita-da for the Mother.</p>
<p>"Ah, it is a fine envelope. So big!" said Amrita-da.</p>
<p>"Since it is for the Mother, it must be sent properly," said Laljibhai.</p>
<p>"When it comes back from the Mother, it will be kept sacredly."</p>
<p>"Ah, Amrita-ji, you have become a poet. I said <em>properly,</em> and you said <em>sacredly.</em> It is a good rhyme. It seems that you have become a poet overnight."</p>
<p>"So you see how bright my future is! Unfortunately, nobody cares to know the poetic genius in me."</p>  </div>
