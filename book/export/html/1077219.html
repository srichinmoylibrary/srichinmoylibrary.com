<p>Life and sports cannot be separated; they are one. As a matter of fact, life itself is a game. This game can be played extremely well, provided the player develops consciously or unconsciously the capacity to invoke the transcendental energy which is always manifested in action. The present-day sportsmen, according to Zatopek, are neither aware of this nor doing the right thing. He says, "Sportsmen are like children; they don't know anything about life. They only know to train and compete. They meet only other athletes."</p>  </div>
