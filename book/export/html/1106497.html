<p>Today was my camera-disappointment day. One boy fixed the automatic camera, but he fixed it worse than before. I lifted my 1,300 pounds six times, but the camera ran out of film after the fourth lift. My fifth and sixth lifts are not there. Not only that, but while fixing the automatic camera he somehow knocked the video camera as well, so that I am not completely in the picture. My camera experiences never end.</p>
