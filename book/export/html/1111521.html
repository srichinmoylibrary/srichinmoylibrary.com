<p>During the five-mile race today a gentleman was ahead of me. All of a sudden he stopped and turned around and said, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?" I was panting and no words were coming out of me. So I gave him a smile.</p>
<p>He said, "You are Sri Chinmoy!" and he made a cross sign on his forehead — not on his chest. He was very happy to see me. Then he ran with me for about two hundred metres. But he felt that he was a better runner so he went ahead of me. I was just behind him.</p>
