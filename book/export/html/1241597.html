<p>The owner of one pet store is very, very nice to us. Always he will quote one price and I will quote another. Then he will say, “Can you not go a little higher?”</p>
<p>I will say, “No, I cannot go higher!”</p>
<p>Then he will tell me that he will give the pet to me at my price provided I keep it in a very large cage. He says he will come to my house the following week to see if I have provided a large cage for it. Otherwise, he says he will take it back.</p>
<p>Usually he brags about his monkeys and I brag about my monkeys. Once he sold us some flying squirrels.</p>
