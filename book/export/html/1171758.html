<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual Master represents light, while these wrong forces represent darkness. The spiritual Master has come into the world to change the nature of darkness. So from the point of view of these wrong forces, the spiritual Master is an enemy.</p>
<p>Ignorance is saying, "I am fast asleep. I am enjoying my life as it is." A spiritual Master will say to ignorance, "You can see the light, but you are ignoring it." Then ignorance says to the spiritual Master, "You stay with light. My darkness is my light."</p>
<p>Idle people do not do anything, but they are seeing in their idleness, in their laziness, their light. In that way, they are satisfied. Spiritual Masters are sent by God, they are commissioned by the Highest. God tells them, "You go and awaken the sleeping humanity." So spiritual Masters try to transform untold lives with their love, affection and light.</p>
<p>Ignorance forces feel that if they can come and attack and conquer the spiritual Master, then they will be able to enjoy their rest. If they can destroy the spiritual Master, then they will be able to continue their supremacy. The spiritual Master, on his part, believes that if he can transform ignorance, then it will be for the betterment of the whole world. This is the difference. The spiritual Master cares for the good of the world, whereas ignorance cares only for its own supremacy.</p>  </div>
