<p>Later that day, which was the day before the marathon, I took a cab and went to the marathon starting point. I was disappointed, frightened, to say the least, when I saw the whole course.</p>
<p>I said, "Since I came all the way, best thing is to die on the battlefield."</p>
<p>But when you are in the car, the battlefield is not a real battlefield. Only when you start running, when you are on the ground, is it a real battlefield.</p>
<p>When I saw it in the car, I still had a little hope that I would be able to manage it. Secretly I had a little hope that I would be able to finish it. O God, the actual day was something else!</p>
