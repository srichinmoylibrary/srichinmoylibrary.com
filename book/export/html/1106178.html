<p>There are many times when I say serious things by way of joke. I start with absurd jokes but, in the back of my mind, I know that reality and divinity are being consciously expressed in my joking manner, which almost borders on absurdity.</p>
<p>Two days ago, by way of a real joke — but I am saying that divinity was involved — I asked some disciples in my house how many of them had faith that I would one day be able to lift up 700 pounds with one arm. Most of them were silent, except for one or two. I didn’t want to embarrass them, but the monkey or donkey in me spoke. I said that if they had this kind of faith in my capacity, I would put them in a garbage bag, seal it and throw it out!</p>
<p>If my Beloved Supreme wants to use my right arm to lift up 700 pounds, He will — no matter how little faith my disciples have in me.</p>
