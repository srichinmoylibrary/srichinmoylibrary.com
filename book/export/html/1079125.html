<p>My Lord Supreme, my stupidity-mind wants me to speak to You. My wisdom-heart would like You to speak to me.</p>
<p>My Lord, my Lord, my Lord, I am praying to You this morning to command my mind not to dictate anything to me anymore.</p>
<p>My Lord, my Lord, my Lord, may my purity-heart and my oneness-heart lead me and guide me always to Your highest Heights and deepest Depths.</p>
