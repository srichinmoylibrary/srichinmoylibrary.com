<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The question itself is self-contradictory. When we use the term 'selfless service', we cannot and we must not expect anything. If it is devoted service, we can expect some reward; but when it becomes selfless, then we cannot expect any reward. When we are able to do real selfless service with no desire or expectation of reward, the result we shall get will be far beyond all our expectations. Also, during the performance of real selfless service, we get abundant joy. We don't have to wait for any result or aftereffect. Selfless service itself is the greatest joy and highest reward.</p>  </div>
