<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> By will and by God's Grace. Will itself is God's Grace. What we call will is actually God's Grace. In your family, perhaps your parents are not aspiring, your brothers or other members of your family are not aspiring. So how is it that you are praying and meditating? Just because God's Grace has descended and you have the receptivity to receive God's Grace. Without will, without determination, you can't do anything. But where do will and determination come from? They come from God, from the Supreme.</p>  </div>
