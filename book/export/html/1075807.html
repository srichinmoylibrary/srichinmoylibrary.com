<p><em>(Shanker Chetty's house. K.V. Rangaswamy Iyengar, the zamindar of Kodailam, comes to meet Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>K.V. IYENGAR: <em>(Bowing down)</em> I have come to place myself at your feet.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: How do you mean?</p>
<p>K.V. IYENGAR: My Guru while leaving us for his heavenly abode advised me to take spiritual help from you.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Me! How could he know of me?</p>
<p>K.V. IYENGAR: His words have come literally true.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: How?</p>
<p>K.V. IYENGAR: He said to me that a Purnayogi from the North would be coming to the South seeking refuge. Now that you are no more in the vortex of the country's politics and have come here for a life of seclusion, I am sure that you are that very Purnayogi.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(Giving a smile)</em> Is it so?</p>
<p>K.V. IYENGAR: I will come to you again with whatever help I can afford for your service. Pray give me your blessings. <em>(Bowing down he looks up at Aurobindo's face.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: My blessings are already with you.</p>  </div>
