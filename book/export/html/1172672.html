<p>Surrender first arises at the time of our meditation. Then this surrender permeates the entire being of the aspirant. Our meditation has to be completely conscious because what we need is conscious surrender. Conscious surrender is the easiest and most effective way to realise our deepest aspiration.</p>
<p>Before surrender becomes sincere, genuine and profound, the first thing that is required is peace of mind or, in spiritual terms, the calm mind. There are many types of mind: the quiet mind, the silent mind and the tranquil mind; but the calm mind is needed most. The calm mind creates a new and divine energy in us. When we consciously feel this new energy flowing from the top of our head to the bottom of our feet, at that moment we will get a glimpse of the Infinite in the finite. What we represent right now is the finite, but within us is the Infinite which we will consciously represent either in the near future or in the distant future. When we are aware of the divine energy flowing through us, then we can surrender ourselves without any personal effort. The very nature of this divine energy is to pull us into the strength of surrender. The energy itself is already strength but it serves to intensify the strength of surrender within us. This surrender is our oneness with our Highest. When we are in the physical, we surrender ourselves to the soul bit by bit, drop by drop. But when we are in the soul, we surrender our whole inner and outer life to the infinite Peace.</p>
<p>Human surrender, which is the conscious surrender of the aspirant, is something dynamic, progressive and fulfilling. If our meditation is conscious, then surrender comes easily. In surrender, our entire being sees the Light and wants to grow into the Light. So when we meditate, we should always try to feel that we are inspired and that we will consciously try to surrender. Only during meditation can we make the conscious effort of surrendering ourselves. Then a day will come when our conscious effort during meditation starts to bear fruit. We will see that our very existence will be crying daily for twenty-four hours with conscious aspiration.</p>  </div>
