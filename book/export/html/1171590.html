SCA 1102-1108. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on 4 January 1989.</p>
<h2>Question: One of the basic concepts in physics is that the amount of energy in the universe is constant. When you do weightlifting and you draw on spiritual energy, is that something that comes from the Beyond? And does this mean that the energy of the universe is not constant — that it can be expanded from the Beyond?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Energy is both constant and ever-expanding. I always use the term 'ever-increasing'. Infinity itself is ever-increasing. Our Beloved Lord Supreme is ever-increasing, which means He is progressing. Not only you and I are making progress, but God Himself is making progress. So the energy in the universe can be constant and, at the same time, it is going beyond and beyond. The Goal is ever-transcending. Energy is constant but, at the same time, it has no limit; we cannot confine it. It is expanding and expanding and expanding.</p>
<p>When I lift up a heavy weight, it is not that I am invoking a very large supply of energy to lift it. In my case, I do not invoke. I only concentrate and free my mind from all thought. You may think that when I breathe in before I lift, I am drawing energy from Above. No. At that time I am trying to keep my mind absolutely free of thought. That is the strongest power — not to have thoughts. I am keeping my mind shut from the outer world totally. Then, when I am keeping my mind silent, many times I will see my Mother Kali or the Supreme or something else. When the mind is silent, when there is nothing inside it, inside that nothingness is everything. But I do not invoke the Supreme or my Mother Kali as such. It is not that I am saying, "Please come, O God. Descend from Heaven." My Heaven is not somewhere else. It is inside my heart.</p>  </div>
