  <h1 class="book-heading">Love: sacrifice</h1>
  
 
<p>Fulfilment is nothing but voluntary sacrifice.</p>
<p>Where your sacrifice is, there will as well be your delight.</p>
<p>Sacrifice is fulfilment attained. Surrender is delight obtained. Love is union manifested.</p>
<p>Love is precious. Surrender is more precious. Union is still more precious.</p>
<p>Self-giving alone has free access to Joy everlasting.</p>
<p>It has been delightfully claimed that: “Love in France is a comedy; in England a tragedy; in Italy an opera serial and in Germany a melodrama.” In the true Indian tradition love has always been a self-offering and a self-fulfilment.</p>  </div>
