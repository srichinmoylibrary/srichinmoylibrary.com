<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some breathing exercises are of real help to meditation. But we should not exercise for an hour or two before we meditate. If we do, by the time we start our meditation, we will be totally exhausted and have no energy left or we will be unnecessarily agitated. If we do breathing exercises for five or ten minutes first, it will be of great help to our meditation. If we want to do more than that, then we should do the rest at some other time,</p>  </div>
