<p>You have to prove<br /> That you are sincere.<br /> You have to prove<br /> That you are pure.<br /> You have to prove<br /> That you are real.</p>
<p>How can you prove<br /> That you are sincere?<br /> Just see everything rightly,<br /> Feel everything timely,<br /> And say everything soulfully.</p>
<p>How can you prove<br /> That you are pure?<br /> Just feel that your inner purity's beauty<br /> And your soul's immortal duty<br /> Are inseparable friends.</p>
<p>How can you prove<br /> That you are real?<br /> Just tell yourself today, tomorrow and every day<br /> That you are of God alone<br /> And you are for God alone.</p>
