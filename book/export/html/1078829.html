<p>Am I a giver? Yes I am. Am I a cheerful and soulful giver? No, unfortunately I am not. That means I am offering not only my rose but also many, many thorns along with it.</p>
<p>Am I a giver? Yes I am. Am I a cheerful and soulful giver? No, unfortunately I am not. That means I am offering not only my hope-world but also my frustration-world along with it.</p>
<p>Am I a giver? Yes I am. Am I a cheerful and soulful giver? No, unfortunately I am not. That means I am offering not only my aspiration-free world but also my desire-bound world to all those who are around me.</p>
<p>How can I become a cheerful and soulful giver in order to liberate myself and liberate others? I can become a cheerful and soulful giver provided I can feel that a giver is he who is also a receiver. The greater a giver he is, the better a receiver he becomes. He gives because he feels that that is the only way to please the real in him, the soul. The real giver gives to the world his soul’s all-illumining beauty cheerfully and soulfully, and never, never does he give his body’s ugliness-dream.</p>
