<h2>United Nations Day</h2>

<p>On 24 October 1978 the Peace Meditation at the United Nations observed United Nations Day with a programme in the Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Auditorium. Sri Chinmoy made the following remarks on that occasion.</p>
<p>Today is U.N. Day. What does U.N. Day signify? It signifies a day of universal hope, a day of universal promise, a day of universal peace and a day of universal oneness. Hope brightens humanity's present deplorable fate. Promise encourages humanity's speed, which embodies success and progress. Peace enlightens humanity's age-old ignorance. And satisfaction, which is founded upon oneness, the oneness-family that we would like to live in, will one day dawn in our aspiring heart and our dedicated life.</p>
<p>To us, the United Nations is not a mere building, it is not a mere concept, it is not wishful thinking or even a dream. It is a reality which is growing, glowing and manifesting its radiance here, there, all-where, throughout the length and breadth of the world. All those who are sincerely crying for a oneness-family, according to their receptivity, are receiving light from the soul of the United Nations.</p>  </div>
