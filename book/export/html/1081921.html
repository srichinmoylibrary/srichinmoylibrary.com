<h2>Question: How do you define God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is beyond definition. But according to one's own vision or receptivity, one will define God in one's own way. Some will say that God is all Love. Others will say that God is all Power. Each one will see God according to his own necessity, his own receptivity and, finally, according to the way God wants him to see the ultimate Truth.</p>
<p>I see God with form and without form. I see Him as boundless Consciousness, limitless and endless Consciousness. Again, I see Him as energy, infinite energy. But usually I see the Supreme in the form of a most luminous, golden Being. When I converse with Him, I also see this form. I am extremely fond of this particular form. Here on earth, where we judge beauty with the human eye, we feel that a particular child is most beautiful. But I wish to say that the Supreme that I pray to and converse with is infinitely more beautiful than the most beautiful child on earth. Again, the same Supreme, who is my Beloved, who is my Pilot, may assume the formless form of infinite Light, Peace and Bliss. But I personally prefer the personal form.</p>
<p>Some people don't even like to use the term "God." The Buddha did not use the term "God." He used the term "Bliss," or "Nirvana." But we have to know that this transcendental Bliss is none other than God Himself. Inside this Bliss is divine perfection and satisfaction. If you want to call it Bliss, you can. And if you want to call it God, you can do that, too. Whatever gives you satisfaction is the right way for you.</p>  </div>
