<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just before the battle began, Yudhishthira did something most remarkable. He came and stood in front of the enemy and said, "If anybody from your side wants to join us, now is the time. We shall be very happy to have you."</p>
<p>Hearing these words, one of Duryodhana's own brothers came running and said, "My brothers are very bad. I want them to be killed! Please accept me on your side." This brother's name was Yuyutsu. He was born not to Gandhari but to a Shudra woman. At the end of the Battle of Kurukshetra, he was the only brother to remain alive.</p>  </div>
