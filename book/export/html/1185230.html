<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has a living Breath and the name of that Breath is man. Man has a living Goal and the name of the Goal is God. In God is man’s satisfaction, achievement and fulfilment. Through man is God’s Satisfaction, Achievement and Fulfilment. God needs man just as man needs God. God needs man to manifest Himself totally on earth. Man needs God to realise the Highest. We are His limbs: He is our body.</p>  </div>
