<p>In this volume of stories, the Indian spiritual Master Sri Chinmoy lucidly reveals many aspects of the relationship between Master and disciple. He creates in each story a living world in which the reader can readily experience the Master's unconditional love and the disciple's evolving aspiration.</p>
<p>Here Sri Chinmoy answers searching questions about the death of a devoted young disciple, the way to please one's Master and become close to him, the special concern of a Master for his black disciples.</p>  </div>
