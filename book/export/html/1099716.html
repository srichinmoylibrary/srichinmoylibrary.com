<p>Once someone brought a lawsuit against my father. It was a real joke! The man was unnecessarily harassing my father. The man who was supposed to defend my father was very close to our family. He came to our house before he and my father went to court and ate with us. But later at the court he went against my father.</p>
<p>This man died a few months later. He had a young son and a young daughter. There was nobody to look after them. My father said, "Once upon a time he was my friend. He could not remain my friend, but I have to prove that I was his friend." So my father paid for the son's and daughter's schooling. He even paid for the son to go to college. That fellow had brothers and other relatives, but they didn't care for his children.</p>  </div>
