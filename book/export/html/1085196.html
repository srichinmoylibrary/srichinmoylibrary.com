  <h1 class="book-heading">The pride of the cosmic gods</h1>
  
 
<p>Once Lord Shiva decided to destroy the worst possible demon, Tripura. Some of the cosmic gods wanted to help him in this great adventure. So one of them became his chariot, some became his horses, one became his charioteer, some became his arrows and one became his bow. Each god became something in order to help Lord Shiva.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, pride all of a sudden entered into these cosmic gods. The god who became the chariot said, "If I had not become the chariot, now Shiva would not be able to win." The god who became the charioteer said, "If I had not become the charioteer, Shiva would not be able to win." The god who became the bow said, "If I had not become the bow, Shiva would not be able to win." Each cosmic god felt that he was indispensable.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Lord Shiva smiled and said, "You fools, do I need you? If you serve me devotedly, then indeed I need you. But I don't need you with your pride. You stay with your pride. I can do the needful all by myself. Look what my third eye can do."</p>
<p>Immediately Shiva opened up his third eye and destroyed Tripura. Then he turned to the cosmic gods, "Your service I badly need only when you offer it soulfully and devotedly. But when pride enters into you and you feel that you are indispensable, then I wish to tell you that you are millions and billions of miles away from the discovery of Truth. O so-called helpers of mine, give what you have; give what you are. Give what you have soulfully, give what you are unreservedly. Then you will see what you become: a torrent of Delight, ceaseless and immortal."</p>
