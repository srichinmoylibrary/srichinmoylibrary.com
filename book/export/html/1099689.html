  <h1 class="book-heading">The cycle-rickshaw rogue</h1>
  
 
<p>Now I will tell another rickshaw experience. This was a cycle rickshaw. As you know, cycle rickshaws are much easier to drive and they go much faster than the old-fashioned hand-drawn rickshaws. The hand-drawn rickshaws are made of wood and they are quite primitive, but the cycle rickshaws are made of metal and they go much faster.</p>
<p>The driver of the cycle rickshaw was such a clever fellow. He wanted to kill time, so he would cycle for about 50 or 60 metres, and then he would jump off and start dragging the rickshaw.</p>
<p>I said, “Why are you doing this? Can you not pedal with your legs?”</p>
<p>He said, “No, you are very heavy. I have to pull it by hand.”</p>
<p>I said, “According to you I am very heavy. Perhaps it is true. But I know that this kind of rickshaw can take two persons. I am definitely not as fat as two persons. I do not have the weight of two human beings. I know the real reason why you are doing this.”</p>
<p>He said, “Why?”</p>
<p>I said, “Because you want to kill time. If you do this, you will take more time and I will have to pay more.”</p>
<p>The driver was wearing a wristwatch. I had asked him to take me around the circumference of Pondicherry. I know the route so well. It is only three miles. In an hour easily we could have come back. But the driver was playing a trick. He did not want to go all around, so he would pedal for 50 or 60 metres, and then he would start wasting time and walk slowly. So in an hour, I could not cover even one mile. Can you imagine? This is how he took time. Even while walking he was saying he was so tired, so exhausted.</p>
<p>Finally, I got disgusted and asked him to take me back to the starting point, our house.</p>  </div>
