<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, we should not worry! We should have implicit faith in God our Inner Pilot or in our spiritual Master. We have to feel that God knows what is best for us and He will do what is best for us. We worry because we do not know what is going to happen to us tomorrow, or even the next minute. As long as we feel responsible for our own life, we will always be worried; we will not know how to properly utilise even two minutes a day of our time. But if we can feel that there is Someone who thinks of us infinitely more than we think of ourselves, and if we can consciously offer the responsibility for our life to Him, saying, "Eternal Father, Eternal Mother, You be responsible for what I do and say and grow into," then our past, present and future become His problem.</p>
<p>Right now we feel that if we do not do something for ourselves, then there will be nobody to do it. But this is not true. There is Someone who will do everything for us and that is our Inner Pilot â€” provided we consciously surrender to His Will. The reason we suffer is because we do not surrender to His Will. When we consciously surrender to His Will, we feel that He is the Doer and that we are only His instrument. At that time we will not worry or be afraid of our destiny, for we will know and feel that it is in the all-loving Hands of God, who is doing everything in us, through us and for us.</p>
<p>So let us consciously offer our very existence, what we have and what we are, to God. What we have is the aspiration to grow into the very Image of God, into infinite Peace, Light and Bliss. And what we are right now is ignorance, the ignorance-sea. If we can offer our aspiration-cry and our ignorance-sea to God, then all our problems will be solved.</p>
