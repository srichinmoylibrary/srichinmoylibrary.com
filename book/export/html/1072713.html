<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No matter what degree of refinement we have achieved, we cannot experience delight in its pristine beauty and immortality. It is through expanding and heightening our consciousness that we experience delight. We can precipitate the experience of delight only by increasing our unconditional self-giving and our conscious feeling that the Supreme loves us infinitely more than we love ourselves.</p>  </div>
