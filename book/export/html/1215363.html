<p>This afternoon I was walking on the right side of the Grand Central Parkway. An elderly couple was walking ahead of me with their little granddaughter. Both of them were about eighty years old and she was seven or eight years old. The three of them were blocking the pavement. I could not walk by them. I was approaching quite fast, but they were blocking the way.</p>
<p>When I came near them, the little one saw me and moved aside so that I could pass. As I went by, she said to me, "Sir, please walk slowly! You are frightening my grandfather."</p>
<p>So I started walking slowly. I passed by them and I could have resumed my former speed, but I listened to her request. I continued walking slowly the rest of the way home!</p>
