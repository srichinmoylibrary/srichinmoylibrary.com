<p>Our Beloved Supreme is always ready to lead us, but it is we who have to cultivate the desire to follow Him. Our Beloved Supreme is always eager, more than eager, to make us feel that He loves us constantly, but it is we who have to cultivate the willingness to believe Him.</p>
<p>Our Beloved Supreme is always ready to help us fight against ignorance-night. but it is we who have to feel the real necessity to be in wisdom-light and not in ignorance-night. If we want wisdom-light, then only shall we accept His Service.</p>
<p>Our Beloved Supreme is always ready and more than eager to cry for us to attain the highest Reality-Height, but He expects in return just a little soulful smile from us. If we do not offer Him a little soulful smile, then He will not be able to create a receptivity-vessel within us. If we do not have a receptacle within us, then when He cries for us, we will not be able to see Him crying or feel His cry. So what we need is a receptivity-vessel when He cries. This receptivity-vessel is nothing short of an echo-reality, for His cry has to echo and re-echo in the inmost recesses of our hearts. This is what our Beloved Supreme longs for from us, so that He can cry and cry from His own ever-transcending Heights only for our salvation, liberation, realisation and perfection â€” for us, only for us.</p>
