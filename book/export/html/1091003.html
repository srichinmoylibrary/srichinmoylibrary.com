<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to get the fruits of your meditation is to feel that the result, the fruit itself, is a fulfilling experience. This fulfilling experience, in the outer terms, may come in the form of failure or in the form of success. But you will see that it will help you whichever form it takes. It will create one more rung in the ladder, and help you climb to the Highest.</p>
<p>You do something and you get the fruit, either bitter or sweet. Now even when you get a bitter fruit, you have to feet that this bitter fruit will give you an experience necessary for your perfection And if you get a sweet fruit, a delicious fruit, then you can feel that it is also leading you toward your perfection. This is the best way to receive and achieve the fruits of your meditation.</p>  </div>
