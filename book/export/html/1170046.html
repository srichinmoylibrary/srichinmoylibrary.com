<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your first grade teacher still remembers you well because he thinks and feels that you have grown in terms of years, but not in terms of wisdom-light. Therefore, he is eagerly waiting for you and expecting for you and expecting you to continue studying with him. Although you know who your first grade teacher was, you perhaps may have forgotten his name. His name is ignorance-hunger.</p>  </div>
