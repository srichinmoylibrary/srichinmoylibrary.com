<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If geography separates you from your country, you can offer your good will to the soul of your country. You are from South Africa. Do you think that your good will, your love, your concern in the inner world will not enter into the soul of South Africa? When an individual who is working in America gets a letter from his mother in India, his whole face changes, his whole consciousness changes. He swims in the sea of his mother's affection and love, and immediately gratitude grows inside his heart; he becomes gratitude itself. Even when he does not receive a letter, how many times his mother's consciousness enters into him when she thinks of him with her boundless love and concern. The mother may be far away and busy with many projects, but she constantly feels the existence of her son inside her heart, and vice versa.</p>
<p>If you really love your country, geographically you may remain far away, but spiritually your mother-country can be inside you and you can be inside your mother-country. This feeling is not an illusion or a product of the imagination. Far from it! From the inner world everything comes to the outer world. The moment you think of your mother's love and concern for you, immediately you create a divine world of your own. Inside that world you feel the existence of your dearest mother. And when your mother thinks of you with all her affection, love, concern and blessings, she immediately creates a world of her own where you exist inside her heart.</p>
<p>It is not the outer location but the inner feeling that is important. Where real concern exists, where real love exists, there the bond of oneness, inseparable oneness, reigns supreme. The son can stay in any part of the world and the mother can stay in any part of the world, but the bond of oneness inside their hearts can be felt at every moment. The mother will see the fulfilment of her existence inside the son no matter where he is. And the son will feel his success, his progress and the meaning and purpose of his life inside his mother.</p>  </div>
