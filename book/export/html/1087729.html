<p>There are two kinds of compassion: one is called human compassion and the other is called divine Compassion. In human compassion we often see quite a few undivine things. We see the exaggeration of one's false capacity. That is to say, while showing compassion, one deliberately and consciously overestimates his true inner feeling for somebody else. Everybody says that he is compassionate, but there is great deception in his compassion. It is not actually compassion that he is offering to the needy, but an overestimated opinion of himself.</p>
<p>In the matter of compassion, very often man is fooling himself. He says he is compassionate to so-and-so. But there is a form of inner weakness in him that is either not allowing him to open to the Light, or not allowing the victim to open to the Light. How can a human being, unless and until he has abundant inner light, show compassion to a sufferer? A blind man cannot show light to another blind man.</p>
<p>But again, inside a human being divine Compassion can and must exist. This divine Compassion is spontaneous Delight. In it there is no feeling of separativity, no feeling that one is superior and the other is inferior. No! It is a feeling of oneness. Delight unites us and the sufferer whom we are going to help.</p>
<p>Whenever an aspirant says that he is offering compassion to his fellow beings, he has to know if it is really Delight that he is giving or something else. If he feels that he is superior, that he has something unusual, something extraordinary to offer, then he is mistaken. He has to feel that it is Delight that he is offering. Delight he has and the other person also has. But right now the other person's Delight is not operating, while his is operating.</p>
<p>From now on let us try to feel that the divine Compassion means the divine Delight, and that human compassion is very often treacherous and full of self-deception. Let us try to use only the divine Compassion in and through our life.</p>  </div>
