<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For a seeker, one quality is enough in his own life and that is gratitude. And in God's Life one quality is also enough, and that is God's Compassion. God's Compassion encompasses all His divine qualities, and the seeker's gratitude encompasses all his divine qualities. So if one wants to feel the presence of all his divine qualities, then he has to look in his gratitude. And if he wants to feel all the divine qualities of God, then he can easily find them in God's Compassion. If one wants to see all God's good qualities or all one's own good qualities individually, one can easily do that too. But if one wants to see one good quality which embodies all the good qualities, then in God's case it is His Compassion and in man's case it is his gratitude.</p>  </div>
