<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am also lucky to have them.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Of course, how many more of them are there?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have about seven hundred students.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Seven hundred! He works only in astronomical numbers! How many paintings? It was one hundred thousand last year.</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> One hundred and thirty thousand.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> You mean he has painted thirty thousand pictures since that celebration of one hundred thousand! I wish I could have attended that night, but I couldn't. Our meeting had to be put off until today. What a perfect day it is today! It's the first day of spring. It has been so many years since the first day of spring has looked like the first day of spring. I can't remember how long â€” at least ten years since we have had a perfect March 21. And it was Bach's birthday last night and it's my mother's birthday tomorrow. So Bach and you and my mother and all these beautiful kids, and spring: God, that's too much!</p>
<p>Where are you going to sit? Sit down on the floor somewhere. Please rest yourselves for a minute. I cannot bear you all standing so. That's better. While we are waiting for Peter to set up, let's be silent together.</p>
