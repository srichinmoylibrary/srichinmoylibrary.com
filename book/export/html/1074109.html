<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely, definitely. When a pioneer does something, that means a new dream has blossomed on earth because of him. He opens the door for others to come in. Those who do the same thing later have the advantage of knowing that somebody else has done it. The one who has no predecessor has to be remembered because he has accepted the challenge of something most difficult. It is like climbing up the Himalayas. He should be given credit. Afterwards, people may do it more easily; they may break his records, but definitely he deserves the credit.</p>  </div>
