<p>Once a great many sages and seers assembled in the Himalayas. Because of their vast wisdom, they were very heavy. It was not their physical bodies, but their wisdom that was heavy. So many sages had gathered together with their wisdom that the earth began to sink.</p>
<p>Because the great sage Agastya's wisdom was the heaviest, the other sages requested that he leave the Himalayas, which are in the North, and go to the South. Agastya agreed and with his boundless knowledge and wisdom he went to the South.</p>
<p>Agastya is very well known in South India. It was he who brought science and literature to that part of India. It was he who introduced Tamil grammar. He excelled in astrology, magic, sorcery and many things.</p>  </div>
