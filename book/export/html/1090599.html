<p>[Matsyendranath's ashram. Enter Matsyendranath and Gorakshanath.]</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: My son, you have now equalled me in spirituality. You have inner peace, light and bliss in boundless measure. I want you to leave my ashram and open one of your own.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: <em>[bursting into tears]</em> Master, Master, this can never be! I can never leave you, and I shall never leave you. You are my life.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Son, two lions cannot live in the same den. We should not stay together now. You should now roam somewhere else. You have the capacity to guide world-souls as I am guiding them. Now you must use it. You are not getting the opportunity to flourish here.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, who wants to flourish? Not me! Not in the least! I came into the world to serve you, not to equal you. It was your mistake that enabled me to equal you.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Whether it was my mistake or your tremendous capacity that has enabled you to equal me is not the question. You have equalled me, and now it is God's Will that you should serve Him by inspiring and guiding other souls. The world badly needs a Master of your calibre. Now go, my son. This is my soulful demand and command. If you really love me then you will obey my command. After six years you may come back and pay me a visit.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, I shall obey you although my heart is crying and bleeding within me. Please bless me once more before I depart.</p>
<p><em>[Matsyendranath blesses Gorakshanath.]</em></p>
<p>Although I shall not see you outwardly, please do not forget me. I shall come back in six years.</p>
<p><em>[Exit Gorakshanath.]</em></p>  </div>
