<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> It is now so clear to me that<br /> You do not care for me.<br /> My Lord, You do not care for me.<br /> Is it because my mind is insincere?<br /> Is it because my heart is impure?<br /> Is it because I criticise You<br /> Inwardly and outwardly every day?<br /> Or are there some other reasons<br /> Why You do not care for me?</p>
<p>"My child, if it is true that<br /> I do not care for you,<br /> Then it is not because of<br /> your mind's insincerity,<br /> Not because of your heart's impurity,<br /> Not because of your cruel criticism of Me,<br /> But because you dare to live<br /> And do succeed in living<br /> Without My Heart's Compassion,<br /> Love, Blessing and Light."</p>
