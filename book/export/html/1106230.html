<p>Last night a few boys were over at my house for Sahishnu’s birthday. Everybody was predicting when I would lift 2,000 pounds. They all said I would do it today. Dhanu and Achyuta were the only ones who didn’t make any predictions.</p>
<p>Some were saying that I would do it at 1:30 in the morning. I told them that I would not try before 4:30 because I was so tired and exhausted, but still they thought I would try right away.</p>
<p>Some predicted times that were only 10 minutes after Unmilan and others finished building the new power rack.</p>
<p>Sahishnu’s prediction was the closest. He said I would lift 2,000 pounds at 7:37 a.m.</p>
<p>This morning at 4:30, I started doing my usual endless weightlifting exercises. Then, at around a quarter to seven, I started attempting to lift 2,039. It was over 500 pounds heavier than my previous best lift, 3 days ago. My fifth attempt was my best performance. After my fifth attempt, I looked at the time and saw it was 7:40. So Sahishnu’s prediction was the best.</p>
<p>Ketan was the farthest away. He said I would do it at 9:00.</p>
