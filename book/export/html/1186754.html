<p>If you are working only to become<br /> A great autocrat,<br /> Then you will eventually find yourself<br /> On a doubt-frustration-journey.<br /> But if you are working to become<br /> A choice instrument of God,<br /> To serve Him in His own Way<br /> At His choice Hour,<br /> Then God will definitely allow you to enjoy<br /> His Eternity's Self-Transcendence-Journey.</p>
