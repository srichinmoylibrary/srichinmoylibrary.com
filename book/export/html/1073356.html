<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to cry inwardly. Here in the ordinary world, if a child cries for a piece of candy, his parents will give it to him. Similarly, if we cry inwardly and soulfully for Peace. Light and Bliss, then the one who has it, God, will give it to us. When a human child cries for something, his human parents are in a position to supply him with it. In the case of a seeker, God is the Parent. He is divine and immortal and He has everything in infinite measure. When we cry for something with a real inner need, if our cry is sincere and genuine, naturally He will give it to us.</p>  </div>
