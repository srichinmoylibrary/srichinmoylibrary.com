<p>The registration place was the Holiday Inn in Miami. Savyasachi told me that Bill Rodgers was in the hall, so I got out of the car, thinking, "Let me say hello to him." He was just going out to run and was holding some running shoes.</p>
<p>I said, "Hello. Tomorrow you will be running?" He said, "Yes." I said, "I wish you the best of luck. Someday I wish you to go under two hours. Tomorrow I want you to be first and to go back to your highest glory."</p>
<p>He looked at me and said, "How I wish I could! "</p>
<p>I said, "Tomorrow you will try to do it. Do you recognise me?"</p>
<p>He said, "Yes." He was looking into my eyes very intensely and soulfully. He said, "Sri Chinmoy."</p>
<p>Again I smiled at him and he smiled at me. He thanked me and I thanked him.</p>
