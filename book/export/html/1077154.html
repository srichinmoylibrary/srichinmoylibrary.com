<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you take one drop from the vessel of love, then doubt is bound to come, insecurity is bound to come, jealousy is bound to come. Let the tumbler be full to the brim with water. Then, I tell you, there can be no problem. But take away just one drop of love, and then that particular part of the ocean will be filled with something undivine. When you take out one drop, immediately doubt or jealousy or insecurity or something will enter there. Immediately everybody wants to go and station himself there. But if you are already filled with light, then how can they come in?</p>  </div>
