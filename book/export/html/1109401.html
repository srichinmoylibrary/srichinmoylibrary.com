<blockquote>
<p>"To choose time is to save time."</p>
<p>â€” Bacon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a most significant statement. Now, why do we choose time and how can we choose time? We can choose time by loving time. How can we love time? We can love time by meditating constantly on our life's promise to God. What is our life's promise to God? Our promise is that God's Light divine will grow and glow in human life.</p>
<p>What happens when we save time? Opportunity knocks at the door of possibility, and possibility knocks at the door of inevitability. Possibility says to opportunity while opening the door, "My child, you are wise." Inevitability says to possibility while opening the door, "My child, you are no longer your searching soul. Today you have become your fulfilling Goal."</p>  </div>
