<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is not only in the mind; God is the mind itself. But we have to know what kind of mind we are speaking of. If it is the physical mind, the earthbound mind, the mind that cherishes and treasures jealousy, meanness and impurity, this is not the mind that can be of any help in our search for God. The mind that is as wide and vast as the sky, the mind that accepts and loves the entire world, is the real mind. Inside that mind God functions most satisfactorily. So we have to know which mind you are referring to.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> So you're saying that the person who thinks in a positive way, the person who thinks in a way that is honest and sincere and concerned about all the people in the world, that person is using the mind in a spiritual way?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes.</p>
<p><em>Caller:</em> But they say that God is a jealous God.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> That's a very good religious point. What about when they say that God is a jealous God?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is jealous only for those who have not experienced God the Supreme Beloved, God the Eternal Compassion, God the Eternal Friend.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> So you're saying that God is a friend?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is our Eternal Friend and our only true Friend.</p>  </div>
