<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What you call evil, that very thing I call ignorance. There is a great difference between ignorance and evil. Ignorance is an experience that ultimately will lead us to a higher truth. We go from lesser light, to greater light, to greatest light. What you call evil and sin are actually experiences of bondage and imperfection. Evil is in our mind. In our aspiring heart there is no such thing as evil. What the mind sees as evil, the heart sees as imperfection. And this imperfection can easily be perfected when we pray to God for light, peace and bliss.</p>
