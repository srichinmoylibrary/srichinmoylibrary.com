<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here we have to be sincere. Sometimes it is not actually delight that descends; it is only a kind of pleasure that enters into the seeker from the vital world which he mistakes for delight. This so-called delight naturally cannot and does not last for a long time. The real delight within us knows perfectly well that this is a false delight that is trying to please and satisfy the human in the aspirant, so the real delight comes and pushes aside the false delight. Now, the seeker may have identified himself to such an extent with the first kind of delight that when it leaves him, he feels sad and miserable. When this pleasure goes away, a kind of frustration comes, and in frustration, dissatisfaction looms large.</p>  </div>
