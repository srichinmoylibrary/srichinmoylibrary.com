<p>Yesterday in Flushing Meadow Park a group of black and white girls were playing with a doll on the grass. I was running by on the street when all of a sudden one of the black girls came into the street. She was quite fat and short, and she stood blocking my way and showing her muscles. I stopped running and went two metres to the right, and then I started running again. How she was flexing her muscles!</p>
