<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ultimately he will become an expert. Learning meditation is like learning anything else. One cannot become an expert overnight. Sometimes he will do extremely well, sometimes he will do very badly. But if he continues to study, to practise, he will become an expert eventually.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> So in meditation you have to practise?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Practice is necessary in every sphere of life.</p>  </div>
