<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, not only godparents, but anybody can enhance the spirituality of somebody else by prayer and meditation. And if they are godparents, it means they have already taken some responsibility for their godchildren. So naturally their prayer is bound to be fulfilled, provided they are sincere in their prayer. When somebody is already connected to someone, and he is anxious to be of service to that other person, naturally the connection will enhance his ability to serve. You will always try to give more light to the persons you love. Since godparents definitely love their godchildren, their own spiritual practice, without fail, will enhance the spirituality of their godchildren. It is not only possible, but inevitable.</p>  </div>
