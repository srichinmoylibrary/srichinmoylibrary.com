<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can help a person to remember a thing or an incident by doing two things. First, you can tell him that he is not the forgetful mind but the all-remembering soul that knows the Beginning's beginning and the ever-transcending End. You can consciously pray to the Supreme to grant your dear one the capacity to have a new mind, a new mental receptivity, a new mental awakening.</p>  </div>
