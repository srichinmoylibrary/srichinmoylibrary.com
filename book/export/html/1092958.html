  <h1 class="book-heading">George Frederic Handel</h1>
  
 
<p>When the composer is surcharged with the inspiration, aspiration and dedication of the transcendental Heights, it goes far beyond the body-boundary. He brings down Immortality's delight and shares it with the world at large. He becomes the pioneer of earth's Heaven-climbing journey.</p>
<p>On composing the Hallelujah Chorus, Handel tells us: "Whether I was in my body or out of my body as I wrote it, I know not. God knows."</p>
<p>God the Doer chooses His choicest instrument to reveal Him and manifest Him on earth in an unprecedented manner.</p>  </div>
