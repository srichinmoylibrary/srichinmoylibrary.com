<p>In Japan I announced that I was going to write 27,000 more poems. Just as God-realisation never ends, my self-torture also does not end. In Japan I completed 1,500 poems for <em>Ten Thousand Flower-Flames,</em> and by August I plan to have all 10,000 completed. Then that will be followed by <em>Twenty-Seven Thousand Aspiration-Plants.</em></p>
<p>Not only in the evening of my life but actually on the last day of my life perhaps I will be writing poems. Will you read them? Get ready! In August I will start the new series, but I will go very slowly — at bullock-cart speed.</p>
