<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that time I often feel that you are all pilgrims and I am the leader. We are all enjoying the pilgrimage. I am walking along Eternity's Road, and you are all following me. On the outer plane, you are all waiting in place for my blessings, but actually I see your souls following me while I am walking.</p>  </div>
