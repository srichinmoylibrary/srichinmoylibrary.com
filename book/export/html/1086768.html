<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are afraid of death because you feel that death is your enemy. If you feel that death is neither your friend nor your enemy, but just a casual acquaintance, he cannot harm you. If you don't pay attention to him, he will not bother you. You are going toward death and he is coming toward you. You will pass by death and death will pass by you, but if you stop to talk, then he will snatch you up.</p>  </div>
