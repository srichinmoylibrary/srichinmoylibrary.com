<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Already there have been quite a few extremely good leaders. Some of these leaders got the opportunity to lead, while others did not. If there is a need for more leaders, then the Supreme will definitely grant the United Nations more leaders. But if the present leaders already have the capacity and if others are praying for the capacity in their own way, then the goal of the United Nations will not always remain a far cry and there is no need for the Supreme to grant the United Nations more leaders.</p>
