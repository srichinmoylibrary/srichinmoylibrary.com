<blockquote>
<p>I have said that we have replaced the life of the jungle by the rule of Law. We must now replace the rule of Law by the rule of Love.</p>
<p><em>Towards the Rule of Love</em> <em>by Ranasinghe Premadasa</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Replacement must always be done with something infinitely better. This is what our inner voice tells our outer mind. But, alas, quite often we do not pay any heed to it. Usually we prefer not to change. But once we make a positive change, we see how much we have advanced along the progress-road of life. When the power of love replaces the love of power, man will have a new name: God.</p>  </div>
