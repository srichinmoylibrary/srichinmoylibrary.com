<p>The date of his birth is controversial.<br /> The soul of the earth says:<br /> "He was born on August 27, 1931."</p>
<p>The heart of the earth says:<br /> "He was born on August 30, 1931."</p>
<p>The vital of the earth says:<br /> "He was born on August 27, 1936."</p>
<p>The mind of the earth says:<br /> "He was born on August 27, 1938."</p>
<p>The body of the earth says:<br /> "He was born on August 27, 1950."</p>
<p>God says:<br /> "He was born twice:<br /> Once before the beginning of Life<br /> in the Heart of Silence,<br /> Once after the end of Death<br /> in the Head of Sound."</p>
