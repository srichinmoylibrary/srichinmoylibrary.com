<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes the problem is solved, but sometimes without solving the problem I throw the pain away. The problem is not solved, but I don’t want to suffer anymore. Sometimes an individual’s problem starts on the physical or mental plane The physical pain I take. If I have to tell the person, he will not believe it. He will say that the doctor or nature has cured him. So where do I stand? The more I keep it in the physical, the less the person suffers. I keep it so that the person will not suffer. But sometimes it goes on and on.</p>  </div>
