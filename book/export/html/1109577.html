<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this world there are good people and bad people. In God's creation there is day and there is night. But I am not in a position to say who are good teachers and who are bad teachers. Only I wish that the sincere seekers will get the good teachers. If they are really sincere, they will not remain with false teachers.</p>  </div>
