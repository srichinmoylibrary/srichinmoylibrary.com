    <title>Question: If you have realised &lt;em&gt;atman&lt;/em&gt;, do you also realise &lt;em&gt;brahman&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;paramatman&lt;/em&gt;?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> <em>Atman</em> is the soul and <em>paramatman</em> is the Self. When Shankara speaks about the <em>paramatman</em>, he means the great Self, the Self without a second, which is beyond the entire universe. <em>Atman</em> is the small self, the individual soul. The small self, the individual soul, is part and parcel of the <em>paramatman</em>. Nothing can exist apart from the <em>paramatman</em>. Let us say that <em>paramatman</em> or <em>brahman</em> is like the ocean. If you enter the water at any one place, you are entering into the ocean itself. You will not say that you have entered into only one tiny part of the ocean.</p>
<p>So if you know yourself, if you know what you are, if you live perpetually in the soul, then immediately you become consciously aware of God and of your inner existence. If you know what you are, only then can you know about the Source; if you know the soul, <em>atman</em>, only then can you know the source of <em>atman</em>, which is <em>paramatman</em>. They are one. If you know the son well, then through the son you can know the father. And similarly, if you know the father well, then you can know the son. If you live a divine life and enter into your own soul, which is the representative of the Absolute, then naturally you will come to know <em>paramatman</em> and <em>brahman</em>.</p>  </div>
