<p>Then I saw a pair of white, plastic sandals in another store. I said, "These are very nice." But when I went to look, I saw that they were not actually a pair. They were two different sizes. One was size eight and one was size six.</p>
<p>I took the sandals to the shopkeeper and asked her to give me either a six or an eight, since she didn't have seven or seven and a half. She said that she only had this one pair of sandals. She said, "No, you take these."</p>
<p>Was I going to buy one size six and one size eight? Naturally, I didn't buy them. That was my second experience.</p>  </div>
