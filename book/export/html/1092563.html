<blockquote>
<p>"A woman must be a genius to create a good husband," so said Balzac. What does Tagore say on this subject? "It is a wonder that girls are eager and zealous to develop their talents only before their marriage, after which they remain solely busy with their household affairs." â€” Translated from <em>Alapahari Rabindranath</em> by Rani Chandra</p>
