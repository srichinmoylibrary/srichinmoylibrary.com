<p>Subhas was saddened and angered by Nehru's criticism-volleys. He responded with unsheathed sincerity-parries and power-thrusts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What is the use of your sitting in Allahabad and uttering words of wisdom which have no relation to reality? ...</p>
<p>"Regarding Bengal, I am afraid you know practically nothing. During two years of your presidentship you never cared to tour the province, though that province needed your attention much more than any other, in view of the terrible repression it had been through."</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
