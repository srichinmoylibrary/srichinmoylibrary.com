<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation undoubtedly helps to expand the silence within ourselves. Meditation is like an inner flashlight. When you enter into a dark room with a flashlight, immediately the room is illumined. When we enter with our meditation into our subconscious, unconscious, or even inconscient parts, immediately we feel that Light has dawned. And when the Light dawns, immediately the Divinity, which is the silence within us, gets the opportunity for expansion, universal expansion.</p>  </div>
