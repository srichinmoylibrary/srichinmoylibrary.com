<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As an ordinary human being, we have very limited free will. But if we become a sincere seeker, then we will be surcharged eventually with an adamantine will. Now we are like a cow that is tied to a pole. There is a point beyond which we cannot go, but within these confines we have free will. The higher we go or the deeper we go, the more our capacity increases. When we can listen to the dictates of the soul, or when we can bring the soul forward to illumine our vital, our mind and our gross physical, then our will becomes boundless. At that time, our individual will unites itself with the universal Will within us. When the universal Will becomes our will, at that time our freedom is infinite. Although we have free will to a very limited extent right now, this free will can be increased in infinite measure.</p>  </div>
