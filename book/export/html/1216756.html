<p>As you know, a very nice article came out about me in <em>The Illustrated Weekly of India,</em> which is like America's <em>Time</em> magazine. The following week an Indian wrote four or five lines highly appreciating that article. It came out as a letter to the editor. I saw it when I was in India.</p>
