    <title>Question: When I try to meditate, I get a feeling of oceans and waters before my mind&#039;s eye. This creates fear in me, and I cannot meditate very well. How can I meditate without getting this feeling of oceans and waters?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You will be able to meditate even when the ocean appears before you. Please try to see the ocean as something of your own, something in your inner being. Instead of seeing the ocean with its surges, waves and waters, please think of it as your own largest consciousness, and throw yourself into that largest and deepest consciousness. The ocean is not something standing in front of you as an enemy. Water is, in our spiritual language, consciousness. When you see this consciousness, you should feel happy and fortunate. There are so many seekers who try to imagine the ocean, so that they can make their consciousness as vast as the ocean. Unfortunately, your attitude towards the ocean has been wrong.</p>
<p>From now on, you yourself must try to throw your own consciousness into the waters of the ocean. You will be able to meditate most powerfully and most successfully. You will be able to contact, deep within you, that which is nearest and dearest to your soul.</p>
<p>Again, remember that you are extremely lucky to see the ocean in front of you. Do not focus your attention on the surface of the ocean, but please go, silently and consciously, deep into the ocean, where you will find your True Reality which is all Tranquillity.</p>
