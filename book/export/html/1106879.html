<p><em>The only things we ever keep</em></p>
<p><em>Are what we give away.</em></p>
<p><em> — a song by Louis Ginsberg</em></p>
<p>In my view, the overall theme of the encounter of the mothers of the disciple sons with their revered Guru Sri Chinmoy was the theme of 'givingness.'</p>
<p>It is my belief that a mother's love is equated to giving. A mother's entire character expresses the joy of giving. It seemed especially relevant this afternoon when Sri Chinmoy spoke to us as the "Divine Offeror" of spirituality for our sons. I felt an affinity toward him — as a continuum of a love/giving relationship.</p>
<p>This Sunday afternoon Sri Chinmoy was also giving to us in three ways. His divine presence; his inspiring and humble address in which he asked for us to accept his spiritual guidance of our sons and to rejoice with him over the happiness he has given them; and the concluding short ceremony, where the Guru personally handed each mother seven gifts to enjoy, and then clasped our hands in a handshake that symbolized for me our sharing of the continuum which was most meaningful to me. In fact, the entire afternoon was a most meaningful and memorable one.</p>
