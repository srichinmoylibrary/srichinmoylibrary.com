<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not believe in the word “sin” at all. I only believe in imperfection. We came from God. Our original Father was not a devil or evil. Our original Father was God, who is all Love, all Delight.</p>
<p>When we can remove the veil of ignorance from our consciousness, we will immediately enter into the world of perfection. There, there is no such thing as sin. Sin is in our mind; it can never be in our soul. And what is sin? It is something that binds and restricts, like a prison-cell. And what is delight? It is the boundless freedom of perfection.</p>  </div>
