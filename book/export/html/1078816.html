  <h1 class="book-heading">I lived only twice</h1>
  
 
<p>I lived only twice: once in the kingdom of strangling and devouring animals and once in the kingdom of doubting and suspecting human beings.</p>
<p>I am living now only twice: once in the world of hesitation and once in the world of unawareness.</p>
<p>I shall be living only twice: once in the smile of my gratitude-heart and once in the heart of God's Satisfaction-Light.</p>
<p>To grow and experience more and more, to become most spiritually mature, I shall live only twice: once inside the aspiration-plant and once inside the realisation-tree and realisation-fruit.</p>
<p>From now on, I shall make it a special point to live in my aspiration-world. There I shall see that my beloved Lord is crying and ascending to open up a new world of light, a new world of promise.</p>
