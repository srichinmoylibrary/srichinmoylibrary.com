  <h1 class="book-heading">Dr. L.M. Singhvi</h1>
  
 
<p>As a bridge connects two countries, even so, a man of most extraordinary capacities connects two countries. He is our supremely choice representative and God-favoured Mother India's beloved son, High Commissioner Laxmi Mall Singhvi.</p>
<p>Dr. Singhvi is the golden link between the United Kingdom and India. On the strength of his world-loving aspiration and world-serving dedication, every day he self-givingly barters India's inner wealth, the message of a oneness-world-family, with the United Kingdom's same inner wealth, along with his most illumining and most fulfilling outer contributions to two political firmaments.</p>  </div>
