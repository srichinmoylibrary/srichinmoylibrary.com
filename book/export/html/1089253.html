<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I am holding a meditation, I wear Indian robes, because this makes it easier for the seekers to identify me as a spiritual teacher. If I am in need of a policeman, I look for someone wearing a policeman's uniform. If I see someone in a policeman's uniform, I immediately have confidence in him. So when I hold meetings at the United Nations and elsewhere, I wear Indian robes in order to represent outwardly what I inwardly am. Inwardly I know that I am a spiritual person, a seeker, twenty four hours a day. I don't have to wear Indian robes to know who I am. But for the seekers I do it.</p>  </div>
