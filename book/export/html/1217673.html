<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yet, it is absolutely true. I have twice had the good fortune to witness such a performance.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Were you not afraid or astonished?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I was not afraid because fortunately I was not one of the performers. And I was not astonished because I was aware of the power of faith. They had a tremendous faith in Govinda (Lord Krishna). Chanting the name of Govinda in intense consecration, they walked unscathed over the fire.</p>  </div>
