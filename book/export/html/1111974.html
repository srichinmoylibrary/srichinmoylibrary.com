<p>Yesterday I ran John's one-mile course in Flushing Meadow Park. Kailash took my timing. I have made tremendous progress — from 13:40 to 11:40! If I can make progress, all of you can make progress.</p>
<p>If you lose seven to ten pounds, you will not die. But the result is something else. If you lose ten pounds, even three pounds, you simply fly when you run. You don't need to be a bird to fly.</p>
<p>So, overweight people, lose ten pounds!</p>
