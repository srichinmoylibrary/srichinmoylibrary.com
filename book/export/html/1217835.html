<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Normally it is the soul that determines the experiences that the individual will have in his lifetime. As a matter of fact, if the individual consciously puts himself into spontaneous flow of the experiences that the soul wants to give him, he will eventually grow into abiding peace, joy and fulfilment. Unfortunately, the individual, being a victim of ignorance, is not aware of the soul's selection of the experience, or, in spite of knowing, does not care for the selection made by the soul.</p>  </div>
