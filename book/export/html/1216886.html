<p>After Andre's accident, I went to see him in the Spanish hospital. He was unconscious, but I said, "Now your Guru is singing the Supreme," and I started singing.</p>
<p>Then he started chanting "pranam." As soon as he started chanting, the two nurses who were there jumped up from their chairs to see. Before this, the nurses had been calling him, but he hadn't responded.</p>
<p>Andre went on chanting so loudly that the nurses were pushing each other's shoulders out of excitement. He was so happy, and four or five times he smiled.</p>
