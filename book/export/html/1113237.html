<p>"So, Chinmoy, Amal has spoken to you?"</p>
<p>I said: "Yes, he has."</p>
<p>"You had to wait for a long time," Nolini-da said.</p>
<p>"I am so grateful that you are finally allowing me to continue my play on Sri Aurobindo in the <em>Mother India.</em>"</p>
<p>He gave me a significant smile.</p>
<p>I said to him: "Yesterday in the playground you told us that it would be your last sitting. How I wish that you would tell about your musical experiences and your sports life at the playground."</p>
<p>"Oh no, those are my personal experiences. They are too personal."</p>
<p>"Rabindranath, in his <em>Jiban Smriti,</em> and Nabin Sen, in his <em>Amar Jiban,</em> revealed quite a few personal experiences," I said.</p>
<p>"Chinmoy, as you know, I am neither Rabindranath nor Nabin Sen. I am your Nolini-da and I would be embarrassed to read out those experiences in the playground."</p>
<p>I said to him: "But I have heard from an authoritative source that your musical experiences and your sports life will be published in <em>Vartika.</em>"</p>
<p>"I see, I see. If ever they are published in Vartika, then you must know that it was not my doing but Ranju's."</p>
<p>Then we both smiled.</p>  </div>
