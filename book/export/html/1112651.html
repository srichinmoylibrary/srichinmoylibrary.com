<p>When I was staying at the Palace Gardens Hotel, one day around six-thirty or quarter to seven in the morning somebody opened my door. Usually they don't clean so early so I asked, "What is it?"</p>
<p>A maid answered, "Sorry, sorry," and went away.</p>
<p>Then I came out and put the "Don't Disturb" sign on the door and went back into my room. In twenty minutes, the same lady again opened the door. This time I insulted her: "You don't read English? Here is the 'Don't Disturb' sign. You speak English, but you don't read English."</p>
<p>After that, I left my key at the desk and went out for about three hours. When I came back to my room, I realised I had left the key downstairs. I saw the same lady in front of my room, so I said, "I am very sorry, but I left the key downstairs. Would you kindly open my door?"</p>
<p>She said, "How do I know you are staying in that room?"</p>
<p>She would not open the door for me, so I had to go downstairs to get the key. When I came back, she was watching me open the door and laughing at me. For twenty minutes she had bothered me. Then, three hours later, she said she did not recognise me. By not opening the door, she was punishing me for insulting her.</p>  </div>
