<p>This morning I went out three times to walk: at four o'clock, six o'clock and eight o'clock. I want to show that I can maintain strength even after losing forty pounds. The joy of losing weight itself gives me strength!</p>
<p>Anyway, at four o'clock, no human being was visible. At six o'clock also, I was lucky that there was no interference. Then at eight o'clock something cute happened. I saw two of the disciples who work at Aparajita's restaurant. They were cycling. Both of them put their hands on their heart chakra. One of them had proper head gear and the other one did not have. They were extremely devoted.</p>
