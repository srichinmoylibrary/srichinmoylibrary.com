RTMB 155-172. For Western audiences, Sri Chinmoy would sometimes preface his performance or recitation of Tagore’s songs by offering an illumining translation of the Bengali words. In addition, he often commented on the significance of Tagore’s message in the song. Several of these songs have not previously been translated into English.</p>
<h2>1. ‘Nibir ghana andhare jwaliche dhrubha tara’</h2>


<p>“In the tenebrous gloom shines the Pole-Star;<br /> O my mind, in the immense expanse of night, lose not your Way.<br /> Dead with depression and despair,<br /> O my heart, cease not your singing.<br /> Breaking asunder the prison of delusion, fulfil your life . . .”</p>

<p>In this song, Tagore compares the Pole-Star, fixed and steady in the dark night, with the light of the mind and heart which illumines the unlit existence of human life.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
