<p>I had another friend at the Consulate whose name was Kapoor. He was a friend and also a great admirer of mine. He left the Consulate and worked at an airline. Then he went to Oakland, California. Every Saturday, in the evening, he used to call me from Oakland to chat with me and get a little bit of advice about how to have more peace with his wife and children.</p>  </div>
