<p>I walked many miles today. At one point, after covering about 11 miles in my slowest possible walk, I entered a candy store. I bought all kinds of things, including candy that looked like little baseballs.</p>
<p>I spent lots of money — about $15. Then, after I had paid for everything, I wanted to buy four more of the little baseballs. The lady said, "They are 25 cents each."</p>
<p>I gave her a dollar. She took the dollar and then said, "But there is tax." Can you imagine? After I spent so much money, she had to ask me for tax on one dollar!</p>
<p>I never keep any change in my pocket, but I reached into my pocket and found a five-dollar bill. In the meantime, the lady put the first dollar I had given her into the register. When she gave me change for the five dollars, she gave me three dollars and some coins.</p>
<p>I said, "I gave you a dollar before."</p>
<p>She said, "Oh no, you didn't give it to me."</p>
<p>She had been holding it while I was getting out my five-dollar bill. In this world there are good people and bad people. She was very, very bad!</p>
