<p>At the playground Nolini-da said: "Today I am going to tell you about the last days of my life as a revolutionary. If you follow me I can take you right up to the jail."</p>
<p>At the end of his talk he said: "What I have just read out is profane, non-spiritual, but now I want to read something spiritual. I will now introduce Amrita to you. This is the second instalment. I must say that Amrita is always spiritual in his writings."</p>
<p>After reading out Amrita-da's talk he said: "Poor Amrita, he was not fortunate enough to dine with Sri Aurobindo. Indeed, this instalment has a tragic end, but soon he will tell us about his bright light."</p>  </div>
