<p>Both the Buddha and Mahavira practised tremendous austerities when they first renounced the world. At the end of six years, the Buddha adopted the Middle Path, while Mahavira continued to practise austerities for the remainder of his life.</p>
<p>The Buddha and Mahavira had the goal of attaining <em>nirvana</em>, or complete enlightenment â€” and they both achieved this Goal of goals.</p>
<p>After the Buddha and Mahavira had attained enlightenment, they each walked countless miles to and fro across the face of India, giving spiritual discourses, answering the questions of aspiring seekers and begging for food.</p>
<p>They each began to accept disciples, both male and female.</p>
<p>Neither one recognised any of the traditional Hindu distinctions of caste.</p>
<p>The Buddha withdrew from his physical body at the age of 80. His last words to his disciples were, "All things composed are perishable. Now, strive diligently."</p>
<p>At the ripe age of 72, Mahavira left the body. On his last day, he uttered the words: "As a dewdrop clinging to a blade of kusa-grass lasts but a short time, even so, the life of men. Gautama, be careful all the while!"</p>  </div>
