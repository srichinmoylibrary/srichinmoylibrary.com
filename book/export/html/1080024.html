<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind is quite often jealous of the heart. The heart enjoys its surrender to the soul and when the heart pleases the soul in the soul's own way, the heart gets tremendous delight. On the one hand, the mind does not want to surrender to the soul. But, at the same time, when it sees that the heart is enjoying supreme delight by virtue of its surrender to the soul, the mind becomes jealous of the heart.</p>  </div>
