<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> These individuals have to excuse me, but unfortunately, I had quite a few sad experiences six or seven years ago when I accepted disciples who were taking drugs. So I decided that people may come to me only after they have given up drugs. It is not that I will not be able to help them, but here we have a family, a spiritual community. If people are still taking drugs when they come, then they may poison our system. If I didn't have any other disciples, I would tell them, "Yes, you may come. I will be able to help you." But right now I tell them that they have to conquer drugs first; they have to give up drugs totally. Only then can they enter into our family.</p>  </div>
