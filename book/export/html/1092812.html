<p>India was divided. According to many, Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel were fully responsible for the amputation of Mother India's body.</p>
<p>But the seekers of the highest Truth, when they dive deep within, can clearly see and emphatically say that it was Gandhi-ji who, through his never-to-be-caught actions and manners, prompted Nehru and Patel to long for a divided India.</p>
<p>Why? For two reasons. Firstly, Gandhi-ji was convinced that it would be impossible for Nehru, Patel and others to rule the country in the face of the ceaseless demands of the Muslim insurgents. Secondly, Gandhi-ji wished to keep his Muslim brothers happy. He said, 'Over my dead body only can Muslims ever be mistreated by the Hindus.'</p>
<p>To the truth-seekers and truth-discoverers, it is crystal-clear that Mahatma was fully responsible for the separation-destruction of poor Mother India.</p>  </div>
