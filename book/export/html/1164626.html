    <title>Question: Many of your disciples are professionals such as engineers and scientists, who spend the majority of their day working with their minds. Your path, the path of the heart, requires that we remain in the spiritual heart in order to make the fastest progress. What can we do when we are forced to remain in the mind in our job situations?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to feel that your thoughts are like food. In the kitchen you can either leave food on a counter and let it spoil, or you can put it into the refrigerator and preserve it. You can let your day's thoughts spoil in your mind after work, or you can put them away. After work you can either stay in the mind with your thoughts, or you can take the mind to the heart.</p>  </div>
