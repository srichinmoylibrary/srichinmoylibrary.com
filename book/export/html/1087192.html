<p>Since Mahasamrat has a connection with Peru, I got him a huge jacket. From small they went to large; medium sizes they didn't have.</p>
<p>I also got a nice sweater for myself. The price was 350. I liked it and didn't want to waste time bargaining. So I said 300 and just took it.</p>
<p>I bought so many presents for people who didn't come on the trip.</p>
