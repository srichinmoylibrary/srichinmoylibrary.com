<p>To cheer his divine birth<br /> He invited the cosmic gods.<br /> The gods simply flew down<br /> To the earth to cheer him, love him, embrace him.</p>
<p>To mourn his human death<br /> He invited his earthly comrades, earthly devotees, earthly adorers.<br /> Some came late,<br /> Some came not at all,<br /> Some just sneered<br /> At his audacious invitation.</p>
