<p><em>(Satyavama, having prepared a most delicious meal, goes to the River Jamuna, and tries to cross it. The Jamuna is a tiny river that is usually knee deep, but when there is a flood or a storm, it has to be crossed in a ferryboat. Satyavama sees that the water is raging like the surges of the sea. The boatman refuses to take her across because of the danger. Satyavama, depressed and angry, returns to the palace!)</em></p>
<p>SATYAVAMA: Krishna, I went to cross the river to take food to your dearest disciple, but the river was hostile to me. Do something!</p>
<p>KRISHNA: All right. Go and say this to the river: "If my Lord Krishna has not seen the face of any woman other than me, then calm down."</p>
<p>SATYAVAMA: How can I say this? I know how many women friends you have. I cannot say to Jamuna that you have never seen the face of any woman but me. It is all lies! Jamuna will never calm down. You have seen the faces of millions of women. To say that you have only seen my face is ridiculous!</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Go. Go and say what I have told you to Jamuna and see what happens.</p>  </div>
