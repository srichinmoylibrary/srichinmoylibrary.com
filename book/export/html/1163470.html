<p>In most of his poems and songs, Rabindranath Tagore extols Bengal to the skies and says that the rest of India should follow in the footsteps of Bengal. But when it came to Shivaji, Tagore urged Bengalis to follow Shivaji's example. Shivaji's motto, his sacrifice, his courage and self-giving all received the utmost praise from Tagore. He said, "O Bengalis, follow him, follow him. Follow Shivaji and say: 'Victory to Shivaji! Victory to Shivaji!'" This was Tagore's immortal poem.</p>  </div>
