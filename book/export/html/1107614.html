  <h1 class="book-heading">A true seeker</h1>
  
 
<p>A true seeker is he who constantly prays to God and yet consciously remains unconscious of his prayer. A true seeker is he who sleeplessly meditates on God and yet deliberately remains unconscious of his meditation. A true seeker is he who soulfully loves the world and yet easily remains unconscious of his love. A true seeker is he who devotedly serves the world and yet surprisingly remains unconscious of his service.</p>
<p>God has a special liking for a true seeker because of his sincerity-life. God has a special love for a true seeker because of his purity-heart. A true seeker has a special liking for God, not because God gives him infinitely more than he needs, but because God gives him His Infinity’s Compassion. A true seeker has a special love for God, not because God gives him infinitely more than he deserves, but because God is His Eternity’s Forgiveness.</p>
<p>A true seeker most sincerely cries with humanity’s cries and thus becomes perfectly one with humanity’s countless problems. A true seeker most soulfully smiles with Divinity’s Smiles and thus unconditionally becomes one with the sleepless readiness of Divinity to descend, thus solving its endless problems.</p>
<p>A true seeker has a unique way of teaching and preaching. He stands before the world-audience and unlearns what the earth-bound mind has taught him. This is how he teaches the world. He stands before the world-audience and reveals what his Heaven-free heart has taught him. This is how he preaches to the world at large.</p>
<p>A true seeker is at once Heaven’s prepared messenger and earth’s treasured message.</p>
<p>When a true seeker says to the world, “I am as young as your perfection-life,” God immediately says to him, “My most precious child, you are as old as My Vision-Eye.” </p>
