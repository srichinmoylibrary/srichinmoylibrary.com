<p>The oldest living head hunter (long ago retired) came to see me in Borneo. He was 85 years old.</p>
<p>Then the chief of the tribe came to see me. The chief liked me so much that he gave me his grandfather's ring. He put it on my finger and said, "I am making you an honourary chief of the Iban tribe."</p>
<p>I gave the old man a shirt and the young Iban chief an ocarina. They were both very happy.</p>
<p>I also gave each of them six pictures that I had taken myself when they were dancing. Long live my camera!</p>
<p>Both the old man and the chief had tremendous receptivity.</p>
