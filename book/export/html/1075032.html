<p>His desire-kingdom<br /> Is bounded on the north by fear,<br /> On the south by doubt,<br /> On the west by jealousy,<br /> On the east by insecurity.</p>
<p>His aspiration-kingdom<br /> Is bounded on the east by faith,<br /> On the west by love,<br /> On the north by devotion,<br /> On the south by surrender.</p>
<p>His realisation-kingdom<br /> Is bounded on the east by God's Compassion,<br /> On the west by God's Illumination,<br /> On the north by God's Realisation,<br /> On the south by God's Perfection.</p>
