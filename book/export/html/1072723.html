<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one way to expand our receptivity and that is through our constant remembrance of what we were, what we are and what we can be. We were animals. We are human beings trying to become divine and perfect. We will, by the Grace of the Absolute Supreme, eventually become divine, perfect and immortal. If we remember this, then automatically we expand our receptivity. Then we experience delight in abundant and boundless measure.</p>  </div>
