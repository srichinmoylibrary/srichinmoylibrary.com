<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not need human appreciation. When you are one with the Supreme, you receive all love and appreciation from Him.</p>
<p>I do not need human appreciation. But when my disciples appreciate me, at that time they enter into me with joy and love, and this gives me joy. Also, with their joy and love they can manifest the Highest.</p>  </div>
