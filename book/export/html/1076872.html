  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Would you be classified as a Swami?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I should be classified as a spiritual Teacher.</p>
<p><em>I thought that was primarily what Swami meant?</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A spiritual Teacher can be of various types and of different calibres. He can be called a Swami or Guru or can be addressed by a number of other titles like Acharya, Sant, Yogiraj, Nath, Rishi, etc. But I prefer to be called a spiritual Teacher.</p>
<p><em>So there is not really any difference between a Guru and a Swami or other titles?</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there is a difference in grade. A Guru is supposed to be one who has inner identification or conscious oneness with God, whereas the Swami need not be spiritually fully awakened or spiritually realised.</p>
<p><em>This is, of course, in Yoga?</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, in Yoga.</p>  </div>
