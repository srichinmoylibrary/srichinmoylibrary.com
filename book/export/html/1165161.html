<p><em>(Jesus on the Mount. He is rapt in trance.Enter Father.The face of Jesus glows.)</em></p>
<p>FATHER: Son, I wish you to offer a series of aphorisms as special advice to your disciples. Your disciples may ask you for their meanings. Therefore I shall tell you the meanings as well, First, blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<p>JESUS: How wonderful is Your advice, Father!</p>
<p>FATHER: It means that the Kingdom of Bliss is for those blessed people who have devoted dedication to their inner and spiritual life and who have nothing to do with pride.</p>
<p>JESUS: I see. Thank You, Father. Next?</p>
<p>FATHER: Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</p>
<p>JESUS: Wonderful, Father.</p>
<p>FATHER: Son, it means that the true spiritual life of a seeker begins when he has a real sense of loss. His loss is the loss of his inner wealth: peace, joy, love and bliss. This loss creates in him an inner cry which may outwardly be known as mourning. Naturally a seeker of this type will be given back the peace, joy, love and bliss which he is crying to recover.</p>
<p>JESUS: I see. Thank You, Father. Next?</p>
<p>FATHER: Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p>JESUS: Wonderful, Father.</p>
<p>FATHER: Son, it means that if a man has a tremendous sense of superiority, he will lord it over others, but if the same man feels that he is weak and helpless without Me, then he will develop a deep sense of humility. This humility will make him one with all human beings on earth. His universal oneness is the strength that will enable him to claim the earth divinely and supremely.</p>
<p>JESUS: I see. Thank You, Father. Next?</p>
<p>FATHER: Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</p>
<p>JESUS: Wonderful, Father,</p>
<p>FATHER: Son, it means that purity alone has the capacity to receive and achieve Divinity. A pure heart is a peerless manifestation of My divine Reality.</p>
<p>JESUS: I see. Thank You very much, Father. Next?</p>
<p>FATHER: Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</p>
<p>JESUS: Wonderful, Father.</p>
<p>FATHER: Son, it means that My divine children are those who aspire for Light and who are surcharged with Light. Light, in the process of its manifestation, becomes the all-nourishing and all-fulfilling Peace.</p>
<p>JESUS: I see. Thank You, Father. Next?</p>
<p>FATHER: If any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.</p>
<p>JESUS: Wonderful, Father.</p>
<p>FATHER: Son, it means that forgiveness is by far the best quality both in Me and in all human beings. If ignorance has struck you once and you have forgiven ignorance, there is no guarantee that it will not strike you again. But if you tell ignorance that if it wants to strike you again you are more than prepared to answer it with your forgiveness-weapon, ignorance comes to realise that your weapon is infinitely stronger than its weapon. Your weapon has Light and spreads Light; whereas its weapon, which is darkness, is all confusion. Remaining in utter and constant confusion, how can it continue to fight against its opponent, Light, which is all-loving and all fulfilling?</p>
<p>JESUS: I see. Thank You, Father, thank You. Next?</p>
<p>FATHER: When you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.</p>
<p>JESUS: Wonderful, Father.</p>
<p>FATHER: Son, it means that man gets a great sense of satisfaction if he sees that someone is watching while he is giving something to others. The satisfaction that results from a public show immediately creates unnecessary pride. What is pride, if not immediate and total self-destruction?</p>
<p>JESUS: Thank You, Father, thank You. Next?</p>
<p>FATHER: For today it is enough, My son. I am a bit tired. Some other day I will give you more advice.</p>  </div>
