<p>November 3, 1964<br /> The battle is done. Robert has won.<br /> The battle is done. Jack's hope has won.<br /> The battle is done. God's Smile is won.</p>
<p>Yours is the mind creative in thought,<br /> Yours is the heart rich in experience,<br /> Yours is the soul that braves<br /> The storm-tossed life of the world.</p>
<p>Although you have not seen many summers on<br /> the earthly stage,<br /> Far have you travelled in the adventure of life.<br /> Yet farther have you to travel.<br /> No halt, no end to your journey's life.</p>
<p>You are Senator.<br /> Consciously, even inevitably,<br /> Thrust upon you is a stupendous measure<br /> of burden.<br /> Through you President Kennedy's voice<br /> Rings with the clearest extremes<br /> Of emotion divine: Freedom and Peace.<br /> To silence the age-long dirge of poverty,<br /> Jack's heart in his brother cries like a child.</p>
<p>Victory you have won: a victory significant,<br /> A victory of paramount importance,<br /> One brilliant with the light of countless stars.<br /> Your dream, no chimera's mist, but reality itself:<br /> The Man of the Eternal Dawn in you<br /> Shall far transcend the Senator in you,<br /> On the frontiers of West and East,<br /> South and North.</p>
