<p>There was once a little girl who was living with her mother. Her father had passed away, and they were very poor. The mother was a very, very kind-hearted woman, and her six-year-old child was extremely beautiful and extremely sweet.</p>
<p>The little girl was always afraid of darkness. Every night the little girl would become very afraid. Unfortunately, the mother would also get frightened at night. The mother would say, "There is no lock on the door. We do not even have a nail in the house to close the door." She was so afraid that hooligans would come and rob them. Although the mother was also afraid, she tried to hide it from her daughter.</p>
<p>One night it was extremely hot, and the child kept the window wide open. There was moonlight streaming into the house, and she was thrilled. The little girl asked her mother, "Who has given this light to the moon?"</p>
<p>The mother answered, "God has given this light to the moon."</p>
<p>The little girl said, "The moon is so beautiful. How I wish I could be as beautiful as the moon!"</p>
<p>"My darling, you are much more beautiful than the moon."</p>
<p>"Mother, I cannot believe that. No, no, you are just telling me lies."</p>
<p>"I am telling you, my darling, that you are much more beautiful in my heart. You are infinitely more precious to me."</p>
<p>"Does the moon sleep?" asked the child.</p>
<p>"No, the moon does not sleep at night and the sun does not sleep during the day."</p>
<p>Then the little girl said, "The moon does not sleep during the night and the sun does not sleep during the day. Is there anybody who does not sleep during the day and also does not sleep at night?"</p>
<p>The mother said, "Yes, there is someone."</p>
<p>"Who is this person?"</p>
<p>"God," replied the mother.</p>
<p>The little girl exclaimed, "God! So God does not sleep either during the day or at night. The moon sleeps during the day and the sun sleeps at night, but God never sleeps."</p>
<p>Then the little girl asked, "You take care of me, but who takes care of the moon?"</p>
<p>"God takes care of the moon."</p>
<p>"Who takes care of the sun?"</p>
<p>"God takes care of the sun," answered the mother.</p>
<p>The little child was so moved. She said, "So God does not sleep. He takes care of the moon and He takes care of the sun. God will also take care of you. God will take care of me. We do not have to worry, mother. God will definitely take care of us."</p>
<p>The mother was so happy. She was shedding tears of love, pride and joy. She said, "Now you will never again be afraid of night. God will take care of you, my darling. God will take care of us both. Before I was also afraid. Now we will never again be afraid of the darkness."</p>  </div>
