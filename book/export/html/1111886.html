<p>Every mile Savyasachi would come to give me something to drink. He would come either at the end of the mile or somewhere in the middle of it — wherever he could bring the car.</p>
<p>Many people were running on the sidewalk, so that the trees would protect them from the heavy rain. But I didn't like the leaves on the sidewalk and also I was afraid I would step in a puddle. At least on the street I could see where I was running.</p>
<p>At seventeen miles I found a friend. A young man, about thirty years old, was driving by in a car. He said to me, "I want to drive with you."</p>
<p>I said, "Fine!"</p>
<p>Whenever I would walk, he would stop the car and wait for me. He was following me and encouraging me, saying, "Yes, you can make it."</p>
<p>After driving with me for one mile the man said to me, "My name is Mark. What is your name?"</p>
<p>I said, "Chinmoy."</p>
<p>Mark said, "Come into the car. I will take you secretly a few miles ahead and nobody will know."</p>
<p>I said, "I can't do that."</p>
<p>He said, "You are a nice gentleman. Good luck."</p>
