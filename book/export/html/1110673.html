<p>When you are not one with God the Creator, when you are not one with God the creation, everything that you do for another individual or for other individuals, you feel is a stupendous sacrifice. But when you become one with God and with humanity's life, heart and breath, then there is no such thing as sacrifice. It is only a oneness-song that you are singing in the God-aspiring, God-revealing and God-manifesting universal family.</p>
