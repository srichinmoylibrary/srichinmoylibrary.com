<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to feel that each hour in your life is a page of your life-book, and that you are studying, memorising and utilising the wisdom of that page in your life. Every hour you have to feel that you have studied one particular page of your life-book. When the wisdom of that page enters into you, immediately there appears in you a form of creativity. Creativity does not only mean writing poems or stories. No! Creativity can be inside one’s heart: creativity can take place inside one’s body-consciousness. Creativity means a kind of manifestation inside you. When you study that particular page, the wisdom recorded there is spread inside your being. That is called creativity. If you can feel that every hour is a page in your life-book and that you are studying it, then every action of yours will be an art.</p>  </div>
