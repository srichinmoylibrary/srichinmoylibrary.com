<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em> You can get rid of anxiety for a short time by ignoring it, but if you want to get rid of it permanently, then you have to bring light into it. In the beginning, if you can convince your mind that anxiety does not exist, then you can get temporary relief. If, even for one day, you can be free from anxiety, then you will have accomplished something. And during the time it is away, you may acquire or achieve light. Then when anxiety returns you can inject light into it.</p>
<p>If you do not have enough light or illumining power inside you, the best thing is to ignore anxiety and wait for God's Capacity, which is light, to develop inside you. But if you do have the inner capacity to transform your anxiety right from the beginning, why delay further? Right now you can enter into your anxiety with your soul's light to illumine and perfect it. Then it will no longer exist.</p>
