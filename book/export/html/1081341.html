<p>After they had discussed the price of the ticket, Sri Ramakrishna said to Girish, "I can see that a tremendous transformation is taking place in you. You see only your outer life, what you are doing outwardly, but inside you there is so much divinity and love for God."</p>
<p>Girish was simply astonished. He said, "I am living such an undivine life and you see so much purity and divinity in me! And love for God! If I had even an iota of love for God, would I be leading this kind of unspiritual life? Absolutely not!"</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna said, "No, no, I am seeing it! I am seeing it!"</p>
<p>So Girish was puzzled and, at the same time, he was getting great joy from the idea that there was something divine inside him. On the one hand, he had now developed some faith in Sri Ramakrishna, but on the other hand, the life that he lived was totally contradictory to what Sri Ramakrishna was saying about him.</p>  </div>
