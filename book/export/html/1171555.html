<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, my philosophy is love, good wishes and brotherhood. As I said before, we are all children of God, and we all belong to one family, even though we come from different countries. I am Indian, you are Indonesian, and somebody else may be another nationality. And we all have different names â€” that is how we recognise one another and distinguish one from the other. But we are all members of the same family.</p>  </div>
