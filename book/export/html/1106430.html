<p>This morning I started my serious lifting just after seven o’clock. I was determined to go higher in my 200-pound double-arm lift, but just after I had taken my first breath a telephone call came. I feel that I could have broken my record, but unfortunately that kind of determination one cannot get back immediately. Today I would have been the happiest person, but for this interruption. Who knows at what point the telephone will ring? How much concentration I was putting into that lift! Even one minute before or one minute after for the telephone to ring would have been fine.</p>
<p>Life is always comedy and tragedy — then we have to go beyond it.</p>
