  <h1 class="book-heading">Part I — What is the meaning of life?</h1>
  
 
<p>What is the meaning of life? Life is for the absolute satisfaction of God the Creator and God the creation.</p>
<p>The meaning of life is to become inseparably one with God the transcendental Bliss and God the universal Peace.</p>
<p>The meaning of life is to achieve unconditional self-giving and a self-giving will, at God’s choice Hour, in the unhorizoned blossoming of God-becoming.</p>
<p>Life means will-power, the will-power that unites God’s descending Compassion-Smile with man’s ascending aspiration-cry. In the desire-bound life, there are teeming rules and regulations. In the aspiration-free life, there is only one rainbow-rule: complete faith in oneself and birthless and deathless faith in God.</p>
<p>Life is love: animal love, human love and divine love. Animal love is destruction. Human love is frustration. Divine love is satisfaction. Again, love is life par excellence because it is the existence-reality itself.</p>
<p>Life must needs have a dream and a goal. Today’s dream and goal have to be transcended tomorrow. Each Himalayan dream of man is God’s own Self-Transcendence.</p>
<p>Transcendence is the glorious beginning of human perfection. Perfect perfection is pure satisfaction within and sure satisfaction without.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life and who am I? From time immemorial these two questions have remained inseparably one. Who am I? I am my life’s unfinished God-manifestation.</p>
