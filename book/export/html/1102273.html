<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to deal with people who are actively opposed to the United Nations with perseverance, tolerance and forgiveness. If we have perseverance, then we have made a first step towards world harmony. If we have tolerance, then we have put forward the second step. And if we can forgive, then we have made the third and ultimate step. With these three qualities we can eventually illumine those who are actively opposed to the ideas and ideals of the United Nations.</p>  </div>
