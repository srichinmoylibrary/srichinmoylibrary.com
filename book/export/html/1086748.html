<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dear child, first of all, I shall definitely die, but I am not going to take another human incarnation unless the Supreme changes His Plan. There is no wish and no necessity on my part to come back again. I have worked very hard on earth and I am ready to do the rest from above, from Heaven. So, since there is no possibility of my returning to the physical plane, with a physical body, I unfortunately cannot become either you or Nathan or Ruth or Suvikash. But you, your father, brother and mother will come back again and again. What for? To work for the Supreme in me, in your Guru.</p>  </div>
