<p>He is great,<br /> Not because of his cosmopolitan education.<br /> He is great,<br /> Not because of his international name and fame.<br /> He is great,<br /> Because he touched the Feet<br /> Of his Beloved in the temple.<br /> He is great,<br /> Because he kissed the Feet<br /> Of his Beloved in the mosque.<br /> He is great,<br /> Because he breathed the Life<br /> Of his Beloved Feet in the synagogue.<br /> He is great,<br /> Because he has become<br /> His Beloved 's Feet in the church.</p>
