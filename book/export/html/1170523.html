SCA 65-72. Interview by <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine on 6 August 1993, at an exhibition of 70,000 Dream-Freedom-Peace-Birds, Soho, New York.</p>
<h2>Interviewer: Is there one thing that inspired you to do all these small drawings of birds?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am a truth-seeker and God-lover. I pray and meditate. From my prayer and meditation I receive inner messages and inner inspiration to compose songs, write poems, draw and do various other things. This inspiration carries me. I try to receive inspiration and aspiration from within, and with this inspiration and aspiration I try to be of service to mankind in various ways.</p>  </div>
