<p>A human being has many divine qualities. But there has never been another unparalleled divine quality like man's self-sacrifice, nor can there ever be. God's own soulful Message to humanity in all walks of life is self-sacrifice. The brightest self-sacrifice can easily ease and diminish the darkest trials and stresses of human life.</p>
<p>He who is all sacrifice can never go through life as a failure. His is the perpetual victory. His is the spontaneous inner joy. What is to be sacrificed? One's life-breath. How to sacrifice? With the feeling of universal oneness.</p>
<p>To despair's invitation, self-sacrifice says, "No." To delight's invitation, self-sacrifice says, "Yes."</p>
<p>God secretly blesses me from Heaven when I wish to grow into sacrifice. God openly blesses me on earth when my earthly existence becomes all sacrifice.</p>
<p>Man's choice is joy. Joy's choice is sacrifice. Sacrifice's choice is nothing. This nothing is verily the unfoldment of everything, and the fulfilment of man and God.</p>
<p>A man of no sacrifice wants to possess the world with his strongest might. A man of sacrifice wishes to be possessed by the world with his all-surrendering right. To love life is to sacrifice our divinity within. To sacrifice life is to transform our humanity without.</p>
<p>When I sacrifice my material possessions, I see God coming smilingly towards me. When I sacrifice my austerities, I see God marching dynamically towards me. When I sacrifice my spiritual achievements, I see God running speedily towards me.</p>  </div>
