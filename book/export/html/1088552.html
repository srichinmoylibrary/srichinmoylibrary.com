<p>Humayan's son, Akbar, became the greatest of all Moghul emperors. In his court there were many Hindus with high posts, and he even married a Hindu princess. It was he who made the Hindus and the Muslims one. He ruled his kingdom with compassion and truth.</p>
<p>One day Akbar said to his minister, "Birbal, for a long time I have been thinking of one question. I am sure you will be able to answer it. We see everything clearly in the sunlight, but is there anything that cannot be seen even with the help of sunlight?"</p>
<p>"Yes, your Majesty, there is something that cannot be seen in the sunlight. Even the sunlight fails to illumine it."</p>
<p>"What is it, Birbal?"</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, it is the darkness of the mind."</p>  </div>
