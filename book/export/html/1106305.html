<p>The other day Achyuta said something very funny. Some people do not believe I have lifted 7,000 pounds, but they do believe that I have lifted 3,000 pounds. So, according to Achyuta, I should do 10,000 and then they will believe 7,000!</p>
<p>In New Zealand one man told me, “Three thousand I believed, but 7,000 I had a little suspicion.” But then he made enquiries with his good friend Bill Pearl and Bill Pearl told him it was true, so he believed it. His name is Warren.</p>
