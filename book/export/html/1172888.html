<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there should always be some spiritual practices. These spiritual practices alone will enable the seekers to have harmony in their marriage. Purity in thought and action, patience, both in the inner life and the outer life, and always to live in the loving heart rather than in the doubting mind â€” these are the spiritual practices that can support a marriage.</p>  </div>
