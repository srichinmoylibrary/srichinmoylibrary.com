<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If there are people interested in following my path, then I will see them and, if I feel that they are accepting me sincerely and that I can also accept them sincerely, then naturally I will accept them. It has to be a mutual acceptance. There are people whom I consider nice and sincere, but who do not care for my path. And again, there are people who are willing to follow my path but whom I unfortunately will not be able to accept. Even for these, however, I can be of some help. I have come to inspire people, and if there are people who see something in me, then they will benefit from my presence and my instruction.</p>  </div>
