<p>Sincerity is of paramount importance in the spiritual life. But sincerity has no value unless it is lasting. Suppose you have done something wrong and you tell me. Your sincerity I appreciate. But then you have to take the next step, and that is called obedience: You will not do it a second time. Otherwise, if you keep doing the same thing wrong over and over again, and each time you say, "I have done it," then your sincerity becomes a mockery. You blow your own horn, "I am sincere," but what kind of sincerity is it?</p>
<p>If you do something wrong, you should tell. But then you have to listen to me and not do it again. Insincere people I can do nothing with. I am helpless. Sincere people give me the opportunity to take them one step forward. But then obedience is necessary. If obedience is there, each second you can jump, jump. Hundreds and hundreds of things you will do to make the fastest progress.</p>
<p>If you are a little afraid of me, then tomorrow you will have a little obedience. Until you have established your total identification with me, a little fear is good â€” not destructive fear, but constructive fear: "I will see Guru's sad face if I disobey him." This kind of fear is good. If you feel you are all love and concern for my mission, then my sad face will be much more powerful than my angry face.</p>  </div>
