<p>After my father was cremated, we came back home and everybody was crying and crying. Who would console whom? In three hours' time a Bengali newspaper called Panchajanya, or "Krishna's Conch," came out with an article all about my father. When I looked at the article, I received such consolation. As soon as I read how nice and how great my father was, I stopped crying.</p>
<p>Even then, for weeks I would look at his picture early In the morning and cry. I would appreciate, admire and adore him, saying, "Oh, I am his son."</p>  </div>
