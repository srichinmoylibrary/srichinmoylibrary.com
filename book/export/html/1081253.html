<p>I longed to give my heart and soul<br /> To the animal world.<br /> My ex-friends were confused.<br /> I longed to give my heart and soul<br /> To the human world.<br /> My human fellows were not enthused.<br /> I longed to give my heart and soul<br /> To the worlds divine.<br /> My divine friends were quite amused.</p>
