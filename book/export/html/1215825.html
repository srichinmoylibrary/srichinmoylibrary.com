<p>O my soul,<br /> I wrote to you<br /> For help<br /> In my God-manifestation.<br /> Alas,<br /> Your answer could have been<br /> More generous.</p>
<p>O my heart,<br /> I wrote to you<br /> For help<br /> In my God-manifestation.<br /> Alas,<br /> Your poor response<br /> Fails to inspire me.</p>
<p>O my mind,<br /> I wrote to you<br /> For help<br /> In my God-manifestation.<br /> Alas,<br /> Your obscure answer<br /> Puzzles me.</p>
<p>O my vital,<br /> I wrote to you<br /> For help<br /> In my God-manifestation.<br /> Alas,<br /> Your senseless answer<br /> Frustrates me.</p>
<p>O my body,<br /> I didn't write to you<br /> Because<br /> I didn't know<br /> Whom to choose<br /> Between you<br /> And ignorance.</p>
