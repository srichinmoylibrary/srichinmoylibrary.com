<p>Early in the morning on weekends, my mother used to come with a glass of water and wash my father's feet with utmost devotion. It is an old Indian tradition. Even though my father had just taken a shower, still she would wash his feet. She also used to wash his feet before he went to the temple. My mother used to touch my father's feet in front of her children, servants â€” everyone. When my mother used to do that, our love for her would increase. We all had tremendous respect for our mother.</p>  </div>
