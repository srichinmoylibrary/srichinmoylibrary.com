<h2>Question: How can one bring the soul's consciousness into the professional world?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this world everybody has a profession, a vocation of his own. But one can become a seeker no matter which profession he follows. When someone becomes a seeker, he will be able to feel the presence of the soul and see his soul. When one becomes a seeker, no matter which profession he follows, he will be able to feel the presence of his soul and execute the will of the soul in his profession.</p>
<p>Someone has become a professional because he has studied a particular subject. If this person prays and meditates regularly, then he will also get the result of his inner study. He will get Peace, Light and Bliss in abundant measure. It is a matter of time, a few months or a few years, but he will definitely get it. Through this inner Light, he will be able to come into contact with the soul. Then, with the light of the soul he can fulfil all his dreams in the field of his profession.</p>  </div>
