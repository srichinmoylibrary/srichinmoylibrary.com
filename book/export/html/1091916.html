<h2>All The Disciples Who Have Been With...</h2>

<p>All the disciples who have been with us for a long time and those prospective disciples who sincerely want to sail in our Boat are requested to come up here, one by one, and speak on my philosophy.</p>
<p>I want you to speak in one, two, three or four sentences. It must not exceed four sentences. So one by one, you will come up and speak on Sri Chinmoy's philosophy according to your own understanding; what you feel about my philosophy.</p>
<p>And I wish to say that it has to come directly from your heart and not what you hear others say. It will be what you feel. You have read my writings, you have meditated on my writings many times. Now from your own inner experience, tell us what you think of my philosophy, so that in the future, it can be published in book form and can be distributed.</p>
<p>In New York we got quite a few comments on my philosophy and also in other places. Here also we want to have your comments. Those who cannot speak English well, no harm. Come up and speak in Spanish. Afterwards, it will be translated into English.</p>
<p>So please meditate first for two or three minutes. We shall start with Sudha, then Agni, Vijaya, Sanjivan... then one by one all will come up. But please don't give a long talk; only four sentences at the most.</p>  </div>
