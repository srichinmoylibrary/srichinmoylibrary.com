<p>It is no joke to run a seven-minute pace. Today, in the three-mile race in Greenport, Long Island, by the time the race started at ten o'clock, it was so hot. After the first six hundred metres, I was feeling very hot. My head was so hot, I couldn't breathe and I was dying of thirst. Still, in my first mile, I did my fastest time since I have been in America: a 6:35 pace.</p>
