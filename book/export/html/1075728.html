<p><em>(The abode of Manomohan Ghosh, a Barrister and close friend of Or. K.D. Ghosh. Behind the screen.)</em></p>

<p>The Birth of the Infinite<br /><em>(5 a.m., August 15, 1872)</em></p>
<p>The golden dawn of the cosmos rapt in trance,<br /> Awaits the birth of the All.<br /> The seven worlds' bliss converges in her heart<br /> With august and sun-vast call.</p>
<p>Slowly the Peak unmeasured of rapture-fire<br /> Climbs down to our human cry.<br /> His diamond vision's deathless Will leans low<br /> Our mortal frames to dye.</p>
<p>Suddenly life's giant somnolence is stirred.<br /> His all-embracing Wing<br /> Declares, "I come to end your eyeless fear:<br /> To me alone now cling!</p>
<p>"No fleeting dreams your teeming births do trace:<br /> Now own my infinite bloom.<br /> In me the flood of Immortality!<br /> Nowhere shall be your doom."</p>

<p>MANOMOHAN: My joy knows no bounds that your son takes birth in my house.</p>
<p>K.D.: No doubt, it will be a matter of great rejoicing if the dream of my wife comes true.</p>
<p>MANOMOHAN: How does her dream run?</p>
<p>K.D.: Friend, to me it is just a dream, a chimera's mist, but to her it is a blazing truth.</p>
<p>MANOMOHAN: Krishnadhan, I wish to hear her dream and not your comment on it.</p>
<p>K.D.: Well, during her confinement she dreamt that it was Sri Krishna who would take human birth through her.</p>
<p>MANOMOHAN: I see nothing wrong in her dream. You are a pessimist from head to foot. Come, let us hurry to the child. Who knows, we may find the Marvellous One?</p>  </div>
