<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are not always serious. If every second we only do serious things, we can be neither in Heaven nor on earth. Most of the time we do serious things. If you want to make a comparison between silly and serious things, then I must say that our amusement is nothing in comparison to the serious things that we do. Here also, I am talking to you for three or four hours. But the rest of the time I am doing serious things. Again, I know how many things I am doing right now. You people can also do several things at a time if you just develop your capacity. You can do it with the power of concentration in the inner world.</p>  </div>
