<p>After I ran my seven miles in Boston, I watched the disciples run two miles up "Heartbreak Hill" on the official Boston Marathon course. Nothing gives me so much joy as to watch others running. I really sympathised with them.</p>
<p>Chikur was the first boy. He was far ahead of the second boy, Pahar. Pahar was panting, "Hah, hah!" while he was running, but he could not catch up.</p>
