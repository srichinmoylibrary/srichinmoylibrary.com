<p>In the first part of our marathon in Flushing Meadow Park, I saw Gary Fanelli running behind some other runners. I said to him, "Gary, go faster." In two minutes, as he came back in the other direction, he said, "Guru, thank you." Then from his pocket he put something in his mouth.</p>
<p>He ran another half mile before making a turn. When he came back from the small loop, he was in first place — a hundred metres ahead of the runner behind him.</p>
