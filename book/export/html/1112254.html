<p>Near my house, I saw a boy coming along the street towards me on roller-skates. He was moving very restlessly. He was going forwards, but all of a sudden, what happened? He started skating backwards.</p>
<p>There was a car just three metres behind him. The driver was a Chinese lady. What could she do? There was only a three-metre gap, but she stopped her car immediately. How alert she was! Otherwise, this boy would have gone to God.</p>
<p>I was about twenty metres away, so I saw everything. If anything had happened to the boy, it would not have been the driverâ€™s fault at all. Fortunately, she stopped in time. This is how careless children can be.</p>
