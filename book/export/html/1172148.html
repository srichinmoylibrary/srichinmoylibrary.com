<p>The plane to Madras was delayed by an hour and a half. From Madras to Pondicherry it takes three and a half hours if you drive very fast. One of my close friends came to take me. He always comes. He is such a kind friend. He was waiting for me at the airport and he said, "At ten o'clock the nursing home closes. After that they do not allow visitors."</p>
<p>I said, "What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>He said, "I will drive as fast as possible, and Mother will protect us."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, Mother will protect us."</p>
<p>On the way two or three times big lorry trucks unnecessarily blocked us. He used all his Indian mantras, but the trucks did not listen. Whenever he got the opportunity, he drove very fast. Where it says you cannot drive more than 35 miles per hour, he was going very fast.</p>
<p>I said, "Let us hope and hope that we can reach Pondicherry in time."</p>  </div>
