<p>During my run this morning I saw two more soldiers: Ila and Nirvik. Ila saw me first and her soul saved me from imminent death. I was about to make a left turn, but I did not see that one car was coming behind me. I would have crossed in front of the car, but Ila called out to me and saved me. A little farther on, I saw Pradhan and then I saw Agraha. I ran for twenty minutes and then I came back to the hotel following the same route. On the way back, it was less than eighteen minutes. So, while coming back, I ran faster.</p>
