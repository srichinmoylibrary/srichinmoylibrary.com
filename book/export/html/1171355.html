<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on each angel's closeness to the Supreme. Even the cosmic gods do not meet with the Supreme every day or every hour. Angels do have a free access to the Supreme. A secretary may have a free access to the boss, but there will be many days when the boss is so busy that the secretary does not dare to disturb him. Again, some days the secretary can spend hours with the boss. Sometimes the boss may say that unless it is life or death, the secretary should not call, whereas if the boss wants to chat, he can call the secretary any time. Similarly, angels do have free access to the Supreme, but they cannot exploit it. Unless there is an emergency, they will not disturb Him.</p>  </div>
