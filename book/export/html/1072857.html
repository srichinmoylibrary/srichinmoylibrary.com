<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A portion of the Avatarâ€™s inner consciousness will know, but his conscious mind may not know. Only when the mind receives some light will he be able to know, and for that human incarnation is necessary. Unless you know something with the mind, you cannot be aware of it consciously. In the animal consciousness there is no mind.</p>  </div>
