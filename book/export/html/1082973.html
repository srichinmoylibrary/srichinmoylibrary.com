  <h1 class="book-heading">73. Question: Can the soul also experience ignorance?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, the soul can experience ignorance, but it is not bound by ignorance. You may do something which makes your hands very dirty, but you know that if you use water and soap, your hands can be cleansed. Similarly, if the soul enters into ignorance, it knows that it has only to look at the Face of the Supreme and it will immediately come out of the meshes of ignorance. Most human beings do not know where the Supreme is, but the soul knows. Even while it is in ignorance, it sees its illumined oneness with the Absolute Supreme. The soul is not bound by ignorance.</p>  </div>
