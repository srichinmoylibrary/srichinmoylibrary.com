<p>When I was in London at a smaller-than-the-smallest shop, I saw a small harmonium. Just for the sake of fun and curiosity, I said, "Can I see the harmonium?"</p>
<p>The man said, "Certainly you can see it, but first you have to tell me if you have ever played one. If you have never played one, I can't allow you to play it. You have to listen to me play it. I will play, and you will hear what a wonderful sound it has."</p>
<p>I said, "Definitely I can play it. Please let me try." It was very small. After playing it I said, "I have four or five harmoniums and this one is infinitely worse than my worst!"</p>
<p>He kept quiet because he saw that I did know how to play.</p>  </div>
