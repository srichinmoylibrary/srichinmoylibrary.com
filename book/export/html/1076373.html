<p><em>(Sri Ramakrishna with some of his selected disciples.)</em></p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: My health is failing very rapidly.</p>
<p>RAKHAL: Please tell us how we can restore your health.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: That depends on the Will of God.</p>
<p>NAREN: I know your will has become inseparably one with God’s Will.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: In this body two persons live: God in the form of an Avatar, and God in the form of a devotee. An Avatar’s devotees come with him and go away with him.</p>
<p>RAKHAL: So you must not go away alone, leaving us behind.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: The religious mendicants appear quite unexpectedly out of the blue. They sing and dance, and again they disappear quite unexpectedly. Hardly anyone recognizes their aspiration. Similarly, spiritual Masters appear and disappear without being recognized. <em>(Ramakrishna closes his eyes for a minute.)</em> I tell you all that a life without renunciation is no life at all. Renounce your ignorance. Renounce your knowledge. Renounce what you have and what you are.</p>
<p>NAREN: When I talk of renunciation some people get terribly annoyed with me.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: Naren, don’t be afraid of them. Say what you must say. It is through renunciation that you can and you will realise God. <em>(Caresses Naren.)</em> Much.</p>
<p>NAREN <em>(with a smile)</em>: What do you mean by “much"?</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: Much renunciation has been accomplished by you. Naren, I have told you many times that you have come into the world for me.</p>
<p>NAREN: I don’t quite understand what you say. Please explain it to me.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: You are here on earth to manifest me. I have already given you all that I have. I have nothing left.</p>
<p>NAREN: Do you mean that I have to believe all that you say to me?</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: You will not only believe me but make all of humanity believe who I am.</p>
<p>NAREN: You talk. I listen.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: True. But in the near future you are going to act.</p>
<p>NAREN: From the very dust of your feet you can give birth to millions of Narens like me.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: Stop, stop. From the very Heart of God, from the very Breath of God you have come. Naren, my Naren, with you I am complete.</p>
<p>NAREN: Thakur, in your heart I am fulfilled. At your feet I am perfect. <em>(Prostrates himself at Ramakrishna’s feet.)</em></p>  </div>
