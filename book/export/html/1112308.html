<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em>: It is not only possible but inevitable. The inner life and the outer life must go together. When we look at a flower, the first thing we notice is its beauty and fragrance. Then, after a few seconds, we see the purity it embodies. If we continue to look at it for two or three minutes, we will also see the divinity inside it. The beauty and fragrance that the flower radiates are the realities of its outer life, whereas the purity and divinity in the flower are the realities of its inner life. So when we look at a flower, first we see the outer life. Then if we continue to look at it most soulfully, we also see the inner life. But the outer life and the inner life are part and parcel of the same flower; they go together. Let us say the inner life is the seed. If there were no seed, then there would be no flower. The roots of the flower came from the seed itself. In exactly the same way, the outer life comes from the inner life. The inner life is deep within. From there we get the message of peace, love, joy, self-giving and oneness, and these qualities we offer in our outer life. But if there is a disharmony between the inner life and the outer life, then the outer life will not be successful and fruitful, and we will not be able to manifest our soul's divinity.</p>  </div>
