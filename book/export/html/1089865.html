<p>When we use God as our instrument, He is happy because He knows that we are doing the right thing. When we use God, God is happy because He feels that His son has wisdom and knows whom he can utilise. But when God uses us, we misunderstand. We feel that He is trying to lord it over us. Our life of aspiration is living proof of God's acceptance of us as chosen instruments.</p>  </div>
