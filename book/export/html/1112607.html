<p>In Geneva I met with the Vice President of the international Red Cross. He was very humble and modest. Our people sang the Red Cross song. It was a very soulful atmosphere that our singers created. Everything went well.</p>
<p>In Switzerland I also met with the Indian ambassador, who was extremely nice and very kind. Daily we went to three or four different places.</p>  </div>
