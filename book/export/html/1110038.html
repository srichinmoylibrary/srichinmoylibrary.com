<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In India we have many <em>mantras</em>. In the <em>Gita</em>, Sri Krishna says that the <em>Gayatri mantra</em> is the best of all the <em>mantras</em>. Its meaning is: "We meditate on the transcendental glory of the Deity Supreme, who is inside the heart of the earth, inside the life of the sky, and inside the soul of the Heaven. May He stimulate and illumine our minds." It is said that if one can recite this special <em>mantra</em> one hundred thousand times, then all his wishes will be fulfilled. Any desire, any aspiration, no matter how mighty, will be fulfilled.</p>  </div>
