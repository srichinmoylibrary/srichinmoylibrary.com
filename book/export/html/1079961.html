    <title>Question: I was brought up as a Roman Catholic, but when I grew up I stopped attending church. Now that I am again interested in the spiritual life, my mother cannot understand why I don&#039;t want to attend church again. How should I explain this to her?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can tell your mother that you studied in that particular school and you did not care for it. Now you are studying in a different school and you like the teacher, you like the students and you like what you are being taught. The Catholic Church teaches Truth, Light, Peace and Bliss. You are also trying to bring to the fore Truth, Light, Peace and Bliss in a different way. So if you take the Roman Catholic Church as a school and our spiritual organisation as another school, then you have every right to say that you like one particular school and not another, and that is why you are going to that school.</p>  </div>
