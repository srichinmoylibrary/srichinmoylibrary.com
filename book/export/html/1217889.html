 <p>
AUM 248-255. On July 20, 1967, from 7:00 to 7:30 P.M., Sri Chinmoy appeared on television for the first time. He was interviewed on the Government Station, W.I.P.R. (Channel B) in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The interviewer was Senor Hector Campos Parsi, a well-known musician and composer who has a weekly TV program in which he interviews persons prominent in the arts and sciences. Senor Parsi is also a man of deep philosophical insight and he has a particular interest in spiritual figures whom he invites to appear on his program whenever possible.</p>
<h2>Master Chinmoy, I have just introduced you in Spanish and explained some of your works that I have read in Spanish.</h2>

<p><em>Interviewer:</em> What is your mission now in Puerto Rico and how long will you stay here?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My mission here in Puerto Rico is to help the sincere seekers in their inner life and help them realise their spiritual perfection. I shall be staying here until August 6th and then I shall leave for New York where I have another Centre. We have two Centres, one here in Puerto Rico, the other in New York.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Master Chinmoy, is this the first time that you have been in Puerto Rico?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is my fourth visit. I was here exactly a year ago, last year in July. That was my first visit. Then I came here twice after that. So this is my fourth visit.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> How many people do you have working at the Aum Centre in Puerto Rico?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have here now fifty members, fifty sincere seekers, I must say. And there are many who are connected with the Centre but are unable to come to the meetings owing to family problems and so on.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Are they all well acquainted with philosophy? Are they students of different stages or are they all of the same level?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They attend the classes, they come to me to receive help and guidance in their self-realisation, but they are not of the same standard. Some of them are very well versed in both eastern and western philosophy, while others are not. All of them come to me and meditate with me and ask me spiritual questions to solve their inner and outer problems. The students range from absolute beginners to the most advanced aspirants.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Well, it is a very broad problem in order to attain to Realisation, is it not?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is a lifelong problem. To be accurate, a lifelong process. It depends on the individual. It may even take a few incarnations to achieve Realisation.</p>  </div>
