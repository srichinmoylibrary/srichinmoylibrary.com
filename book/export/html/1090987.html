    <title>Question: For the past year I have been practising concentration and meditation with my attention focused on my navel chakra. But I don&#039;t seem to be making as much progress as I would like in controlling my thoughts. Have you got any suggestions?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What you are doing is extremely good. We have six spiritual centres in the body. You are concentrating on the centre which is called <em>manipura</em>. This is the centre that usually is given most importance in Zen practice. From this centre, according to our Indian spiritual teachings, you get dynamic energy. If you use this divine energy for divine purpose, then you create. It you use it for an aggressive purpose, then you destroy.</p>
<p>Now if you want to control your thoughts, you should concentrate on the centre between the eyebrows. If you become very stiff and your concentration is intense, then you should not concentrate here for more than two minutes. Otherwise, you will become exhausted in the beginning. Now it you concentrate on the heart centre, you will get peace, love and joy. Try to hear the cosmic sound, the soundless sound, when you enter into the heart. If you bring love, joy, peace and bliss up from the heart to the centre between the eyebrows, then you will see that there will be no thoughts.</p>
<p>The heart is the safest place for you to concentrate and meditate. If you do this, automatically you will get purification because inside the heart is the soul, and the soul is one with the infinite. It is from here that you will get everything.</p>  </div>
