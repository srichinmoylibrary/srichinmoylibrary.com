<p>Before he read out one of his articles in his room, Nolini-da said: <em>"Bonne fęte ŕ Tapati, bonne fęte ŕ Madhuri.</em> Today I shall read out something of mine and something of Amrita's. Mine is not serious but Amrita's is."</p>
<p>The audience burst into laughter because it was always just the opposite.</p>
<p>After reading out his article, Nolini-da said: "We love our country dearly and our country has also loved us dearly and it always will. India's independence is nothing short of our soul's triumphant smile."</p>
<p>After he had read out Amrita-da's writing, he said: "Like last time, this time also Amrita's ending is abrupt. Amrita's writing is excellent but his conclusions are abrupt. It seems to me that this is Amrita's special speciality."</p>
<p>Amrita-da said: "Who else can or will bless me with a special speciality if not you, Nolini?"</p>  </div>
