<p>What is Yoga? Yoga is the language of God. If we wish to speak to God, we have to learn His language.</p>
<p>What is Yoga? Yoga is that which discloses God’s secret. If we wish to know God’s secret, we have to launch into the path of Yoga.</p>
<p>What is Yoga? Yoga is the Breath of God. If we wish to see through God's Eye and feel through His Heart, if we wish to live in God’s Dream and know God’s Reality, if we wish to possess the Breath of God, and finally if we wish to become God, Yoga will beckon us.</p>
<p>Yoga is union. It is the union of the individual soul with the Supreme Self. Yoga is the spiritual science that teaches us how the Ultimate Reality can be realised in life itself.</p>
<p>What we shall have to do is to accept life and fulfil the Divine in us here on earth. This can be effectuated only by transcending our human limitations.</p>
<p>Yoga tells us how far we have progressed in relation to God-realisation. It also tells us about our destined role in God's cosmic Drama. The final word of Yoga is that each human soul is a divine representative of God on earth.</p>
<p>Now let us focus our attention on the practical aspect of Yoga. There are various kinds of Yoga: Karma-Yoga (the path of action), Bhakti-Yoga (the path of love and devotion) and Jnana-Yoga (the path of knowledge). These three are considered to be the most important kinds of Yoga. There are other significant types of Yoga, but they are either branches of these three or closely related to them.</p>
<p>These three serve as three main gates of God's Palace. If we want to see and feel God as the sweetest and most intimate, then we have to practise Bhakti-Yoga; if we want to realise God in humanity through our selfless service, then we have to practise Karma-Yoga; if we want to realise the wisdom and glories of God's transcendental Self, then we have to practise Jnana-Yoga.</p>
<p>One thing is certain. These three paths lead us to self-Realisation in God-Realisation and God-Realisation in self-Realisation.</p>
