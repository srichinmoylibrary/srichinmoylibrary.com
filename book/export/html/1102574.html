<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At your journey's close, when you come and stand before God, He will not ask, "What did this person think of you?" or "What did that person think of you?" Since God is the Boss, He does not need others' recommendation. God will only ask, "What did you think of yourself?" or "What did you think of Me?" He is not going to ask if others appreciated you or admired you; He will only ask whether you paid attention to your life of aspiration and dedication.</p>
<p>Suppose someone speaks highly of you. Is that person really lifting you up to the top of the Himalayas? Again, by deprecating you, by speaking ill of you, someone cannot bring you down. World opinion has no value. You are to God what you actually are: what you think of yourself and what you think of God in yourself. Your assessment is your own value. Again, our assessment may not always be right. Sometimes we think we are pure although we are not; but no harm. When we make a wrong assessment, God is there to show us Compassion and Kindness. But God does not want us to waste a single minute worrying about what others think of us. Your life is God's Life. God's Life and your life are inseparable and God does not need the world's opinion to assess what you are doing. Your action is your certificate; your action is everything in God's Eye. If you are praying and meditating, you are an excellent seeker.</p>
