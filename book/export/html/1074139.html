  <h1 class="book-heading">&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; When you lift, do you lift our ignorance?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I lift, if I am identified with you, then definitely I lift your ignorance. And if you have identified yourself with me, then I do lift up your ignorance. Otherwise, when I lift, at that time my Beloved Supreme lifts up my own ignorance.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Is our ignorance as heavy as metal weights?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. Metal weights are nothing in comparison to ignorance-weight. To conquer jealousy or insecurity is infinitely more difficult than to lift up 7,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Practise, practise, practise! One day God's Grace will descend. If you practise lifting heavy weights for some time, then eventually you will be able to lift them. But to lift insecurity, jealousy, impurity, imperfection, doubt and so forth is a lifelong process. Each doubt, even an iota of doubt, is infinitely heavier than so-called metal weights. If you cannot lift up heavy weights, you are not going to lose anything precious. But if you do not conquer your ignorance, the ignorance that embodies doubt, suspicion, anxieties, insecurity, jealousy and so on, then you become the real loser. And these things are all heavier than the heaviest.</p>  </div>
