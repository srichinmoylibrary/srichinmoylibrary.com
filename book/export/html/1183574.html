<p>Insecurity not only creates sadness but is itself a form of sadness. However, if one smiles soulfully, spontaneously from the heart, at that time he can never feel insecure. Your soulful smile means the solid, concrete manifestation of light on earth. And this light comes from your conscious, inseparable oneness with everyone and everything. We are all one; we all are the limbs of the One, Absolute Supreme. Knowing this, we should have no sense of insecurity at any time.</p>  </div>
