<p>I wanted to tell God that I sincerely love Him. It was on the tip of my tongue. Alas, Satan came. As soon as I saw Satan, I totally forgot to tell God what I had intended to say.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell God that I need Him constantly. It was on the tip of my tongue. Alas, alas, Satan came at that very moment and ruined my inspiration. The very presence of Satan ruined all my joy, and I totally forgot to tell God what I had intended to say.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell God that I shall become unconditionally His most devoted instrument. It was all planned. It was on the tip of my tongue. Alas, Satan came and gave me an unwarranted frown. His frown took away all my inspiration, all my joy. All at once I felt miserable, and I enjoyed my misery to such an extent that I totally forgot to tell my Beloved Supreme what I had intended to say.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell my ignorance-friend that I would no longer speak to him. I had it all planned. It was on the tip of my tongue. Ah, who came to strengthen my promise? My Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell ignorance that from now on mine is the way of light, mine is the goal of delight, and that I must leave ignorance for good. It was on the tip of my tongue. Ah, who came to strengthen my promise? My eternally old, everlastingly old and, at the same time, ever-amazingly new friend, my Beloved Supreme.</p>
