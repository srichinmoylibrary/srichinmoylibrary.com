<p>Yesterday I was walking near the tennis courts behind P.S. 86 and Hillcrest High School. Six or seven young black boys saw me and started saying, "Ali, Ali, Ali! Champion 1999!" Then one of the boys told the others, "Shut up!" They were calling me Muhammad Ali!</p>
<p>Databir, Pulin and Bipin were following me in the car only 10 metres behind, but the boys didn't notice them.</p>
