<p>Sometimes five or ten days or even a month before I do something great, the cosmic gods and goddesses in Heaven know that I will do it and celebrate my achievement.</p>
<p>When I was about to lift 200 pounds for the first time, I saw that their celebration was already over. Here, I had not yet done it, but in Heaven the celebration was over.</p>
