<p>When I lived in Brooklyn on New Utrecht Avenue, I had to take three trains to get to work each day. Can you imagine? One train I took for only five blocks; then I had to change. The second train used to stop in Manhattan, but it did not go to Fifth Avenue, so I had to change again to go to the Consulate. But I was happy because I had so much time to meditate. I always used to sit at the side of the conductor. The last train left me on the other side of Central Park. Then in five minutes I used to come walking across the park to the Consulate.</p>
<p>In January 1966 there was a general transit strike for two weeks and I had to walk to work each day and home again in the evening. It was a very severe winter and there was snow everywhere.</p>
