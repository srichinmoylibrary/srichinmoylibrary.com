<p>If you want to lose weight, there is no middle path. Buddha spoke of the middle path. But if you want to lose weight, you have to go to the extreme — starve unto death. Then you can fly when you run.</p>
<p>Saturday I was under a hundred and forty pounds. Then I ran in a two-mile race. During the race I felt that I had conquered the world, but after the race I felt tired and exhausted. Then relaxation started, and I gained four pounds.</p>
