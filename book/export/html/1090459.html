<p>A few of these stories are based on my own experiences, while others are ancient stories. There I do not claim even an iota of originality. The original authors are buried in oblivion, but the successors are following in the foot steps of their predecessors with gorgeous embellishment. I, too, have indulged lavishly in my own way of embellishment. Long live my humour-wisdom-flooded predecessors, who loved anonymity. May these stories liberate us from the heavy dryness of the mind, and may they transform the dryness of the mind into an ever-blossoming fountain-ecstasy.</p>  </div>
