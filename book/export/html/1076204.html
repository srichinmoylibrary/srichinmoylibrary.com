<p>Disobedience,<br /> Can you not try to be<br /> God's worthy rival<br /> By offering Him your<br /> Ignorance-mountain<br /> And<br /> Ignorance-ocean?<br /> Can you not try to become<br /> His Eternity's choicest instrument,<br /> Him to love,<br /> Him to fulfil in His own Way?<br /> Do not forget<br /> That you are of God.<br /> Do not forget<br /> That you are for God<br /> ONLY.</p>
