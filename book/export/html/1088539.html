<p>The Vedas are the most ancient scriptures in the library of consciously evolving humanity. For our own conscious evolution, we may be inspired to read the Vedas by Professor Max Müller's encouragement: "I maintain that for everybody who cares for himself, for his ancestors, for his history, for his intellectual development, a study of Vedic literature is indispensable."</p>
<p>When Max Müller extolled India to the skies, he was sincere in his praise. It came from the depths of his heart. He undoubtedly loved India.</p>
<p>He writes, "If I were to look over the whole world to find out the country most richly endowed with all the wealth, power and beauty that nature can bestow — in some parts a very paradise on earth — I should point to India."</p>  </div>
