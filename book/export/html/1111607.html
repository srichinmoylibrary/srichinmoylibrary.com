<p>I started my life of competition in Santa Barbara on 5 June 1979 with a three-mile race. My pace was 7:43. For the first four hundred metres I was running with excellent runners at a six-minute pace. Then everything went blank; I couldn't see anything. After that I started walking for a while.</p>
