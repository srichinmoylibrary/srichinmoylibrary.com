<p>My sincerity speaks:<br /> God, I need You.<br /> God's sincerity speaks:<br /> "Daughter, I need you<br /> More than you need Me."<br /> Father, why?<br /> Why do You need me<br /> More than I need You?<br /> "Daughter,<br /> My daughter,<br /> I need you more than you need Me<br /> Because I know what you really are:<br /> On earth you are My only hope,<br /> In Heaven you are My only promise."</p>
