<p><em>(The Buddha and his disciples are in the forest. All of a sudden a dacoit named Angulimal enters.)</em></p>
<p>ANGULIMAL: Stop! Stop!</p>
<p>BUDDHA: I have already stopped. It is you who have not stopped. You have killed hundreds of people. You wear a garland of thumbs around your neck. I have already stopped; I am stationed in the infinite Consciousness forever. But you are still roaming in the world of vital desires and trying to destroy the world. You have not yet come to a halt. In my case, I am already in the static silence of the Ineffable.</p>
<p><em>(Angulimal pulls out a knife and attempts to stab the Buddha, but the Buddha's Light captures him. He falls at the feet of the Buddha.)</em></p>
<p>ANGULIMAL: O Buddha, forgive me. Forgive my ignorance. Forgive me for what I have done to the world, and for what I was going to do right now to you.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: I have forgiven you. I have forgiven your past; I have forgiven your present.</p>
<p>ANGULIMAL: If it is true that you have forgiven my past and my present, then I wish you to prove it.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: How do you want me to prove it?</p>
<p>ANGULIMAL: Accept me as your disciple. If you accept me as your disciple, then I will believe that you have truly forgiven me, O Lord.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: You are my disciple, Angulimal. I accept you.</p>  </div>
