<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual essence of Beethoven's sound-creation-manifestation is that the outer life can be harmonised, liberated and fulfilled by the soul's conscious guidance of the physical in us. Even if the outer life starts from the darkest ignorance, it has hope. It begins its journey with hope; but eventually its total transformation, illumination and perfection become certain.</p>
<p>When Beethoven's music starts, it gives the feeling of a mad elephant, first striking this side, then that side. We can imagine it striking one wall, then moving to the other side and striking another wall; but it is moving, moving â€” constant movement. Then after getting a few blows, after breaking heads here and there, the movement goes toward the goal. Whether we call it soulful movement, vital movement or something else, it eventually reaches the goal.</p>  </div>
