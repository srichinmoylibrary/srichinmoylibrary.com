    <title>Question: In the East there is more of a tradition of seeking a teacher like this. But in the West we are more into being individual. Could you comment on that please?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What you are saying right now does not apply. There was a time when the West did not feel the need of a teacher. But now the West does. Now you see the Indian Masters are coming and many people go to them to get inner instruction. There was a time when the West felt that it was beneath its dignity to listen to Eastern philosophy. But right now Eastern philosophy is not only accepted but embraced by the Western world.</p>  </div>
