<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is both my Father and my Mother. I meditate on my Father-God for my illumination and perfection. I pray to my Mother-God for Her Compassion and Affection. When I wish to hear the song of the Infinite in the heart of the finite, I go to my Father-God. When I wish to hear the song of the finite in the soul of the Infinite, I go to my Mother-God.</p>
<p>My heart’s streaming tears in no time reach my Mother-God. My soul’s beaming joys reach my Father-God sooner than the soonest. My Mother-God proudly tells the whole world who I am: I am God’s choice instrument. My Father-God smilingly tells the whole world what my ultimate goal is. My ultimate goal is to serve both my Father-God and my Mother-God unconditionally while they are transforming today’s man into tomorrow’s God.</p>
<p>Every day in the small hours of the morning my Mother-God says to me, “How are you today, My child?” And my Father-God says to me, “What are your plans today, My son?” Late at night when I am about to retire, my Mother-God tells me, “My child, sweet dreams, sweet dreams.” And my Father-God tells me, “My son, do not dream of escaping from harsh reality. Fight bravely against ignorance-night. Be victorious! Your Mother and I are all for you.”</p>
<p>A sweet conversation in my fragrance-heart-garden: I say to my Mother-God, “Mother, You forgive me almost immediately when I do something wrong. How is it and why is it that when I do something wrong, Father, instead of forgiving me, illumines me? And that He does so slowly — although steadily and unerringly. Why, why?”</p>
<p>My Mother-God says to me, “My child, your Father is the one who has to answer this question."</p>
<p>My Father-God says to me, “My child, your Mother’s quick Forgiveness does not necessarily change your nature, but My Illumination can and does change your nature. Yes, it always does.”</p>
<p>My Mother-God says to my Father-God, “But if I do not forgive My child first, how on earth are You going to illumine him?”</p>
<p>My Father-God, heaving a smilingly tearful sigh, says, “Oh, I see! I helplessly agree with You.”</p>  </div>
