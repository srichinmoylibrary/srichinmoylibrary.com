<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can help only by becoming soulful and fruitful as individuals. If our conscious day-to-day existence becomes soulful and fruitful in our thought-world, in our speech-world and in our self-giving-world, then we can easily help people in a physical way.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>Flame Waves, part 9</em>, Agni Press, 1978<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/fw-238</p></small>    </div>  </body>
