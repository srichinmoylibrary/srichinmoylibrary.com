<h2>Editor's note</h2>

<p><em>The following is a translation of a Bengali poem which was written by Chinmoy in Pondicherry, India, on August 14th, 1945 — the day before Sri Aurobindo's Birth Day. Chinmoy was then thirteen years old.</em></p>
<p><em>The poem became a song in New York on July 8th, 1995 — fifty years later. It is the longest song in Sri Chinmoy's musical opus.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy began translating this Bengali poem into English on June 9th, 1996. He completed the translation on August 4th so that it might be released on August 15th of that year.</em></p>  </div>
