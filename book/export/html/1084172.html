<p>   With bubbling enthusiasm<br /> He launched into the path of yoga.<br />   With doubting uncertainty<br /> He walked along the path.<br />   With his destructive impatience,<br />   With his devouring personality,<br /> He left the path,<br /> Only to become once again<br /> What he was before:<br />        A monkey with a<br />        Sesquipedalian tail.</p>
