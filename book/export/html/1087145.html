<p>While I was in a music store, a young man came up to me and said, "Sri Chinmoy a few years ago I went to one of your concerts and you played one Indian instrument very intensely. Afterwards, you chanted 'Aum' five times. When you chanted 'Aum' the fifth time, you exploded into white light. Later I told my experience to Fred Lebow, but he didn't believe me."</p>
<p>The young man asked me about the United Nations. He was speaking with such respect.</p>
<p>Then he admitted to me that he cannot tune any of his instruments. He said his workers tune them.</p>
<p>I said to him, "I can't tune my instruments either."</p>
