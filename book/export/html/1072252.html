    <title>&lt;em&gt;Second interviewer:&lt;/em&gt; I think, though, that a lot of people will look upon somebody who is meditating and so on as kind of weird, bizarre or mystical. How do you counter that feeling?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now let them cherish this false notion. But a day will come when we are in a position to offer or reveal our inner qualities and then they will be able to recognise their folly. So let them assess us in their own way. Let us offer to the world at large what we have to offer. A day will come when they will be able to recognise their mistake.</p>
<p><em>First interviewer:</em> Thank you very much for coming today, Sri Chinmoy. I think people will now want to at least try meditation and see if it works for themselves.</p>  </div>
