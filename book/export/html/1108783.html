<hr /><ol><li id="fn1"><p>PCPS 7. On 23 February 1998, Sri Chinmoy was advised by Mr. Gianfranco Costa, President of the International Centre for Peace Among People (Assisi, Italy) that he had been selected as the 1998 recipient of the international <em>Pilgrim of Peace Award</em> for the “international significance of your activities for a culture of peace.”</p>
<p>The first recipient of this prestigious Award was President Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev (1988). Other recipients include United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, His Holiness Pope John Paul II and Mother Teresa.</p>
<p>At Sri Chinmoy’s request, the Award ceremony was held in Rome on 16 May 1998, two days prior to Pope John Paul II’s 78th birthday, as a special birthday offering to the Pope.</p>
<p>The ceremony was held on 16 May 1998 at the Galleria Palazzo Colonna, Rome, Italy; and was attended by many distinguished international ambassadors and Italian representatives.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
