<p>I refuse to accept the stone-blind opinion<br /> Of those who declare that Netaji's I.N.A.<br /> Was an absolute failure in every way.<br /> True, he lost on the battlefield,<br /> But in terms of bringing about Indian unity,<br /> He was the only leader to unite<br /> Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis, Sikhs<br /> And other religious faiths.<br /> He wanted all his brothers and sisters<br /> To join together and give their very lives<br /> To bring about India's freedom.<br /> They did it-proudly and happily.<br /> Is this not the greatest victory?</p>
