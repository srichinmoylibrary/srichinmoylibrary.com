<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God works very hard day and night. Sometimes He needs rest. He was clever enough to do something. Boyfriends and girlfriends think of each other all the time; they don’t think of God. So if they don’t think of God, God does not have to worry. They can think of each other and He can take rest.</p>  </div>
