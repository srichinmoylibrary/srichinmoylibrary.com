<p>Today I went to a store where they have very beautiful glasses. I asked if they were sunglasses, and the man in the store said, "Yes."</p>
<p>As soon as I put the first pair on, the man said, "Very nice, now you can read."I said, "I don't need glasses to read."</p>
<p>Then immediately my eyes started burning. I said, "They are very powerful. I don't need these."</p>
<p>The second pair also started giving me pain, so the man said, "You should go to an eye specialist."</p>
<p>If they had been sunglasses, they would not have burned my eyes!</p>
