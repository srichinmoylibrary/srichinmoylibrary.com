<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one does not seek God, he will never realise Him. A humanitarian will never be able to realise God unless he consciously enters onto a spiritual path. He may be sincere, he may help others, he may do good things for the rest of the world; but that is not enough to realise God. To realise God one must have aspiration.</p>
<p>In order to be of real inner service to mankind, we have to get divine qualities from God. Unless and until we have these divine qualities, what can we offer to humanity? Those who are really helping mankind are doing so at the express command of God.</p>  </div>
