<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is growing like anything. Previously it was like a hard rock, but now we feel that it is like fertile soil. It is responding. It is not only because we are praying and meditating, but because the U.N. members also have an inner urge to do the right thing, to grow into the divine light. It works in two ways. We will never say that we are working very hard and that is why we are getting the benefit. No. I have taken one step ahead and you have also taken one step ahead. So we are coming to a meeting point. The inner world is coming forward with its inner wealth and the outer world is then entering into the inner world with its aspiration. So they are meeting together.</p>  </div>
