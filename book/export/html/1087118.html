<p>In Puerto la Cruz we went to buy a chair. We saw a chair like the one I have in New York, but I didn't like the price. I wanted to bargain the price down, but the lady in the store wouldn't bargain, so we went to another store. There I liked a chair which was from Italy.</p>
<p>Shubhra said to the saleslady, "Can you lower the price?" Then Shubhra said, "This morning we were with President Lusinchi in Caracas."</p>
<p>The lady immediately lowered the price. She told us that when Saraswati and Savyasachi had been in another store they showed a pamphlet of me with some big shots. She happened to have been in that other store at that time. So she lowered the price even lower than Shubhra asked because I was a big shot.</p>
