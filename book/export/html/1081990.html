<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If a disciple can have a life of constant and conscious surrender to the Master, then he will always be most dear. If his surrender is constant and conscious, if he becomes a conscious, constant and surrendered instrument in the heart of his Master or at the feet of his Master, then he will always remain a first-class disciple. Otherwise, there is a possibility of his descending.</p>  </div>
