<p>On the 22nd of September 1962 Mridu passed away.</p>

<p>Unwarned by the Grim Reaper, unweighted with years<br /> In silence off she shuffled her mortal frame.<br /> A ceaseless fount spraying pure joy was she,</p>
<p>Her heart all sweet with the zeal of a daring flame.<br /> Her heavy boat plied from shore to shore unrhymed<br /> Of blooming, quiescent or withering souls.<br /> A snow-white train of humour with rosy thrill<br /> Her presence called forth in persons of varied roles.</p>
<p>She served her Father divine, the Lord of the gods,<br /> With earthly manna savoured with her soul's delight.<br /> Her heart's up-brimming transport she shared with all.<br /> Mridu, His dove, flew quick to His golden Height.</p>
<p>She bodied forth a climbing, sleepless love,<br /> Her Parents blessed her life with bending Grace.<br /> A unique prayer the child from Him received;<br /> Behold, ecstasy's emblem grew her face.</p>
<p>â€” Chinmoy</p>

<p>Sri Aurobindo wrote for Mridu the following to be used by her as her prayer:</p>
<p><em>"I pray to be purified from self-will and self-assertion so that I may become docile and obedient to the Mother and a fit instrument for her work, surrendered and guided by her Grace in all I do."</em></p>  </div>
