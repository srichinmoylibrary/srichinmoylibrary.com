<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are Indian leaders in India to offer the Indians advice. For me there is no India, there is no America. I am a spiritual man. For a spiritual man, geography has no meaning. Geography cannot bind a spiritual man. The Creator feels that the entire creation belongs to Him. So the whole world is one if you are one with the Creator.</p>  </div>
