<p>I had an enjoyable day attending the Sri Chinmoy Centre Mothers' and Sons' Banquet with my son Jason. It was inspiring to listen to Guru's speech and hear him answer questions. I found it a delight to meet the other mothers. The food was delicious and the gifts and flowers we received made a lasting impression.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for everything.</p>
