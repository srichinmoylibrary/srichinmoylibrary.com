<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If it is a positive inner wave, then intensify it, for intensification has the inner urge for manifestation. If it is a negative inner wave and you are not strong enough to transform it, then just silence it. But if you are exceptionally strong in the mental world and vital world, then transform the negative wave into a positive one. If you have great capacity, then transformation is the answer, for transformation increases satisfaction. But if you do not have great capacity, then destruction offers the second-best satisfaction.</p>  </div>
