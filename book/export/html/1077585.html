<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Energy is something fluid: like consciousness, it spreads itself everywhere in an infinite expanse. Energy is like the immense expanse of water in the ocean. It is a dynamic liquid in constant flux. If you enter into the inner world, you will see that energy is flowing and very dynamic. The soul, on the other hand, can take any form it likes. One moment it can be smaller than an atom and the next moment it can be vaster than the Vast.</p>
<p>Energy and the soul must go together. If there is no divine energy in the soul, then the soul cannot manifest anything. Again, if there is energy in the being but the consciousness of the soul is not brought forward, then realisation will not take place. So the two are interlinked. For realisation, energy needs the soul; and for manifestation, the soul needs energy.</p>  </div>
