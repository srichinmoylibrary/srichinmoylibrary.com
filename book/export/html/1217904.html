<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The vital and the body do not have a separate mission. But when they collaborate with the soul's mission, it becomes theirs too. The vital hungers for name and fame, which are only aims. When the vital identifies itself with the soul and willingly accepts the soul's mission then the soul's mission undoubtedly becomes the mission of the vital.</p>  </div>
