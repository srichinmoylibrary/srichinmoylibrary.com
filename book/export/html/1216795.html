<p>When I went to see Connors play Nastase in the U.S. Open at the National Tennis Center, Databir and Ashrita had gotten me a very expensive ticket. The usher showed me to my seat, which was in the front row.</p>
<p>After some time the man sitting beside me said to me, "I am so and so. Would you please show me your ticket?"</p>
<p>I gave him my ticket. He began looking at it and scratching his head. It was definitely the correct ticket for that seat. He asked, "How could they put you here?" According to him, his party had the whole box.</p>
<p>Then, after five minutes, he again asked for my ticket. That time I said, "Please don't bother me anymore. You saw the usher put me here."</p>
<p>His friends also were annoyed with him. After that he didn't bother me anymore.</p>
