<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best that you can expect from your mind is mental illumination and your mind's acceptance of your heart. The heart has accepted the soul as its advisor; similarly, the mind has to accept the heart as its advisor. The mind has not accepted a teacher: it wants to remain its own teacher. But it should have the heart as its teacher. The best thing you can <em>ask</em> of the mind is for it to accept the heart's blessingful advice. The best thing you can <em>expect</em> from the mind is mental illumination. Illumination of the mind is the most important thing, and this illumination of the mind can take place only when the mind really goes to the heart, the aspiring heart and becomes totally one with the heart.</p>  </div>
