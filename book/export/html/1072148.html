<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you pray and meditate, please feel that the love that you have is not to possess or to bind anyone. The love that you have is only for expansion, only for the illumination of others. When you want to give someone your divine love, it means that you want to see that person as you see yourself: you want to see him as an exact replica of your own life. You give so that you will see him as an extension of yourself. When you meditate, you have to tell the Supreme that what He has given you, that very thing you want to share with your brothers. You can share with those around you; it is not only possible, but it is inevitable.</p>  </div>
