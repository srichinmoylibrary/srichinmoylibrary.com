<p><em>(The World-soul, the soul of England and the soul of America in the Abode of the ever-transcending Heights.)</em></p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> My sweet daughter, England-soul, are you not happy now? Possession is not happiness. Renunciation is happiness. And if renunciation is God-ordained, then it is perfect happiness. It was God who wanted you to renounce your possession-authority. Look, now your daughter America is happy and you are happy. Needless to say, I am happy too.</p>
<p><em>Soul of England:</em> Mother, once I was temptation-possession, but now I am illumination-oneness. And I unmistakably and gratefully know that it was all your doing.</p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> My daughter, what we need to know is not so much whose doing it was, but whether the thing is done. I am glad beyond measure that the thing is done, the right thing is done.</p>
<p><em>Soul of America:</em> Grandmother, Mother has taught me many nice things, and two things I treasure most: her mind's lofty nobility and her life's non-sentimental, or non-emotional but measured and confident progress along the road of Eternity's perfection.</p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> You are absolutely right, my granddaughter. Now I would like both you and your mother to do me a big favour. Please sing me the song that says, "My Captain says go on."</p>
<p><em>(The souls of England and America sing:</em></p>

<p>There was a time when I stumbled and stumbled,<br /> But now I only climb and climb beyond<br /> And far beyond my Goal's endless Beyond,<br /> And yet my Captain commands: "Go on, go on!"</p>

<p><em>And then they sing:</em></p>

<p>America, America, America!<br /> Great you are, good you are,<br /> Brave you are, kind you are.<br /> O my America, America.<br /> Your Heaven-freedom is earth’s aspiration-choice.<br /> With you, in you, is God-Hour’s Victory-Voice.</p>
