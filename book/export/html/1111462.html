  <h1 class="book-heading">A race for the military</h1>
  
 
<p>In California we held a race especially for the military. Unfortunately, they heard about it only at the eleventh hour, so there were hardly ten runners. Our runners joined them.</p>
<p>The race began at seven o'clock in the morning. Around five-thirty I got inspiration to compose a song on the military. I didn't know that there were women in the military. Later I saw that four or five women soldiers were there.</p>
<p>One of the high-ranking officers came over to me and said, "This time we have very few people, but next time it won't be like this. We deeply admire your races." He took off his jacket and showed me one of our T-shirts. He said, "I run all of your races."</p>
