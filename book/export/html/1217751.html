    <title>Question: I understand. But in order to find out whether I am reaching that for which I am seeking, if I am doing this correctly very often, with the inner self, I may not recognise it to be the true inner self. I do not know whether this is the inner voice or the outer voice and this is extremely confusing.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I fully understand. But if you get a teacher who is a realised soul, you can go to him for help and find out if what you are doing is correct. Or, if you do not get a spiritual teacher, what you could do... please go deep, deep within and see if you get a voice or a thought or an idea — just go deep into the voice or thought or idea — and see if that gives you a kind of inner joy or peace, where all questions end, where there is no question, no problem. When you get this kind of peace and inner joy, you can feel whether the voice that you have heard is correct and whether it is the inner voice and whether it will help you in your inner and spiritual life.</p>
<p><em>Questioner:</em> Thank you very much.</p>  </div>
