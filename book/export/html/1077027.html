<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On very rare occasions, if the dream occurs on a very high plane, and if the disciple is very spiritual and devoted and sincere, then the message can be really true. But many times the dream will come from the vital plane. The disciple carrying the message will have his own likes and dislikes and vital propensities. This kind of dream you cannot believe.</p>
<p>Every day I hear hundreds of juicy stories about what “Guru has said.” This is on the physical plane. But those who are saying this do not go to the length of saying that I have asked them to give you a message. No! They only say, “Guru has said this, Guru has said that.” Where, when, to whom they do not mention. The context in which I said it they totally forget. In order to gain prominence, in order to make others feel they are close to the Master, they say this. I cannot be responsible for their message at that time. So you have to be on your guard. Each disciple has his own personality; this personality may enter into the message that you are going to get and it can be totally wrong.</p>  </div>
