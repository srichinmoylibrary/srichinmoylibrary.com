<p><em>(At Cambridge. The Principle had sent for Aurobindo. Aurobindo was very bashful; it was not in his nature to come to the fore.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter Aurobindo)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Good morning, Sir.</p>
<p>PRINCIPAL: Ah, at last you have come. Better late than never. I have sent for you three times.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Sorry, Sir, please excuse me. I was a bit busy then.</p>
<p>PRINCIPAL: My dear boy, nothing wrong with you, I suppose? Now, I come to the point: your essay on Milton. I have never seen such a wonderful piece by an undergrad since I came over here. You have headed the list</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(Bashfully smiling)</em> Thank you, Sir, it is so kind of you. If there was any inspiration, it must have been from the great subject of the essay himself.</p>  </div>
