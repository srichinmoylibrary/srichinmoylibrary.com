<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us try to feed the Supreme with our meditation and aspiration. For my disciples, the easiest and most effective way of doing a good meditation is to enter into me, into my consciousness. Try to remain in my consciousness twenty-four hours a day. Then only can you rest assured that you are really safe in our boat. Otherwise, you may try to leave the boat. Then I will have to jump out of the boat and enter into the sea of ignorance to rescue you. Also, to get a good meditation, one has to have inner discipline and one has to know what the truth is, what aspiration is. This requires time. If God-realisation is your sole wish, then I wish to say, please meditate well.</p>  </div>
