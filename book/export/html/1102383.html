<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Those who come here to meditate want to try to walk along the inner road. The inner road is the road of sincere dedication to the highest cause. We try in every way to lead a more illumining and more fulfilling life and to do the right thing from the highest point of view. The inner world embodies peace, light and bliss in boundless measure, whereas the outer world right now does not embody these qualities. So in our meditation meetings we try to establish a free access to the inner world by virtue of our inner cry and soulful meditation.</p>
