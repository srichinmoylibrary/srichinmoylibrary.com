  <h1 class="book-heading">I have played my role</h1>
  
 
<p>I sincerely feel I have played my role; I have done enough. I feel I have done my share. Other spiritual Masters, great spiritual figures, played their roles. Some left the earth when they were on the right side of forty, while others were on the right side of sixty or seventy.</p>
<p>I do not know, or perhaps I do know, when the hour will strike. But I do feel I have done a few things for the betterment of the world. When we see the outer situation, we feel that the present-day world has gone down considerably. But there is also another world. We call it the inner world. In the inner world a few things have been established, and those things are very, very solid. There the foundation is very strong.</p>
<p>If not this generation, the future generation will be able to derive tremendous benefit from what my students and I have accomplished here on earth.</p>
<p>If you can dive deep within, you are bound to feel that my statement is true, absolutely true.</p>
