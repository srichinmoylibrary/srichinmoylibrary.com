<p>The Consul General’s junior secretary was Mr. Ramanathan. He often gave talks on Hinduism and he used to invite me to go and listen.</p>
<p>In 1994, Dr. Jayaraman-ji, the Executive Director of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (USA), invited me to a special Indian cultural performance at Queens­borough Community College. He wanted to dedicate the performance to my mother for her centenary.</p>
<p>At the performance an Indian man came up to me and said, “Ghose, do you recognise me?”</p>
<p>“I do not recognise you,” I said.</p>
<p>“You cannot recognise me because you have become a big shot!” was his reply.</p>
<p>“Please tell me your name.”</p>
<p>“I am Ramanathan.”</p>
<p>O God, as soon as he said the name, I knew who he was. “From your name I can recognise you, but not from your face,” I told him. His face was completely changed. Old age has heavily descended upon him.</p>  </div>
