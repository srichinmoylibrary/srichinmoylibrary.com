<p>In our marathon today I was watching Sarita run. I thought, "If you have will power and strength, who cares about extra body weight?" She has tremendous strength from practising for five or six years. Five or six years ago she would sometimes faint when she ran. Now she is so strong!</p>
<p>Sarita and Snigdha were running together. Sarita looked like a mountain and Snigdha looked like a Lilliputian next to her.</p>
