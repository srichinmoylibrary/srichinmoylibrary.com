<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme sheds ceaseless and endless tears when people take steroids because it is completely against His Will. From the spiritual point of view, people who enjoy that life are complete failures. Anything against nature is against God. Nature is God the Mother. So if you violate the rules and principles of God the Mother, then how can God the Father tolerate it? He becomes very sad and disappointed when nature's rules are violated in any way.</p>
<p>With our aspiration, we can get everything inside the heart of nature, Mother Earth. But human beings do not take help from her. They take pills and adopt artificial means. Then, sooner than the soonest, this stupidity destroys their health, destroys their retentive faculties, plus many, many divine things, good things, world-inspiring things which they could have done otherwise.</p>  </div>
