<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you aspire for the inner cry, you should know that that very cry comes from God's Concern and Compassion. So the most important thing is to offer your gratitude. If you offer gratitude, then immediately your inner cry increases. It becomes continuous and constant. When you offer gratitude, your inner cry mounts to the highest.</p>  </div>
