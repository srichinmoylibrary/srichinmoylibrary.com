<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is true; faith is a gift. Every good quality is a gift from God. But faith you can also develop. Faith came, and everybody had an opportunity to become divine. But still there are quite a few who are not exercising their faith. Faith can be developed like a muscle. Today you have little faith, tomorrow you will have more faith in yourself and in God.</p>
<p>Again, faith is like a box with a jewel inside. We have the box, but we are not opening the box in order to see the jewel. If we go to the Source we will see that we have faith in infinite measure. An infinite supply we have inside ourselves as an achievement or as a reality. But we are not utilising it; we are neglecting this quality of faith.</p>  </div>
