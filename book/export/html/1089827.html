<p><em>Francisco Matos Paoli:</em> And what is the relationship of the mystic with the world of limitation?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He can live on earth very firmly and well established, like a boat in the water. The boat is in the water, but it is not affected by the water. You live inside this house, but you are not bound by this house. You can neglect it or you can make it better. You are the lord of this house. In this way the true mystic lives with humanity. The mystic has the capacity to illumine the consciousness of mankind, to change the world, illumine the world, to make it more divine and more perfect.</p>  </div>
