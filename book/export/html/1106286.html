  <h1 class="book-heading">Weightlifting and inner poise</h1>
  
 
<p>Among the spiritual qualities that I have, my inner poise is first and foremost. And this is the quality you can see in one of the pictures when I am lifting 3,000 pounds. There is no tension in this picture.</p>
<p>When people believe that by spiritual power I have lifted 3,000 pounds, when it is all settled in the mind-world, then only I shall show this picture. Otherwise, people will not believe that I am lifting that much weight. Once they believe it, I will show the picture.</p>
<p>When Mahasamrat heard the news, he said, “I won’t believe it!” And then he said, “I have to believe it!”</p>
