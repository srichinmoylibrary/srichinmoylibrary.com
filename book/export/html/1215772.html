<p>I saw Him,<br /> But<br /> I forgot to ask Him his Name.<br /> Yet His Compassion loves me.</p>
<p>I dined with Him,<br /> But<br /> I forgot to ask Him His Address.<br /> Yet His Compassion loves me.</p>
<p>I sang with Him,<br /> But<br /> I have forgotten the Tune.<br /> Yet His Compassion loves me.</p>
<p>I danced with Him,<br /> But<br /> I have forgotten the cadence.<br /> Yet His Compassion loves me.</p>
<p>I played with Him,<br /> But<br /> I forgot to smile at Him.<br /> Yet His Compassion loves me.</p>
