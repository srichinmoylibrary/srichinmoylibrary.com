<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He has to be very careful in every way, beginning with the mind. He has to feel that his mind is a room that has a few doors and windows which will let the whole world inside. The seeker has to close the doors and windows and stand at a particular door. Then he must allow inside only the thoughts and ideas that are going to help him in his spiritual life. Purity, peace, harmony, and so on â€” these are his friends. So he will allow them to enter into his mind-room and he will converse only with them. This is how the individual can practise.</p>  </div>
