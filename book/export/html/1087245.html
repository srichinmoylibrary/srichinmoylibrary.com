<p>Vinaya and I went to buy potatoes with broccoli. We ordered 16. The man at the window said, "Are you kidding?" He didn't believe we wanted 16 potatoes.</p>
<p>We paid him and asked how long it would take. He said it would take two minutes. Then we didn't believe him!</p>
<p>First he didn't believe us; then we didn't believe him. So we went away to do something else. When we came back in five or six minutes, our order was already waiting for us.</p>
