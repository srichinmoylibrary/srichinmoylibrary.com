<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly he can. Even if he does not consciously spread it, his very presence will spread it. It is like this. The very nature of a flower is to spread fragrance. The flower may not talk to you or tell you, "Look, I have purity! I am now giving it to you; so take it, take it!" No. But the very fact that you are near a flower will immediately bring you purity. If you have something, if you have a dollar, you can give it to me. Again, if you don't give it to me, then I don't get it. It is up to you. But when it is a matter of purity, even if you don't want to give it, already it is spreading, because purity is something divine. Anything that is undivine will bind you and try to bind others. But anything that is divine you cannot bind; you cannot hold it back. It is free, absolutely free; it is immortal, eternal. When you have purity, automatically it will flow. If you stand in front of a saint, your whole being becomes purified. His very presence makes you pure. A spiritual Master, by his very presence, spreads Peace, Light and Bliss. When he comes in front of you, he spreads it. He can't hold it. Always it is going out.</p>  </div>
