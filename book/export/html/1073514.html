<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> Not really, because I donâ€™t start in the outer world; I am in my own world. At the 200-metre relay, I blow kisses, sign autographs. There is no pressure from outside because I am having a good time. All the time I am very relaxed, confident, with nothing to worry about. I feel peace of mind.</p>  </div>
