  <h1 class="book-heading">Truth</h1>
  
 
<p>Truth: earthly truth, Heavenly Truth, eternal Truth, universal Truth, Transcendental Truth and Supreme Truth. Earthly truth my body needs. Heavenly Truth my vital needs. Eternal Truth my mind needs. Universal Truth my heart needs. Transcendental Truth my central being needs. The Supreme Truth my soul needs.</p>
<p>Earthly truth awakens my sleeping body. Heavenly Truth disciplines my restless vital. Eternal Truth illumines my sighing mind. Universal Truth liberates my crying heart. Transcendental Truth immortalises my central being. The Supreme Truth expedites my soul’s God-manifesting aspiration here on earth.</p>
<p>Truth is beauty. Beauty inspires a God-seeker to see God’s Face of eternal Beauty. Truth is peace. Peace inspires a God-seeker to feel God’s Heart of infinite Peace. Truth is power. Power inspires a God-seeker to watch God’s Eye of immortal Power. Truth is compassion. Compassion inspires a God-seeker to sit at God’s Feet of all-forgiving Compassion.</p>
<p>Truth frightens a weak mind in a human being. Truth enlightens a strong heart in a human being.</p>
<p>Truth nourishes the self-giving seekers. Truth treasures the God-realised souls.</p>
<p>Although man and truth are one, man cannot replace truth, but truth can easily replace man. How and why? Because man is by nature earth-bound and truth is always Heaven-free.</p>
<p>Although truth and God are one, truth cannot replace God, but God can easily replace truth. How and why? Because truth is the Creation. The Creation cannot become inseparably one with the Creator at its sweet will. But the Creator can easily become inseparably one with His Creation. Something more, the Creator can easily remain, eternally remain, infinitely higher than the Creation’s reach. But, out of His infinite Bounty, the Creator keeps Himself inseparably one, eternally one and—to our wide surprise—unconditionally one with His Creation. </p>
