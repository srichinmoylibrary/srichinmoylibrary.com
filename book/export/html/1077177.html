<p>Music has a universal appeal; it elevates human consciousness. Music glorifies the human in the divine and the divine in the human. The human is the eternal thirst; the divine is the eternal satisfaction. Einstein the musician consoled, energised, harmonised, benefited and universalised Einstein the scientist. Music not only kindled the flame of aspiration in him but also illumined his human thought-world. <em>“I often think in music. I live my daydreams in terms of music,”</em> he declared.</p>  </div>
