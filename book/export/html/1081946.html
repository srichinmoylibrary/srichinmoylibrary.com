    <title>Question: In one of your books you said, &amp;quot;If you want to see God, you have to meditate twelve hours a day. If you want to come face to face with God, you have to meditate twenty-four hours a day.&amp;quot; Is that possible?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible. When you are on the verge of realisation, you will see that it is quite possible, because at that time you have acquired considerable capacity. Even while you are eating, you will see that you are meditating. While you are talking, while you are doing your office job, you will see that you are having your best meditation. At that time, you will be able to do four things at a time. After you make considerable progress in your inner life, you will see that your mouth is functioning and, at the same time, your heart, your inner being, is doing something else. So twenty-four hours a day your inner being will be able to meditate. It is quite possible.</p>  </div>
