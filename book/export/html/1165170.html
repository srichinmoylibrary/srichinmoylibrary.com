  <h1 class="book-heading">Will</h1>
  
 
<p>Will is myself. Will is my Self. My will is absolutely God's and God's alone.</p>
<p>As my inner will is, in the world of realisation, so is my outer life, in the world of manifestation.</p>
<p>To my mind's doubt, nothing is real. To my heart's will, everything is real. To conquer my doubts is to grow into the breath of my will.</p>
<p>I am not afraid of my emotions and frustrations. My emotions and frustrations live in my surrendered will to God, and will always rejoice in His adamantine Will.</p>
<p>When my inner will energises my outer existence, all my imponderable troubles and excruciating pangs dissolve into thin air.</p>

<p>Doubt wants to blight my mind.<br /> Fear wants to kill my heart.<br /> Ignorance wants to veil my soul.</p>
<p>Aspiration wants to illumine my life.<br /> Surrender wants to fulfil my life.<br /> Will wants to immortalise my life.</p>

<p>My earthly will has always a beginning and an end. My Heavenly will has no beginning and no end. It has always been and will always be the same. My will is Eternity's Abode of Truth, built on the rock of God's Vision-in-Reality and God's Reality-in-Vision.</p>  </div>
