<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only keep the mind empty of thought and keep the heart absolutely pure. Repeat “Purity, purity, purity” or “Supreme, Supreme, Supreme.” If you say “Purity, purity, purity”, it is convincing your mind. If you say “Supreme, Supreme, Supreme”, then immediately, anything that is absolutely necessary to maintain the Blessings that come from Above, you will be able to do. “Supreme” is far better, but if you cannot say “Supreme, Supreme”, at least say “Purity, purity”. If you can repeat it at home, even out loud, that will help tremendously. It convinces the mind. Then you can retain the Blessings you have received from Above.</p>  </div>
