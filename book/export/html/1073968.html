<p>My Lord, my Lord, yesterday I competed with the rest of the world. Today I am competing with my own self. Tomorrow I shall compete with Your eternal Compassion and infinite Forgiveness. My Lord, my Lord, do You ever compete with anything or anybody?</p>
<p>“Yes, My child, I do. I compete every day with your unbelief and disbelief that you are another God. You feel that you are not another God. So I must compete daily with your ignorance-unbelief and disbelief.”</p>  </div>
