<p>In Greece everything had a fixed price. On the street they were selling very cheap things, but all for a fixed price. The items they were selling were so bad-worse than useless.</p>
<p>I wanted to enter into a shop to see if they had anything different. At the entrance to the shop were two English-speaking ladies. One of them touched my hand to stop me from going in.</p>
<p>The lady said, "These people are rogues. They have cheated us. You must not go in there."</p>
<p>So I didn't go inside.</p>
