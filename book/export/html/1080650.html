<p><em>After the questions and answers, Sri Chinmoy asked the disciples to come up to the front of the room.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We wish to offer you our most important prayer. As you have significant prayers, this is our most significant prayer. And this prayer we offer to the Supreme in you, the Supreme in us, the Absolute Supreme.</p>
<p><em>Disciples sing The Invocation:</em></p>

<p>Supreme, Supreme, Supreme, Supreme!<br />  I bow to Thee, I bow.<br />  My life Thy golden plough;<br /> My journey's Goal Thy soulful Dream.<br /> Supreme, Supreme, Supreme, Supreme!<br />  I bow to Thee, I bow.</p>
<p>Supreme, I am Thy glowing Grace.<br />  My world, Thy Feet of Light;<br />  My breath, Thy Vision's kite.<br /> Thou art one Truth, one Life, one Face.<br /> Supreme, Supreme, Supreme, Supreme!<br />  I bow to Thee, I bow.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Gratitude is not a mere word. It is a living reality which abides in the inmost recesses of my heart, and this reality I wish to offer to the mothers of all my students. And as I said before, you are not only their mothers, but also my mothers in America. In me I wish you to discover an Indian son of yours. In honour of your visit we wish to offer you our heart's love in the form of applause.</p>
