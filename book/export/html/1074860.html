<p>God, do You ever think of me?<br /> "I do."<br /> When do You think of me?<br /> "My son, I think of you<br /> When you do not think of Me."<br /> God, why? Why do You do that?<br /> "My son, when you think of Me<br /> I feel you are safe<br /> And well-protected.<br /> But when you forget to think of Me<br /> I feel I am under obligation<br /> To think of you,<br /> To care for you<br /> So that you do not go astray."</p>
