<p>There was a very big puddle about 400 metres from the Centre, near Lilo's Health Food Store. A lady was driving by quite fast, but she stopped her car in the middle of the street so that she would not splash me. Perhaps she had seen me somewhere — on television or in the newspaper. She asked, "Master, when did you come? How do you do?" The people waiting in the cars behind her were blessing her.</p>
