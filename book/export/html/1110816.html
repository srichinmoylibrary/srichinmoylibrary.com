<p>[/Sri Chinmoy opened the programme with a short song end then spoke to the children:/]</p>
<p>Sweet children, dear young friends, my heart is all joy and pride to be in your loving company. I wish to tell you that I have hundreds of friends. Most of them are grown-up people. But I treasure the company of the children much more than I treasure the company of my grown-up friends. Why? Because you are all heart; you are all joy.</p>
<p>My young friends, do you know that there is a person who loves you infinitely more than your best friend loves you? Do you want to know his name? His name is God.</p>
<p>Do you know there is a person who loves you infinitely more than your dear parents love you? Do you want to know his name? His name is God. Do you know there is a person who loves you infinitely more than you love yourselves? Do you want to know his name? His name is God.</p>
<p>Do you want me to prove it? It is very easy to prove. Your best friend never feels that you are as great as God. But God always feels that you are as great as He is.</p>
<p>Your parents never feel that you are as good as God. But God always feels that you are as good as He is.</p>
<p>You never knew that you are another God. But God knows that you are another God and He all the time tells you that very thing. But in order to hear His Voice, you have to pray lovingly every morning and every evening. Please ask your parents to teach you how to pray. If you pray daily, I assure you one day you will hear God's Voice. And then what I have just told you, you yourselves will be able to hear directly from God.</p>
