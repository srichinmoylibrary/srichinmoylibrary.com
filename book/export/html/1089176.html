<p><em>Mr. Kobayashi:</em> That is our policy. The countries in Southeast Asia are not ready to process the raw materials into spices and keep the product quality at a very high level. In order to keep the delicate quality, you have to process the raw materials in a certain way, and those countries do not have the capacity.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> And Seko works for you as well as his wife? Previously he had some connection with Tiger shoes. He gave me a pair of Tiger running shoes once.</p>  </div>
