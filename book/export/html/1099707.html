<p>When I was a little boy, I had a small torch — what you call a flashlight — and I used to enjoy using it to look at things. I used to shine it on the top of a mango tree and say I was aiming at the heavens. My brothers and relatives used to laugh.</p>
<p>In the Mahabharata there is a story about how the Pandavas tried to walk to Heaven, but each of them dropped dead on the way, except one. We had a cook who was a real joker. He would say, "In the Mahabharata the Pandavas failed to walk to Heaven. Now Madal is sending the torchlight first so we can follow."</p>
<p>My father didn't appreciate that kind of joking. He would say, "Don't discourage my son! Don't discourage children!"</p>  </div>
