<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The personal Supreme usually does not interfere. He lets His Justice-Light operate in and through the law. He has already given His Justice-Light to the earth-consciousness, and if He has to interfere, then He is breaking His own Law. On very rare occasions, when He sees that the ignorance-force inside the law or inside the judge is predominant, this may be done. Otherwise, His impersonal aspect, which takes the form of His Justice, is allowed to operate.</p>  </div>
