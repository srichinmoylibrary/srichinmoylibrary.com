    <title>Question: Before becoming your disciple, I took a course in meditation in which they taught me a mantra and told me to repeat it for fifteen minutes in the morning and fifteen minutes in the afternoon. Is that the way I should continue meditating? I feel I can meditate more than that.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On my path you should meditate on your heart. If your <em>japa</em> conflicts with the kind of meditation I ask you to do, and with your oneness with me, then I advise you to give it up. But if you feel that it does not conflict at all and is only adding to the effectiveness of your present method of meditation, then please continue. If it is obstructing your spiritual growth, please give it up. But do not spend all your meditation time in chanting. You should do pure meditation also.</p>  </div>
