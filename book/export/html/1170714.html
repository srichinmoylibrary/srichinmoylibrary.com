<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul's name that I give is very often the outer indication of the soul's promise. If I give you a spiritual name, which describes your soul's qualities, that name will help you remember your inner qualities so that you can try consciously to manifest them. Inwardly your soul is all the time telling you what to do. But if outwardly also you are conscious of your soul's qualities and trying to manifest them, then your mind and your soul will go together. The message is coming from the soul and the physical mind is receiving it and trying to fulfil it.</p>  </div>
