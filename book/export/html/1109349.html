<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Either by diving deep within or by crying most soulfully, we can get in touch with the life-producing, life-transforming, life- illumining and life-fulfilling energy. A seeker either has to go deep within and touch the inmost recesses of his consciousness or he has to bring to the fore his inmost cry.</p>  </div>
