<p>Dulali's complaints against Krishna: Dulali told Nolini-da that Krishna had beaten her. Nolini-da said: "So what was your reaction?"</p>
<p>"My reaction was to do nothing. I didn't strike her back because I did not come to the Ashram to do that kind of thing."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "Oh, I see, I see. Since you have come to do something else, do that very thing and become very good and devoted to the Mother."</p>  </div>
