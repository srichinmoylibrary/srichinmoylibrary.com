<p>This morning<br /> My Lord Supreme commanded me<br /> To use His Mirror.<br /> I immediately obeyed His Command.<br /> To my widest astonishment,<br /> I saw myself as a budding God.<br /> I said to my Beloved Supreme,<br /> “What about Your other children?<br /> You have countless children.<br /> What about them?”<br /> Smilingly and blessingfully<br /> He said to me,<br /> “They are also the same, My child.<br /> All your brothers and sisters<br /> Are also budding Gods and Goddesses.”</p>
