<p>At the four-mile race there was a dog that was very bad. What was he doing in the race? The owner was there, taking the dog to this side and that side. Sometimes the dog wouldn't listen to him.</p>
<p>Children should be forbidden in these kinds of races. They should have their own races. It is so hard to run with them! They never, never stay in a straight line. While I take one step, they take three steps. And during these three steps they move like snakes — all serpentine winding!</p>
