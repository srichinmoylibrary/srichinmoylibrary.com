<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The first man was born on earth by God's Will, God's Willpower. If you read the Bible you will learn the story about Adam and Eve. But if you read your inner life story, then you will know how God created, and whom God created â€” how God created the first human being, and whom God created first on earth. The first human being was born by God's Will through the evolutionary process, through the continuous and gradual process of the animal kingdom.</p>  </div>
