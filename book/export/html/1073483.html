<p>His kindness-flooded heart has given me not one, not two, but three of his immortal achievements. In the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, right after winning the 200 metres, he gave me his victory-bouquet. In the 1988 Seoul Olympics, immediately after winning the long jump, he gave me his long jump shoes. And in the 1991 Tokyo World Championships, after becoming the fastest human with his world-record victory-speed, he gave me his sprinting shoes. Carl Lewis, my Sudhahota, my aspiration-heart and my dedication-life are all gratitude to you and to your heartâ€™s vastness-magnanimity.</p>
