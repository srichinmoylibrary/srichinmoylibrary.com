<p>Every seeker has to pay utmost attention to aspiration and not to experience. Experience comes from God. Aspiration comes from our inner existence. At every moment we have to feel the need for an inner urge to go forward, upward and inward. Experience is not enough to pull God to us and keep Him with us all the time. In the spiritual life we have to aspire. Then one day we will get inner experience on the strength of our aspiration. Intense aspiration is food for our inner being. Just as we do not eat delicious food every day, we do not have high experiences every day. But eventually the time comes when we can have these experiences whenever we meditate. When does that time come? When we are in a position to identify ourselves inseparably with the Cosmic Will. Right now we have a very limited will. But when we are in the Cosmic Will, the Universal Will, then at every moment Truth is glowing and blooming in us and around us.</p>
<p>So if we want constant experience, then we have to go deep within and become inseparably one with the Universal Will. This Universal Will can easily be possessed on the strength of our aspiration. When we offer our soul’s will to the Universal Will, the highest Truth will dawn within us. Daily we can offer our surrender to the Universal Will. Let us meditate daily and cry to the Highest with our gratitude, dedication and consecration. We should not cry for experience; we should cry only for God. When we offer our dedication to God, God can never be ungrateful. Let us take and take and take from God; on God’s part, He will always give and give and give. Right now, unfortunately, our receptivity is very limited. We receive very little of God’s omnipotent Grace and Bounty which He offers to us in abundant measure. So we have to try incessantly to increase our receptivity. Then every day we can have divine inner experiences.</p>  </div>
