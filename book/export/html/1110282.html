<h2><em>Professor Charles Johnson:</em> Why did God create the different races?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, God created and continues to create each individual with a special purpose. Each one He creates in a unique fashion. What He actually wants from His creation is unity in its multiplicity. His creation is His Cosmic Game. In a team, a certain number of players are needed. Each player has a specific position and a role to play. The question of superiority and inferiority does not arise; the sole purpose of the players is to score jointly. Unfortunately, our human mind wants to enjoy division, wants to feel superiority and wants to receive satisfaction in its own limited way.</p>
<p>There are a few distinct races, as we all know. To serve our purpose, let us take only black and white. God the Creator is also God the Supreme Artist. An artist, when he paints a picture, can easily use black and white side by side. The two colours are interdependent, adding visible beauty, contrast and harmony to each other to complete the painting to perfect perfection. In exactly the same way, God the Supreme Artist, God the Dispenser of human destiny, wants each individual and each race to grow and glow together, each playing perfectly its individual role for the betterment and enlightenment of humanity. If the races can be inseparable and interdependent, the division-enjoyment in our human nature can be illumined and divinely and supremely transformed into oneness-fulfilment.</p>
<p>Dear Professor, I had the golden opportunity and privilege of meeting with you in Seattle. Your prayerful, soulful and compassionate eyes have gone far beyond the so-called boundaries of race distinction. You represent a particular race, African, and I represent a particular race, Aryan. Both our races may be distinctive, but our Source is the same: God. And our Goal is the same: perfect perfection. Your own embodiment of light — illumining and fulfilling — can perfectly sing the song of oneness, while preparing itself to sing the song of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.</p>  </div>

<h2><em>Rev. Dr. David B. Burrell:</em> How is it that in prayer people discover that they literally have no distance to traverse between themselves and God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My dear Father, prayer is a magnet. When you put a magnet between two iron filings, the magnet immediately unifies the two objects on either side. In exactly the same way, prayer is the magnet between humanity's tearful heart and God's cheerful Heart, between humanity's cries and God's Smiles.</p>
<p>When we soulfully cry or soulfully smile, inside our cry and smile we discover the very Presence of God. We do not have to travel the length and breadth of the world to discover God's Existence. We can discover God's Existence here and now inside our own heart of love.</p>
<p>For everything we need in life, there is a teacher to help us find it. If we need God, then prayer is the teacher, prayer is the helper, prayer brings God into our consciously awakened life.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Part III — Professor John Berthrong</h1>
  
 <p>
PCGR 3. Associate Dean, School of Theology, Boston University, Boston, MA</p>
<h2><em>Professor John Berthrong:</em> Does God change?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, God is eternal, immortal, infinite. A tiny drop is God. The vast ocean is also God. How does the vast ocean come into existence if not from one drop, two drops, three drops and then countless drops? God is constantly changing, sleeplessly changing. From the finite He is going to the Infinite. Again at His sweet Will, from the Infinite He is coming into the finite. He has the capacity to be the Infinite by changing or transforming or adding to the finite. Again, if He wants to separate Infinity into finite parts, He can do so drop by drop, or portion by portion.</p>
<p>On the one hand, God is changeless and deathless. On the other hand, He is in the process of constant change, constant self-creation and self-immolation. Creation and dissolution take their turn in exactly the same way that day and night interchange.</p>
<p>When we ordinary human beings change something, we are not sure that the change is going to be an improvement. Change in and of itself does not necessarily mean improvement. But when God changes something, He changes Himself in and through that thing, always for progress and true satisfaction.</p>
<p>God is not bound by anything, either by what He creates or by what He does. We human beings must have wisdom before we try to change a thing, since human change need not necessarily be for the better. But when we try to change ourselves for the better on the strength of our inner wisdom-light, we succeed.</p>
<p>God desperately wants the transformation of human nature. Although He does not have to change anything, He does change whenever He wants to change, and this change He does with a view to feeding mankind's hunger for the ultimate progress-delight.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Part IV — Professor K. R. Sundarajan</h1>
  
 <p>
PCGR 4-5. Department of Theology, St. Bonaventure University, Olean, NY</p>
<h2><em>Professor K. R. Sundarajan:</em> The notion of the goodness of God, which all theistic forms of Hinduism affirm, runs contrary to the human experience of evil and of the unmerited suffering that one experiences in life. It may be that the Hindu doctrine of karma enables one to explain them. Even so, how can we explain these experiences, especially when we try to emphasise the Love and forgiving Grace of God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, everything depends on the planes of consciousness in which we live. There are many planes of consciousness, as you know from studying Hindu philosophy: physical, vital, mental, psychic, to name only a few. On the physical plane, when we see that the world is full of misery, suffering and cruelty, we find it very difficult to believe that God the Creator could be loving or compassionate.</p>
<p>Hindu philosophy believes in reincarnation. Because of our ignorance and limitation, we do not know what we did in our previous incarnations. It may happen that we are very good, kind and virtuous in this lifetime, but during a previous incarnation we did something very bad, and for that we are paying the penalty now in the form of suffering which appears to be unmerited. If we dive deep into the Hindu philosophy-ocean and go beyond the law of karma (which we may explain on a very mundane level with the phrase "As you sow, so you reap," either today, or in the near or distant future,) we come to realise that it is God who is having all the experiences in and through us. He is at once the action and the Doer.</p>
<p>The human in us always wants to emphasise the idea of God's Love, God's Forgiveness and God's Grace. We want only God the Compassion-Height to act in our life; we do not want God the Justice Light. But if we truly love God, and if we dare to say, "Let Thy Will be done in and through us," then even the suffering that comes to us through God's Justice-Light will make us happy.</p>
<p>If we want to be totally surrendered to God's Will, we shall pray to God to make us His perfect instruments by utilising His Compassion-Aspect or His Justice-Aspect — whichever pleases Him. There can be no better prayer than what the Saviour Christ taught us: "Let Thy Will be done."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1110288" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">&lt;em&gt;Professor K. R. Sundarajan:&lt;/em&gt; In terms of teaching, I have often faced problems explaining the Hindu doctrine of &lt;em&gt;maya&lt;/em&gt;, especially in its understanding of life as &amp;quot;illusory.&amp;quot; I have similar problems when I speak of the world as &lt;em&gt;lila&lt;/em&gt; (God&#039;s Play) and try to emphasise the &amp;quot;purposelessness&amp;quot; of God&#039;s created world as a consequence of its being God&#039;s Divine Play. How can I best teach these concepts to our students in the United States?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Hindu doctrine uses the term <em>'maya'</em> which means 'illusion'. It has been the Hindu belief, right from the very birth of the Hindu philosophy, that the world is an illusion. The Hindu spiritual figures, the Hindu philosophers and some of the Hindu thinkers get tremendous pleasure in telling the world that it is nothing but an illusion. Their philosophy is: why pay so much attention, or even any attention, to something that is unreal?</p>
<p>I wish to say that it is the height of our stupidity to say or feel that we have more wisdom or understanding than the Transcendental and Universal God. We are ready to pray to God, we are ready to devote ourselves to our idea of Him, but we are not ready to accept God's creation as something real. If we believe that we are praying to a God who is real, then how can we believe that His creation is unreal? How can we separate God's reality from God?</p>
<p>Maya has another meaning. It means 'fleeting, impermanent, temporary'. The things that we see or we do or we are in the physical world do not last permanently. Therefore, some people describe the physical world as unreal. But the outer reality does not require immortality. Although the highest reality is infinite, eternal and immortal, reality can also be short-lived, just as Infinity can be infinitely tiny as well as infinitely vast. Reality can be short-lived and reality can be long-term. Again, reality can be immortal. A flower that lasts only for a day is not unreal. A human being who lives for 80 years is not unreal. They are temporary; therefore, you might describe them as illusory. They are real, but limited, impermanent.</p>
<p>Some philosophers are of the opinion that only that which lasts forever is real. But if God's Will is to create something permanent or to create something that will last only for a short time that is His choice. Both things are still His creations. He is at once the Creator and the creation, the Player and the play, the impersonal and the personal, the invisible and the visible, the known and the unknown, the real and the unreal. No matter how hard we try to define God, we cannot. To define is to limit, and God is without limits. God is Eternity's Child playing in His own Infinity's Heart-Garden. As a little child gets satisfaction, abundant satisfaction, when he plays with his friends, even so, God the Child-Player likes to play with His child-friend-creations. God is one, but He wants to enjoy Himself in countless ways and in countless forms. And He does this through His Cosmic Play, through His <em>lila</em>. You and I and all of your students are God's creation-friends, although we may not understand the purpose of God's creation or our role in it.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Part V — Professor Arvind Sharma</h1>
  
 <p>
PCGR 6. Dirks Professor of Comparative Religion, McGill University, Montreal Canada</p>
<h2><em>Professor Arvind Sharnia:</em> What contribution can the study of religion in colleges and universities make to the spiritual life?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, it is of paramount importance to have religion not only inside the body of colleges and universities, but also inside the body of all schools. In this way, even if we do not long for God at the dawn of our lite, we may try at any time during our life's journey to bring God into our lives.</p>
<p>What is God? God is Satisfaction in the purest sense of the term. If we do not long for God's sleepless Presence, if we do not bring God's sleepless Presence into our conscious life, then we can never have abiding satisfaction, no matter how much knowledge or how many degrees we get from schools, colleges and universities. True satisfaction will always elude us.</p>
<p>What is religion? It is the messenger of God. It is always helpful to have a messenger who can carry messages between ourselves and God. Religion is the older brother of humanity. The older brother tells the younger brothers that only aspiration, dedication, love of God and service to God can provide us with an endless vision of perpetual truth and perpetual light. Religion is God-invocation, and inside God-invocation is mankind's transformation-life and satisfaction-breath.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Part VI — Professor Sumner B. Twiss</h1>
  
 <p>
PCGR 7. Chair Department of Religious Studies, Brown University, Providence, RI</p>
<h2><em>Professor Sumner B. Twiss:</em> Can we experience God in such a way that we can embrace as equals the authentic spirituality of all the world's religious traditions? Here I am looking for not only a viable theory but also a viable practice.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, after one has realised the Highest Absolute Supreme, one can easily embrace all religions with equal love and concern. It is like climbing up a tree that has many branches. An expert climber finds no difficulty in climbing from one branch to another. An Indian spiritual Master of the highest order named Sri Ramakrishna first realised God in India's traditional way. Then he realised God in the Christian way, and then in the Islamic way. He taught his followers that all religions are equal. Their source is an oneness-God.</p>
<p>The life-tree is one, but the branches are many. If a tree has no branches, then we are not inclined to call it a tree. God is the trunk of the world-religion-tree.</p>
<p>The spiritual Masters of the highest order have all come to the same realisation: there is only one true religion, and that religion is love of God in God's own Way to manifest God's Light here on earth for the complete satisfaction of Divinity in humanity and humanity in Divinity.</p>
<p>If one reaches a certain height, one can easily embrace all the religions in this way. Unfortunately an ordinary person cannot do so. But everyone, regardless of what height he or she has reached, should have respect for all religions.</p>  </div>

 <p>
PCGR 8-9. Director of the Institute for Religion and Social Change, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI</p>
<h2><em>Professor Joan Chatfield:</em> God has created us all in the image and likeness of God. But why is there such a discrepancy in the way that we human beings think about ourselves? We like to think of ourselves as so much better than our fellow human beings. Why do we like to foster our blatant elitism?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, the real God creates us all in the image and likeness of Himself, but we have accepted the false god — our mind — as our real boss. The limited mind wants to exert its supremacy over each and every thing and over each and every person. The ordinary human mind has not studied and does not want to study the oneness-philosophy-course. It wants to satisfy itself either through superiority or through separativity. But, alas, neither superiority nor separativity can satisfy the poor self-styled mind-god.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1110292" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">&lt;em&gt;Professor Joan Chutfield:&lt;/em&gt; At what moment does God place the soul into the body? Why does God not reveal to the parents the exact moment?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, there is no hard and fast rule as to when the soul will enter the body. The soul can enter into the body exactly at the moment of conception, or the soul can enter into the body a few days later, a few months later, or even a few hours before the birth of the child. According to the occult vision of seers, the soul can enter into the body as long as 13 hours after the birth of the child.</p>
<p>Similarly, the soul can be away from the body for as long as three days without causing the death of the body. The body can continue to function in its mechanically normal way without the soul's occupancy for short periods of time. Such incidents are very rare, but great occultists and spiritual Masters of the Himalayan heights can testify to the veracity of this fact.</p>
<p>The soul is neither masculine nor feminine. The soul enters into one kind of body or the other, the way one enters into a house. If a soul takes a feminine body that does not mean that the soul itself is feminine. The soul has accepted a feminine type of house. One particular soul prefers a certain type of house. Another soul may prefer a different type of house. With occult power that house can be changed. Science will not believe it.</p>
<p>The soul is like the person who wants to buy a house. He may give the order to the contractors to build the house in a certain way, or he can choose a house that has already been built. In either case, the buyer can decide to enter whenever he wants to, within limits. Like that, the soul is under no obligation to come at a certain time. It can come at any time during the nine months before the birth of the child. It can even come shortly after the birth if it wants to.</p>
<p>When the soul enters the body, if the parents are spiritually conscious, they will see a column of light descending. The soul is made of light, but it can take any form. If the mother is very, very spiritual, she will feel something special on the day that the soul enters. The father also may feel it. The soul of the child is entering the mother's body, but if the father is very, very spiritual, on the strength of his oneness with his wife and his child, the father will feel that something special is happening. God will give them the vision. In the Bible we learn that an angel told Mary that she was carrying the Christ. This has also happened in the case of some other highly developed spiritual figures.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Part VIII — Professor Satya Pachori</h1>
  
 <p>
PCGR 10. Department of Languages and Literature, University of North Florida, Jacksonville, FL</p>
<h2><em>Professor Satya Pachori:</em> Why does God let virtuous people suffer from sorrow and grief?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, today somebody can be virtuous, but perhaps he was not so yesterday. In this incarnation somebody may be leading a virtuous life, but in his previous incarnation the life that he led may have been totally different. Even in the course of one incarnation we may notice that certain people who are undivine to the extreme in the beginning may eventually become divinity incarnate.</p>
<p>The great sage Valmiki, who wrote the Ramayana, belonged to this group. When he was a young man his name was Ratnakar. He was a notorious robber. Destruction was his very nature. But with the grace of Sri Ramachandra he became compassion incarnate and illumination incarnate. His life embodied the transformation of human nature to its ultimate heights.</p>
<p>It also happens that some people, either consciously or unconsciously, take on the sufferings of their dear ones. In the case of spiritual figures of the highest Height, like the Lord Buddha, Sri Krishna, Jesus Christ and others, what kind of bad things did they do that they had to suffer so much? The answer is that they took humanity's suffering as their own, very own.</p>
<p>When virtuous people suffer, it may be because of something they did in their past lives, or, if their past lives were spotless, soulful, spiritual and divine, they may have consciously or unconsciously prayed to God, "O God, people around me are full of suffering. By Your infinite Grace, You have given me wisdom-light, compassion and concern. Please allow me to take their suffering as my own, very own. Let them be free."</p>
<p>The way a mother cries to take away the suffering of her children, some people try to remove the suffering of their dear ones. It may even come to pass that when death threatens their dear ones, they pray to death to summon them instead. I shall give you an example from our Indian history. Babar was the first of the great Moghul Emperors of India. He had a son named Humayun, which means 'fortunate'. When Humayun was a young man, he fell seriously ill. Day by day his condition grew worse, until his death seemed imminent. Many people prayed to Allah for Humayun's recovery, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Then a saint came to Babar and said, "If you make a great sacrifice, if you sacrifice something most precious to you, only then will your son be cured."</p>
<p>The Emperor Babar asked, "What kind of thing should I sacrifice?"</p>
<p>The saint replied, "Give away the Kohinoor diamond. It is most precious."</p>
<p>But the Emperor said, "The Kohinoor is my son's possession. What kind of sacrifice would that be? I have to sacrifice something of my own. I have so much wealth and such a vast kingdom. But the most precious Kohinoor diamond is not mine. Therefore, I cannot sacrifice it. And even if I did own the Kohinoor, it would not be a real sacrifice to give it away. Even if I were to give away all my wealth and power — my entire kingdom — I do not think this is the most precious sacrifice that I could make. My life alone is most precious. I am ready to give my life."</p>
<p>Then he walked around his son's bed three times, offering this prayer: "Allah, my most precious possession is my own life. If You wish me to sacrifice something most precious, then take my life instead of my son's. Let me die in his place, and let him live on earth. This is my only prayer and my most willing sacrifice."</p>
<p>To Babar's wide surprise, after he had completed three rounds, his son stood up completely well. But immediately Babar fell ill.</p>
<p>Humayun wept with gratitude and love for his father. He said to Allah, "My father is going to die, but I shall eternally treasure my father's fondness for me, and my father's implicit faith in Your Compassion."</p>
<p>Allah listened to the father's prayer, and in three months' time Babar died. This is the kind of love that a human father can have for his son. This kind of love will gladly welcome undeserved suffering.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, unfortunate things can happen to seemingly virtuous people, and also good things can happen to undivine people. Do they merit it? On the face of it, they do not merit it, but perhaps in their previous incarnations they did something good, and the law of karma is now giving them the fruits. Or possibly it is because God's unconditional Compassion and unconditional Love is operating in and through them for their transformation and perfection. God may choose to make some people happy, although they do not seem to deserve it.</p>  </div>

 <p>
PCGR 11. Department of English, Director, Creative Writing Programme, University of Washington, Seattle, WA</p>
<h2><em>Professor Shawn Wong:</em> I often tell my students that acquiring knowledge and learning are about belief. It is from belief that one's passion about one's own education springs. How can a student better understand where knowledge comes from? Is God the Source of this deeper knowledge?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, please allow me to use four words to come to my rescue: belief, faith, knowledge and wisdom.</p>
<p>Belief and knowledge are on one side. They are with the mind, in the mind and for the mind. Faith and wisdom are on the other side. They are with the heart, in the heart and are not only for the heart but also for the body, vital and mind. These four concepts are not supposed to enjoy rivalry and contradictions. They are supposed to sing the song of oneness in their ultimate reality. The outer education — belief and knowledge — feeds the mind, and vice versa. The inner education — faith and wisdom — feeds the heart, and vice versa. The outer education can be challenged, contradicted and even replaced. The inner education, which is sleepless and breathless oneness with God's Will, can never be challenged, contradicted or replaced. The outer education at times searches for God, at times does not. The inner education embodies and reveals God spontaneously, unreservedly and self-givingly.</p>
<p>Again, belief, knowledge, faith and wisdom have the selfsame Source: God the Illumination-Eye and God the Compassion-Heart.</p>  </div>

 <p>
PCGR 12. Department of Liberal Studies, University of Washington, Seattle, WA</p>
<h2><em>Professor Genevieve McCoy:</em> How does one reach Being-in-General?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, I was told that your expression 'Being-in-General' means God Himself. How do we reach God? Instead of trying to reach God, it will be wiser for us to discover God. When man tries to reach God, a certain distance always remains between himself and God. By virtue of our prayer and meditation, we come to realise that God is not someone who is at the farthest corner of the globe or in the highest sphere. Definitely He does dwell in those regions, but our wisdom will tell us that He is nearer than the nearest as well. He is Someone within us whom we have to discover.</p>
<p>When we want to invent something, we use the power of our mind to its fullest extent. When we want to discover something, we simply dive deep within, using the power of our heart. In the heart there is no question of distance, and we realise God much sooner than otherwise.</p>
<p>To reach the furthest length, we have to run fast, faster, fastest. To reach the ultimate height, we have to climb up high, higher, highest. But when we want to discover God, we just dive deep within and find our supremely chosen Inner Pilot dwelling inside our hearts.</p>
<p>To come back to your question: How does one reach God? Let us say, how does one discover and then realise God? We discover God and realise Him by virtue of our sleepless prayer and breathless meditation. And for that we have to love God unconditionally. We have to say to ourselves, "God for God's Sake," and then make this a reality in our life.</p>  </div>

<h2><em>Professor Leanna J. Standish:</em> Why is it that for you, apparently, the existence of God, the Absolute, the Divine, is known and experienced every day, but for me, a scientist and a physician, there is insufficient evidence to say I know, or even believe, that God exists? I am not at all certain that scientific materialism or material realism is an incorrect assessment of the nature of reality. Why are you certain and I am not?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, our human life is so complicated. Our human understanding is so complicated. Our approaches to reality are also complicated. But again, we can develop mutual respect for each other's understanding and conviction. You, as a scientist, are at home in the world of science. I happen to be a conscious God-seeker. My life has been entirely devoted to the inner exploration. Therefore, God — out of His infinite Bounty — has blessed me with certain illumining and fulfilling experiences. With regard to science, there are many things of which I am totally unaware, that you will be able to prove to me if I am willing to devote my time to the study of your reality. I also will be able to prove to you the existence of God if you want to consciously and selflessly dedicate your life to God-discovery. Your science-God and my spirituality-God are the same Being. But devotees of the science-God ask for concrete proof at every step of the way. Devotees of the spirituality-God care more for inner experience than for immediate proof or physical evidence.</p>
<p>Those who are devoted to the spirituality-God do not try to authenticate God's Existence. Their own faith in God and love of God enables them to feel God as an omnipresent Reality. They have tasted a most delicious mango, and they are still enjoying the taste of it to their full and complete satisfaction. They do not care whether the rest of the world believes in the mango or not. They are pleased and satisfied with what they have. The inner Presence of God is enough for them. They do not feel it is at all necessary for God to come and stand in front of them face to face. They feel that their inner happiness, peace and satisfaction in life are proof enough for them.</p>
<p>As a scientist, you may want me to prove to you the authenticity of my approach to reality, but as a God-lover I shall not ask you to prove anything. I shall only ask you to be satisfied, and if you are already satisfied with what you have and what you are, then I am truly, divinely and supremely proud of you. Your satisfaction is the manifestation of your chosen reality. My satisfaction is also the manifestation of my chosen reality. At the final end of our life-journey, we will see that God the Science and God the Spirituality are eternally and inseparably one, playing two different, distinct roles for the betterment and fulfilment of humanity.</p>  </div>

PCGR 14. Co-Director of Research, Bastyr University Research Institute, Bastyr University Seattle, WA</p>
<h2><em>Professor Carlo Calabrese:</em> For one who has not experienced God or a separate consciousness, how would you suggest a fresh approach to the possibility of experiencing God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, consciousness has infinite varieties, but primarily, there are two types of consciousness: earth-bound consciousness and Heaven-free consciousness. By virtue of our prayer and meditation, we transform our earth-bound consciousness into Heaven-free consciousness. Once we become the possessor of Heaven-free consciousness, the experience of God will, without fail, be at our disposal.</p>
<p>There are also two kinds of prayer, which we can categorise as "Give me" and "Take me." An ordinary person who uses the first kind of prayer will say to God, "My Lord, give me money-power, name and fame so that I can be inundated with happiness." A seeker who uses the first kind of prayer will say, "My Lord, give me peace, light and delight so that I can have a life of true satisfaction." A seeker who uses the second kind of prayer will say to God, "My Lord, take me. I want to be all Yours, only Yours. Mould me, shape me and use me in Your own Way."</p>
<p>The second type of prayer is totally different from the first. In the first, we use our desire-hunger to possess the world, or even to possess God. Alas, we are so limited that we do not understand that God cannot be possessed like a material object or even a human being. He can only be realised, revealed and manifested.</p>
<p>You would like a fresh approach to God. Such being the case, you will find the second kind of prayer to be all-illumining and all-fulfilling. This approach encompasses each and every action of yours here on earth and its result, in the form of success or failure, victory or defeat. All are placed at the Feet of God with equal delight.</p>  </div>

<h2><em>Professor Leonard Hudson:</em> Is God judgemental and, if so, is God judgemental of individuals or of society?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, God is not judgemental, far from it! He does not judge us; He loves us and loves us. We human beings use our minds to judge others. God has no time to judge us. He spends all His time loving us, for He has and is only the Heart.</p>
<p>When we judge others, we try to take an account of their good deeds and bad deeds, but when we love others, we go far beyond good deeds and bad deeds. The strength of our genuine love devours both their good deeds and their bad deeds at the same time.</p>
<p>The mother showers boundless affection on her child, even when the rest of the world says that he is a scoundrel of the worst dye. Her affection for her son far transcends her son's deeds. In this respect, God is like a mother.</p>
<p>You can also say that God is like a great grandfather. He indulgently feels that by judging someone, we in no way help the person to improve. On the contrary, his fear of us, his reaction to our judgement, only delays his Heaven-bound progress and his achievement of the supreme Reality. God is inwardly telling us and teaching us to pray to Him and to grow into His very Image. To sit on the seat of judgement is not the right thing to do. The right thing is to love the Absolute Lord Supreme and be loved by the Absolute Lord Supreme in His own Way. This is the only way humanity's tears and Divinity's Smiles can become one in the Oneness-Fulness-Heart of God the Beloved Supreme.</p>  </div>

<h2><em>Professor Wes Van Voorhis:</em> Why does God allow bad things to happen to people?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, it is so easy for us to blame God for what is happening in His creation. But again, the creation also has some will of its own. Since we take God's Love as infinite, in exactly the same way we should take God's Power as infinite. Do we pray to God, the Absolute Beloved Supreme, for our daily protection? Do we bring Him into our daily multifarious activities? Do we pray to Him to be with us in the hustle and bustle of life? No, we do not do our part. Sleeplessly is out of the question; hourly is out of the question; alas, not even occasionally do most human beings think of God. Knowing perfectly well that the world is full of undivine forces, why do we expect God to protect us at every moment when we do not keep Him with us consciously at every moment?</p>
<p>Again, if we enter into the deeper philosophy of life, we may come to realise that something infinitely worse could have happened to us than what we are experiencing. Or we may realise that we are now facing the consequences of our past actions, or that God is awakening us to a higher Light through physical, vital or mental suffering. God allows us to have painful experiences not because God wants us to suffer or to be destroyed, but because He feels that this is the fastest and surest way for us to learn, to grow and to become perfect so that we can eventually enjoy the delight of conscious oneness with Him in our day-to-day lives, in all our earthly activities.</p>  </div>

 <p>
PCGR 17. Lecturer Ursinus College, Collegeville, PA</p>
<h2><em>Professor Zell Kravinsky:</em> What is the fastest way to know God and feel His special Concern for us?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, there are many ways to realise God. The two main ways are the way of the mind and the way of the heart. The way of the mind is infinitely more difficult than the way of the heart because of the nature of the human mind. The mind doubts, the mind suspects, the mind contradicts, the mind limits. Alas, there comes a time when the mind doubts its own understanding, its own capacities, its own faith in higher realities and even in God.</p>
<p>The way of the heart, on the other hand, is the way of love, devotion and surrender. We love God, we devote ourselves to God and we surrender our will to God's Will. The way of the heart is the way of a child who entirely depends on the mother's unconditional affection and concern. In the spiritual life, the fastest way to make progress is the way of unconditional surrender. Unconditional surrender means to please God in His own Way. It is easy to say that we shall please God in His own Way, but it takes years of prayer and meditation. Slowly, steadily and unerringly the seeker strives to develop the capacity to surrender his will to God's Will. At every moment he has to practise in thought and deed the supreme prayer that the Saviour Christ taught humanity: "Let Thy Will be done."</p>
<p>If we pray and meditate soulfully and selfgivingly, if we feel that we love God only and need Him only at every moment, and if we dare to claim Him as our own, very own, then we are bound to feel His special Concern for us at every moment in our multifarious activities.</p>  </div>

<h2><em>Professor Mary Evelyn Tucker:</em> In the light of the current environmental crisis, how would you see God in Nature?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, God the Creator and God the creation are one. Nature is the outer expression of God. The environmental crisis that we are seeing at present, especially in the twentieth century, may take away some beauty from Nature, or we can say her beauty may be partially destroyed, but the inner divinity of Nature or the environment can never be destroyed.</p>
<p>Nature is God's revelation and manifestation. God is Nature's Source. You can say that Nature is God in His outer Form. When a crisis in the environment takes place, we may lose Nature's beauty but not Nature's divinity. Even when the ocean is polluted at various places, or when a forest is turned into a wasteland, we can never say that God has left the ocean or the forest. God will always remain inside both creation and destruction because He is beyond creation and destruction.</p>
<p>Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed by atom bombs. Beauty left those two cities, but divinity remained. Now that divinity is expressing itself in the most soulful peace shrines that have been built in the ruins. The man-made power that is tempted to destroy the world will definitely be arrested by the Heart-Power of God.</p>
<p>Ignorant people who are destroying Nature will not remain ignorant forever. In this century, warmongers have been successful in their destruction-attempts directed towards some countries. Again, peace-lovers with their superior wisdom are not allowing the war-mongers to succeed as freely as they did in the past.</p>
<p>The mind has destruction-power. The heart has creation-power and enlightenment-power. Today's doubting and destructive mind will grow into tomorrow's searching mind and creative heart. Today's matter-satisfaction-hunger will be turned into tomorrow's spirit-nourishment-meal.</p>  </div>

<h2><em>Professor Savyasachi Dastidar:</em> I am told that God is an all-powerful and merciful Mother. How can She allow the deliberate killing of small children by men in times of war?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, when we are on earth, on the physical plane, living in the physical consciousness, we see life and death in one way. But when we are in a very high consciousness, we see life and death in a totally different way. On earth, life gives us joy, death gives us pain. These experiences we get through our physical senses. But when we are in the subtle body, we go beyond, far beyond the experiences of human pain and joy. Here the omniscient and omnipotent God wants to have an experience in the omnipresent God.</p>
<p>Because of our own experiences with fathers and mothers in the physical world, we have formed our own concept of God the Father or God the Mother. We may see God as all Affection, all Love, all Compassion or something else. But when God plays certain other roles in His Cosmic Game, we do not understand. God is not Someone who can be understood. He can only be realised. When we establish our conscious oneness with Him, on the strength of countless years of our sleepless and breathless aspiration, we see that each action of His has a special purpose. We may see destruction on the physical plane. But from another level of consciousness, that very experience can be seen as the transformation or illumination of certain embodied souls. The true God-lovers will always be able to justify God's Actions because of their constant love for Him. This is not a blind belief in God's Goodness. It is an inseparable oneness with God's Will. The true God-seeker and God-lover knows and feels that God the Creator and God the Destroyer are the selfsame Being.</p>
<p>I can build a house, and I can break it. When I build a house, people congratulate me and say that I am very great. When I break it, they say that I am foolish, arbitrary, destructive. But they do not know my reasons either for building or for breaking. Similarly, God created this body of mine. Has He no right to destroy this body, if so is His Will? If I have the right to build something, do I not also have the right to break it? Perhaps I want to break it in order to build a better house. With your eyes, you see it as an act of random destruction, but if you knew my reason, you would change your opinion. On another plane it is not destruction at all. It is only moulding and remoulding. God moulds us in one way, and then He may want to remould us in another way and give us different experiences and different opportunities.</p>
<p>The one who creates also has the authority to destroy. It is our stupidity to say that when God creates something He is good, and when He destroys it He is bad. We are judging the Almighty God according to our limited, very limited, human understanding. God is beyond our appreciation and deprecation. As human beings, we feel free to build and break our own property at our sweet will. When God creates something, which is His property, why do we feel that He has no right to break it?</p>
<p>If we build something and see that it is not to our satisfaction, then naturally we will break it and build something that is more perfect. Similarly, if God's creation is not to His Satisfaction, He also may try to do better. Why do we want to give Him only the right to build, to create?</p>
<p>You are seeing God as the Mother. If She sees that somebody has killed one of Her innocent little children, She has the wisdom to say, "My child has been killed. I will produce another one to take his place, and this one will be infinitely better." God the Mother tolerates it when She sees that some of Her children have been killed in times of war or during a flood or famine. She allows it to happen because She knows that She has the capacity to create something far better. If someone comes to my house and starts destroying my garden, I may allow him to do it because I know that afterwards I can easily plant new flowers, new trees and make the garden much more beautiful than it was before. Similarly, God the Mother can easily use Her divine Force to create a better creation and give a better life to those embodied souls who meet with an untimely death in this incarnation.</p>  </div>

PCGR 20. Special Visiting Instructor, Department of Physics, Oakland University Rochester, MI</p>
<h2><em>Professor Clara Castoldi:</em> In modern physics we have found that there is a sea of energy pervading the 'empty' space of the universe which can materialise into matter. Can this be called God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My dear Professor, alas, I am a perfect stranger to physics, either ancient or modern. From the spiritual point of view and from the point of view of my inner experiences, everything is God: the finite and the Infinite, the emptiness and the fulness, the silence and the sound, everything that was, is and will be. There is nothing other than God.</p>
<p>In that sense, definitely God and energy are inseparable. But if you say that God and energy are inseparable to such an extent that energy itself will be able to guide or govern the universe without the direct Will of God, then you are mistaken. Energy and God are one, true, but again, God is beyond everything that He has and that He is. Although God appears to depend on us or on laws of nature to achieve something, He can easily achieve that thing without our assistance, independently.</p>
<p>Our Indian philosophy uses the term <em>'shunya'</em> — emptiness. This emptiness is nothing other than fulness, which we call <em>'hiranya garbha'</em> — the golden egg or womb. It is from this golden egg that creation came into existence. God embodies everything that is in His creation. He is at once this and that. But He is also beyond this and that. We cannot limit God by saying, "This is what God is." God is everything. At the same time, He is nothing. Our mind finds these concepts difficult to grasp. God can be beyond both this and that. He can be this and that combined. He can be neither this nor that. He must be felt and experienced; He cannot be defined.</p>  </div>

<h2><em>Professor Gerard Morris:</em> In the eternity of time, when God has perfected His present creation, will He start a new creation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My dear Professor, when one has free access to the Absolute Reality, one clearly sees that God's creation will forever and forever remain in the process of perfect perfection. Perfection has no culmination. It is an endless process.</p>
<p>When we look at a flower bud, we see that it is perfect, and we are absolutely satisfied. Later we may see that the bud has opened. The fully blossomed flower has another kind of perfection. Even then the process may not be complete. We may place the flower on our shrine or use it in a particular way. This new situation gives us a unique satisfaction and enhances the flower's perfection in our eyes.</p>
<p>It may happen, however, that our mind will come forward and say that our satisfaction is not enough. Our mind will try to convince us that there can be a bud more perfect, a flower more beautiful, a shrine more spiritual. Then we are no longer satisfied. In our human life, perfection is nothing other than satisfaction. When we are satisfied, we say everything is perfect. When we are dissatisfied, we see imperfection everywhere. A plant in its seed-form is perfect. When it germinates and becomes a tiny seedling, it is perfect. And when it becomes a huge, full-grown tree, it is perfect. Then it returns to its seed-form perfection once again.</p>
<p>The important thing is at what point in the process of evolution we are satisfied. When we are satisfied with something, at that very moment it is perfect. Perfection can never be separated from satisfaction. They go together. God's creation will always be in the process of perfection. Perfection is an endless process of blossoming reality.</p>  </div>

<h2><em>Professor Russell Bradshaw:</em> How can I serve God here on earth when I have to be in the mental world and get so many headaches?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My dear Professor, problems, problems! I am sure your headaches are nothing other than your problems. In human life, some days we can count our problems; some days our problems defy our counting capacity.</p>
<p>When we have a problem, either we try to conquer the problem or we surrender to the problem and try to live with the problem, helplessly or proudly, consciously or unconsciously.</p>
<p>To a seeker, each problem is a challenge and an opportunity, provided we utilise the problem in a correct and divine way. What is the correct and divine way to tackle a problem? The correct way is to implore — as often as possible and as sincerely as possible — God's Grace to come to our rescue. We human beings want to solve each and every problem in our own way, with our own mental capacity, which is next to nothing, although we do not want to believe it. In spite of repeated failures, we feel that our capacity is stronger than the problem itself.</p>
<p>All the problems of the world have only one source: dissatisfaction. And dissatisfaction also has its source: imperfection. Imperfection also has its source: division. Division also has its source: ignorance. Ignorance also has its source: God in the slow process of evolution.</p>
<p>God the Vision wanted to play the role of God the Involution. God the Involution wants to play the role of God the Evolution. God the Evolution will eventually become God the Total Satisfaction.</p>
<p>A problem is our journey's start. Problems loom large during our journey. The same problems receive light in the course of our journey. But at the end of our journey's close there can be no problems. There we shall find Eternity's Smile in Infinity's Sky.</p>
<p>You can serve God here on earth by becoming a divine and supreme hero of God. How do you become a divine and supreme hero? You can become a supreme hero by consciously reminding yourself at every moment of the undeniable fact that you are of God and you are for God. You are chosen by God Himself to love Him, serve Him and manifest Him here on earth in His own Way. Your inner conviction of what you are and what you are supposed to do can easily help you to conquer the pride of all your problems, born and yet unborn.</p>  </div>

<h2><em>Professor Kusumita Priscilla Pedersen:</em> What is the best way to see God in all beings?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My dear Professor, in order to see God in all beings, we must first learn to see God the Creator and God the creation as one. We must consciously convince ourselves that God is not only inside a living being, but that that living being is God Himself. We must love God the immanent and God the manifest as one.</p>
<p>The best way to see God in all human beings is to love God devotedly, faithfully, self-givingly, consciously, spontaneously, sleeplessly and breathlessly in all of His creation. We do not have to enter into a temple and stand in front of the shrine to feel the Presence of God. If we can feel that the temple itself is also God, and that the temple and the shrine are inseparable, then the moment we approach the temple we are bound to feel the Presence of God. Long before we enter into the temple and stand in front of the shrine, we will feel the Presence of God.</p>
<p>On another level, if by virtue of one's spiritual practices one can become a sincerity-heart and a humility-life, singing the song of self-giving without any expectation of return, either from mankind or from God Himself, that is absolutely the best way to see God in all beings. The heart is like our Indian lotus. When you can consciously open the heart-lotus petal by petal and invoke God's constant Presence and constant Guidance, then you will without fail see God in all beings. A fully-blossomed lotus-heart is the esoteric significance of your spiritual name, Kusumita.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Part XXII — Professor Lincoln Polissar</h1>
  
 <p>
PCGR 24. Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA</p>
<h2><em>Professor Lincoln Polissar:</em> The universe is so vast and complicated. Is there any imaginative way to visualise how God runs the whole thing?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My dear Professor, in order to imagine God, what you need first is faith in your imagination. Imagination is a reality in itself that can stand on its own. It is a power that can be embodied, revealed and manifested like any other quality. When you have faith in an individual, let us say, you feel that that person can do something to your satisfaction. Similarly, when you imagine God in His Vastness, you have implicit faith in His omnipotent Power. With His creative Power He has brought forth the universe.</p>
<p>Let us go one step further. Since you can believe that God has created the universe, you can easily believe that He has also created the tiny insects. Now can you believe that a tiny insect embodies and reveals God the omnipotent Power in the same way that His infinite Vastness does? If you can exercise the power of your imagination, you will see that God is not only the Infinite but also the finite. He can be both reality and unreality; He is and He is not at the same time.</p>
<p>Your mind will say, "If He is, how can He not be?" Your imagination also may say the same in the beginning. But you have to learn to use a different kind of imagination. You have to take imagination as a reality that can be within your grasp. Do not think of it as a bird which is flying in the sky far beyond your reach, and then disappears from your sight. Think of it as a kite which is attached to your hand by a string. You can allow the kite to fly with the wind wherever it wants to go. Again, you can bring it down into your hand at any moment. Your imagination has to be allowed to fly and, at the same time, it has to remain under your control so that you can use it whenever you wish. The string that is attached to your imagination is nothing other than your faith in God's Omnipotence. Your faith will tell you that God can be vaster than the vastest or smaller than the smallest.</p>
<p>Before a photographer takes a picture, he selects a particular type of lens. By using a zoom lens, he can bring objects that are far away right in front of his immediate vision. Again, by selecting another type of lens, he can push objects that are nearby to the farthest horizon. It is the same with your imagination. You can bring the Infinite nearer than the nearest using your faith-string, or you can release your imagination and see things at a great distance using the same string.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when we say that God is omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient, we tend to imagine God as Someone who is farther than the farthest and higher than the highest. But that is only one reality. Why can we not imagine that God is right inside us, perhaps in our heart or in our eye?</p>
<p>We have to come to the point where we can feel that God is not only in the infinite Vast, but also inside us, and even inside the smallest thing in His creation. This is what spiritual Masters and spiritual seekers of the highest order do: they use their vision to see the Presence of God in every aspect of God's creation. This vision, like a zoom lens, enables them to see far more things than our ordinary human sight will allow.</p>
<p>If you have the vision to go beyond what your eyes can see, beyond what your mind can understand, then you will see that your vision is nothing other than reality itself. And what is the connecting link between your vision and the farthest distance? It is your faith and nothing else.</p>
<p>Right now you are ready to believe that God is inside the Himalayas, inside the ocean, inside the planets and the stars, but you are not ready to see Him inside something minute. Again, you may be ready to see the Presence of God inside the things that are material and visible, but are you ready to see Him inside the things that are invisible? You can see and touch a flower, but its fragrance is invisible. Your eyes and your mind are telling you that the flower is beautiful. How do you describe beauty? How do you define it? Beauty as such defies description. In order to feel beauty as a reality, you have to experience it. As we can experience material objects which we can see and touch, so we can experience intangible things like beauty, purity, divinity and so forth. This we do on the strength of our oneness-imagination.</p>
<p>What is purity? If it is merely physical cleanliness, then it will be immediately obvious to our outer eyes. But true purity cannot be seen with the outer eyes. Purity is an inner state, in which the mind sees everything as divine. No matter how many times somebody takes a shower, I am sure that person will not see everything around him as divine! When a person is inundated with real purity, that person will see everything as Divinity — the wall, the door, the window, everything. Purity sees everything as the manifestation of Divinity.</p>
<p>Beauty, purity, divinity and so on all have a reality of their own. They do not have to have a physical or material form. If we can identify ourselves with them, then it is possible for us to believe that Divinity is not only omnipresent but that we are that very thing. We are Divinity Itself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the human mind only thinks that God can be this but He cannot be that. Our mind imagines Him as God the Compassionate, God the Merciful or God the Just. Our mind simply cannot imagine that God can be indifferent or even cruelty incarnate! But we have to take all aspects of God as one: He can be this, He can be that. In His absence, He is present. In His presence, He is absent. Inside the beauty of the flower, He is the fragrance. Inside the fragrance, He is the beauty of the flower. It is like looking at the obverse and the reverse of a coin simultaneously. On one side is the portrait of the king, on the other side is something else. While looking at the face of the king, you have to immediately, directly, see the other side of the coin. That is the reality — they are absolutely inseparable, the way the fragrance and the flower are inseparable.</p>
<p>Vastness and smallness have to be seen together. For us it is easy to believe that God embodies the Infinite, but hard to believe that God can be tinier than the tiniest. He not only embodies that tiny thing, but He is that tiniest thing. Look at our human bodies. Our chest is very big and we may be able to imagine God is dwelling there. But it is hard for us to imagine that God is inside our smallest toe. We have to come to the point where we can feel that the very toe itself is God.</p>
<p>Let us take the ocean as God. If you separate one drop from the ocean, can you still feel that that one drop is God? You will say that a little drop is so helpless, how can it be God? But God can play the role of helplessness inside a drop of water. With His omnipotent Power He has made Himself helpless.</p>
<p>The best thing is always to imagine that the God who is farther than the farthest, deeper than the deepest, higher than the highest, has the same reality as the God who is being expressed in that which is near, that which is tiny. If you can have the faith that God can be this, and He can be that, then imagination does not remain imagination any longer. Imagination becomes reality. But imagination can become reality only when we exercise our faith that God exists in all His aspects. He can be sleeping; He can be awake. He can be near; He can be far. He can be here; He can be there. Why should God be confined to just one way of being seen or believed in? If you have faith in all His aspects, then imagination becomes real, and you will no longer doubt yourself or doubt God.</p>
<p>We always say God is omnipotent, and we beg Him to grant us a portion of His Power so that we can fulfil our desire to be successful or do something well. But we can also pray to Him in another way. We can say, "God, since You are omnipotent, please use Your omnipotent Power to take away my greed, my desire, my ignorance." How often do human beings pray to God in that way? Most people only pray to God the Omnipotent to fulfil their desires, not to remove them. One out of a million will pray to God, "Let Thy Will be done." The rest will say, "Give me this, give me that."</p>
<p>There are some thieves who go to the temple and pray to God not to be caught. At the same time, the owners of houses are praying to God, "O God, if thieves break into our house, do give us the capacity to catch them." Which prayer is God going to fulfil? One party is saying, "I am doing the wrong thing, but please do not allow them to catch me." The other party is saying, "Please do not allow thieves to come into our house, or allow us to catch them if they do." God is lost in between the two! God may see that the householders need a certain experience to illumine them, so He may allow their things to be stolen. Then again, He may not. God alone knows in which way He will please human beings!</p>
<p>On very rare occasions there will be the kind of person who prays to God, "Let Thy Will be done. If You want a thief to come into my house, if You want him to be caught, or if You want him to go free, it is all up to You."</p>
<p>Once a thief came to rob an Indian spiritual Master. He found nothing inside the room except a mattress and a pillow. While the thief was going away with these things, the Master happened to come into the room. Immediately, the thief dropped the pillow and mattress and started to run away. The Master ran after him calling, "Wait, wait! Please come back and take these belongings of mine. You need them more than I do. That is why you came. During the night I have the moon and during the day I have the sun. I do not need anything else."</p>
<p>You may say that the spiritual Master was showing the height of stupidity, but I wish to say that on the strength of his oneness with God he saw that the thief valued those things more than he did, so he allowed the thief to keep the mattress and pillow. He said, "God's Will operated in and through the thief to steal my things. The same God is now telling me to let him get joy by keeping them. I will get inner satisfaction by offering them to him. I am not an idiot; I am only fulfilling God's own Will in this particular case."</p>
<p>The reality of the universe is visible when the mind is completely silent. When the mind becomes like an empty vessel, then alone can it be receptive to God's Will. Inside nothingness, everything can be found. This is our Indian philosophy. From nothingness came fulness. In the spiritual life emptiness is fulness. When the mind is absolutely still, the all-pervading reality is visible.</p>  </div>

<h2><em>Professor Ananda W. P. Guruge:</em> How would you explain to an agnostic why God has hitherto not revealed Itself, Herself or Himself to humanity as a whole? Is knowledge of God a privilege reserved for a few? If so, why?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, each one has his own concept of God. An agnostic (as, for example, India's supremely beloved son and matchless Prime Minister Pandit Nehru) believes that God is both unknown and unknowable. He is doubtful as to the existence of God. Our philosophy is that God is known and God is knowable. At the same time, He is unknown and unknowable. He is both, in the same way that we say He is and He is not. When something is vaster than the vastest, it is unknowable. But again, the same Energy or same Force can take the form of something very small which is visible, and we can easily see it and fathom it.</p>
<p>If somebody takes Reality as unknowable, how can we convince them otherwise? From our inner experiences, we have come to learn that Reality is knowable. When our good friend stands in front of us, we know that he has certain qualities. But another person may say that this same person is unknowable. For us, he is knowable. For someone else, he is unknowable. Who is right and who is wrong?</p>
<p>If I may venture another point of view: why should God have to come and prove to an agnostic that He is? God will honour each theory. If someone says that God is unknowable, God will say, "If you are satisfied by saying or feeling that I am unknowable, that is fine. Satisfaction is our goal." If someone else says, "God is knowable. He is my Father, He is my Mother. I will one day speak with Him face to face. I see Him and feel Him in Nature — in the little flowers, in the trees, in the river. I see and feel Him everywhere," God will say to that person, "My child, be satisfied with your undeniable inner experiences."</p>
<p>Let the one who wants to be satisfied with the unknowable aspect of God be satisfied, and let the one who wants to be satisfied with the knowable aspect of God also be satisfied. There is also a third party who says that God is both known and unknown, knowable and unknowable. He is the finite and the Infinite. The God-lovers who are of this belief take God's unknowable aspect as real, and God's knowable aspect also as real.</p>
<p>When a tiny seed is under the ground, we are not aware of its existence. Only the one who sowed the seed will know that it is there. Everybody else will claim that there is nothing there. In spite of their accusations, is the gardener under any obligation to dig up the ground and bring the seed to the surface? No, he will simply say, "You be satisfied by believing that there is nothing under the ground. I will be satisfied when the seed germinates and becomes a plant and then a tree." Again, there will be someone who will believe from the very beginning, although he did not see the gardener plant it, that the seed is under the ground. Right now the seed is unknown because it is under the ground. But the fact that I do not see it does not mean that it does not exist.</p>
<p>I do not have a telescope, so with my human eyes I cannot see faraway objects. That does not mean they do not exist. Let somebody bring a telescope, and he will be able to prove the existence of those objects. With the help of the telescope, our human eyes will be able to see the stars, the planets and so on. Just because something is beyond your physical senses does not mean that it does not exist. If we can have a high consciousness, an elevated consciousness, that consciousness can take us to the unknown in the same way that a telescope takes us to far distances. When something is clearly visible, our minds take it as reality, but when it is invisible, our limited minds take it as unreality.</p>
<p>The knowledge of God is not a privilege reserved for a few. We are all God's children. But we have to strive for it. Professor, you have spent so many years studying, and you have become a scholar, a philosopher, a theologian, an historian, a cosmopolitan. How did you become all these things? It is because you had the inner urge and the outer dedication to pursue them.</p>
<p>Very often when something is unknown, our mind brings doubt into the picture. If a spiritual Master of the highest order stands in front of a seeker, immediately the seeker will recognise who he is and what he is. But an ordinary person, a desire-bound person who does not care for spirituality, will see the spiritual Master as another ordinary man, in no way different than he is. It is the aspiration of the seeker that know that the man in front of him is a great spiritual figure.</p>
<p>Spirituality is not the sole monopoly of an individual or a small group of individuals. Inner food is there for all to eat. Those who are hungry will devour it, whereas those who are not hungry will not care to partake of it. But to say that the food is available only to the few who are hungry would be the height of folly. It is available to all. God is under no obligation to us to prove His Existence. The light of the sun is for all. The sun does not beg us to come outside to bask in its rays. It is we who feel we need the light of the sun and therefore go outside. Similarly, God the Infinite, Eternal and Immortal is within us, but He is not begging us to go deep inside and discover His Presence. If we feel the need for inner light, then we will go deep within and discover it.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">&lt;em&gt;Professor Ananda W. P. Guruge:&lt;/em&gt; Is belief in God or a Supreme Power absolutely essential for a person to lead an ethically sound and fruitful life of devotion and service? When does the belief in such a power become necessary, and for whom?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Belief in God or a Supreme Power is absolutely essential for those who want to make the fastest progress in both their inner life and their outer life. There are many human beings, including a few world figures, who do not believe in God, but their lives are ethically sound and fruitful. Inwardly they are aspiring, although it may not be consciously, and outwardly they are serving God the creation.</p>
<p>They may not use the term 'God'; they may not even believe in God, but they believe in goodness. From the spiritual point of view, their choice of an ethically sound and fruitful life and signal service to mankind is an act of faith. In the way they have chosen to live their life, they are representing God in His active and dynamic manifestation.</p>
<p>But if one wants to realise the Highest and grow into the Highest, then one must necessarily believe in the Highest. For those people, we do not even use the word 'belief', we use the word 'faith'. Belief is in the mind, with the mind and for the mind. Faith is in the soul, in the heart and in the inner existence, and eventually comes to the fore in the outer life.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">&lt;em&gt;Professor Ananda W. P. Guruge:&lt;/em&gt; Can you verbalise your spiritual experience of encountering the force or power to which you submit as &amp;quot;the Supreme&amp;quot;? How does an interactive relationship develop, and in what plane? Is it a purely psychological experience taking place in your consciousness only?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Indeed, this is a personal question, and since you are my most affectionate Brother-Friend, I shall take the most loving liberty of answering the question in a personal way.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of personal God-encounters. One is merely a God-experience. The other is God-realisation. When you experience God, you climb up God the Tree. When you realise God, you eat God the Fruit. And once you are completely satisfied with the fruit, God may ask you to climb down the tree and tell the world how delicious the fruit tastes. God also gives you a very large quantity of fruit to bring down and share with your earthly brothers and sisters who are really hungry for this particular fruit.</p>
<p>God-experience was my journey's infallible start. God-realisation is my journey's sleepless flow. God-manifestation is my journey's breathless glow.</p>
<p>Dealing with another part of your question, mine is not a psychological experience. Far from it! Please allow me to elaborate.</p>

<p>Yoga's child is spirituality.<br /> Spirituality's child is religion.<br /> Religion's child is philosophy.<br /> Philosophy's child is psychology.</p>

<p>Yoga lives in the illumining soul and in the aspiring heart. Yoga is a Sanskrit word which means 'union'. It is the union of earth's aspiration-cries and Heaven's Compassion-Smiles, of man the ascending cry and God the descending Smile.</p>
<p>Spirituality lives in the heart and the soul. Religion lives in the heart, in the mind and in the vital. Philosophy unfolds and spreads the mind-mattress. Psychology folds the mind-mattress and offers its density and intensity to the needy.</p>
<p>Mine is not a psychological experience. It is a state of consciousness which is infinitely higher than the mystic and psychic experiences. It is the transformation of the body-consciousness-reality into the soul-consciousness-immortality. There is no mind, no form. One becomes absolutely one with God the creation-Dreamer and God the creation-Lover.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">&lt;em&gt;Professor Ananda W. P. Guruge:&lt;/em&gt; Are the Upanishadic and Advaita Vedanta concepts of &lt;em&gt;Paramatman&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Brahman&lt;/em&gt; compatible with the concept of God?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> <em>Paramatman</em> and <em>Brahman</em> of the Advaita Vedanta, <em>Purusha</em> of <em>Samkhya</em> and Yoga, and God of the English-speaking world are one and the same. I may use the term 'God', or I may use another English term, 'the Supreme', or 'the Absolute'. To me the word 'God' encompasses all the concepts from the different systems of religion and philosophy.</p>
<p>When I use the term 'God', I am referring to the broadest possible concept of deity. 'God' is the Creator and the creation. He is at once cosmic Silence and cosmic Sound. 'God' is within us, all around us, far beyond us and, at the same time, He is us.</p>
<p>When we use the term 'God', our feeling is that He is on the top of the Himalayas, in the middle of the Himalayas and at the foot of the Himalayas. He is both inside the creation and beyond the creation. God is everywhere. But when we use the terms <em>Brahman, Paramatman</em> or <em>Purusha</em>, unfortunately we feel that God is only stationed at the summit of the Himalayas. These aspects of God are for us, but we do not feel that they are within us or from us. It is the same God, but at the summit we feel He should have a separate Name. Here God is the witness, <em>'Sakshi Purusha'</em>. Like an individual who acts in various capacities, each time He plays a different role, He is given a different name.</p>
<p>To simplify everything, we can say <em>Paramatman, Brahman, Purusha</em>, God —these all comprise one supreme Reality. This Reality is nothing other than Infinity-Eternity-Immortality's Light and Delight of the ever-transcending Beyond. A little child calls his father 'Papa' or 'Daddy'. These names give him much more joy than the word 'Father'. Again, the same child, when he grows older, may get more joy by using the word 'Father'. In my case, I use the term 'Supreme'. I know that my Supreme is none other than the Absolute <em>Paramatman, Brahman</em> and <em>Purusha</em>. But when I use the term 'Supreme', I get tremendous joy, whereas when I use the terms <em>Paramatman, Brahman</em> and <em>Purusha</em>, I get no joy. Knowing perfectly well that God and the Supreme are the same, I prefer to call Him 'Supreme'.</p>  </div>
