<p>The United Nations as a divine instrument is undoubtedly the embodiment of God's Dream. And we must serve this world-organisation devotedly and untiringly in order to transform this dream into reality. Let us be illumined by the supreme message of the great instrument of the United Nations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We will not be misreading the historical process we are going through if we believe that what previously happened domestically is now happening on the global plane. The United Nations provides nations with an instrument designed precisely to bring about the accommodation of legitimate national interests in the wider international interest. But this demands a sense of purpose, a clear idea of the direction that needs to be given to international affairs and the stamina to pursue that course."</p>
