<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want inspiration, then pray to God. Inspiration is the first step. If you are not inspired, you will not budge an inch. You will not do anything. You will not make any progress. There is nothing wrong with praying to God to give you inspiration, just as you cry to Him to give you more aspiration, intense aspiration. People are inspired. That is why they become great scientists or something else great. If they are not inspired, they cannot do anything. So you can pray to God to give you inspiration.</p>  </div>
