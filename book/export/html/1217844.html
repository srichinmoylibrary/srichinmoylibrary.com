<p>On Thursday, April 13, 1967, the two Aum Centres (Santurce, Puerto Rico and New York City) celebrated the third anniversary of Sri Chinmoy's arrival in the West.</p>
<p>Each Centre marked the event with a special spiritual and cultural program. In Puerto Rico a tape-recorded message from the Guru was played, in which every disciple was individually greeted by Sri Chinmoy. This was heard after a special meditation. The function was most devotedly conducted by the President, Sudha. Selected readings from the Guru's works were given by the disciples, who also offered their own soulful appreciation of his divine mission on earth.</p>
<p>In New York, a significant meditation also started the program. Moving tributes to the Guru were then offered. This was followed by a program of songs, readings and dramatic performances by the disciples.</p>
<p>Both functions were followed by delicious refreshments, generously provided and beautifully arranged by the disciples of the respective Centres. In New York, Mrs. Irene Silver (Durga) Mrs. Lillian Gerber (Lakshmi) and Mrs. Ruth Moseley (Karuna) deserve special thanks for their dedicated service.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy offers his deepest gratitude to all his esteemed friends and disciples who were present at both the Centres and made each function a spiritually elevating experience.</p>  </div>
