<p>Yesterday I was running in Flushing Meadow Park near our 1,000-mile race. Two men were also running. One of them saw the poster about the race and said to me, "Why are you not also competing?"</p>
<p>I just smiled at him.</p>
<p>Then the other man said, "Maybe he doesn't understand English."</p>
