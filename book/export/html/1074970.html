  <h1 class="book-heading">401. A joint bank account</h1>
  
 

<p>God and I<br /> Have a joint bank account.<br /> He earns and deposits;<br /> I neither earn nor deposit.<br /> "Son," He says, "why don't you<br /> Withdraw and buy your desires<br /> So that at the end of the year<br /> We shall be paying<br /> Less income tax to Satan?<br /> And also for another reason<br /> I would like you to withdraw<br /> Our wealth from the bank:<br /> If you issue cheques to others,<br /> The world will see that<br /> You and I are good partners,<br /> Loving partners, eternal partners."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">402. I am not going to talk back</h1>
  
 

<p>I am not going to talk back<br /> To anyone any more.<br /> No, not even to God.<br /> Let Him scold me,<br /> Let Him insult me.<br /> I shall prove to Him<br /> That I have not one,<br /> But three striking qualities:<br /> I know how to hear,<br /> I know how to bear,<br /> I know how to transfigure.<br />         Of course,<br /> It is for our mutual good.</p>
<p>If I become perfect,<br /> God will definitely be proud of me.<br /> If I become perfect,<br /> I won't have to fight<br /> Constantly against Him.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">403. My mirror</h1>
  
 

<p>   In the morning<br /> When I look in my mirror<br />   I see the face of pure aspiration.   At noon<br /> When I look in my mirror<br />   I see the face of sad dissatisfaction.   In the evening<br /> When I look in my mirror<br />   I see that I am totally lost.   At night<br /> When I look in my mirror<br />   I see my broken heart<br /> Replaced by God's Heart of Determination,<br />   And my sunken face<br /> Replaced by God's Perfection-Grace.</p>

<p>A monkey climbed down a tree;<br /> Lo, he became a man.</p>
<p>A man looked up;<br /> Lo, he became a god.</p>
<p>A god looked within;<br /> Lo, he became<br />   The energy of a monkey,<br />   The patience of a tree,<br />   The forgiveness of a man,<br />   The dedication of the Supreme.</p>

<p>I hoped to get a better Guru;<br />   Alas, there was none.</p>
<p>I hoped to get a better disciple;<br />   Alas, there was none.</p>
<p>I hoped to get a better God;<br />   I saw so many,<br />   I saw them so willing,<br />   I immediately felt<br />        That<br />   They were worth loving<br />        And<br />   Worth becoming.</p>

<p>   The biggest secret<br /> Came out of my little mouth:<br />        God is still alive.   The sweetest secret<br /> Came out of my little mouth:<br />        God loves me.   The purest secret<br /> Came out of my little mouth:<br />        God is for all,<br />            Including me:<br />            My uselessness,<br />            My unwillingness.</p>

<p>God's Love is blind,<br />         But<br /> His Concern is not.</p>
<p>God's Promise is blind,<br />         But<br /> His Fulfilment is not.</p>
<p>God is blind;<br />   Therefore He is available.</p>

  </div>
<div id="node-1074989" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">419. No and yes</h1>
  
 

<p><em>No</em> is not<br /> A rejection<br /> From a woman's heart.</p>

<p>Cosmic Law is not<br /> A rejection<br /> From God's heart.</p>

<p>I am a seeker.<br />   I want to live my life<br />        In my own way.<br />            Why should I not?</p>
<p>To the puritan friend of mine, God says:<br />   "Don't be a beggar,<br />        You will fail."</p>
<p>To me, God says:<br />   "Don't be a chooser,<br />        You will fail.<br />   Follow My Way:<br />        My Way is the only filler<br />            Of your empty life.<br />        My Way is the only fulfiller<br />            Of your soul's ancient promise."</p>

<div id="node-1074995" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">425. They knocked</h1>
  
 

<p>   Opportunity knocked<br /> At my door only once.   Opportunists knocked<br /> At my door thousands of times.   God knocked<br /> At my door twice:<br />   Once after I dined with ignorance,<br />   Once before I went to sleep with inconscience.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">427. I am an orphan</h1>
  
 

<p>   Adam and Eve<br /> Had no human parents;<br />        Yet<br /> They were not orphans,<br /> For God the divine Father became their Father<br />        And<br /> God the divine Mother became their Mother.        I<br /> Have two visible and tangible parents;<br />        Yet<br /> I am an orphan,<br /> For my father<br /> Does not know how to feed me with wisdom-light,<br />        And<br /> My mother<br /> Does not know how to feed me with concern-might.</p>

<p>My Lord,<br />   True, they are.<br />   But when are You<br />   Going to make them impermanent?   "Son, the moment the world wants Me to."</p>
<p>My Lord,<br />   Why do You blame the poor innocent world?<br />   After all, who created the world?</p>
<p>"Son, by creating the world<br /> I feel I have played My role.<br /> Now I feel the world should play its role<br /> By embracing love,<br /> Faith and oneness.<br /> And you know, son,<br /> I am more than ready,<br /> I am more than eager<br /> To assist the world<br /> In its noble adventure."</p>

<p>Lo,<br /> The jumper reached<br />   The Height of the Supreme.<br /> The runner reached<br />   The Length of the Supreme.<br /> The diver reached<br />   The Depth of the Supreme.</p>
