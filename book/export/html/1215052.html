<p>The Supreme’s form is not always the same. He can change His form at any time He wants. Even spiritual Masters will not see the Supreme in the same way; for each Master, He may appear differently. If one starts his journey by thinking of God as a personal God with form, then he will realise Him as a personal God. If he starts his Yoga thinking of God as impersonal, then he will realise the impersonal aspect of God. It depends on how the seeker wants to approach God while he is in the process of aspiring. If someone starts practising Yoga while thinking of God’s infinite Consciousness, then he will realise God as infinite Consciousness. A spiritual Master may first realise one aspect of God, but when he has his full realisation he sees God in all His aspects.</p>
<p>No matter how God appears to us, we will feel ecstasy, divine ecstasy. Ecstasy is delight. When we are in our ordinary consciousness, we are disturbed by the many ugly, undivine things in the world. But when we see God, at that time everything appears beautiful to us. All is good and nothing appears ugly.</p>
<p>In our Indian scriptures we say, <em>Tat twam asi</em>, “That Thou art.” This is the realisation of the Vedic seers of the hoary past. But the most important thing is to feel that God is Something or Somebody who has not only the capacity but also the eagerness to fulfil us. So let us not try to define God. We can say only that God wants to fulfil us. Now we are trying to fulfil ourselves with desires, but we ourselves are not fulfilled even if our desires are fulfilled. Real fulfilment comes only when we are swimming in the sea of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.</p>  </div>
