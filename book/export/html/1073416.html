<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to sacrifice our existence to God devotedly and soulfully, with no reluctance. If we want to see the Face of God, if we want to grow into our real Reality, then we have to offer God constantly all that we have. If we have an iota of love or concern for God, we have to give it devotedly and soulfully. This kind of self-giving is possible only when we regularly pray and meditate. Otherwise, our life is one of possession, not giving. But when we pray and meditate, at that time we try to minimise or diminish all our wants. Peace is found not in possession, but in constant renunciation. We renounce our limited self and enter into our unlimited Self. This unlimited Self is God.</p>  </div>
