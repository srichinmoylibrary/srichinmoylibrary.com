<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are assailed by impure, undivine thoughts, just think of somebody who is infinitely more powerful than these thoughts, and that is the Supreme. The Supreme is omniscient and omnipotent. It is His world. So you have to feel that He is infinitely more powerful than the invasion, than the attack you have just received from the hostile forces.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when a seeker is attacked by an undivine force, immediately he feels that this undivine force is omnipotent. He does not think at that time that the Supreme is the only omnipotent Power on earth. You have to have more faith in God's Reality, God's Concern, God's Compassion for you.</p>
<p>If you have real faith in God's Concern and Compassion, then the attack of the hostile forces will lose all its strength. So think in a positive way that there is someone who is infinitely more powerful than the force of undivine thoughts, and that His infinite Power will immediately come to your rescue, provided you are sincere and soulful at the time of your desperate need.</p>  </div>
