<p>My bother Chitta has a nice theory to console me. He says, “If you had done 250 pounds on the 14th or 15th of April, just 10 months after you first started weightlifting, people would not have believed it. They would have said that you employed some ghosts to lift it.”</p>
<p>Each time I go away on a trip and come back, I have good luck. When I come back from my Germany trip, I will have 13 days more before my anniversary on the 26th of June. Who knows, if I can do 250 pounds by then, I will be very happy.</p>
