<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the evening of his life, my father taught everything to my brother Chitta. Then, during the last ten or twelve years of his life, if there was any problem involving the family, my father would say, "Go to Chitta. He knows better than I do." My father had such confidence in Chitta! When you see that somebody else in your family can do your job well, it is such a relief. You get tremendous joy because you are the one who taught him.</p>
<p>I also am hoping to have disciples like that. I am not just talking about individuals who are good at manifestation. No, no! I am talking about some disciples who will have such love, devotion and unconditional surrender that they will become supremely chosen instruments of our Lord Beloved Supreme. If some disciples of mine can become really good, really perfect, you have no idea how much joy it will give me. Then, from their example others can learn; you can call it inner or outer teaching. It is not that I will be like my father and delegate my responsibilities to them. No, only I will be so happy to find disciples who will please me by serving God unconditionally in God's own Way.</p>  </div>
