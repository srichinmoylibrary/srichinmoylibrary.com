<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em> No. If somebody is really in my divine consciousness, then he cannot do anything wrong. Sometimes the clever and tricky mind will make you feel that you are one with my consciousness. This feeling of yours, needless to say, is one hundred percent wrong. But if it is your loving and aspiring heart that makes you feel that you are one with my will, then rest assured that your heart's oneness will always receive abundant light from my own heart's satisfaction-delight. Hence, you cannot do anything wrong. In this case my satisfaction is the expansion of my oneness-will with your deep inner longing.</p>  </div>
