<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If somebody was really sincere in his spiritual life in his past incarnation, then in this life he will start his spiritual life at a young age. He will start with his spiritual life when he is ten or twelve or sixteen years old. But it may happen that the child is brought up in an unfavourable environment. So even if he had started his spiritual life in his past incarnation, in this incarnation he will go slowly and steadily because he does not get help from his parents or his environment. But if he was a very great aspirant in his past life and only just failed to realise God, then in this life he will definitely come into a highly developed spiritual family, so that from the very beginning he will be able to enter into the true spiritual life.</p>  </div>
