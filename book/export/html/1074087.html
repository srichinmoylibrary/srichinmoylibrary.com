<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the inner world my connection with these great musicians does exist, but not in the outer world. In the inner world, their souls and my soul still maintain a very good and healthy connection. I still love them and I become happier than the happiest when they do something great to inspire and elevate the consciousness of humanity.</p>  </div>
