<p>When I say that I have realised God,<br /> Why do I see a look of disbelief in your eyes?</p>
<p>Do you think I am fooling you?<br /> Do you think I have nothing else to do<br />   on earth<br /> Than to tell you who I am<br />        And<br /> To try to convince you why I am here?</p>
<p>No. No. No.<br /> I tell you I have realised God<br /> Just because God wants me to tell you.</p>
<p>I am more than pleased with my God-realisation<br /> I do not have to proclaim my divinity.<br /> I do not have to share my divinity.<br /> I am complete in myself.<br /> I am perfect in myself.<br /> It is for your good,<br />   For your realisation,<br />        For your perfection<br /> That I tell you I am a realised soul.</p>
