<p>These two dogs, Sona and Kanu, will not have any more animal incarnations. No more animal incarnations for them â€” only human incarnations. Who knows, perhaps they will not want to take human incarnation. But if they want to, I will bring them into a very, very, very nice family, and I will bring them into the same family.</p>
