<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately you are wrong if you think that delight is a lighter, less profound quality, which we see in a ‘delightful’ child. Delight is Eternity’s Treasure and Immortality’s Life. A delightful child may very often lose his life of delightful experience when he grows into an adolescent. His experience of this kind of delight can be something quite transitory. But when real divine delight enters into an aspirant, it is an everlasting experience. Now, what is the divine meaning of delight? The divine meaning of delight is Immortality in one’s entire being.</p>  </div>
