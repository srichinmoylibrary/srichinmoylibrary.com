<p>I was running on the right side of the street all the time and my road crew was also stationed on the right side. At the second mile mark I was shouting at my road crew that I was coming, but Sudhir was not seeing me. Peter and Databir were looking right at me. I even passed by them, but still they didn't see me.</p>
<p>After I had crossed the ten-mile mark and had run hardly three hundred metres, Databir was saying, "Almost eleven miles!" It was false encouragement.</p>
