<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. Some are doing it consciously, and some are doing it unconsciously. Those who are doing it unconsciously, we can’t always appreciate. All human beings are trying to realise God, but those who are not consciously aspiring we usually do not like to spend our time with. We shall all realise God in the course of Eternity, just because that is God’s Plan. But there is a great difference between you people who are aspiring consciously and those who are not aspiring. They may take millions of years to achieve what you will do in a few hundred years or so, now that you have begun to aspire consciously. Similarly, you have to know the difference between consciously aspiring artists and unconsciously aspiring artists.</p>  </div>
