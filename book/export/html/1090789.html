<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At this stage of your inner life, you need not do contemplation. Contemplation comes after quite a few years of spiritual practice. When one is very advanced in the spiritual life, at that time contemplation starts. Here among my disciples only very, very, very few have even a limited capacity for contemplation; otherwise, all are up to the meditation stage. Contemplation is a very high state, and even those few who have the capacity cannot contemplate at their sweet will. So please think only of meditation right now. Please don't be offended, but the time has not yet come for you. But one day, in the near or distant future, it is bound to come.</p>
<p>Contemplation is required before God-realisation. It cannot be ignored or avoided. But the necessity for contemplation has not yet come because your concentration and meditation are not yet perfect. When concentration is perfect and meditation is perfect, then the necessity of contemplation is imminent. Contemplation also has to be perfect. Then, after we have climbed up these three rungs on the ladder of Self-realisation, we really enter into the Highest.</p>  </div>
