<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To have simplicity is to run towards God without darkness, worries or impurity. Simplicity is running towards the goal. Sincerity means that the seeker wants only the goal and not the flowers and fruits that are along the road. Humility comes when he reaches the goal. He knows that it is not his capacity that has brought him to the goal. Simplicity is beauty; sincerity is duty; they produce humility. Humility is God-reality, God-oneness and God-perfection. Humility not only embodies the Vast, but it is also the infinite, the Eternal. It is not something to become, but it is God the Reality.</p>  </div>
