<p>Please try various methods to inspire seekers, including running races and also swimming races. In Australia, Switzerland and a few other countries, our disciples have swimming races. If you have a swimming pool, you can have races of 100 metres or 400 metres or one mile. You can rent a swimming pool for a day.</p>
<p>Do you not swim? I want you to swim in the sea of light! You have joined the spiritual path, so you are not swimming any more in the sea of ignorance. Now you are supposed to swim every day, every hour in the sea of light!</p>
<p>Easily you can have short-distance races in a swimming pool. You can have races for different types of swimming strokes.</p>
<p>Cycle races I do not advise, because accidents can take place. But there will be no problem with swimming. I would like to hear from you that you will have swimming races. Swimming, swimming!</p>
