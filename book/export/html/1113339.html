<p>Nolini-da gave me a written note for Chiman-bhai and asked me to bring back a few pictures from him. When I gave him the note, without reading it Chiman tore it to pieces and said: "Chinmoy, do you think I am such a rascal that I shall not believe you? And for whom do you want the pictures? For Nolini-da. Is there anything that my heart would not be happy to do for him immediately?"</p>  </div>
