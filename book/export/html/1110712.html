<p>The life of desire is conditional. The life of aspiration is unconditional. ‘Unconditional’ is not a mere dictionary word. ‘Unconditional’ is a state of consciousness. When we are unconditional, we feel there is only one Reality that is always ready to give us joy in a divine, supreme way, and that Reality is God’s Compassion-Tears and God’s Forgiveness-Smile.</p>
<p>We can never become unconditional in any way unless we become one with God’s blessingful, unconditional Self-Offering to humanity. We have to become one with God sleeplessly, breathlessly, birthlessly and deathlessly. Then only can we grow into unconditional love, unconditional devotion and unconditional surrender to our Lord Beloved Supreme.</p>  </div>
