<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is very easy. Just invoke light. When you pray, pray to God to inundate your body, vital, mind and heart with light. There is nothing wrong in doing this. It is absolutely necessary to pray to the Supreme to inundate your inner and outer existence with light. Our Upanishadic seers prayed to God for light, light, light. For us also, there is only one thing we need: light, light, light. If you want to bring down light from Above, prayer is the answer. Or, while you are meditating, you can invoke God the Light.</p>  </div>
