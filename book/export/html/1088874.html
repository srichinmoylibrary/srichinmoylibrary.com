So he wouldn&#039;t have any feelings against any race or any creed or anything like this. People who are caught up in prejudicial thoughts, have they turned away from God, or do they just not understand God, or what?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They have not necessarily turned away from God, only they understand God according to their limited capacities. But a true seeker will not condemn them. On the contrary, he will try to see and feel that the mistakes committed by them are his own mistakes because he has accepted God totally. This acceptance of God includes the acceptance of God's entire creation, and these people who are making mistakes are also God's children. So the sincere aspirant feels that it is obligatory on his part to consider the weaknesses, the failures and the shortcomings of others as his own. Because he loves God, he feels that he has to be identified with God's creation. He cannot negate God's creation; he cannot speak ill of God's creation. He can only accept God's creation as such and pray and meditate on God to illumine His creation.</p>  </div>
