<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Prayer can give you everything. If you don't have poise, your prayer is bound to give you poise. But I wish to say that everybody comes into the world with some inner poise. The soul has all the divine qualities in seed form. The soul is a portion of divinity, so naturally everything will be there. But poise can be in the physical in an absolutely negligible quantity. If you try, you can develop an ocean of poise from one drop. Even if you think that you don't have a drop of poise, no harm. The Supreme will give you abundant poise just because you are praying. Then, a time will come when your whole being will be flooded with inner poise. You are praying and praying and your inner being is storing up your poise, keeping it secret. Then one day you will see that you are all poise, boundless poise.</p>  </div>
