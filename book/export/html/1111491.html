  <h1 class="book-heading">Two-mile races</h1>
  
 
<p>Two-mile races are my favourites because I am always able to finish them. I enjoy running a two-mile race but for a one-mile race I don't have the speed. Out of fifty two-mile races we are having this year, at least thirty I will run.</p>
<p>In the last race, as I was approaching the turnaround point I saw Karabi and Cathy. They were only twenty metres ahead of me. It was tempting to try to catch them! But it's easy to forget that you have to run another twenty metres before you even reach the turnaround!</p>
<p>Then I was going back on one side and Hashi was coming on the other side. My ego went so high! I also saw Nayana and a few others behind me. Then I saw Chameli very far behind. I said, "You! In the 26-mile New York Marathon, you smiled at me and after 17 miles you went ahead of me." She was smiling in this race also.</p>
<p>For most of the race I was a little ahead of Gayatri. Because of my fever I never had any energy. When Gayatri went ahead of me, I didn't have any power left. I made a sincere surrender to her.</p>
