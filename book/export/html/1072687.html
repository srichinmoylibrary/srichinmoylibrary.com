<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, the cosmic law operates. If it is not your time they will not catch you. But this is a special month: September, 1972. This month it is as though the light has gone away; there is a spiritual black-out. When there is a little light, then the dark, hostile forces are afraid of doing things, for fear of being caught. But when there is total darkness, then the mischievous fellows can do anything they want. This particular month of September is like that. Everything is dark, so anything they want to do they can do.</p>  </div>
