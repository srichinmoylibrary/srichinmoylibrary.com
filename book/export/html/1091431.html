<p><em>Governor Macias:</em> I hope that we get what we have been searching for. You are right. We want to get things done our own way.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is not the right way. We have to know that there is Someone who is the Doer and that this Doer is acting in and through us. If we can be simple, sincere and pure like you, then He can expedite our journey. But if we become impatient and want peace to be achieved overnight, it doesn't work out.</p>
<p>A tree does not come into existence overnight. First the seed is sown, and then it becomes a little plant and finally a tree. It takes a few years. Right now we have a hunger for peace, but this hunger was not in us so powerfully 10 or 20 or 30 years ago. We need peace desperately from the day we are born. Our parents, grandparents and great-grandparents also needed peace. But only now, let us say, are we sincerely striving for peace.</p>
<p>As soon as we come to realise that we need something, we become like a child. As soon as a child feels that he needs a particular toy, he makes his parents' life miserable. He wants them to give him the toy immediately.</p>
<p><em>Governor Macias presents a gift to Sri Chinmoy.</em></p>
<p><em>Governor Macias:</em> In spite of the peacemakers through the centuries, this world has never really known peace. I thought that with the end of the Cold War that we would have peace. But it looks like the peace effort has become even worse after the end of Communism.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately we are trying to solve the world's problems with our mind, which is impossible. We have to solve these problems with our hearts. In summit meetings they are talking about peace, nuclear disarmament and so many things; but they are using their minds and not their hearts. Each country is trying to exercise its supremacy. "If you accept my supremacy, then I will allow you to have peace." That is what the countries are saying because they are using the mind. But if they were using their hearts, in a day or a couple of months they could bring about world peace.</p>  </div>
