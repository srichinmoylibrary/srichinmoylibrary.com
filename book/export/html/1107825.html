<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know what we get from anger: frustration, depression and destruction. We have come into the world to transform it. If we see something wrong, we have to transform it. But by breaking, we cannot build. Gradual transformation is the way. Take anger as a thief. If we know that somebody is a thief, we will not want to let the thief enter into us and steal all our love and other inner wealth. Our guard is our aspiration. When anger assails us, we have to cry inwardly for deeper aspiration. If we can immediately aspire, the guard will come to our rescue, and we will be able to save our most precious jewel, love, from anger the thief.</p>  </div>
