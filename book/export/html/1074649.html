<p>His are the lips that do the best preaching.<br /> His is the life that does the worst deceiving.<br /> His is the body that does the longest sleeping.<br /> His is the vital that does the wildest ridiculing.<br /> His is the mind that does the meanest snobbing.<br /> His is the heart that does the filthiest defiling.<br /> His is the realisation that sempiternally shines<br /> Between<br /> Man's hopeless inconscience<br /> And<br /> God's endless forgiveness.</p>
