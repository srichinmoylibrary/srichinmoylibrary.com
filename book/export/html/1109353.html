<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When India wants wheat or something else, America automatically says, "You have to do us a favour in return. If you help us, or if you don't speak to Russia for five days, we will give you the wheat." Some condition is there. Then, when America sees that India has kept its promise, America is pleased and gives a very, very large quantity of wheat â€” much more than it originally promised. So here it is giving unreservedly, but it started with a condition.</p>  </div>
