<p>To-day is the day<br /> I have given God<br /> The thorns of my desire-life<br /> And<br /> The roses of my aspiration-heart.<br /> He has gladly and equally<br /> Accepted them.</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> Since the beginning of My creation,<br /> I have been claiming you<br /> As My own, very own.<br /> What is wrong with you?<br /> Can you not also do the same?"</p>
<p>My Lord,<br /> I certainly can.<br /> I am doing it.</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> You have done it.<br /> You have done it.<br /> You have done it."</p>
