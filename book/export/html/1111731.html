<p>After about four or five miles, I was breathing heavily as usual. A middle-aged man said to me, "Did you have a checkup with your doctor for your chest? Is your heart all right?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, yes!"</p>
<p>Then I said to myself, "O God, I am not going to run with the runners. I don't want to show people how tired I am." From then on I ran on the left side of the street. Most of the runners were running on the right side. There were still some runners on the left side, but very few in comparison.</p>
<p>There were many people who were breathing louder than I was. In the Athens Marathon that I ran a few years ago, there was one person breathing so heavily that you could hear him a hundred meters away.</p>
<p>After about seven or eight miles, I saw a man lying down by the side of the road. Two people were helping him. Then the ambulance came.</p>
