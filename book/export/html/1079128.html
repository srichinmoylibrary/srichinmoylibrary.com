<p>My Lord, I know that I need many, many divine qualities to please You both inwardly and outwardly. But is there anything that I need most? Is there anything that embodies all the divine qualities?</p>
<p>"My child, there is only one divine quality that embodies all the other divine qualities, and that divine quality is your faith in Me-your implicit faith in your God-transformation-life."</p>
