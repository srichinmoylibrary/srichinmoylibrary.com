<p>My name is preparation, preparation-purity.<br /> My Captain, what is Your Name?<br /> "My Name is Compassion, Compassion-Beauty."<br /> My Captain, my body is prepared.<br /> "Then ask your body to wake up<br /> and look around<br /> And soulfully appreciate the beauty<br /> Of My fruitful creation."<br /> My Captain, my vital is prepared.<br /> "Then ask your vital<br /> To go to discipline-school to study<br /> And receive most glorious<br /> achievement-degrees."<br /> My Captain, my mind is prepared.<br /> "Then ask your mind to stop living<br /> In the fruitless thought-world,<br /> For I want your mind to swim<br /> In the sea of peace."<br /> My Captain, my heart is prepared.<br /> "Then ask your heart to sing every day<br /> A new oneness-song<br /> That will please My Transcendental Vision's<br /> Universal Life."<br /> My Captain, my soul is prepared.<br /> "Then ask your soul to come to Me immediately<br /> And occupy its secret and sacred seat<br /> In My Golden Boat<br /> Which is about to start<br /> Its birthless and deathless voyage."<br /> My Captain, finally, I am prepared.<br /> "Then at this very moment I declare<br /> You and I are Eternity's<br /> Earth-transformation-dreamers."</p>
