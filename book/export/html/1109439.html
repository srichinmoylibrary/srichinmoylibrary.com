<blockquote>
<p>"Our deeds still travel with us from afar, and what we have been makes us what we are."</p>
<p>â€” George Eliot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the spiritual point of view, what do we learn from this soulful message? We come to learn that we have been victims to teeming desires and here is the result: we are still earth-bound. We are bound by the fetters of ignorance; we are caught. We want to possess the world. To our widest surprise and sorrow, we are already caught; we are already possessed.</p>  </div>
