<p>A Hindu family and a Muslim family were very close to each other. A daughter from the Hindu family was in love with a son from the Muslim family. Usually it is frowned upon for Hindus and Muslims to marry. But some broad-minded people allow this. World-famous leaders who are Hindu or Muslim often say that the two faiths are one, but when their dearest ones want to marry someone from the other religion, usually they are one hundred per cent against it.</p>
<p>The members of the Hindu family came forward with an excellent suggestion: "Because our children are such close friends, our daughter can study the Koran and your son can study the Bhagavad Gita. In this way each will become familiar with the other's religion, and they will be able to live together peacefully."</p>
<p>The Hindu daughter began to study the Koran, but without actually paying any attention. The Muslim son began to study the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads and other Hindu scriptures. He was studying very sincerely and this was giving him tremendous joy. While reading the spiritual books and thinking of the Vedic seers, he was deeply moved. He said to himself, "I want to be a spiritual person. I do not want to get married. I do not want to be entangled by earthly affairs and family life."</p>
<p>One morning, the Hindu daughter was crying and crying. Her father asked, "What is wrong? Did you quarrel with your future husband?"</p>
<p>"No, no, no!" she replied.</p>
<p>"Then why are you crying?"</p>
<p>"Father, you have given him an overdose!" she said. "At your suggestion, he studied our Hindu scriptures so seriously that now he says he does not want to marry me. He has decided to dedicate his life to God." She was crying inconsolably and added, "In my case, I was not paying any attention while studying the Muslim sacred books. I was only interested in having him as my husband."</p>
<p>We have no idea at what point God's Hour will strike for someone to turn towards God. Sometimes we start with curiosity. But God may want us to go beyond curiosity. Here is the proof. At first the Muslim son was curious to see what the Hindu scriptures had to offer him. He got so much inspiration from the sacred books that he wanted only to be absorbed in prayer and meditation. He went farther and deeper, and found, in the Hindu religion, the message of renunciation. He renounced his future wife and he renounced the world. He said, "I want to give my life to God."</p>  </div>
