<p>Lord, I need You more than You need me.<br /> I love You more than You love me,<br /> At least on the physical plane,<br /> Or at least that is what my proud discovery is.<br /> So Lord, don't make a fool of Yourself<br /> By cherishing unhealthy thoughts<br /> That I do not care for You at all.<br /> I do care for You, hundreds of times,<br /> But what actually happens is this:<br /> Sometimes my old friends,<br /> Fear, doubt, insecurity and anxiety<br /> Make me feel that they need me<br /> More than I need You.<br /> Therefore, my ever-sympathetic heart<br /> Overflows to them with diamond-concern.<br /> Alas, at that time I forget You,<br /> I don't love You and I even ignore You.<br /> Lord, since I love You and need You<br /> More than You love and need me,<br /> I am bound to return to You<br /> And to You alone, without fail.</p>
