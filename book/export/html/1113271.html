<h2>I</h2>


<p>What we understand easily we believe we understand rightly,<br /> We make a confusion between the face and its mask.<br /> We think the horizon line is the finishing line,<br /> We forget that a blue sky stretches still beyond.</p>
<p>The world is built with the tears and smiles of the gods...<br /> A child is at play on the sandy beaches:<br /> He is never to be met in the crowd...<br /> A jewel knows not itself, nor does a pearl know that it is a pearl!</p>
<p>The goal fixed for ever, for ever he goes on,<br /> The path offers no bar, no call reaches from behind:<br /> Lo! The eternal voyager, eternally free,<br /> Eyes ever turned to the dawning East, never to the setting West.</p>
<p>He hides behind a veil and moves on...<br /> Is it the stream? Is it the ocean vast?</p>
<p>— Nolini Kanta Gupta</p>
