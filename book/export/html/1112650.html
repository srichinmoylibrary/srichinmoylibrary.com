<p>In Canada when I was flying from Halifax to Quebec, I was carrying my smallest esraj. When I went to sit in my seat, a stewardess asked, "How is it you have brought that in here? Did you pay for it?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, they didn't ask me to pay."</p>
<p>She said, "It is illegal. You have to pay and you can't bring it here."</p>
<p>I said, "They allowed me to come in here and they saw that I was carrying this."</p>
<p>I was sitting on the extreme right. A musician happened to be on the extreme left. He took my side. He got furious, and started abusing the stewardess: "You make your rules every second. All over the world we go and here you won't allow us to carry an instrument." I said, "When I went to Halifax, Air Canada allowed me to bring this with me."</p>
<p>Then the stewardess got frightened or perhaps she was amused. She said, "Please give me the instrument. I will keep it very safe and give it back when we land." She kept her promise. As soon as the plane touched the ground, she brought the instrument back.</p>  </div>
