<p>Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice within, sacrifice without-sacrifice, the secret and sacred achievement above all others. To the brave self-givers, the Secretary-General's mind is all appreciation and his heart is all admiration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No day of peace should pass without a special salute to the brave men and women of our international peace-keeping forces. For them, every day is devoted to peace. For this, they have earned the respect, the admiration and the gratitude of the international community."</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
