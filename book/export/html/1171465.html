<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have other ideas. The only question is whether they can be fully manifested. I am not going to stop at 1,300. But before we go beyond that, the runners must acquire the inner confidence that they can do it. It is just like the idea of the marathon. In the beginning, just a handful of people ran the New York Marathon. At that time people did not have the confidence. Now twenty or thirty thousand people are running it.</p>  </div>
