<p>"O God,<br /> Where are You?"</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> I am in between<br /> Your desire and your aspiration."</p>
<p>"My God,<br /> Do You have anything special to do<br /> With my desire and my aspiration?"</p>

<p>"My Lord,<br /> What is the difference<br /> Between human love and divine love?"</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> The difference<br /> Between human love and divine love<br /> Is very simple:<br />  Human love desperately needs;<br />  Divine love abundantly feeds."</p>

<div id="node-1102061" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>

<p>God is anxiously and eagerly waiting<br />  To be claimed by you.<br /> What you need<br />  Is the right way<br /> And what you will need<br />  Is the right moment<br /> To claim Him as your very own.</p>

<p>"My sweet Lord,<br /> Please tell me the difference<br /> Between You and me."</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> The difference is very small:<br /> You are possessed<br />  By your little possessions;<br /> And I am released<br />  By My infinite Possessions."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1102066" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13.</h1>
  
 

<p>My question is:<br /> "How can I leave the world<br /> Better than I found it?"</p>
<p>God's answer is:<br /> "Give the world a moment of your concern<br /> And give Me your endless night of ignorance.<br /> Lo, you have achieved your noble goal."</p>

<p>My Lord tells me<br /> That I need both science and spirituality.</p>
<p>In my life of desire,<br /> I need science<br /> In order to relay my thoughts<br /> To the furthest end of the globe.</p>
<p>In my life of aspiration,<br /> I need spirituality<br /> To bring me the message of the Unknown,<br /> The ultimate Beyond.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">17.</h1>
  
 

<p>This morning I accused God<br /> Of making Heaven superior to earth.<br /> He denied my accusation.</p>
<p>He said:<br /> "I offer My Blessings equally<br /> To both Heaven and earth.<br /> Heaven is with Me and in Me.<br /> That is why Heaven is eternally divine.<br /> Earth is of Me and for Me.<br /> That is why earth is eternally evolving<br />  Towards My transcendental Perfection."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">18.</h1>
  
 

<p>"My Lord,<br /> Do I need both Consolation and Compassion,<br /> Or is one of the two enough?"</p>
<p>"My son,<br /> You need both Consolation and Compassion.<br /> You need Consolation from Me<br /> Because you are defeated<br />  In the battlefield of life.<br /> You need Compassion<br /> To act as a divine hero<br />  In the battlefield of life.<br /> Also you need Compassion<br /> To act as a victor<br />  Over the forces of failure."</p>

<p>When I am without God,<br />  I cry.<br /> I cry because there is no other way<br />  To realise God<br /> Than to cry silently and incessantly.</p>
<p>When I am with God,<br />  I shed tears.<br /> I shed tears because there is no other way<br />  To express my eternal gratitude to God<br /> Than to shed tears soulfully and unreservedly.</p>

<p>"At times I achieve<br />  According to what I believe.<br /> At times I believe<br />  According to what I achieve.<br /> Am I doing the right thing, my Lord?"</p>
<p>"My son, the right thing will be<br /> For you to achieve<br />  Only what I want you to achieve<br /> And to believe<br />  Only what I want you to believe.<br /> What I want you to achieve<br />  Is perfect perfection.<br /> What I want you to believe<br />  Is the immortality of your aspiration."</p>

<p>"My Lord, I would like to drink Your Nectar so that I can be immortal like You."</p>
<p>"My sweet child, certainly I shall give you My Nectar to drink, but there is another way for you to be immortal.

Do you want to drink My Nectar, or do you want to offer Me your love, devotion and surrender?"</p>
<p>"My Lord, I want to do both. I want to drink Your Nectar, and also I want to offer You all my love, devotion and surrender. While drinking Your Nectar, I shall sit down at Your Feet with my life of gratitude.

<p>"Lord, be sincere. When I criticise You, do You get angry with me or do You punish me inwardly?"</p>
<p>"My son, when you criticise Me, neither do I get angry with you nor do I punish you. I simply try to lift your standard of human understanding to My highest standard of divine dispensation. There I show you My Love, Joy and Pride, as here I show you My Patience, Concern and Compassion."</p>

That means I shall not use the words Infinity, Eternity and Immortality any more."</p>
<p>"My sweetest child, you don't have to deceive yourself and humanity. I am teaching you the meaning of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.

<p>"My Lord, only once! When?"</p>
<p>"My child, it was the time when I created My creation and saw it becoming totally attached to Me. I am the Creator, eternal, free and detached. How could My own creation be attached, totally attached and bound? Believe Me, My child, I could not account for it. I had to doubt My own capacity."</p>

And since it is difficult for them to think of Me, I think of them constantly. O humanity's advocate, do you agree with Me?"</p>

<p>"My child,<br /> I get Joy only when you talk to Me.<br /> My Joy is rest, ever-nourishing<br /> And ever-fulfilling."</p>
<p>"My Lord, I am a clever fellow.<br /> I was just being modest and polite.<br /> It is I who am actually tired."</p>
<p>"I see.<br /> Then, My child, sleep.<br /> Sleep inside My Life's Depth,<br /> Inside My Soul's Breath,<br /> Inside My Vision's Glow,<br /> Inside My Reality's Flow.<br /> Sleep, My child, sleep."</p>
