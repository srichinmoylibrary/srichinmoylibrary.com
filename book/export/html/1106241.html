<p>The world is so peculiar. Last year, when I went to a gym in San Francisco, the owner would not condescend even to talk to me. One of his workers showed me so many exercises. He was so kind to me and gave me lots of advice.</p>
<p>Now the owner has become my greatest admirer. He has posted so many pictures of my weightlifting. Yesterday he predicted I will do 2,000 pounds. He has pictures of my 600 and 800-pound lifts. But when I went to his gym the first time, he would not talk to me.</p>
