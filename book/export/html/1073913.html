<p>Ganapati’s parents never allowed their children to smoke or even to drink tea. Ganapati drank tea once in Chittagong and at the Indian spiritual community two or three times. Later when he would visit India, he would drink tea like anything. In his childhood home, tea and coffee were forbidden, and chicken was also forbidden, although in Chittagong the children could eat duck or goat meat. Then in the spiritual community there was no meat or fish allowed.</p>
<p>Once one of the servants instigated Ganapati’s eldest brother Samrat to smoke. After tasting cigarette smoke for a few seconds, the poor brother’s head began rotating. He was on a swing, and he fell down and got hurt. His right eye was very badly damaged.</p>
<p>Ganapati’s eldest sister was quite short, like a dwarf, in comparison to this brother’s height. When she discovered the cause of his fall, she commanded him to come inside a particular room. She bolted the door from inside and started beating him. He was crying and crying. He was much stronger than his sister, but how could he beat her? Respect is respect. How could he stop her? So he had to accept her beating. Then he took an oath that he would never smoke again because he was so badly beaten. That was his first and last time smoking.</p>
<p>Luckily, little Ganapati never wanted to smoke. When he saw his brother’s fate at the hands of his sister, he said, “Who wants to be beaten?”</p>  </div>
