<p>Mexico has Indian culture to some degree. My brother Chitta has asked me to visit Indian temples when I go to Mexico. He said that many ancient religious temples are there.</p>
<p>Near Guatemala City we went to one convent. It is such a beautiful, huge place with many statues of the Christ, but they have turned it into a business. All spiritual places meet with the same fate. I saw hundreds of people eating there. We thought that no disciples would be there. First, we saw Madhuri; then we saw Diksha taking pictures.</p>
