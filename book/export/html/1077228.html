<p>A life without humour is undoubtedly a life of slow but certain failure. Humour is the spice of life. Humour shakes off tension-fever, unnerves frustration-night and brings to the fore spontaneously encouraging reality and fulfilling beauty. A Chinese restaurant once inspired Zatopek, and his inspiration he offered to us in a strikingly amusing way: "There are three things worth living for: American luxury, Japanese women and Chinese food."</p>  </div>
