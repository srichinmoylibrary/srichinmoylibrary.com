    <title>Question: What should be the attitude of a world-server in relation to dictatorships, imposed will and the restriction of individual rights and liberties? Should one refuse any contact with dictatorships or compromise in the hope of their evolution?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A world-server will never compromise. His is the life that will soulfully and dauntlessly fight dictatorship, imposed will and the restriction of individual rights and liberties. Compromise can never be the answer. When we make a compromise with darkness and ignorance, then it becomes a partnership: ignorance gives half and light gives half. At that time, darkness will rule half the world. The half that ignorance has is only destructive and has to be totally transformed. The entire ignorance-world has to come and take shelter in light.</p>
<p>So there can be no compromise between truth and falsehood, between God and Satan, between light and darkness. If you compromise with darkness and hope that in the process of evolution darkness eventually will change into light, then I wish to say that this is a false hope. Darkness will not change; on its own it will never give way to light. It is the power of light, operating consciously in and through darkness, that has to compel darkness to surrender for its own good.</p>  </div>
