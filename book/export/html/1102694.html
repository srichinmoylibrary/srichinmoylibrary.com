<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. Religious fervour or religious joy we get mainly on the vital level, though sometimes we get it in the mind. And it satisfies us only on the vital or mental level. But when one experiences delight, it permeates one's entire being. Delight is something infinitely higher than religious fervour. It is on the strength of our oneness with the Absolute Supreme, or on the strength of our total dedication to His Will, that we get delight. Delight deals with our own birthless and deathless inner existence, with the full manifestation of the divine within us. So these are two different things.</p>
