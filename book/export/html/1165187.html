<p>What is patience? It is a divine virtue. Unfortunately, we are not only badly wanting in this divine virtue, but we also neglect it most foolishly.</p>
<p>What is patience? It is an inner assurance of God's unreserved Love and unconditional Guidance. Patience is God's Power hidden in us to weather the teeming storms of life.</p>
<p>If failure has the strength to turn your life into bitterness itself, then patience has the strength to turn your life into the sweetest joy. Do not surrender to fate after a single failure. Failure, at most, precedes success. But success once achieved, confidence becomes your name.</p>
<p>Have patience in the body; you will be able to accept the whole world. Have patience in the vital; you will be able to hold the whole world. Have patience in the mind; you will neither forget nor lose the world. Have patience in the heart; you will feel that the world is not only with you and in you, but for you.</p>
<p>Time is a flying bird. Do you want to capture the bird and encage it? Your fondest dreams will be transformed into fruitful realities if you just know the secret of growing the patience-tree in your heart.</p>
<p>Patience is your sincere surrender to God's Will. This surrender is by no means the effacement of the finite self which you now are, but a total transcendence of your finite existence to the infinite Self.</p>
<p>In silence, patience speaks to you: "Try to live the inner life. You will not only see and reach your Goal, but also become the Goal."</p>
<p>Patience can never be imposed on you from outside. It is your own inner wealth, wisdom, peace and victory.</p>  </div>
