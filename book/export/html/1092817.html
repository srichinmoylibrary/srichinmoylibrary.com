<p>The British Government home-interned Subhas in December 1940. The real royal Bengal Tiger, to the nation's widest astonishment, disappeared the following month! This disappearance of his created a tremendous sensation and uproar nationwide.</p>
<p>Poet Rabindranath Tagore was anxiety-stricken. He immediately sent a message by telegram to the family of Subhas:</p>
<p>"DEEPLY CONCERNED OVER SUBHAS' DISAPPEARANCE. CONVEY TO MOTHER MY SYMPATHY. KINDLY KEEP ME INFORMED NEWS."</p>
<p>Sarat Chandra Bose wired back:</p>
<p>"MOTHER AND WE PROFOUNDLY TOUCHED BY MESSAGE. NO NEWS SUBHAS YET DESPITE UTMOST EFFORTS LAST FEW DAYS. HOPE HE WILL HAVE YOUR BLESSINGS WHEREVER HE MAY BE."</p>
<p>Mahatma also sent a telegram to the family. He said to them:</p>
<p>"STARTLING NEWS ABOUT SUBHAS. PLEASE WIRE TRUTH. ANXIOUS. HOPE ALL WELL-BAPU."</p>
<p>This time Sarat wisely threw out a red herring. His reply was:</p>
<p>"WE ARE AS MUCH IN DARK AS PUBLIC ABOUT SUBHAS' WHEREABOUTS AND INTENTION AND EVEN THE EXACT TIME OF LEAVING. NO NEWS IN SPITE OF BEST EFFORTS FOR LAST THREE DAYS. CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE RENUNCIATION."</p>  </div>
