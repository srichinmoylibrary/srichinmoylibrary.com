<p>They are great<br /> Not because<br /> They love their God unconditionally.</p>
<p>They are great<br /> Not because<br /> They serve their God unconditionally.</p>
<p>They are great<br /> Because they rightly claim<br /> Their God as their very own.</p>
<p>They are great<br /> Because their God knows<br /> They are His Voice,<br /> They are His Light.</p>
