<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You will be happy to learn that on the 9th of June, I will have an interview with Pope Paul. This half-hour private interview will be my third interview. The first time was three years ago. Then I had an interview a second time, but he was not well, so I could only see him for a few minutes. He is aware of our activities at the United Nations and I have received some letters from him inspiring me and encouraging me in my activities. So I will speak with him on the 9th of June.</p>
<p><em>Bishop Kennedy:</em> He understands English, but does not speak it very well.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He is full of love and compassion.</p>  </div>
