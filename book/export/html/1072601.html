<p>One disciple, who was an amateur magician said, “Master, you haven’t yet told us any stories about levitation.”</p>
<p>The Master said, “Even now, in this incarnation, when I think of my previous incarnation, I get such an emotional thrill. In front of many people I used to clap my hands and rise up into the air or disappear. I can’t do it in this incarnation because of my tremendous weight. In my previous incarnation I was very light. That is why I am asking all of you to lose weight. If you lose weight, then easily you can try!”</p>
<p>“Master,” said one disciple, “can you tell us where this power comes from?”</p>
<p>“There are eight main <em>siddhis</em>, or supernatural powers: <em>Anima</em> (subtleness), <em>Laghima</em> (lightness), <em>Mahima</em> (greatness), <em>Prapti</em> (attainments), <em>Prakamya</em> (indomitable willpower), <em>Isita</em> (superiority), <em>Vasita</em> (self-control), <em>Kamavasayita</em> (control of passion). Inside these main siddhis there are at least one hundred more siddhis. What you call levitation is the second of the siddhis. When you get this siddhi, instead of becoming a fake magician, you will be able to become a genuine magician. The first siddhi makes the body as subtle as possible so it can disappear; that is called anima. So when the eight siddhis come, anima and laghima usually come first. They are at once the easiest and the most effective of the eight siddhis. What did some of the Christian mystics do? Brother Lawrence used to levitate while cooking. He used to float up to the ceiling of the kitchen. Believe it or not, there are many Indian sadhus who can do the levitation-miracle quite easily.</p>  </div>
