<p>O Children of the Supreme!<br />I bow to the Supreme within you.</p>
<p>Today my body completes thirty-five years of its earthly existence. You are entering into me with your hearts' joy and your souls' aspiration. I am placing your divine wealth at the Feet of the Supreme. I am also offering to the Supreme all that you have and all that you are.</p>
<p>A song without notes is no song. A song breathes because it has a Singer. The Singer is the Supreme.</p>
<p>A tree without branches is no tree. A tree lives because it has a Root. The Root is the Supreme.</p>
<p>O Flames of my Spirit's fire,<br />Fly into the Transcendental Beyond.</p>
