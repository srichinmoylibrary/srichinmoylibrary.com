<h2>The hundred-dollar room</h2>

<p>I stayed at the Princess Hotel. It was supposed to be quite elegant, but inside I saw only dirt and filth. Everything was broken and everything smelled. My room number was 226, but I had to press "3" in the elevator to go the second floor.</p>
<p>In that place everything went wrong. When I went to take a shower, in a few minutes the hot water became unbearably hot and there was no cold water. This was a one-hundred-dollar room. Forty dollars would have been more than enough!</p>  </div>
