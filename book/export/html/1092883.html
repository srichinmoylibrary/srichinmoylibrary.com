<p>Subhas came to realise<br /> From an early age<br /> That his mission was not the acceptance<br /> Of life-renunciation.<br /> His mission was to throw himself<br /> Into the vortex of self-sacrificing activities<br /> With the view to liberating his Motherland<br /> From the shackles of the foreign yoke.</p>
