<p>While I was running in Boston two young men were behind me. Then they passed me and said, "Buddy, come on."</p>
<p>One gentleman said to me, "Friend, my friend, don't give up!"</p>
<p>At one point I was breathing heavily. A little boy came up to me with a few pieces of orange. Usually I don't take oranges, but the little boy was so kind, so I took a piece of orange from him. Then he said, "Don't die, don't die!"</p>
