<p>During the flight, the stewardess came over to me and asked, "Do you want cereal or sausage?"</p>
<p>I said, "Cereal." Then I started meditating and entered into a high consciousness.</p>
<p>They put some yogurt in front of me, but also ham. When I saw the ham, I said, "Great!"</p>
<p>I thought I would just eat the yogurt and cereal. I started to pour some milk on my cereal, but the milk immediately jumped up and spilled on my trousers. The cereal dish was covered with plastic, but I did not notice it.</p>
<p>A bearded man sitting near me saw what happened and said, "Are you a philosopher? I think you are a philosopher." Then he added, "I am, too!"</p>
