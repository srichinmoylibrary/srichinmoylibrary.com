<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He takes away the Grace for some time. The person who does not use the Hour of God forfeits God’s Grace. I have just explained that later on, God will compel the slacker. But at that particular time, it is an act of withdrawal on God’s part. Of course, one day everyone will realise God, but when God withdraws, it is a matter of centuries and not just years.</p>
<p><em>But if His Grace is infinite, how can He take it away for a while?</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, God’s Grace is infinite, but God is working through the finite. When the finite is unable to receive the Grace, due to its limited receptivity, the Grace is forced to withdraw. God can stay in you only according to your receptivity and capacity. He is Infinite, but I am finite. If the vessel in me is very limited and He is limitless, how long can He stay? Only according to my receptivity can He pour down His Grace. And if my vessel is very tiny, poor God!</p>  </div>
