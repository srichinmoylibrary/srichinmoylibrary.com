<p><em>Question:</em> Can you tell me if I'm meditating correctly?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are meditating well; yet you have unconscious fear in your meditation. This is not good. If you are trying to do the right thing, why should you be afraid? You want to meditate well, but unfortunately fear is constantly torturing your mind. Since you have not deliberately done anything wrong and you are not purposely going to do anything wrong, please feel that there is nothing to fear. Then your meditation will be very deep and sublime.</p>  </div>
