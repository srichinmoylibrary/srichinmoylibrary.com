  <h1 class="book-heading">The Nobel Peace Prize</h1>
  
 
<p>Each member of the United Nations is a force, and the source of this force is either a human desire or a divine will. The human desire cherishes the love of power. The divine will cherishes the power of love. The Nobel Peace award to the United Nations gloriously declares the victory of the power of soulful love and fruitful oneness. Let us learn from the Secretary-General what the higher will accomplishes in and through us for the world-family:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Peace-keeping operations symbolise the world-community's will to peace and represent the impartial, practical expression of that will. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to these operations illuminates the hope and strengthens the promise of this extraordinary concept."</p>
