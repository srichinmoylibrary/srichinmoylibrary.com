<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At the very beginning, before it becomes a serious case! If you know that somebody is doing something wrong, immediately you should warn that person or tell him very compassionately to stop. Always you have to act when it is a small thing â€” before it becomes a most serious disease. Do not wait one month or two months to see whether the individual is going to change his mind and adopt the right course. If someone is going away from the light, it will be difficult not only for him but also for you to come back to the light. So if you have real concern for that person, then right at the very beginning you have to beg him or beg her not to take the wrong step.</p>  </div>
