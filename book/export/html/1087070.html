<p>Yesterday I went to a coffee shop after I had gone shopping. A lady came in after me and ordered some food. Then she said that she was going to make a phone call. When she came back to the counter the waitress said to her, "Here is your food."</p>
<p>The lady started screaming at the waitress and then went out of the coffee shop. The waitress followed her, also screaming, because the lady had ordered food and had gone away without paying for it. God knows what happened during her phone conversation, but she did not want to eat.</p>
