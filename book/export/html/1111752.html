<p>When I was dying around eight or nine miles, I saw some new disciples from Connecticut. There were two girls and one boy. They passed me with folded hands. I could see from their faces that they were disciples, but I didn't know their names. Then one girl said, "Guru!"</p>
<p>While I was walking, she went ahead of me 30, 40, 200 metres. She never stopped; she only ran. Then, when I started running again, I caught up with her. Later, when I started walking again, she continued running and passed me.</p>
