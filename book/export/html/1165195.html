<p>O my Mother-Earth, my usefulness has ended.</p>
<p>"O my son, your ignorance has ended."</p>
<p>O my Mother-Earth, I have sung my swan song.</p>
<p>"O my son, but you have not sung God's Song and my song."</p>
<p>What are your songs?</p>
<p>"My song is aspiration and God's Song is inspiration. If you and I sing the song of aspiration, God will welcome us."</p>
<p>"If you and God sing the song of inspiration, I shall welcome both of you."</p>
<p>"When I welcome you and God, I know you will offer me your God, your Goal, and from God I shall also get you, His Soul."</p>
<p>"When God welcomes us, you and me, I shall give Him the breath of my existence and you will give Him the soul-flames of your liberation."</p>  </div>
