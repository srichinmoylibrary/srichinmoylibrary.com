<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you dream that you are injured, that means that you are being attacked by some undivine forces. These forces may attack you on any plane — on the physical plane, on the vital plane, on the mental plane or even on the psychic plane.</p>
<p>The attack and the injury may take place on any plane. But when you see it, it is your mind that sees it, and it is the mind that convinces you that you are injured.</p>
<p>When you have a dream that you are in a battle, if it is on a higher plane, that means you are fighting against ignorance. If it is on a lower plane, it only means that your own undivine life is fighting against somebody else’s undivine life. But when one becomes a spiritual seeker like you, if you dream of a battle, that usually means that you are fighting against teeming ignorance, against the soldiers of ignorance. You have already taken the side of God, truth and light, so you are fighting against the forces that are standing against you, against your highest realisation of light and truth, against your revelation and manifestation of the divinity within you.</p>  </div>
