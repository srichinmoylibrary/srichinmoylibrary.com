<p>Tagore and Gandhi are two immortals. They were extremely good friends and they had tremendous appreciation and admiration for each other. Tagore used to call Gandhi "Mahatma," which means great soul, and Gandhi used to call Tagore "Gurudev"-spiritual Teacher, Master of inner wisdom and light.</p>
<p>Once, in front of many people, they were having a simple discussion. Unfortunately, the discussion became very heated. Some people took Tagore's side, while others took Gandhi's side. A great artist named Nandalal Bose happened to be there, so people asked him which side he was on.</p>
<p>"We are taking sides," they said, "so you must take one side."</p>
<p>"I am sorry," the artist replied. "Please do not ask me to take sides."</p>
<p>Still, everyone wanted to hear his opinion. "You must be in agreement with either Gandhi or Tagore. We are curious to know what you are thinking," they said.</p>
<p>Again Nandalal Bose said, "I can't take any side."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" they asked him. "Don't you have a mind of your own?"</p>
<p>Finally Nandalal Bose said, "I am an artist. If you ask me which colour I like most, I have to say that I feel that all colours are good; to me they are all excellent. Here, I have great admiration for these two, so for me both of them are right. I won't take either side. Both Tagore and Gandhi are right."</p>  </div>
