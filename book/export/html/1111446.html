<p>This morning when I was running, I passed three black boys going to school. The tallest was telling the younger ones: "Our Indian Pope is running around the block."</p>
<p>I said, "Thank you, thank you!"</p>
<p>I am also known for my monkeys. Three or four times I have heard school children talking about them. The children stand in the street and watch them on my porch.</p>
