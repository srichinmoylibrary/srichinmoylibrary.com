<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us give dream a higher and more fulfilling name; let us call it ‘vision’. The relationship between vision and reality is extremely sweet, significant and invaluable. What we call vision tomorrow that very thing is reality. But we get this experience only when we are in the physical plane, the vital plane, the mental plane or the psychic plane. When we are on a very, very high plane, the plane of the soul, or in a plane which is higher than the soul’s plane — such as the plane of the cosmic gods and goddesses — there vision and reality are inseparable. On other planes, vision and reality are two different things which eventually become one, but on the soul’s plane or higher they are <em>already</em> one. On other planes they are playing a hide-and-seek game. But in the higher regions, you can see that they are inseparable.</p>  </div>
