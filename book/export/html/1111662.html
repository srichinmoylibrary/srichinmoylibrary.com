<p>While I was walking, I saw Abhipsa at a distance. He had on a Bill Rodgers running suit, and the back of it was shining.</p>
<p>Once a seeker was misusing his occult power by showing light, so Sri Ramakrishna took away the light. Ramakrishna did the man a big favour. But Abhipsa was not misusing his light, so I didn't take it away.</p>
