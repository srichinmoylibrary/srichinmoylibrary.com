<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I must be very sincere. I did not complete the Ashram education, but I studied a lot on my own at the Ashram's main library. I left the school and worked at various jobs in the Ashram: hand-made paper, dyeing and other cottage industries. I also worked in the electrical department.</p>  </div>
