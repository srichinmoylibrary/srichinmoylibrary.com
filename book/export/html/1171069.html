SCA 598-608. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 4 February 1990 at Progress-Promise in New York.</p>
<h2>Question: Yesterday you were talking about the prayer “Let Thy Will be done.” Is it wrong to pray for something specific?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to see what kind of prayer it is. If you pray to God, “God, give me the Light of Compassion,” that prayer is not at all bad. Definitely you have to use your wisdom. If you pray to God for His Compassion, for His Love, for His Blessings, those things are part and parcel of His Will. But if you ask, “Shall I pass in the driving test?” or “Give me a new car,” this kind of thing is totally different.</p>  </div>
