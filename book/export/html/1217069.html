<p>Today I spontaneously set to music 201 Bengali songs during our four-hour meditation in the grounds of the Sheraton Hotel. Sometimes I was singing alone, and then the disciples were learning the song and singing with me. I was having a wonderful meditation. While we were singing, the sky made a solemn promise to meditate on our behalf. The disciples were not looking at the sky, but I saw that the sky was meditating on our behalf.</p>
<p>When we pray to God and meditate on God, everything helps us. When Lord Buddha realised God at the foot of the boddhi tree, the tree itself was helping him. Today the vastness of the sky was helping us. The silence-swing of the sky was cradling us.</p>
