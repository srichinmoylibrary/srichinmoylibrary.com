<p>Someone infinitely wiser than you<br /> Is waiting at your mind's door.<br /> Someone infinitely purer than you<br /> Is waiting at your heart's door.<br /> Someone infinitely more self-giving than you<br /> Is waiting at your life's door.<br /> Welcome Him.<br /> Give Him the opportunity<br /> To do everything through you.<br /> Needless to say,<br /> He will do everything for you<br /> With utmost joy.</p>
