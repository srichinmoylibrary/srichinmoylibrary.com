<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A seeker must feel that he is all duty. This duty is not enforced duty; this duty is a God-ordained necessity. A seeker can increase his beauty only by increasing his duty to the Inner Pilot. The more you take your life as a life of divine, supreme duty to the Supreme, the more your body, vital, mind, heart and soul will spread beauty. By increasing your sense of inner and outer duty to the Supreme, you increase your inner and outer beauty as well as the beauty in the world around you. And all these forms of beauty are noticeable and manifested.</p>  </div>
