  <h1 class="book-heading">Occultism and spirituality</h1>
  
 
<p>The occult power is taught, as it were, in God's private Primary School; the spiritual power in His High School; the omnipotent Will in His University.</p>
<p>An occultist, in wielding his power from one plane to another, flies faster than sound. The Yogi, embracing each plane of consciousness, marches forward more confidently than a commander.</p>
<p>Difficult is it, if not impossible, for a one-pointed occultist to have an amenable and adaptable consciousness. His endless battles for control of and supremacy over the vital planes render his mind rigid and inflexible.</p>
<p>The yogi may not be qualified to help the occultist in his precarious tight-rope walking; but the occultist is certainly not qualified to advise a yogi on how to attain an inner level of poise.</p>
<p>Many are the spiritual figures who display contempt for the occultist. Many occultist, using their powers for vain and egotistical display if not for money, rightly deserve this contempt. But very often the abusers, lacking the occult capacity themselves, are merely adopting a sour-grapes attitude.</p>
<p>An occult power and a spiritual freedom often fight shy of each other. Occult power is a restricted force used to serve a particular purpose. Spiritual freedom reveals the universal consciousness in its vast totality.</p>
<p>The march of time bows to the occultist; the glory of distance surrenders to him; the secrets of humanity prostrate before him. Yet strangely enough, the occultist himself finds no escape. He, too, has to sit at the feet of the Omniscient Vision and the Omnipotent Will.</p>
