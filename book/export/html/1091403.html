<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dear Mr. President, we are coming from Viet Nam. You were there during the Viet Nam War, where you played your role as a supreme leader and diplomat for your country.</p>
<p><em>President Ramos:</em> In which area were you?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
<p><em>President Ramos:</em> I hope you can help the Philippines also.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We belong to one family. Right now the brothers and sisters are having a dispute. But one day the same brothers and sisters will enjoy friendship and oneness.</p>
<p><em>President Ramos:</em> This is what we try to do here on a moderate scale among the quarrelling Filipinos. Unfortunately, they have been quarrelling for a long time. We hope to be able to bring peace to both the extreme left and the extreme right — not only in a political sense but also in terms of social justice. We must persuade the more affluent among our countrymen to share their worldly goods with the poor. That will go a long way towards forging a unification of the country. Many of the violent conflicts come from socio-economic reasons — the unjust distribution of wealth. Friends and neighbours start quarrelling when they don't get three meals a day. You know about this famous phenomenon.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I come from India. There we speak about poverty's tyranny. It is so true!</p>
<p><em>(Presenting a plaque to the President)</em> I was inspired to compose a prayerful song about you. My students would like to offer this song to you.</p>
<p><em>President Ramos:</em> I am deeply honoured, Sri Chinmoy. This plaque looks like a masterpiece of composition and art.</p>
<p><em>The singers perform the song dedicated to the President.</em></p>
<p><em>President Ramos:</em> Thank you very much. This is the first time somebody has composed a song for me.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have selected some of your momentous utterances and set tune to them. My students will now perform them for you.</p>
<p><em>The singers perform four songs that Sri Chinmoy composed by setting tune to quotations from the President's speeches.</em></p>
<p><em>President Ramos:</em> Thank you very much. You must have worked very hard for the last one, because I remember I said this only last New Year's day.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The day before yesterday I read it, and then immediately I set tune to it.</p>
<p><em>President Ramos:</em> I see. I am deeply honoured that we are now co-authors of one of the top ten! I wish I had brought my oldest daughter with me. She also practises meditation.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is our way of life. We pray and meditate and try to be of service to mankind. With our prayers and meditations we try to bring about world peace.</p>
<p><em>President Ramos: (presenting Sri Chinmoy with a decorative plate)</em> This is a very small token compared to these songs. I would like to give this to you because, in a sense, it represents the government as well as the people of the Philippines. You can keep it at your headquarters.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For me, this plate is most precious... We have with us our Peace Torch, which your predecessor held a few years ago. This torch goes all over the world carrying our love for mankind. I would be extremely grateful if you could hold it for a moment.</p>
<p><em>President Ramos:</em> Yes, with best wishes and appreciation from the Philippines.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are most grateful.</p>
<p><em>President Ramos:</em> Thank you very much for your visit. I hope you will be successful in your efforts.</p>  </div>
