<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every time, imagine that you are doing better. In the high jump, when you have reached a particular height, the mind will say, "Oh, this is the maximum height." Forget about the mind. Imagine that you have jumped two inches higher. Keep the height there, not lower. While imagining, be very, very happy. Feel that you have done it.</p>
<p>Always make yourself happy by imagining something higher, something longer, something faster. When it is running, just imagine that you are going faster. When it is high jump or pole vault, imagine jumping higher. Each time you imagine, feel that you are very happy, very happy that you have done it. Your imagination has absolutely no barriers. When you are imagining something, do not think that there are hurdles that you have to jump over. No, feel that the road is absolutely clear; there is only you and nobody else on the road.</p>
<p>I am very, very happy to speak to you on the eve of your Olympic championship. Your happiness is your strength. Happiness will give you confidence; confidence will give you happiness. If you are doing the high jump or anything else, feel that you are doing it to make yourself happy. If today you are not doing your best, only tell yourself: "It is not necessary. When the time comes, I can easily do it." Do not say, "Today if I am not doing it, how will I do it in the Olympics?" No. You have to say, "It is not necessary. I will be able to do it easily."</p>
<p>At every moment challenge your mind. You be the boss of your mind. The mind will always try to create self-doubt. The mind never gives us joy. Even if it gives us a certain amount of joy for five seconds, after five minutes it takes away even more joy. We may get limited joy from the mind. Then the mind takes away this limited joy plus it brings unlimited unhappiness. One dollar it gives. Then afterwards it takes away that one dollar and tries to steal ten dollars more from the heart. The heart has joy, so secretly the mind enters into the heart-room and takes away the heart's joy.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, do it happily. Do not have any regrets: "Oh, I should have done this; I should have done that." No, whatever you have done, feel that that is absolutely the right thing. That will give you joy. Once you do it, feel that you have done your best. If you say, "I should have done something else," it will weaken you. Then you will not be able to do your other events well. Always do everything well and say, "I have done the right thing. If I have taken rest, it was absolutely necessary. If I have not taken rest, it is because it was not necessary." Always convince your mind with happiness, happiness.</p>
<p>I wish you good, better, best of luck in every event!</p>  </div>
