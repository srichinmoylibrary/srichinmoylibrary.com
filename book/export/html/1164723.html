<p><em>(Krishna and Arjuna are together.)</em></p>
<p>ARJUNA: Krishna, on different occasions I have asked you for advice. Every time your advice has strengthened my heart and fulfilled my purpose. But today I am not in any specific difficulty. Today is the day for me to ask you what your supreme advice is.</p>
<p><em>(Krishna sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Manmana bhava madbhakto</em><br />     /Madyaji mam namaskuru . . ./</p>


<p>Oneness with My mind establish.<br /> Devote your life to Me.<br /> Sacrifice your breath to Me.<br /> Before Me prostrate.</p>


<p><em>Sarvadharman parityajya</em><br />     /Mam ekam saranam vraja/<br /><em>Aham tva sarvapapebhyo</em><br />     /Moksayisyami ma sucah/</p>

<p>[All duties give up. In Me alone take refuge. From all sins you I shall liberate. Grieve not.]</p>
<p>ARJUNA: Krishna, my Lord...</p>
<p><em>(Arjuna sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Nasto mohah smrtir labdha</em><br />     /Tvatprasadan maya 'cyuta/<br /><em>Sthito 'smi gatasamdehah</em><br />     /Karisye vacanam tava/</p>

<p>[My delusion is now destroyed for good. Through your boundless Grace and Compassion I have recognised the Truth. All my doubts are dispelled. To your Will I surrender my life unconditionally. My existence is totally at your disposal.]</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Arjuna, you are dear to me in my role. You are dearer to me in my soul. You are dearest to me in my Goal. In you is my supreme Realisation. With you is my supreme Manifestation.</p>  </div>
