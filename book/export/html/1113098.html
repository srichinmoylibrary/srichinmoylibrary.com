<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, we don't have to sit in special posture. It is not necessary. Only we have to keep our backbone erect. We have to sit in an erect position so that we can breathe in properly. But we don't have to sit in the cross-legged position in order to practise Yoga. Yoga does not demand that kind of austerity. Only we have to keep our spine very straight, so that our breathing can be regulated properly.</p>  </div>
