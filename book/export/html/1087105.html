<p>The owner of an Army and Navy store in Jamaica likes me very much. The other day when I was in the store I asked him, "Do you have a medium jacket?"</p>
<p>He said, "Medium? For whom?"</p>
<p>I said, "For me!"</p>
<p>He said, "Extra large, extra large!"</p>
<p>I said, "Extra large for whom?"</p>
<p>He said, "Extra large for me."</p>
<p>I said, "You are the owner. Why do I have to get one for you?"</p>
<p>He said, "Can you not buy one for your old age?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am already old."</p>
<p>Then he looked around and found a medium. The jacket cost forty-six dollars, but he reduced the price to forty, and said he wouldn't charge me tax. I gave him the money and smiled, and then went out of the door. Suddenly he started shouting and shouting.</p>
<p>I thought, "What, have I not given him enough money?" So I turned around.</p>
<p>He said, "Man, you have given me fifty dollars!"</p>
<p>I had counted it, but I hadn't noticed that two ten dollar bills were stuck together. If he himself had trusted me and not counted it again, then he would not have known that I had given him too much. But for him to call me back was really something!</p>
