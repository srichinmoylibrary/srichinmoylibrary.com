<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As many times as possible say, "Guru, I love you <em>only</em>. I need you <em>only</em>." The word '<em>only</em>' has the power. Otherwise, just to say "I love you" or "I need you" is not enough. By using the word '<em>only</em>', you become one-pointed. '<em>Only</em>' is just one word, but it has all the power, everything that you need. When you say, "I love you <em>only</em>, I need you <em>only, only, only</em>" â€” that '<em>only</em>' becomes so powerful! Then you can feel close, closer, closest to my heart.</p>  </div>
