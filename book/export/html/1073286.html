<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> Where are you?<br /> "Why?<br /> Am I not on earth?"<br /> No, you are not.</p>
<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> Where are you?<br /> "Why?<br /> Am I not in Heaven?"<br /> No, you are not.<br /> "Where do you think<br /> Then, I am?"<br /> I do not know.</p>
<p>"Brother C,<br /> The beauty of<br /> Your self-chosen ignorance-eye<br /> I am deeply enjoying.<br /> But mind you,<br /> I am not going to treasure it.<br /> Never!"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073289" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> The world needs you.<br /> "No, it does not."<br /> Then whom does it need?<br /> "It does not need anybody.<br /> No, not even our Father.<br /> It needs only one thing:<br /> Eternity's ignorance-feast."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073290" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> Were you really born<br /> On December 25th,<br /> Two thousand years ago?<br /> "I think so.<br /> I am not sure."<br /> How is it<br /> That you are not sure<br /> Of the date of your birth?<br /> "Brother C,<br /> Why should I pay any attention<br /> To the world<br /> That failed to care for me,<br /> To the world<br /> That failed to accept me,<br /> To the world<br /> That succeeded only in crucifying me?"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073291" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> How do you like the fact<br /> That the world is appreciating you today<br /> Unreservedly and unconditionally?<br /> "Yes, brother C,<br /> I should be satisfied<br /> With the world's appreciation-meal at least.<br /> But I am sure you know<br /> That what I really want<br /> Is action-salvation<br /> And<br /> Action-feast."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073292" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> Do you have any special message<br /> For us today,<br /> On your<br /> Earth-awakening<br /> And<br /> God-revealing day?<br /> "Yes, a very short message:<br /> Don't give up."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073293" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 

<p>"Brother C,<br /> Do you have any special message<br /> For me today?"<br /> Yes, I have.<br /> Unlike yours, it is a big one:<br /> Eternity's gratitude-seed,<br /> gratitude-plant,<br /> gratitude-tree<br /> Are glowing within me unreservedly,<br /> Are growing within me unerringly.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073294" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> How is our Father?<br /> "Brother C, believe it or not,<br /> He Himself does not want<br /> To know how He is."<br /> Why not?<br /> "I am sure that you have discovered<br /> The true truth by this time:<br /> This self-chosen ignorance<br /> Is sometimes<br /> A flood of nectar-bliss "</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073295" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> How many churches<br /> Have you already visited tonight?<br /> "Brother C,<br /> Since two thousand years ago<br /> I left the earth-scene<br /> I have completely forgotten<br /> Earth-calculation.<br /> Will you condescend<br /> To count on my behalf?"<br /> Certainly I shall do it for you.<br /> But are you going to understand<br /> My earth-figures<br /> When I take the trouble<br /> Of counting the places<br /> You have visited<br /> Or are going to visit today?<br /> "Brother C,<br /> You will fail,<br /> You are bound to fail.<br /> But for our Father's sake<br /> Keep it a top secret.<br /> Only let <em>me</em> know, please."<br /> Why only you, dearest brother?<br /> "Because."<br /> Why? Why?<br /> "Because, because."<br /> Why? Why? Why?<br /> "Because. Because. Because."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073296" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> Tell me, how is everything<br /> In Heaven?<br /> "Heaven is resting.<br /> And I tell you,<br /> It will not open its eye<br /> Unless earth gives up<br /> Its stupid<br /> Inferiority-pride."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073297" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 

<p>"Brother C,<br /> Tell me, how is everything<br /> On earth?"<br /> Earth is crying.<br /> Do you know why?<br /> "No, I do not,"<br /> Earth is crying<br /> Because<br /> All its protests<br /> Against its transformation-life<br /> Are ending in vain.<br /> Brother, this is why<br /> Earth is suffering<br /> And, as you know,<br /> Its suffering will never come to an end.<br /> Before, only earth's heart<br /> Was frightened<br /> By brooding ignorance-night.<br /> Now, earth's entire body-life<br /> Is frightened to death<br /> By illumining-consciousness-light.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073298" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> Why is your Heaven<br /> So fond of singing the song<br /> Of indifference-sky?<br /> "Brother C,<br /> Why is your earth<br /> So fond of dancing the dance<br /> Of stupidity-sea?"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073299" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> I am sharing with the world<br /> Only my imagination-sound-talk with you.<br /> Will you permit me<br /> To share with the world<br /> Our reality-silence-conversation?<br /> "No, for our Father's sake, no!<br /> Don't be a fool.<br /> If you do that,<br /> Father's perfect and complete manifestation<br /> In and through your children<br /> Will suffer Eternity's endless delay."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073300" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> I am glad that your love<br /> Has not forgotten me.<br /> I am glad that your concern still<br /> Remembers me.</p>
<p>"Brother C,<br /> I am glad that you love my company so dearly,<br /> I am glad that you sincerely cared to know<br /> How miserably I suffered<br /> On earth."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073301" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> Look at the height<br /> Of my children's unpardonable<br /> stupidity.<br /> They are adoring me<br /> On your birthday.<br /> "Brother C,<br /> You know well when I<br /> Can and will really be born:<br /> That will be the day<br /> When earth receives<br /> Our Father's Light from you.<br /> And I am truly proud<br /> Of your children sweet and cute.<br /> They know<br /> Who we truly are:<br /> Father's one endless ascending Cry<br /> On earth;<br /> Father's one endless descending Smile<br /> In Heaven."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073302" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> My last question:<br /> I shall be extremely grateful<br /> To you<br /> And I shall be extremely proud<br /> Of you<br /> If you tell me<br /> When you are coming back<br /> To earth.<br /> "Brother C,<br /> Your Himalayan question arrow<br /> You have hurled at the wrong person.<br /> Only our Father can answer<br /> Your stupid-proud<br /> Query.<br /> By the way, even yesterday<br /> Father told me categorically<br /> That He will never grant me<br /> Even a short vacation<br /> To enjoy on earth.<br /> So you see, what can I do?<br /> Poor me, brother C."<br /> Poorer me, brother Jesus.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073303" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16.</h1>
  
 

<p>I really want us to exchange<br /> Our juicy stories of earth and Heaven<br /> Quite often.<br /> "Do you think that I do not want that?<br /> I want it far beyond the ken<br /> Of your imagination-flight.<br /> But what can I do?<br /> I need not tell you anything more.<br /> You know our old Father."<br /> I know, I know<br /> Our eternally wise Father.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073304" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> Will you do me a big favour?<br /> "Certainly I shall."<br /> Please tell our Father<br /> That of late I have been<br /> Thinking of Him constantly.<br /> "Brother C,<br /> I give you my word of honour,<br /> The moment I go back<br /> And sit at Father's Feet<br /> I shall offer Him<br /> Your message.<br /> Don't you worry.<br /> Brother C,<br /> It is getting late.<br /> I must not cause<br /> Any unnecessary worry<br /> For our poor old Father."<br /> Brother Jesus,<br /> I perfectly understand that.<br /> Go, go back to our lucky Father.<br /> Let me stay,<br /> Commissioned if not compelled,<br /> With our unlucky Mother.</p>

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> I am a Hindu.<br /> I know nothing about<br /> Your Judaism and Christianity.<br /> Please tell me the difference<br /> Between the two.<br /> "Brother C,<br /> Judaism knows how to strike;<br /> Christianity knows how to envelop."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073306" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> What is the difference<br /> Between<br /> The Old Testament<br /> And the New Testament?</p>
<p>"Brother C,<br /> The Old Testament saw;<br /> The New Testament knew."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1073307" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> Is it true<br /> That you used only one weapon,<br /> I mean, your compassion-weapon,<br /> While you were on earth?<br /> "Brother C,<br /> It is true.<br /> But I tell you,<br /> If I had lived on earth<br /> A few years more,<br /> Father would definitely<br /> Have asked me to use another weapon:<br /> His divine Justice-Weapon."</p>
  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">21.</h1>
  
 

<p>Brother Jesus,<br /> Tell me frankly,<br /> Do you care for Moses?<br /> "Yes, I do.<br /> How can I not care for the creator<br /> Of the Jewish people?<br /> How can I deny the great lawgiver?"<br /> Where is Moses now?<br /> What is Moses doing nowadays?<br /> "He is working very hard<br /> To discover a few new laws<br /> That will stand against<br /> Earth's atom bomb<br /> And hydrogen bomb."</p>

<p>We know that Peter denied the Christ. We also know that the Christ wanted nobody else save Peter to be head of His church.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Editor&#039;s preface to the first edition</h1>
  
 
<p>True Masters of all ages have respected one another's teachings and admired one another's spiritual achievements. Each subsequent Master offers a new impetus to earth-awakening, earth-transformation and earth-perfection, being constantly conscious of his source of Light and Life: the Absolute Supreme. Far from being inner rivals, they are loving and devoted brothers. In this small volume Sri Chinmoy reveals his intimate inner connection with his brother the Christ through poems, aphorisms and dramatic dialogues.</p>  </div>
