<p>Some dogs on our block are so bad. This morning when I was running at about 6:20, I saw a man walking his dog. The dog was barking. The owner was calling the dog Russell.</p>
<p>A delivery man wanted to put a newspaper in the mailbox of a particular house, but the dog was blocking his way. He was afraid of the dog. Then, when the dog passed by him, he put the newspaper inside the mailbox.</p>
