<p>I saw Malati, Jamuna and Kiran in a carriage. How could three persons sit in one carriage? The horse was still alive? When I sit all by myself, I find it so uncomfortable!</p>
<p>I saw them get in the carriage and I saw them get out again a few moments later. For such a short distance they took a horse and carriage!</p>
