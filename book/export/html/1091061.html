<p>Let me not speak ill of any man. If I speak ill of a man, I may not see him at all in this life for his forgiveness. But if I dare speak ill of God, God being everywhere, I shall be able to find Him for His forgiveness. In such a case, I may speak ill of God, but not of man. God will forgive me openly. Man will kill me secretly.</p>  </div>
