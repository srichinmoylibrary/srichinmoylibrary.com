<p>After I had run about two miles and was near my tennis court, I saw an old lady who had just mowed her lawn. Leaves and grass were lying on the sidewalk. When I was about to run by, she said to me, "Please run softly and gently. Don't make a mess!" When I heard this, I immediately jumped into the street. "Such a nice guy!" she said.</p>
