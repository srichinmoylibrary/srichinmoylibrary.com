<p>The first time I went to Berkeley, it was not at all a good experience. One person would ask me a question and six others would stand up to answer it. I could not answer a question before two or three others also started answering the question. Then, while I was speaking, people in the audience were whistling.</p>
<p>But they have made progress at Berkeley. This time when I came they were silent, and they were kind enough to clap after the meditation.</p>
