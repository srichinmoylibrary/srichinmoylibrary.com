<p>To his mother, Prabhavati Devi, Subhas confided his innermost thoughts, feelings and dreams in countless letters. It was she who encouraged and nurtured his Godward journey, even when he was thousands of miles away in England.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mother, it is most painful and disheartening to think that we hardly ever call out to Him-who is doing so much for us, who is always our friend, in prosperity or adversity...who lives always in our heart and is so close to us and who belongs to us. We weep over unimportant worldly things but have not a tear to spare for Him...."</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
