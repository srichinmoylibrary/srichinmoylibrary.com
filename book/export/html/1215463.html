    <title>Question: When one has a feeling of being completely free in one’s body and one’s mind and, at the same time, one is completely clear — much clearer than what we are seeing and hearing tonight — and, at the same time, completely still, what kind of an experience is this?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a very high experience. About this kind of experience we say, “He moves, He moves not”. Look at the sea. If you dive deep within, it is calm and quiet. But on the surface you will see such huge waves all the time restless and dancing. The sea has two aspects. On the surface it is constant movement and at the bottom it is silence. Similarly, when you become really advanced and realise God, inside you there will be total, complete tranquility even while you are involved in multifarious outer activities. Your inner poise is not disturbed by outer activities.</p>  </div>
