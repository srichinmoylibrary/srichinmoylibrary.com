<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many kinds of consciousness in the ordinary human being but there are two main types of consciousness that regulate a human being. If he is in the desire-world, then earth-bound consciousness dominates him, and if he is in the Heaven-free world, then the divine Consciousness inspires him, energises him and immortalises him.</p>
<p>To what extent can consciousness be controlled? It entirely depends on the seekerâ€™s inner achievement; how much Peace, Light and Bliss he has already established in his life of aspiration and dedication.</p>  </div>
