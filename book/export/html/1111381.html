<p>The day before yesterday, after running about five miles, I was tired and hungry. So I went into a cafeteria for a grilled cheese sandwich. The grilled cheese sandwich was cut into halves, and there was a toothpick in each side. I was reading the Olympic athletes' times in the newspaper, and I didn't see the toothpicks. One toothpick got stuck in the roof of my mouth. How I suffered! The owner of the store, a middle-aged lady, got frightened when she saw my face. I didn't know what had happened. If this experience had lasted a few minutes more, I would have thought about joining my Father in Heaven!</p>
