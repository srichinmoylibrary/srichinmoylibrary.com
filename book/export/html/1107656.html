<p>Silence within, sound without. Silence-Eternity within, Sound-Infinity without. Silence-Eternity-Dream within, Sound-Infinity-Reality without.</p>
<p>Silence is God the Creator. Sound is God the Creation. Silence is the progress-delight of God the Creator. Sound is the success-height of God the Creation.</p>
<p>Silence is never, never afraid of sound, but sound is always afraid of Eternity’s and Immortality’s vastness-silence.</p>
<p>My silence-heart-life is a non-stop aspiration-flight to my Transcendental Goal—the Goal of the ever-transcending Beyond. My sound-mind-life quite often carries me into a tenebrous indolence-coma.</p>
<p>With my silence-heart, I always claim God as my own, very own. With my sound-mind, at times I praise God and at times I blame God, depending on my success-smiles and failure-cries.</p>
<p>When my sound-life lives in the shackles of bondage, when I live only in my buried hopes, at that time my silence-heart comes to the fore and inspires me with new hope, new inspiration, new aspiration and new dedication to go and visit my Lord’s Forgiveness-Heart, Compassion-Eye and Protection-Feet.</p>
<p>My silence-soul is the only teacher that teaches me how to speak to God and how to listen to God devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally.</p>

<p>Man’s eternal question: “Where is God?”<br /> God’s eternal question: “How to please man?”<br /> Silence has the answer to these questions.<br /> Indeed, silence is the answer.<br /> Silence, silence!</p>
