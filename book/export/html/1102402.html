<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there is definitely an inner connection between the employees of the United Nations and the soul of the United Nations. Only this connection may take a little time to develop. When a person first starts working at the United Nations, he will not necessarily have an inner connection with the soul of the United Nations. No, the person has to work here for some time and has to consciously grow into the vision of the United Nations. Then only will he be able to develop an inner connection — which is at once illumining and satisfying — with the soul of the United Nations.</p>
<p>The soul of the United Nations in silence says to the souls of those who work here: "I shall lead you to the goal of universal oneness." The souls of the employees say to the soul of the United Nations: "We shall unreservedly become your choice instruments so that God's Hope for a new world, a new creation and a new perfection in man need not and will not remain a far cry."</p>  </div>
