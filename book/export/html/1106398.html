<p>Today my mind was not on the lifting. I had lots of problems. Only for the sake of routine I did everything, but today’s performance was very bad. When it came to lifting 160 pounds with both arms on Sumadhur and Bishwas’ machine, after the first one I thought I would do better. Alas, the next three were even worse.</p>
