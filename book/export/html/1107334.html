    <title>&lt;em&gt;Mr. Schonfeld:&lt;/em&gt; You talk of the Supreme, you talk of God. Is it a concept that other religions also have in their use of the word God? Jews, Christians and Moslems, for example? Or is it an entirely different concept that you have of the Supreme Power?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it is absolutely the same. Each religion has a God of its own, but there is only one God. Our religion will call Him Paramatman, your religion will call Him God and another religion will call Him Allah. But there is only one God, one Supreme Being. He is known by different names and forms, but my God and your God will always remain the same. There is only one God.</p>  </div>
