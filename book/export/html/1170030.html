<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A teacher who is spiritually unawakened can never learn to teach with his heart. Before he can teach with his heart, he must first teach his mind. He must teach his mind how to become receptive, how to unlearn the teachings that its ignorance-teacher has taught it over the years. Unfortunately, the mind-student is not obedient, whereas the heart-student is not only obedient but also self-giving.</p>  </div>
