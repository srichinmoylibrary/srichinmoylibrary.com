<p>Yesterday afternoon I went for another walk. I saw an elderly lady. She looked very, very nice and dignified. She said to me, “Good afternoon, Sir!”</p>
<p>Poor me, nothing came out of my mouth because I was in my high meditation. I tried to say, “Good afternoon,” but nothing came out. I only smiled. Luckily, my smile saves me.</p>
