<p>Two grandmothers met to chat together. One of them said, "Please, please, I have to tell you something very significant about my granddaughter. It is so cute, so cute."</p>
<p>The other grandmother said, "All right, what is it? If you want to tell me about your granddaughter — how beautiful and how good she is, and how she has done something very great and significant — I shall listen to you without fail. But there is one condition: you have to listen to all my stories about my twenty grandchildren."</p>
<p>The first grandmother immediately said, "In that case, I have changed my mind. I do not want to tell you about my granddaughter. Let us change the topic!"</p>  </div>
