<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you sleep with your hands on your chest, you will see all kinds of frogs, squirrels and cats in your dreams. When you sleep, sleep either on one side or on your back, but try not to have any pressure on your chest. Otherwise, you may enter into a solid wall, and it is a bad, bad wall. That is the best way. I see occultly that there are some disciples who keep their hands on their chests quite often. This is not at all good. Some disciples sleep for many hours, but they don't sleep well. They should meditate for a few minutes before they go to sleep.</p>  </div>
