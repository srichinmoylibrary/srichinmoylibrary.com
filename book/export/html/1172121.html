<p>If you feel that I am at least God's conscious representative, and if for twenty-four hours a day you can feel that I care for you, then you can easily expedite God's choice Hour. Most of you here have one common disease. We have to open up a hospital for all the patients suffering from this one disease. In our hospital, everybody is suffering from one disease: they feel that I don't care for them. But if you can feel that I <em>do</em> care for you as an individual, as a seeker and as a child of my soul, then immediately you can expedite God's Hour.</p>
<p>How I care for you, you will never know. Right now if I smile at you, then you feel that I care for you. But if you can feel my presence inside your heart, then always you will feel that I care for you. If you can consciously feel my presence, then gradually your joy will increase. When you cherish depression, doubt and all that, at that time you will give me a zero. Try to go deep within. If you can give me even one out of one hundred for my care for you, then I will be very grateful. When you can give me seventy, I tell you, at that time you are bound to feel that you are expediting God's Hour. When you can give me higher marks, then you are making the fastest progress. The easiest way to expedite God's Hour is to feel constantly that I care for you in my inner life and my outer life.</p>
<p>In the human way, you think that perhaps I need something from you, some favour, and that is why I care for you. But repeatedly I have told you that nobody is indispensable. Only feel that whoever is in a position to serve our mission in a divine way is getting the greatest opportunity. I am responsible to you, to your soul, to the Supreme. It is not your eagerness that will expedite God's Hour and make you run the fastest: It is <em>my</em> eagerness, <em>my</em> necessity. It is my constant inner necessity to take each individual the fastest towards the Goal. If you feel that it is your necessity and not my necessity, then you are mistaken. I have realised God; it is true. But until I make you realise God, I have not manifested Divinity in the earth-consciousness and my game is incomplete.</p>  </div>
