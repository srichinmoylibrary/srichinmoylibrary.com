<p>Then the man said, "You should sue the airline. You are paying for ambassador class, but the seats are so narrow! They are gypping you."</p>
<p>I also felt that the seats were unbearably narrow, but I didn't want to make a fuss. I just thought that I would cut jokes with Garima afterwards, saying that this was her ambassador class — extra cost, but no extra room! Then I said to myself, "Perhaps I should sue Snigdha; she works for that airline."</p>
<p>When my friend started complaining, a stewardess came and said I would get a full refund. Some of the planes have the new ambassador-class seats, but this particular plane had not yet been remodelled.</p>
