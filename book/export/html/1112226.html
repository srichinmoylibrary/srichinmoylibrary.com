<p>When I came to my 1200-metre mark, right near Main Street, one American man was jogging. He was behind me, but he passed me. As he went by, at least six or seven times he said, "Good morning, Sri, Sri, Sri." Then I said "Good morning" several times. At Main Street, he made a left turn and I kept going straight.</p>
