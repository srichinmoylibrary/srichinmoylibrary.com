<p>There is only one Guru, and His name is the Supreme. The human Guru is the door; the divine Guru is the Throne. You can come right up to the door, but unless and until you sit on the Throne, you won't be satisfied. If you knock at the door, the divine Guru, who is the Supreme, will come and open the door and take you to His Throne. But first you have to knock at the door. If you don't knock at the door, then this divine Guru will not hear. It is through the human Guru that you can go to the divine Guru.</p>
<p>The disciple who feels that the Guru is going to do everything for him, the disciple who feels that the Guru loves him more than the disciple loves himself and has more concern for him than the disciple has for himself — that disciple is really wise. This kind of disciple will realise God much sooner than the disciple who thinks that his relationship with the Guru is one of give-and-take. Some disciples think that if they give the Guru five dollars, then the Guru will give them at least five dollars in return, if they give a little aspiration, then the Master will give them a little realisation — that it is always give-and-take. But the real disciple feels that whether he gives anything or not, the Master will give him everything. The disciple who has this feeling will be the dearest inside the Master's heart.</p>  </div>
