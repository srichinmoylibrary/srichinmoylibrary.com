    <title>Question: Guru, you just said that when we feel we have done something wrong and we feel miserable about it, we are to identify with you. Should we feel that you are miserable also?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, you have to know that I also feel miserable. It is not that I will say, “You deserve it.” I will not say that. I will only sympathise with you, and my sympathy will have the utmost compassion. Then I will give you the necessary light not to do it again. Inner instruction, inner instruction: there is not a single disciple who can say that I do not give inner instruction.</p>  </div>
