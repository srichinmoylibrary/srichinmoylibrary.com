<p>Fulfilling the vision of the sages,<br /> India, our Mother India,<br /> With smiling face opens today<br /> The door of Her Eastern Light.</p>
<p>Our Mother's body is not amputated.<br /> She shines with divine beauty —<br /> Though even now Her glow and grace<br /> Are veiled by the clouds.</p>
<p>It is the festival of awakening of our Mother;<br /> It is the dawn of a golden new era;<br /> Our Mother is bringing for us Her casket<br /> Filled with Her immortal gifts.</p>
<p>We shall bestow to the comity of nations, to the world at large<br /> The sweet nectar of the Supermind.<br /> We shall satisfy by the favour of our Mother<br /> The hunger of all the souls.</p>
<p>The vision of Jesus Christ — the Kingdom of Heaven —<br /> In order to materialise,<br /> Narayan is revealed today in man<br /> On this earth of dust.</p>
<p>Victory of the Creator, victory of Bharatvarsha,<br /> Victory of the dwellers of the universe<br /> Is indicated today, and of the Golden Age<br /> Today forms the dawn.</p>
