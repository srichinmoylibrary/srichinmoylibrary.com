<p>This morning I walked all the way to my garage, in spite of my leg pain, to bring the car, only to find that I had forgotten to bring the garage opener. I had my license, but the opener was missing. So I came back to my house.</p>
<p>The second time I went there, I found that I had forgotten the keys to my car. So I had to come all the way back home again.</p>
<p>Finally, the third time I went to the garage, everything was in order and I was able to bring the car. This all happened because I had a high fever.</p>
