    <title>Question: The style and personality of the Secretary-General influences numerous individuals and national governments and to a degree determines the performance of the entire U.N. Don&#039;t you think, then, it is essential to select a Secretary-General who will not allow possible wrong influences or powers to guide his actions?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We should always try to be true servers and warriors of truth, for truth is life in the purest sense of the term. Therefore, our supreme choice and our only choice has to be an all-loving, all-caring, all-serving and all-fulfilling Secretary-General, whose love-power will transform the dominion-power or the influence-power, and not the other way around. Love inspires us to do the right thing in life. Power quite often, if not always, influences us or, rather, not always but quite often instigates us to do the wrong thing. Therefore, a Secretary-General who is higher than the highest in height is also expected to be wider than the widest in every sphere of his life.</p>  </div>
