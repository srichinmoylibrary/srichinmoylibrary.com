<p>In my hotel in Zurich, there was a group of Japanese making a lot of noise in the room next to me. They had left their door open. At first I thought they were fighting. But no, they were just talking very loudly. Writers long ago said that the Japanese could control their emotions. But when they talk, they scream.</p>
<p>Three times I went out of my room to see what the commotion was all about. But I just smiled at them. They were so young. I thought somebody would come and scold them, but nobody did.</p>
<p>Then at five o'clock I saw them in the elevator. They were leaving the hotel. Even in the elevator they couldn't stop talking!</p>
