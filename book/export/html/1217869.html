<p>Surrender knows that there is a guiding Hand and feels that this guiding Hand is ever present. This Hand may strike or bless the aspirant. The surrendered aspirant has discovered the truth that whatever comes from the Supreme is always fruitful of Good and Light.</p>
<p>In life, everything may fail us, but not surrender. Surrender has a free access to God's omnipotence. Hence the path of surrender is the perfect perfection of protection.</p>
<p>Surrender has the strength to meet the Absolute and stay and play with Him eternally. God may at times play hide-and-seek with manâ€™s divine qualities, but never with His devotee's genuine surrender.</p>
<p>Inner surrender transforms life into an infinite progress. It gives life the soulful assurance that life lives in God and God alone.</p>
<p>Surrender is the soul of the devotee's body. Surrender is the unparalleled fulfilment of the devotee's life. Surrender takes him to the Source. When he is in the Source, he becomes the Highest and reveals the Deepest.</p>
<p>Self-consciousness hates surrender. Surrender illumines self-consciousness. Self-consciousness is self-will. Self-will is self-love. Surrender is God-Will. God-Will is God-Love.</p>
<p>Surrender is the wisdom that sees and becomes the Truth. Surrender wishes nothing other than God. Surrender gets pure God. Nothing is as practical as surrender, for it knows the supreme secret that to offer itself integrally to God is to possess God absolutely. Surrender is the purest devotion that sees through the eye of intuition. Surrender is freedom, perpetual freedom, for it always stays with God, in God and for God.</p>
<p>The eye of surrender does not see the face of the Devil. It always sees the Face of God's Compassion, Protection and Divinity. The life of surrender divinely rings true. It is always filled with abiding inspiration, revealing aspiration and transcending realisation.</p>
<p>Surrender clings to God with all the might of the soul.<br />Surrender clings to God with all the love of the heart.<br />Surrender clings to God with all the will of the mind.<br />Surrender clings to God with all the dynamic energy of the vital.<br />Surrender clings to God with all the snow-white emotions of the body.</p>  </div>
