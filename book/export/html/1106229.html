<p>This morning I tried to go sleep at around 2:00, but I was restless, so I got up. While getting up I bumped into the stronger-than-the-strongest metal bar near the scale in my bedroom. By then it was already 2:30. Sound sleep I didn’t get yesterday even for 10 or 11 minutes. Usually, when I get up I take a 10-minute shower, but this time I took a 20-minute shower to make sure I didn’t fall asleep while exercising.</p>
<p>I did each exercise so many times! First I lifted 10 pounds 50 times, then I lifted 20, 30 and 40 pounds. From 40 pounds I jumped up to 2,000.</p>
