    <title>Question: I know that you are uncomfortable associating yourself with big name sponsors, but if you wanted to bring more glamour to the ultramarathon, would you ever consider working with big sponsors in the future?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In my case, I do not bring the future into the immediacy of today. What is going to happen in the next second of your life, you do not know and I do not know. Today's pressure is enough for me. I am overburdened with today's problems, the problems of here and now. Why do I have to bring tomorrow's elephant and place it on my shoulders? Now I am already carrying an elephant. Today itself is a big problem. So why do I have to anticipate what is going to happen and what is not going to happen? Let tomorrow come. I will be fully prepared. Whatever inspiration and aspiration I have is carrying me through today. Tomorrow, the aspiration that will be needed, God will supply.</p>
<p>What is going to happen tomorrow, I do not know. It will be all mental speculation, that has no value. So let tomorrow dawn. Then, when something happens, God will give me the inspiration to deal with it. To think of the future is not advisable. For myself, I find that it is not wise. What is going to happen tomorrow I do not know. I do not even know what is going to happen the next minute in my life. So this very moment I will try to use judiciously.</p>  </div>
