<p>According to a certain politician:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Gandhi-ji was the dream, Jawaharlal the desire and Netaji Subhas the deed."</p>

<p>Subhas Chandra's wisdom-flooded mind said to them, "If I declare 'Quit India,' only a few million may respond, whereas if Mahatma, the Father of the Nation, emphatically makes the same statement, the entire nation will jump, run and fly to please him in no time. Therefore, by no manner of means am I the right person. Our Mahatma, our Himalayan Father of the Nation, is the only one-"</p>  </div>
