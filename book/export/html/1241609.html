<p>Sona’s soul has also come to me many, many times. But on the physical plane, do either of the dog's listen to me? In India, my dogs were so good, even though they got very little attention from us. As soon as you called them, they would come. But here, you can call Sona’s name again and again, and still he does not come!</p>
