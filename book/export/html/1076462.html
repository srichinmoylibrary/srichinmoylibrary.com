<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, the soul can contact the Master if the soul is a little developed. But sometimes the physical mind does not believe or does not receive the soulâ€™s message. The physical mind doubts the very existence of the soul; it suspects everything, sometimes even its own reality. This physical mind unfortunately does not have a free access to the soul so it does not know what the soul is doing. But if the soul wants to convince the physical mind, it can elevate even the physical mind with divine light. Once this light is brought down into the physical mind in abundant measure, the mind will convince the entire being that the soul has contacted the Master.</p>  </div>
