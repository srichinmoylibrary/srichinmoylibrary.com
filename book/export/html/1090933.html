    <title>Question: Sometimes during my morning meditation I fall into a doze — not a sound sleep, but just a doze. Is this a bad thing?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, it is not a good thing. It is not sleep; but you are not fully awakened either. When you meditate, you have to be absolutely dynamic. Do not allow sleepiness to enter into you. Feel that you are entering into the battlefield where you have to fight against ignorance, doubt, imperfection and death.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many disciples do not get enough inspiration to energise them for meditation. Some days you get inspiration all at once; other days you don't get any inspiration at all. If the fire is already burning inside, you don't have to do anything. But when there is no fire, what do you do? The best thing is to breathe in deeply a few times before you meditate and make your whole body energetic. Your dynamic energy will help you enter into meditation. Or you can jog a little. If possible, take a small quantity of hot juice or hot milk before you enter your meditation. Your whole system will be attuned with the divine energy, and this divine energy will take you to the proper place of meditation in your inner consciousness.</p>  </div>
