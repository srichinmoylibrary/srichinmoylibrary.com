<p>The day before yesterday I was at the 800 metre point on the 1,000-mile course, near the circle, walking. It was in the morning. All of a sudden Nayak's soul appeared for blessings. I thought, "Nayak didn't inform me he was coming to New York. Usually he informs me." But it was not actually Nayak, but only his soul, which appeared so vividly.</p>
<p>Then a few hours later I saw Nayak himself standing at the same spot, near the circle. He had come to New York quite suddenly on business.</p>
