<p>Without humour we cannot exist on earth. Humour really is the salt of life. There is nobody who has not enjoyed humour at least once in his life. Now, what is God’s sense of humour like? God will vary His approach to humour according to the individual. If you enjoy humour, then God is bound to join you. But if you are a dry, intellectual person with an absolutely serious nature, then God will not cut jokes with you. Perhaps you have read my book <em>My Lord’s Secrets Revealed</em>. Those conversations and those kinds of jokes with the Supreme are from actual incidents. So you can see that I enjoy jokes and God does also. If you don’t enjoy that kind of humour, then God will not bother you in that way. I always say that God is a perfect gentleman. A gentleman is not going to disturb you; but if you enjoy something, then he will join you. So God enjoys humour, provided the person He is dealing with enjoys humour.</p>  </div>
