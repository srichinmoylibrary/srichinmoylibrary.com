<p>God wants us to hoist<br /> Our goodness-heart<br /> And not<br /> Our greatness-mind.</p>

<p>"Brother, you are proving that politicians can use their heart, not just the mind. In your life, talking has been replaced by practising â€” practising the feeling of oneness. At every moment you are showing your oneness. Your heart is the bridge between the poor and the rich, between the weak and the strong, and between the smallest countries and the largest countries. You were born in the Soviet Union, but now the whole world claims you with utmost love, joy, pride and gratitude."</p>
