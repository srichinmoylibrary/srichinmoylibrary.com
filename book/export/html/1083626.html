  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Does God like girls or boys better?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em>: Whoever is the most obedient. If at this moment the girl is most obedient to God, God likes the girl. If the girl obeys the Father God, then naturally God likes the daughter. But if both son and daughter are equally obedient to God, then God cannot make any discrimination; He loves them equally. We have to know who listens to the Father more, the daughter or the son. So the individual son or daughter must get his or her answer from God according to his or her obedience. Otherwise, God is very impartial. He has to be impartial. He has created both son and daughter. If He takes one side then He becomes partial. If the boys feel the daughters are closer to me, rest assured that the girls listen to me more than the boys. If the girls feel that boys are closer to me, they have to feel that the boys are more obedient.</p>
<p>I am your spiritual Father; God is our Infinite and Eternal Father. If you listen to me, whether you are a boy or a girl, you become closer to me. If you don't listen to me, whether you are a boy or a girl is immaterial to me. Still the game is played. He or she who listens is God's favourite.</p>  </div>
