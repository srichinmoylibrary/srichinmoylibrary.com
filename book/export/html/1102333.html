<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no fixed date. Only when the hour has struck for a particular individual will that individual cry for world-oneness, world-progress and world-perfection. An individual or a nation has to become consciously aware of what it is necessary to do. It is only through conscious awareness that the right things can take place at the right moment in the right way. At that time, all the negative forces can be conquered and all the world's problems can be solved.</p>
