<p>Soon I will lift an elephant, the way I have lifted cars. Now, if my disciples make it so difficult, if they use an elephant that weighs too much, then I will ask them to try to lift it instead of me. If I fail, then I will say, “All right, now you try.”</p>
<p>Once in India there was a very great Bengali boxer. They tied a rope around him, like the ones used in tug-of-war, full of grease. He had escaped from the rope so many times. But this time, when he tried, he couldn’t do it. One thousand people were watching. Some people showed sympathy; some were laughing.</p>
<p>Then he started screaming at his student, saying that he had to do it, since he was to one who had asked him to come and perform. So the student could not do it.</p>
