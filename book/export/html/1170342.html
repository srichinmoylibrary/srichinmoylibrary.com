<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are Gurus who are householders and, at the same time, they are realised souls. Whose house are they inhabiting? It is Godâ€™s House. And who are their children and family? They are the children that God has chosen for them. The Guru is like a tree, and a tree without branches is nothing.</p>  </div>
