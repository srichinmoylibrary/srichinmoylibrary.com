<p>Once one of the generals of Emperor Aurangazeb fell sick. For months he suffered, and then his case started getting worse and worse. Finally, the Emperor called in a Greek doctor to help the patient. The doctor gave the general some medicine and told him that he should not eat grapes. He said grapes were not good for him and were creating problems. The general kept arguing with the doctor. He could not understand how not eating grapes would help his condition. Since he was very, very fond of grapes and they were one of his favourite foods, he did not want to give them up. But the doctor told him, "I am sorry. You must not eat any more grapes."</p>
<p>The Emperor believed in the doctor. Again, he was very fond of the general and did not want to see his dear friend suffer unnecessarily. So he made a bargain with the general. He said, "You like grapes and I also like grapes. But if you promise not to eat grapes, I also will not eat them. Then, when you are cured, at that time you, Allah and I will all eat grapes together. And if anything ever happens to you, if you do not survive your illness, then I will never eat grapes again."</p>
<p>The general was deeply moved, and he promised not to eat grapes until he was cured.</p>  </div>
