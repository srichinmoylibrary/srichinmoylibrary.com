<p>I have worshipped God with love.<br /> His Delight is my reward.</p>
<p>I have worshipped God with fear.<br /> His sorrow is my result.</p>
<p>I have worshipped God to see Him.<br /> He comes, but I see Him not.</p>
<p>I have worshipped God.<br /> I know not why.<br /> He is now won â€”<br /> My self-revealing Sun.</p>
