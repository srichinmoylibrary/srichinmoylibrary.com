    <title>Question: How can we give up the desire for a strong meditation so that the soul-awareness with its most subtle vibration gets a chance to come forward more fully?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know that if an aspirant is of a very high standard, he need not start meditating with the idea of achieving some specific result. If he wants to have some result immediately after his meditation, then he tries only to have a very strong or powerful meditation. But a seeker should not aspire for a desired result from a powerful meditation. When a real aspirant starts meditating, he will not cry for any result, he will only cry for his self-offering during his highest meditation. If he cries for the result, then he is only imagining something mentally, thinking of some delicious cake, in this case Light or another quality, according to his sweet will or fancy.</p>  </div>
