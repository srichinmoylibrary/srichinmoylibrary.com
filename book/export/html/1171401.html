<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. If somebody has been exercising God's Patience for a long time, and then if that person has a good heart, he will say, "God is so kind to me. He is so affectionate, so compassionate. How is it that I am torturing Him?" Many naughty children become good when they see that their mother is crying, crying, crying because they are misbehaving. They say, "How long can we torture our mother? She is all love for us, all compassion for us!" Then they turn over a new leaf. At that time the mother's patience is successful in awakening the good qualities of her children.</p>  </div>
