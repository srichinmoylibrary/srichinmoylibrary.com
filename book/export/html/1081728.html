<p>Learn to work with those<br /> Beside you.<br /> They are, after all,<br /> Not so bad.<br /> Your body may sleep too much,<br /> But it tries<br /> To wake up.<br /> Your vital may fight too much,<br /> But it does quite often appreciate<br /> A life of peace.<br /> Your mind may doubt too much,<br /> But it does secretly admire<br /> A life of faith.<br /> Therefore,<br /> Learn to work with those<br /> Beside you.<br /> As I told you,<br /> After all, they are not so bad.</p>
