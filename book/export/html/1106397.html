<p>Today I was unable to lift 110 pounds with both arms together. Three times I tried and three times I failed. I was shocked when I failed. I said, “How can I lose my strength overnight?” Later I found out that the boys had put an extra one-inch board on the floor. Somebody advised them. So I was unable to get the correct position.</p>
