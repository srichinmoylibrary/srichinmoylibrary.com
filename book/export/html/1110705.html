<p>Human life is full of complexity. But when we have purity, we simplify our life. When our life is simplified, God multiplies His own Divinity — His Eternity, Infinity and Immortality — inside us. Purity is of supreme importance, not only in our heart, but also in our mind, vital and body. With purity, we get the assurance from God that we shall succeed in the battlefield of life.</p>  </div>
