<p>The other day, I saw Anupadi running. She was dressed in all her winter clothes, trying to lose weight to pass the weigh-in. Had she been a better runner, I would have invited her to run with my road crew and me. But we were planning to run quite fast. If I had been running by myself, with just one driver, she could have trained with us.</p>
