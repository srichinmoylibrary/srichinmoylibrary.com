<p>Before the start of the Jersey Shore Marathon, Dave Peabody, who had run in our twenty-four-hour race, came up to me. I asked him, "Your wife is allowing you to run? She doesn't mind this time?"</p>
<p>He answered, "Oh no, she is very happy. She is here supporting me and helping me. Today she is smiling."</p>
<p>Quite often his wife used to object when he ran races. When he ran our twenty-four-hour race, he didn't tell his wife beforehand that he was going to do it. He just left her a note. But then she came to the race and watched him.</p>
