<p>I ran about nine miles of the Boston Marathon. While I was running, I saw three Japanese women runners. The two younger ones were running with the older one for a mile or so. When they went ahead of her I said, "I am the right person to run with the older lady, since her stride is shorter than the shortest."</p>
<p>Our competition was going on very nicely. After two miles I left the course and about four or five minutes later I came back. I didn't see the older Japanese lady running. I knew she had gone quite far ahead. I ran and ran very fast and finally I saw her again and started running with her. From time to time she gave me a good smile. She was very old and very short. She was the right person for me to run with! She was drinking after practically every mile, but I didn't drink at all.</p>
