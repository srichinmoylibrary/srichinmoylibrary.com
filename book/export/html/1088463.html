<p>Lakshmana has lighted a blazing fire in the presence of a large audience.</p>
<p><em>Sita:</em> O Fire God, my husband Rama has every right to test me, and I have every right to prove to him that I was pure, I am pure and I shall forever remain pure. If I fail in this test, I shall go to my Divine Rama in Heaven. If I pass, I shall remain with my human Rama here on earth.</p>
<p><em>Sita walks slowly, steadily through the leaping flames and comes back to Rama. The all-consuming fire could do nothing to her. Her whole face is aglow. Rama receives Sita with all his love.</em></p>
<p><em>Rama:</em> My Sita, the fire ordeal is over. The world now knows that you are Purity itself.</p>
