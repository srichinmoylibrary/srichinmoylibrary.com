<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are absolutely correct in saying that the believers of God must grow in God's Grace daily. A true believer of God feels that his very existence on earth, his inner and outer achievements and fulfilments are entirely due to God's Grace; also he is truly fortunate to see that his so-called personal efforts too, are an act of God's Grace. At every moment he feels that without God's Grace he is nothing and with God's Grace, he is everything.</p>  </div>
