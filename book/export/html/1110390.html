<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to have peace of mind or abiding purity, it is better to repeat the name very slowly and soulfully. But to chase away impure, undivine thoughts, it is best to repeat the name very fast. To purify your mind quickly and temporarily, do japa as quickly as possible.</p>  </div>
