<p><em>(Subramanya Bharati, the greatest poet of Tamil Nad, visibly excited sweeps into Aurobindo's room.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Why so excited?</p>
<p>BHARATI: There is a grave reason for it. The British Government have conspired with the French Administration to have us, the political refugees, moved out of Pondicherry.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Well?</p>
<p>BHARATI: We must escape. Immediately or as soon as possible.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Where?</p>
<p>BHARATI: To any of the three places â€” Jibuti, Indo-China or Tripoli.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: "Mr. Bharati, I am not going to budge an inch from Pondicherry. I know nothing will happen to me. As for yourself you can do what you like."</p>
<p>BHARATI: Your stand bewilders me. No, it inspires me. I will follow you, irrespective of what others may do.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Rest assured, nothing will happen to us.</p>
<p>BHARATI: I truly feel that not only Pondicherry is hallowed by the touch of your feet, but the whole of South India. No mere sentiment, this.</p>  </div>
