<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I had a teacher in those days. Sri Aurobindo was my teacher. I was at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram for twenty years. But then, when I became fully aware of my inner realities and existence, the Supreme became my Guru. At first, Sri Aurobindo was in the physical body, then he left the body in 1950. But once I got my inner illumination, then I found that the Absolute Supreme is the only Guru â€” your Guru, my Guru, everybody's Guru. Only the Lord Supreme is the Guru of the entire world.</p>  </div>
