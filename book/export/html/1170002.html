<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on the individual. It is true that most human beings must have a formal education. Otherwise, they will not be of much use to society. If you don't get a formal education, you will act not only like a fool but also like an animal.</p>
<p>But again, one does not have to go to school in order to get formal education. India's Rabindranath Tagore and George Bernard Shaw of the West — to name just two — are among those who did not go to so-called high schools and colleges to get a formal education. But they did get education, a broad formal education. For formal education does not mean schooling. Formal education means learning the knowledge that is necessary in order to conquer the world. In order to have a strong footing in the world, it is quite necessary for a human being to have formal education.</p>  </div>
