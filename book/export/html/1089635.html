<p>A teacher asked his student, "Can you show me someone who is both 'bereaved' and 'relieved'? I am sure you know the meaning of these two words. If somebody dies, you are bereaved. And if you have some pain, when the pain goes away, you are relieved."</p>
<p>The clever student said, "Your question is so easy. I know a certain widow. Let me bring her here. Because her husband has passed away, she is bereaved. Again, since she had no love for her husband, she is greatly relieved!"</p>  </div>
