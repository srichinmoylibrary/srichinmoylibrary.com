<p>Death, do you speak to God?<br /> "Yes, I do."<br /> How often do you speak to God?<br /> "I speak to God quite often<br />      And<br /> Also quite a lot."</p>
<p>Death, what do you talk about?<br /> "We talk about various things,<br /> But mostly we talk about<br /> Man's helplessness and man's cleverness.<br /> God thinks all human beings are helpless<br />     And <br /> I think all human beings are clever.<br /> God has decided to make them all<br /> Secure and powerful.<br /> I have decided to make them all<br /> Wise and self-giving."</p>
