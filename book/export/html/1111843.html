<p>This year the water stations in the New York Marathon were peculiar. They didn't put them at every mile.</p>
<p>During the marathon people are always very nice. The spectators always give out oranges, ice and donuts. At one point this time it seemed that people were giving out tissues. At first I couldn't understand why everybody was grabbing the tissues. Then I saw what they were. They were sticks of gum.</p>
