<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to feel only the love that expands, the love that fulfils and the love that does not allow the negative forces to come into the picture. This love comes only from the soul. "Soul" means the effulgence of light. A seeker must consciously feel the presence of the soul. Right now a beginning seeker may not see the soul. But a seeker is bound to see the soul at some point in his journey. At the very beginning he cannot see the soul, but he can feel the presence of something or someone inside his heart. The very presence that he feels is the presence of the soul. Now you may say, "How do I know that it is the presence of the soul and not of an undivine force?" But I wish to say that inside the very depth of your heart, only something divine can exist, something illumining, something fulfilling, something immortal. That place is meant only for the soul to abide and not for anybody else.</p>
<p>If you have faith in me, or if you have faith in some other spiritual Master, then you will believe that it is the soul that resides in the heart and that the light of the soul, which is divine love, will always conquer all kinds of undivine, unaspiring negative forces.</p>  </div>
