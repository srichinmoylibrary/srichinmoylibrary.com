<p>On Kiran's birthday (Mamaji's daughter), the Mother gave a most special blessing to Narottam's family.</p>
<p>Amrita-da held a bunch of ripe bananas in his hand and gave one to Kalipada-da and one to me. Then he said: "In Sri Ramachandra's time there was only one Hanuman. In my time I clearly see that there are two Hanumans."</p>  </div>
