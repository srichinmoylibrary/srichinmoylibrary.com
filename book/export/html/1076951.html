<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No Today's imperfect and unfulfilled man is tomorrow's perfect and fulfilled God. God and Man are eternally one. God needs man to manifest Himself; man needs God to realise his true Self.</p>
<p>You have a soul, I have a soul, the Christ had a soul. The soul is consciously one with God. On the strength of his highest realisation, the Christ said: "I and my Father are one." How can anyone dare to say differently? In India we say "Tat twam asi:" "That thou art" and "Soham Brahman." "I am the Brahman."</p>
<p>There is no yawning gulf between man and God. Through his aspiration and meditation, Man can become conscious of his oneness with God.</p>  </div>
