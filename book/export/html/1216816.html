<p>The manager of the Marine Midland Bank in Jamaica is begging me for a painting. He wants to hang it in his home. For him to ask for a painting is really something!</p>
<p>He told Ashrita that even if I don't give him one, he still sends me all his love.</p>
<p>His daughter is taking a course from one of the disciples.</p>
<p>â€” 19 February 1983</p>  </div>
