<blockquote>
<p>"Man! Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and a tear."</p>
<p>â€” Byron</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each man is a miracle. Each individual is an epic. As ill-luck would have it, we have neither time nor curiosity to see the miracle or go through the epic. We know man is not what he seems. He is something more than his present appearance and achievements. We may say that man is that very thing which must be surpassed.</p>  </div>
