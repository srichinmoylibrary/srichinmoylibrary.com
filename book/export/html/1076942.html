<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To start with, what you need is inspiration. This inspiration you can get by reading sacred, spiritual books, preferably written by real spiritual Masters. Then you must try to live the wisdom of the books. From books you can get inspiration; then when inspiration has played its role, you must enter into the world of aspiration. This aspiration can be expressed through concentration, meditation, and contemplation. Once you are consciously aspiring, if you have a friend who is a very advanced seeker, he may be able to give you some help. And if you are absolutely sincere in your life of aspiration, then you will come into contact with a real spiritual Master who can really help you and guide towards your own realisation.</p>  </div>
