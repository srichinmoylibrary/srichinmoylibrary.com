<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on whether or not the country is spiritual. Some countries do not believe in the soul or in God, and their souls do not observe their birthdays. But if a country does believe in God and the soul, the soul definitely can observe its birthday.</p>
<p>The birthday of a country may not take place on a fixed date. In this case a birthday takes place when a new consciousness is dawning in the country. When the soul can offer this new consciousness to the citizens of the country, when the soul can enter into the body, vital, mind or consciousness of the country with something new, at that time the soul observes its birthday with all its joy.</p>  </div>
