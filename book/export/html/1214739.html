<p>U Thant was a man of illumining and fulfilling determination. This determination was born of his disciplined life.</p>
<p>Some people are apt to distinguish academically between the earth-bound and the Heaven-free realities. Nevertheless, they do not or, rather, cannot come out of the snares of ignorance-life. Indeed, to our deepest joy and pride, U Thant was a very rare exception.</p>  </div>
