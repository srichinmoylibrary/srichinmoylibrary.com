<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You must try to do the first thing first. First you must take the trouble to find God. If you take the trouble to find God, then God will take the trouble to find your soul-mate, shakti. First please Him, first make Him feel that you care for Him. If you can feel that God is your friend, then He will take much better care of you. You must try first of all to please God.</p>
<p>Question: Can one reach the subtle planes of cosmic consciousness as quickly through Raja Yoga as through Bhakti Yoga?</p>
