  <h1 class="book-heading">Receiving peace</h1>
  
 
<p>I am offering tonight’s peace-music-song-experience to Princeton’s illustrious son, President Woodrow Wilson, the founder of the League of Nations, whose heart was the pioneer-dream and whose life was the pioneer-dreamer of the oneness-home of world peace.</p>
<p>Each peace-seeker has a special way of receiving peace from his Inner Pilot. His Inner Pilot is at once his heart’s Saviour and his life’s Liberator. His heart’s Saviour saves him from blighting sins. His life’s Liberator liberates him from teeming imperfections.</p>
<p>Being a peace-seeker, I, too, have my own way of receiving peace. I receive peace only when I am exchanging something with my Beloved Supreme. I offer Him my doubting mind. In exchange, He grants me His compassionate Eye. I offer Him my fearful heart. In exchange, He grants me His powerful Feet. In our mutual exchange of gifts, I receive peace from my Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>In my day-to-day life, when I receive something from others, I get peace. When I give others something of my own, I also get peace. Again, when I go beyond receiving and giving, and just become a oneness-heart, I receive peace.</p>
<p>After receiving something from someone, the peace that I get is beautiful. After offering something to someone, the peace that I get is soulful. And when I go beyond receiving and giving and just become a oneness-heart in my oneness-family, the peace that I get is fruitful, supremely fruitful.</p>
<p>When we use power to bring about peace, we bring to the fore the animal life of our past incarnations. When we use love to bring about peace, we bring to the fore the life divine of our future incarnations.</p>
<p>You are mistaken if you think that by perfecting the world you will get peace. You are equally mistaken if you think that by letting the world perfect you, you will get peace. No, you cannot perfect the world, and the world cannot perfect you. Perfection comes from within, and the message of peace also comes from within — from within the peace-seeker’s heart. If the seeker wants to get perfection, if he wants to get peace, then he has to be consciously aware of his inner divinity and his own reality. It is by virtue of his prayer-life and his meditation-life that he can be conscious of what he eternally is. What he is, is the embodiment of God’s Vision-Dream. Who he is, is the embodiment and continuation of God’s Manifestation on earth. What he is, is the embodiment of God’s Satisfaction in God’s ever-transcending Creation. Only by becoming fully conscious of this can the true peace-seeker have peace—Eternity’s Peace, Infinity’s Peace and Immortality’s Peace. </p>
