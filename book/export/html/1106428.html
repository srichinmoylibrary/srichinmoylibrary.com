<p>Every day when I do my weightlifting I wear the shorts that my Canberra Centre disciples have sent me. When I went there a few years ago, I bought some and I like them very much. They are rugby shorts.</p>
<p>This morning, however, I wore a bright green pair that I bought in Indonesia. When I put them on, I looked like a member of the Jamaica West Indies soccer team.</p>
