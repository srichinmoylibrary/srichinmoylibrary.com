<p>Yesterday Ila’s soul left the body. Since then, she and I have had quite a few conversations.</p>
<p>{{{fleuron}}}</p>
<p>Needless to say, Ila’s humorous aspect we have enjoyed immensely over the years. Outwardly she was an iron rod. Inwardly she was as soft as marshmallow. Her softness-heart was most remarkable, and her outer strictness was also most remarkable.</p>
<p>Let me say something about her humorous aspect. Ila’s soul was here for a long time. Only a minute ago she left. While you were singing the song <em>Jibaner bhar</em><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> so soulfully, she said to me, “My Guru, if this kind of appreciation and adulation your children are going to offer me, then I am ready to take birth every morning and die every evening!” This is Ila!</p>
<p>So many things I can tell about her. If I do so, it will be a huge book, with hundreds of pages. My soul, my heart and my life shall forever treasure her, for among those who think, feel and know who I truly am, perhaps she stands foremost. She continuously felt my inner heights, and for that I shall remain eternally, eternally grateful to her.</p>
