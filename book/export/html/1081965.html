<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is the relationship of Father and son. Because of God's infinite Bounty and Compassion, this is possible. In addition, His infinite Compassion has kindled the flame of aspiration in my heart. When this flame of aspiration climbs high, higher, highest, it carries with it unconditional love, unconditional devotion, unconditional surrender. This happens with all seekers; only most aspirants are usually not aware of it. In my case, out of His infinite Bounty, I am conscious that my aspiration carries with it unconditional love, devotion and surrender.</p>
<p>The Supreme Being can assume any form He wants. But on the human level, if anybody asks me which form I treasure most, I will say His personal form. There is more familiarity in the personal form. Now, it might seem that familiarity could breed contempt. However, when I — or any true spiritual Master — deal with the Supreme Being on the familiar level, the seeker in me increases its intensity and capacity. When a spiritual Master deals with the divine Reality, his familiarity cannot diminish his love. When I deal with the personal aspect of the Supreme, I do not lose my love, devotion and surrender. The more familiar we become with the Supreme, the more we establish our oneness with Him.</p>
<p>This familiarity is a good opportunity for us to establish our heart's capacity and all-transforming oneness with the Absolute Supreme. Thus, the familiar, personal aspect of the Supreme cannot create problems for the true seeker. But in earthly relationships, this is not so, because people realise each other's weaknesses when they become familiar with each other. The Supreme Being, on the other hand, ignores our weaknesses, because He is manifesting Himself and has assumed these infinite forms in and through us. It is His creation and He is perfecting Himself in the process of evolution. He thinks of us as His own infinite extension, His own Reality-Light, and He helps and guides us on the inner plane.</p>  </div>
