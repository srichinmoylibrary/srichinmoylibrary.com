    <title>Daibel Faye: Even though it is by God&#039;s Grace that you lifted all that weight, indeed, there has to be a physical connection. Even though God&#039;s Grace is responsible, there has to be a lifting process.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us use the term 'faith'. Every day I try to increase my inner faith in God. He is full of Compassion, Love, Affection and Concern for His creation. When we look up, we see God the Creator, and when we look around, we see God the creation. God the Creator and God the creation are the same Person. When we pray to God the Creator, He tells us that He will be pleased with us only when we serve Him inside His creation.</p>
<p>This weightlifting that I do inspires many people. When it is on television, millions of people watch me. They get innocent joy when they see this 67-year-old man lifting weights. Specially people who are over sixty get tremendous inspiration. They say, "Oh, he is of our age. What is wrong with us? Why should we allow ourselves to be inactive? Why should we wallow in the pleasures of idleness?" Young people who are twenty or forty years younger than I am say, "If this old man can lift such heavy weights, what is wrong with us?"</p>
<p>My weightlifting is such an innocent thing. I am not boxing or wrestling with anybody. I am only trying to transcend my own capacity. I am only loving the divine in me, in you and in everybody. That divine is telling me to be of greater service to humanity. So when I lift weights, I have only one objective in front of me, and that is to serve mankind according to the limited capacity that I have been entrusted with. Again, my capacity is founded upon faith, and this faith comes from my prayer-life and my meditation-life.</p>  </div>
