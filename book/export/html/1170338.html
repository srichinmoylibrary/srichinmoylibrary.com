<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no difference between the Christ’s mission and the mission of any spiritual Master. Each spiritual Master feels that he is a conscious son of God. An ordinary human being, before he has realised God, does not consciously feel that he is a son of God. Unfortunately, you have not yet realised God so you cannot yet claim that you are a son of God. Sometimes nice, divine thoughts will enter into you and you will feel that you are a son of God. The next moment, when undivine thoughts enter into you, you will say that you are the son of the devil.</p>
<p>This is your life; but in the case of a spiritual Master, once he has realised God, he knows consciously that he is a son of God, a chosen son of God. So, as the Christ claimed on the strength of his realisation that he was the son of God, you also have every right to say that you are a son of God. You also can claim this, but right now you have not established your conscious inner oneness with God. That is why you cannot feel the same as a great spiritual Master or the Christ.</p>
<p>So, to come back to your question, there is no difference between his help to mankind and the service that other Masters are offering. That is to say, we are bringing down the same message that all spiritual Masters have brought down from Heaven: that earth has to lead a better life, a life of illumination. There is no difference, there can be no difference between the Christ’s mission and the mission of any spiritual Master. It is necessary from time to time for a spiritual Master to come into the world to illumine the consciousness of the earth. Lord Rama, Sri Krishna, the Buddha, the Christ, Sri Ramakrishna and others came, and now spiritual Masters are coming and they are doing the same things. It is like an eternal game with a continuous flow of divine players.</p>  </div>
