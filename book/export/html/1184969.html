<p>You are a dreamer,<br /> But that doesn't mean you will become<br /> A self-deceiving thought.</p>
<p>You are a dreamer,<br /> But that doesn't mean you will become<br /> A self-imposed authority.</p>
<p>You are a dreamer,<br /> But that doesn't mean you will become<br /> A God-fulfilling representative.</p>
