<p>A certain Mukherjee came to Nolini-da and said: "Nolini-da, Poddar is asking me to go out and give a few talks on Sri Aurobindo. What will the Mother think of it?"</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "Why do you involve the Mother in this matter? If you feel it proper from within, then go. If not, remain in the Ashram peacefully."</p>
<p>Mukherjee said: "But I am staying in the Ashram. I cannot do anything without the Mother's permission or approval."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "Indeed, indeed, but I am afraid I don't appreciate that kind of sentiment. To have real devotion and love for the Mother is one thing, but to show this devotion and love to others is a totally different matter. Usually the Mother does not give an opinion when people want to go out and talk about Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. You make your own decision."</p>
<p>Mukherjee said: "In that case, I shall think it over."</p>
<p>In ten minutes' time he came back and said to Nolini-da: "I have weighed the pros and cons and I have come to the conclusion that Bengal needs my service. So I am going."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "That's fine. I am glad that you are not involving the Mother in this matter."</p>  </div>
