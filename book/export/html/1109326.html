<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to know whether you are perfect in your purity, for example, then you have to enter into your body-consciousness, vital-consciousness, mental-consciousness, heart-consciousness and psychic-consciousness. Take each one as a different room. As soon as you enter into one particular room, you have to see if that room is illumined or not. If you feel that it is illumined, that means that your purity is perfect in this room. And if there is no illumination, immediately you will say that your purity is not perfect. So enter into your body-room and see if there is light inside your body. If there is no light, feel that here your purity is imperfect. Then enter into your vital-room and your other rooms, and see if there is light in them.</p>  </div>
