  </div>
<div id="node-1087394" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Constant aspiration</h1>
  
 

<p>Constant aspiration tells you that God is both finite and infinite. You can see God, clasp God and become God precisely because He appears before you as a divinely finite reality. God stands before you, loves you, illumines you and fulfils you precisely because He is infinite in His universal self-giving Reality and also He is infinite in His self-transcending transcendental Reality.</p>

<div id="node-1087397" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Gratitude</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1087398" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Humility</h1>
  
 

<p>Humility is the pioneer quality that beckons the rest of the divine qualities to see the universal Light of the Absolute Supreme and to grow into the infinite Delight of the Beloved Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1087399" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Illumination</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1087400" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Purity</h1>
  
 

<p>The purity of the body tells us where God is.<br /> The purity of the heart tells us how God is.<br /> The purity of the soul tells us who God is.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1087401" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Purity</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1087403" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Purity</h1>
  
 

<p>Purity is the height of aspiration, the length of dedication and the depth of illumination.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1087404" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Purity</h1>
  
 

<p>A seeker with a heart of purity does not have to run. God Himself runs for him constantly, unreservedly and unconditionally.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1087405" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Purity</h1>
  
 

<p>There are two types of purity. One is pure purity; the other is sure purity. Pure purity comes from continuous spiritual discipline. Sure purity comes from the eternal child that dwells in the inmost recesses of our heart, fulfilling cheerfully, devotedly, consciously and unconditionally the dictates of the Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1087406" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Purity</h1>
  
 

<p>There is no other way to see God's Face of Beauty than to offer your heart's purity to God constantly and unconditionally. Purity is the seed of your aspiration. Purity is your peerless companion which will never fail you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1087407" class="section-2">

  </div>
<div id="node-1087408" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Sleeplessness</h1>
  
 

<p>Sleeplessness for the Supreme is the beginning of conscious oneness with the Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1087409" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Strength</h1>
  
 

<p>There is only one strength in the inner world, and that eternal strength is constant love of God in God's own Way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1087410" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Surrender</h1>
  
 

<p>When you surrender your human will to God's Will, you immediately come to learn that God will not only do everything for you, but in reality He has already done everything for you.</p>
