<p>Dear ones, each time I complete one hundred songs in Bengali, I would like to invite each and every disciple to offer me a smaller-than-the-smallest gift. With your one-cent offering I will not become a multimillionaire, but I want you to participate in all my achievements. My task, to compose one hundred songs, is perhaps more difficult than yours! By my birthday I think I will be able to complete two hundred songs, so I kindly request two tiny gifts from you.</p>
<p>I want you all to participate, participate! Then you will value what I am doing. You will feel that you have taken part. In everything that I do, in my special achievements, I beg you to participate. Your participation in all my activities is of paramount importance in my life. You are my spiritual children. You participate, and you support me with your good wishes, your good will. I need your good will and good wishes.</p>
<p>So far about seventy songs I have composed. In a few days you will hear that I have completed one hundred. Talk about enthusiasm and dynamism! At the age of seventy-four I am practising it â€” not only preaching, but practising it.</p>
