<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yoga is no religion. Yoga transcends all varieties of religion. It is something infinitely deeper than the so-called “religions”. Yoga is the Living Breath that makes us feel that God is within us, of us and for us. Yoga is the direct communion with God. It is our union with God that Yoga teaches us. And at the same time, it is the language of our inner and spiritual life. Right now, I am speaking in English in order to convey my feelings, thoughts and ideas. Similarly, if I want to speak to God, commune with God, then the language that is required is called Yoga.</p>  </div>
