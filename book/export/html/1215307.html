<p>This afternoon at 1:20 I left my house walking. Vinaya was following me in the car. When I reached my one and a half-mile mark on Union Turnpike, I handed Vinaya my gloves and hat. Then I continued on to Suradhuni's bakery, which is at my two-mile mark. I went inside to buy prasad, but neither Suradhuni nor Pratibha was there to help me, so I came out again and got into the car.</p>
<p>This morning I walked one and a quarter miles and this afternoon two miles. My pace was 18 minutes per mile. This is how I am desperately trying to lose weight. Yesterday I ate ice cream and that is why I am 161 pounds today. Otherwise, I am 157 pounds.</p>
