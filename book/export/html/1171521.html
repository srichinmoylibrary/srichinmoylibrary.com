<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For me, the inner world and the outer world go together, like the fragrance and the beauty of a flower. Again, we can think of a seed and a tree. The seed is underground. There it germinates and eventually it becomes a tree. Then in the course of time, this tree produces new seeds. Like this, inner activities and outer activities must go side by side. Otherwise, there will be no balance between the two.</p>  </div>
