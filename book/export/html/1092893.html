<p>One day at his sister's house in Barrackpore, Dilip offered a reception for Subhas. Driving back to Calcutta in his own car, Subhas, clasping the hand of his dearest friend, opened his heart and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Dilip, I have a request to make to you: don't leave soon for your ivory tower. I need you...I need you because I want to feel that here in Calcutta I have at least one friend on whom I can fully rely, in whom I can confide without reserve."</p>
