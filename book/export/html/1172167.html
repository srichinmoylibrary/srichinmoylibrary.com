<p>I had gone another half a mile, when another girl called out: "Chinmoy-da, stop, stop!"</p>
<p>I said, "I am sorry, but I do not know you."</p>
<p>She said, "You do not know me, but I know you. I work with your cousin Soma at the Ashram press. I have read some of your books. You were brought up here. You are such a great man. I have been begging her to bring me to your place, but she will not listen. She says she comes to your place and she does not see you. You are such a big shot, you do not speak to people."</p>
<p>I said, "Fine, fine. Whatever my cousin has said is true."</p>
<p>She said, "I want to speak to you."</p>
<p>I said, "I am sorry, but I am very busy with my sister."</p>
<p>She said, "All right, since I have seen you, I am very happy. Now I can feel that I have seen a really great man."</p>
<p>She never saw me at the Ashram when I lived there. She came afterwards.</p>  </div>
