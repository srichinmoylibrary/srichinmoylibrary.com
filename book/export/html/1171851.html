<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life there should be only one teacher, because spirituality is one subject. It is not like history, geography and science. In school we study different subjects and we need different teachers. But God-realisation is one subject, so we don't need more than one teacher. But if you have studied under the guidance of a teacher and that teacher is unable to take you any farther, then what will you do? History you studied in primary school and you are also studying it in college. The teacher who taught you in primary school was not in a position to teach you in college. So naturally you had to find a different teacher since your first teacher could not take you to the highest course.</p>  </div>
