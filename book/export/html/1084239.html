<p>O child of the Sun-God,<br /> Did you ask your Father<br /> How much Wisdom-power<br /> He has kept aside<br /> For you?<br /> "I did ask my Father!<br /> He said<br /> He has not kept aside<br /> Even a flame of Wisdom-power<br /> For me.<br /> I shall have to deserve and acquire."<br /> O child of the Moon-Goddess,<br /> Did you ask your Mother<br /> How much Love-perfection<br /> She has kept aside<br /> For you?<br /> "I did ask my Mother!<br /> She said<br /> She has kept aside<br /> Her Love-perfection-universe<br /> For me.<br /> She is eagerly waiting<br /> For me to claim it as my own."</p>
