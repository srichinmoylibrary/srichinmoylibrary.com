<p>Early in the morning I wanted to change some money at the hotel. There was only one person ahead of me in line, but it took me twenty minutes to get my money changed because that person and the man behind the desk were talking and talking.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock in the morning Ekantar did me a favour. Before I came down to the lobby, he paid my bill. Then immediately they turned off my telephone so that I could not make any more outside calls.</p>
<p>When I told the operator that I wanted to make a phone call, she said, "No, no, your room bill has already been paid. You can't make any more phone calls."</p>
<p>I said, "But I am still here in the room. I will come down and pay again."</p>
<p>After a long fight, they finally agreed.</p>
