<p>When I came to Parsons Boulevard, at my 1,000-metre mark, I was really tired! All of a sudden I heard a very frightening noise in the street. I was on the sidewalk, so I didn't have to worry, but I looked back.</p>
<p>There I saw that a red car had stopped very abruptly. A middle-aged man opened the door and started calling to me, "Sri Chinmoy, you are so tired! Please come into my car. I will give you a lift. I will be so honoured."</p>
<p>How abruptly he stopped the car! He was ready to have an accident just so he could offer me a ride. I don't think I have ever seen him anywhere before.</p>
<p>So God wanted me to have this experience. After seeing that bad lady in the candy store, I met this nice man.</p>
