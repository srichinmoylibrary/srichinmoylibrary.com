<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Real Immortality is consciousness. Consciousness does not die. When we speak of Immortality, we have to feel that it is the Immortality of consciousness that we are speaking of. This consciousness, which we think of as already immortal, will be enlarged and brought forward only with the transformation of our human nature. Now we are living in an unconscious world, but a day will come when we will all be conscious, divinised and transformed. Immortality means that which will last forever, and what lasts is our consciousness, our aspiring consciousness.</p>  </div>
