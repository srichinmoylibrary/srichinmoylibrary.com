<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every soul comes down with a promise. When a disciple comes to me, he immediately says, “Your path is by far the best for me. I am going to manifest you and fulfil you. But the next day the same disciple may leave me and say that my path is the worst path on earth. In the same way, although the soul comes from the Supreme with a promise, as soon as it enters into earth-ignorance, it forgets. Sri Ramakrishna brought two most powerful souls to earth with him to become his disciples. You know about Swami Vivekananda, whom he found. But there was another disciple who had been brought down from the soul’s region, whom Sri Ramakrishna could not find on earth. Even Sri Ramakrishna, with all his spiritual height, could not discover this soul. Where did he go? Ignorance took him away. He never came to Sri Ramakrishna at all.</p>  </div>
