<p><em>Sri Chinmoy: Sahasrara</em> is considered to be the seventh spiritual centre, although it is not linked to the other six. The <em>Sahasrara chakra</em> is located at the crown of the head.</p>
<p>When one enters into this crown centre, he enters into trance and goes beyond the consciousness of this world. The mantra of this centre is 'Supreme'.</p>
<p>There are many other insignificant centres in the subtle body, but the six I have talked about and this <em>Sahasrara chakra</em> are the most important ones.</p>  </div>
