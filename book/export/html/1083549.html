<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has already entered into you. It is you who are afraid of entering into Him lovingly, devotedly and fully. Just try to enter into Him. As your sweet little child, Mahendra, enters into your open arms and loving heart, even so God expects you to run and enter into His open Arms and loving Heart.</p>  </div>
