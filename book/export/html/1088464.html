<p>God is proud of His Divinity in Sri Krishna. Man is proud of his humanity in Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna is the beloved Boatman who untiringly plies His Boat of Consciousness between India's unparalleled history and Her unrivalled spirituality.</p>
<p>The Gita is Sri Krishna's Heart, His Vision-in-Fulfilment. The Gita is humanity's breath, its journey towards Immortality.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna's Flute stirs the Universal Consciousness. Sri Krishna's Gita enchants the Transcendental Consciousness.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna plays on His Flute. We hear. We do something more. We barter our body's dust with His Soul's Plenitude.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna is the shoreless ocean of Bliss. But as soon as I sincerely dedicate myself to Him, He presents me with His own Boat and takes me to the boundless Shore, the Golden All.</p>  </div>
