<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Who lasts forever? God. He is real. Therefore whatever comes directly from God is real. Reality, the highest Reality, is something eternal, something immortal. The other name of Reality is Eternity.</p>
<p>The ultimate Reality is one thing, but relative realities can be totally different. Again, sometimes on the physical plane we see something in one way, but when we concentrate on the inner plane we do not see it in the same way. Only things that are permanent will have the same type of reality. There are many transient things on earth and the essence of those things can never be the essence of other things which are immortal.</p>
<p>When we look down from the top floor of the Empire State Building, we see human beings as tiny ants. If we do not use a telescope, it is only with difficulty that we see human beings. So here on the physical plane we can see the same reality in different ways.</p>
<p>There are realities on the higher planes which are absolutely solid, pure and true; but when those realities descend into the earth-consciousness, they lose many of their inner qualities. When they appear here on earth, they are not as beautiful, as dynamic or as soulful as on the inner planes.</p>
<p>There are some realities which are immortal realities. On every plane they have the same capacity, the same truth. If we have the highest realisation of the absolute Truth, then it is bound to be the same on all planes. We can see the Truth on the gross physical plane just as we see it in the higher regions. It is only when we try to manifest the highest Reality on the physical plane that we realise it is a Himalayan task. Inwardly we see and feel that it is a matter of seconds to manifest everything on earth but when we try to establish the Reality here, when we want to manifest it fully on earth, we find it may take thousands and millions of years.</p>  </div>
