    <title>Question: If we could look back at all our lives on earth, we would find that many really significant events took place. Do significant things also happen in between lifetimes, or is it just like sleep?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, in the soul’s world there are significant things, but these things will not be manifested. In the soul’s world there is no manifestation. Progress is there, but not in the sense of evolution.</p>
<p>We enter into the soul’s world to take rest. But if our soul associates with a higher soul, a more illumined soul, then naturally we will be inspired. If, in the soul’s world, we are near a spiritual Master <em>or</em> some other very great, significant, spiritual person, then naturally we will be influenced.</p>  </div>
