<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If they come back, that means you have not offered them to the Supreme with utmost devotion, sincerity, intensity and faithfulness. If you are offering your bad qualities with only one or two of your good qualities, then that bad quality comes back again and again. If you offer your bad qualities with <em>all</em> your good qualities, then they do not come back.</p>  </div>
