<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The supreme duty of an artist is to meditate before he creates something and, while creating, to be in a very contemplative, divine mood. Then, when the creation is completed, he will immediately place his creation at the Feet of the Lord Supreme. No matter what others say about his creation, no matter what his feelings are about his own creation, as soon as his creation is completed, he will place it at the Feet of the Supreme for Him to use in His own way. This is the supreme duty of the spiritual artist.</p>  </div>
