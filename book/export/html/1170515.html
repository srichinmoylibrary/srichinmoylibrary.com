SCA 57-64. Questions and answers at the Jharna-Kala exhibition, on 3 August 1993.</p>
<h2>Question: How do you find the time to draw, to write, to do everything you do?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As you know, where there is a will, there is a way. I pray to God and meditate on God. Out of His infinite Compassion, He has given me the capacity to accomplish quite a few things. These creations of mine are not my personal belongings or my personal possessions. These are my dedicated offerings to my Inner Pilot. Out of His infinite Bounty He has given me the capacity, and it is He who receives the fruits.</p>  </div>
