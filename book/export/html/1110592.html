  <h1 class="book-heading">Concentration</h1>
  
 
<p>Concentration is the surest way to reach the goal. The goal can be God-realisation, the goal can be success in a material field, the goal can be merely the fulfilment of human desires. But it is concentration that acts like an arrow and enters into the target.</p>
<p>He who is wanting in the power of concentration is no better than a monkey. A real aspirant, a devotee, sooner or later acquires the power of concentration either through the Grace of God, through his constant practice of the inner life or through aspiration. Each aspirant can declare and proclaim that he has a divine hero, a divine soldier within himself. And what is that divine warrior? It is his concentration. Concentration is like a bullet entering and piercing the mail-coat of ignorance. Concentration is the aspirant's true divine Pride.</p>
<p>So if one wants to achieve any goal in any walk of life — whether it is the human, earthly journey toward emancipation or the soul's journey toward absolute realisation — then I wish to say that concentration is the answer.</p>  </div>
