<p>The world is blessed with all kinds of complaints. Children do not listen to their parents, friends do not listen to their friends, husbands do not listen to their wives, wives do not listen to their husbands. But when we go to the root of all these problems, we observe in no time that it is the word 'responsibility' that is playing all the mischief. Everybody knows what the word 'responsibility' stands for. But what is true responsibility? In human life, there can be only one true responsibility, and that is to offer our unreserved dedication to God, the Supreme, with what we are and what we have. We know what we are: we are our own existence; and we know what we have: we have friends and family. Instead of taking the responsibilities of others, we must make it a point to offer ourselves, along with our family and friends, to the Supreme.</p>
<p>In the ordinary life we create responsibility to gratify and feed ourselves and that responsibility is based on ego. But spiritual responsibility is not based on ego. When the highest Power and highest Light enter into us, we expand. The expansion of our soul, body and physical mind is the expansion of the Divinity within us. Our responsibility, then, is not to show the world what we are doing, or what we stand for, or how much we have given it. Our responsibility is to feel that we must have God-realisation. In the true spiritual life, I wish to say that the cry for God-realisation is not a sign of ego; it is rather our constant awareness of the Truth, our awareness that the Truth has to be seen, felt, realised, revealed and manifested. It is the soul's responsibility that we feel as our very own, because the soul tells us constantly that God is ours, that we can reveal God and eventually become God.</p>  </div>
