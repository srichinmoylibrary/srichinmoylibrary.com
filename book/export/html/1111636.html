<p>Quite recently I weighed myself, and I literally cried! Then I ran and walked eleven miles, without taking any food. In a day or two I took off nine pounds. Tomorrow also I will take off another one or two pounds. If I can do it, others can also do it.</p>
<p>There are many, many things which I do to encourage and inspire others. I run and keep my weight down because what I preach, I also want to practise in my life. Many Masters don't do this kind of thing — losing weight and taking exercise. Their God-realisation will not disappear if they become exorbitantly fat.</p>
