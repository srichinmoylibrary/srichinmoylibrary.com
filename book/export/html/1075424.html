<p>Do you spend more than you earn?<br /> "Yes."<br /> Why do you do that?<br /> Who taught you to do that?<br /> "My ignorance-friend."</p>
<p>Do you spend less than you earn?<br /> "Yes."<br /> Why do you do that?<br /> Who taught you to do that?<br /> "My wisdom-friend."</p>
<p>Do you spend all that you earn?<br /> "Yes."<br /> Why do you do that?<br /> Who taught you to do that?<br /> "My God-friend.<br /> He said to me:<br /> 'You fool.<br /> Why do you have to think of the future?<br /> Let the future take care of itself.<br /> What I want from you<br /> Is to take care of today,<br /> Only today.'
