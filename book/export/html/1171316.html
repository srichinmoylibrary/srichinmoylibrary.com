<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Angels will have more trouble than ordinary people because the world is so undivine, so gross, so unreceptive.</p>
<p>I have seen some girls in the acting line who were angels or fairies once upon a time. But then they became corrupted by the outer world; they got married ten times and this sort of thing. They came from the angel world to teach mankind to aspire. But it is like a deer coming and telling an elephant to go up. The elephant is so huge that it just grabs the deer. Or it is like a beautiful bird that comes down and asks us to fly. As soon as it comes, we grab the bird and clip its wings. The bird comes to inspire us to go up and fly in the sky, but we do not even allow it to fly.</p>  </div>
