<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Why do I limp along the path of impurity<br /> Every day?<br /> "My child,<br /> You limp along the path of impurity<br /> Every day<br /> Because you and your mind<br /> Do not want to study<br /> At the prayer-school,<br /> You and your heart<br /> Do not want to study<br /> At the meditation-college,<br /> You and your life<br /> Do not want to study<br /> At the surrender-university.</p>

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Why is my inner progress-road<br /> Always so bumpy?<br /> "My child,<br /> Your inner progress-road<br /> Is always so bumpy<br /> Because instead of ignoring<br /> You are adoring your busy body-mind."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> I know You are extremely busy.<br /> Do You think You will be able<br /> To ask my soul to be<br /> My life's decision-maker?<br /> "My child,<br /> I can ask your soul<br /> Only on one condition:<br /> If you are ready to become<br /> Your heart's sincerity-cry."</p>
