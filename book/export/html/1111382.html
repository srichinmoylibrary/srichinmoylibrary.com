<p>In 1944, when I ran 400 metres, I did it in 56 seconds. In 1946, it was 54 seconds. Then, for years, it was always 53.6 seconds or 53.8 or 53.9. Now, O God, it takes me so long.</p>
<p>I used to do 100 metres in 12.1 or 12.2 seconds. Then, when I was finished I used to laugh and smile and go away. Now, I'm taking 19 or 20 seconds, and I'm not laughing when I finish.</p>
