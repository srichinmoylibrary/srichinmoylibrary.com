<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it is not superstition. Something inside the wristwatch may affect the life-energy. It may not affect your lifeline, but some other line in your palm. I have so many wristwatches that I can open up a shop! Each wristwatch gives me a different vibration. This moment if I use one, I get one vibration, and next moment another vibration. Strangely enough, the same wristwatch today will give one vibration, and tomorrow it will give another vibration. Here on this table it has one vibration, and when I put it in my room inside the drawer, there is another vibration.</p>  </div>
