<p>What an adventure this trip to Scotland was! So many things went wrong in the airport, on the plane and in the hotels.</p>
<p>After the disciples saw me off at Kennedy Airport, I went to the British Airways lounge. Can you imagine? About forty people were standing because there were no seats left in the lounge.</p>
<p>Finally we entered into the plane. An orthodox Jewish man was sitting in the seat beside mine. He had a little cap and a long beard. His seat was on the aisle and mine was at the window. When I came and stood in front of him, he didn't want to move or get up so that I could get to my seat. It was only with greatest difficulty that I was able to sit down.</p>
<p>After ten or fifteen minutes I thought, "Let me start writing poems." But I could not find even one ballpoint. I had put six ballpoints into my bag, but at that time I could not find even one. I searched here and there. I said to myself, "How can I ask this man for a ballpoint? God doesn't want me to write poems." So I read for hours on the plane and I didn't write even one poem. Towards the end of the trip, the stewardess gave out immigration cards for us to fill out. I could have asked the stewardess for a ballpoint, but often it is so hard to get their attention that you lose all your inspiration. I said to myself, "At the airport I will fill it out!"</p>
