<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The peace that I bring down is dynamic peace. If you have God’s Peace, this peace is creation, inner creation, continual creation. When you fall asleep, you don’t receive anything. You get absolutely nothing. Only if you fall asleep after meditating, sometimes you have assimilation. But if you don’t receive anything from meditation, then what will rest do? If you have not received anything, then how can you assimilate during your sleep? You are not aspiring; you are sleeping. If you don’t meditate well and then you sleep, do you think an angel will drop from Heaven and meditate for you? No! No angel is going to do that.</p>  </div>
