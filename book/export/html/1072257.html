<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am a seeker and a God-lover. God is trying to inspire humanity in a new way in and through me. The spiritual Masters of the hoary past thought the inner life and the outer life could not go together. In India some of them think this even today. Our spiritual Masters, in order to realise God, used to live in the Himalayan caves or in one solitary room for 20, 30 or 40 years. They were afraid of entering into society. They said that the outer life could never be transformed because they felt that inner inspiration or aspiration did not function in the outer life. But my Beloved Supreme — who is my Lord, who is your Lord, who is everybody’s Lord — feels that if we neglect the body, the outer life, then how are we going to be perfect in every aspect of life and how are we going to manifest Him? The body is the temple and the soul is the shrine. If we neglect the temple and do not keep it in good condition, what will happen to the shrine? If we pay attention only to the shrine, then how can the temple do something for God?</p>
<p>Of late I have been reading articles written about you by your real admirers in <em>Strength and Health</em> magazine. I also have many articles written by you. They are so inspiring, so inspiring. In 1972, when people were saying unkind things about the old champions, your friend inspired you or instigated you to enter into competition again. Then in London again you became Mr. Universe. I read those articles with such joy and got such a real thrill from them.</p>  </div>
