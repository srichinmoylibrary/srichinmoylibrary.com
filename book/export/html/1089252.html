<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am not the right person to pronounce judgement. Everybody knows what is good for himself. I know what is good for myself; they know what is good for themselves. They are doing the right thing according to their receptivity and inner light. We are trying to do the best thing according to our own inner light. We are all responsible for our own rooms, They are responsible for their rooms; I am responsible for my room; you are responsible for your room. You can come to see what I have in my room. I have no right to say what they have in their rooms.</p>  </div>
