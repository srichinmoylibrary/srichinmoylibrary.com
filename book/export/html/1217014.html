<p>The soul of Frank Zane, the bodybuilder, has a very close connection with the soul of that bus driver. While we were driving from the Sultan's palace to the airport, Frank Zane's soul was telling his soul who I am, and the bus driver's soul was listening with such admiration.</p>
<p>Now the bus driver outwardly has developed such admiration for me. It is because Frank Zane's soul is acting inside his soul.</p>
