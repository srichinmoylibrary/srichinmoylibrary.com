<p>Yesterday I was shopping in Valdivia, Chile. I was looking at a jacket in a store window when all of a sudden Tanima's soul came to me and said, "Pretty!"</p>
<p>I asked her soul, "Is it the right size?"</p>
<p>The soul didn't know. So I went inside the store and saw the price was 5,500. I always bargain; it is an Indian tradition. But how could I bargain, since I didn't speak Spanish? So I wrote down 5,500 on a piece of paper, then crossed out the first 5 and wrote in 4. So it went on. The owner smiled at me and I smiled at her. Finally I bought the jacket.</p>
