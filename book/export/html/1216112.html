<p>His birth was a drop<br /> In the sea of time.<br /> His death shall be a drop<br /> In the sea of time.<br /> Yet God felt and declared<br /> That his life was indispensable,<br /> For he thought of God, prayed to God,<br /> Fought for God and fulfilled God<br /> In the battlefield of life.</p>
