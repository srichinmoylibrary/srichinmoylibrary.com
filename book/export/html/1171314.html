<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fairies have more control on earth. If fairies want to do something in and through someone on earth, they can. They get results on the practical plane. Angels also get results, but they are on the inner plane, the subtle plane. The angelic touch is much higher and deeper than that of a fairy.</p>  </div>
