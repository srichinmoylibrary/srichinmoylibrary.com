<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God’s supreme Secret is: “Do not give up!” He says to His children, “I have not given up on you. So, My children, you also should not give up.” Every day in secrecy supreme God is telling human beings, “Your life is still unfinished. Since I have not given up on you, you also should not give up.”</p>  </div>
