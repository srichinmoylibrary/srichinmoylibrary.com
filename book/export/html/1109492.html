<p>When we look at the world with our inner eye, the world is beautiful. This beauty is the reflection of our own divinity. God the Beautiful has our aspiring heart as His eternal Throne. We, the seekers of the Supreme, can never see eye-to-eye with Nietzsche's proud philosophy. He utters: "The world is beautiful, but has a disease called man."</p>
<p>On the contrary, we can say in unmistakable terms that the world is beautiful because it has been illumined by a supernal beauty called man.</p>  </div>
