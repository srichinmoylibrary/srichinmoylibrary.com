<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the North Pole is your goal, and not the South Pole, then naturally you will run toward the North Pole. If you want to go to the North Pole but, at the same time, if you have an inner desire to be an object of attraction to the South Pole, then you will always be attached. The day that you can feel that you do not need affection, love, appreciation, admiration or concern from your family is the day that you will stop being attached to them. That does not mean that I am asking you to give up all connection with your family. Far from it. I never ask young boys and girls to leave their parents. But if you feel that their behaviour is detrimental to your spiritual life, then it is up to you to decide which is more important.</p>
<p>Often I see that if disciples go to visit their parents even for two hours, when they come back they are like totally different people. Their consciousness has fallen to such an extent that it is beyond your imagination. But again, they depend on their parentsâ€™ financial assistance. They are students and they cannot support themselves. Since their parents support them, then naturally they are under some obligation. But if someone feels that he is not in any way under an obligation to his parents, and if his parents are discouraging his spiritual life, then why should he continue any unnecessary connection with them?</p>
<p>If they are totally against your spiritual life, then what is the use of mixing with them? What is the difference between an enemy and someone who deliberately tries to prevent you from making spiritual progress? An enemy will always stand against you so that you cannot fulfil your wishes, If your parents also consciously or even unconsciously stand against you, then you have to be very careful. If you know that your parents are dead against your spiritual life, and if you feel that the spiritual life is the only life you want, then you will have to do what you know is best for your spiritual life.</p>  </div>
