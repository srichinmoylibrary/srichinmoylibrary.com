<p>God in human form<br /> Descends from Heaven today<br /> To touch and feel<br /> The breath of earth-dust.<br /> Comrades, His Victory<br /> Let us proclaim, casting aside<br /> All our world-responsibility-obligations.</p>
<p>O Lord Absolute,<br /> We, the ever-blossoming souls,<br /> Shall satisfy You with our<br /> Oneness-devotion-breath-hearts.<br /> We embody certainty's life<br /> To surprisingly illumine<br /> Our journey's birthless<br /> And deathless course.</p>
<p>Lovingly, prayerfully and soulfully<br /> We shall bring the Victory-Crown<br /> From the Consciousness-Ocean-Beyond<br /> And, with a brightness-splendour-smile,<br /> Place it at Your Feet<br /> With our softness-heart-care.</p>
<p>A poltroon-body, a dunce-mind,<br /> A restlessness-vital<br /> We never shall be.<br /> We shall ever be found<br /> In the newness-vortex<br /> Of activities multifarious.</p>
<p>No sorrow, no diffidence,<br /> No loss can torture us<br /> Before Your blessingful, august Presence.<br /> To none save You<br /> Shall we offer our fear-surrender.</p>
<p>You to invoke<br /> And place inside<br /> Our mind's seraglio-cave,<br /> Let us sleeplessly<br /> Occupy our mind, shunning<br /> All our childish games and pranks.</p>
<p>Together, in oneness-heart,<br /> Your Victory we all shall proclaim.<br /> You if we fail to receive and achieve,<br /> Our earth-life will helplessly betray<br /> Its utter worthlessness and uselessness.</p>
<p>Singing our Master's Victory-Song,<br /> We, the ever-blossoming souls,<br /> Shall walk along Eternity's Road<br /> Blazed by His Divinity's Radiance-Feet.</p>
<p>Like fully blossomed flowers,<br /> We shall distribute<br /> Our sweet redolence-fragrance.<br /> Speechless, the whole world will watch<br /> Our journey's progress-march.</p>
<p>Your new Message we shall carry<br /> To all climes, near and far.<br /> We shall be self-discoverers;<br /> Pride-victims we never shall be.</p>
<p><em>Refrain</em></p>
<p>God in human form<br /> Descends from Heaven today<br /> To touch and feel<br /> The breath of earth-dust.<br /> Comrades, His Victory<br /> Let us proclaim, casting aside<br /> All our world-responsibility-obligations.</p>
<p>O Summit-Soul supreme,<br /> Your Compasson-Light we invoke<br /> To keep our hearts<br /> Eternally at Your Feet.</p>
<p>In all,<br /> The lower than the lowest<br /> And the higher than the highest,<br /> You abide.<br /> Sleeplessly Your Victory-Song<br /> Resonates in the heart of Eden.</p>
<p>You are a perfect stranger<br /> To superiority-inferiority-twins.<br /> You are at once the chosen Haven<br /> Of both penury and prosperity-possessors.</p>
<p>You are Your Life's Sweetness-Affection<br /> To all souls that breathe on earth.<br /> None can dare fathom<br /> Your Compassion-Heart-Ocean.</p>
<p>To offer You our <em>raison d'ętre,</em><br /> We are speeding towards<br /> Your Infinity's Height,<br /> Smashing asunder today<br /> All the bondage-shackles<br /> That will cross our path.</p>
<p><em>Refrain</em></p>
<p>God in human form<br /> Descends from Heaven today<br /> To touch and feel<br /> The breath of earth-dust.<br /> Comrades, His Victory<br /> Let us proclaim, casting aside<br /> All our world-responsibility-obligations.</p>
<p>To spread Your Compassion-flooded<br /> Life-Transformation-Message-Light<br /> Here on earth,<br /> We shall offer our all,<br /> Our very last breath.</p>
<p>Even if we fail to muster<br /> A new supply of strength<br /> At each hush-gap,<br /> We, the ever-blossoming souls,<br /> Shall not permit ourselves<br /> To be name-fame-beggars.</p>
<p>While enjoying a short respite,<br /> We shall sing Your Victory-Songs<br /> And fly Your Victory-Banner<br /> Upon the Himaloy-pinnacle.</p>
<p>A day shall dawn<br /> When we, the ever-blossoming souls,<br /> Only by virtue of<br /> Your Compassion-Blessings,<br /> Shall proclaim our world-conquest<br /> To the four corners of the globe.</p>
<p>No iota of wealth You own;<br /> Yet, all El Dorados at Your Feet.<br /> O Lord Supreme,<br /> Indweller of our hearts,<br /> Your boundless Bounty<br /> Permits You not to escape<br /> Our stark mind-confines.</p>
<p><em>Refrain</em></p>
<p>God in human form<br /> Descends from Heaven today<br /> To touch and feel<br /> The breath of earth-dust.<br /> Comrades, His Victory<br /> Let us proclaim, casting aside<br /> All our world-responsibility-obligations.</p>
<p>If any bosom pines<br /> To be our compatriot,<br /> Then presto! Renounce your all,<br /> Your world-pleasure-plethora.</p>
<p>When all world-attachments leave you,<br /> We shall welcome you<br /> To join our group<br /> With ever-widening open arms.</p>
<p>The rich and the poor,<br /> The wise and the ignorant —<br /> All those who inhabit the world —<br /> In each and every human being<br /> We shall see the living Presence of God,<br /> Like our Master-Guru.</p>
<p>If ever we become pride-victims,<br /> We know for certain<br /> That Your infinite Compassion-Treasure<br /> Will desert us.</p>
<p>We, the ever-blossoming souls,<br /> Must be extremely careful<br /> In preserving<br /> Our newness-strength indomitable.</p>
<p><em>Refrain</em></p>
<p>God in human form<br /> Descends from Heaven today<br /> To touch and feel<br /> The breath of earth-dust.<br /> Comrades, His Victory<br /> Let us proclaim, casting aside<br /> All our world-responsibility-obligations.</p>
<p>He whom the holy saints<br /> And honesty-flooded souls<br /> In perfect amity worship,<br /> And the single-minded devotees<br /> Invoke to claim as their own,</p>
<p>He has taken human form<br /> In the heart of Mother Bengal.<br /> In His happiness<br /> Our hearts must rejoice.<br /> In His sadness<br /> Our hearts must suffer.</p>
<p>To each and every soul,<br /> Smiling we shall offer<br /> Our hearts' newness-strength.<br /> We, the ever-blossoming souls,<br /> Shall dive deep<br /> Into the Heart of Infinity's Light.</p>
<p>O Lord Absolute,<br /> Today do inundate our earth-existence<br /> With Your Compassion-Flood.<br /> May our devotion-adoration<br /> Ever be found<br /> At Your Feet Supreme.</p>
<p>O Transcendental Height,<br /> O Beauty Unfathomable,<br /> To You we bow.<br /> May we be totally oblivious<br /> To our earthly gains and losses<br /> In committing ourselves<br /> To Your Service-Light.</p>
<p><em>Refrain</em></p>
<p>God in human form<br /> Descends from Heaven today<br /> To touch and feel<br /> The breath of earth-dust.<br /> Comrades, His Victory<br /> Let us proclaim, casting aside<br /> All our world-responsibility-obligations.</p>
<p>O Lord of the ever-transcending Beyond,<br /> You are discovered Self-amorous<br /> In Your birthless and deathless Light.<br /> At Your Feet<br /> All utterly lost human souls<br /> Have found their Peace-Haven.</p>
<p>Vishma, Dadichi, Arjuna, Drona,<br /> Bhima, Abhimanyu<br /> Were all indomitable hero-souls<br /> Who walked Mother-Earth<br /> With their loftiest tower-majesty-heads.</p>
<p>You have inundated us<br /> With Your Blessings infinite.<br /> By virtue of Your Blessings,<br /> We, the ever-blossoming souls,<br /> Shall equal those immortal souls<br /> And run abreast with them.</p>
<p>O Lord, Your Consciousness<br /> Pervades the sky<br /> And the Himaloy-pinnacle-heights.<br /> In darkness-caves<br /> And in ocean-expanse<br /> It sings and dances<br /> In perfect oneness.</p>
<p>O Lord Absolute,<br /> Pondicherry-Dweller,<br /> The saints, sages and yogis<br /> Every morn and every eve<br /> Proclaim Your Victory<br /> From all four corners of the globe.</p>
<p><em>Refrain</em></p>
<p>God in human form<br /> Descends from Heaven today<br /> To touch and feel<br /> The breath of earth-dust.<br /> Comrades, His Victory<br /> Let us proclaim, casting aside<br /> All our world-responsibility-obligations.</p>
<p>If ever others speak ill of us,<br /> We shall never hurt their hearts<br /> In return.</p>
<p>Knowing perfectly well<br /> That the Absolute Lord Supreme abides,<br /> In His living Presence, in all,<br /> How can we ever torture<br /> Any human life?</p>
<p>The way the Life-Force<br /> Of our breath<br /> Resides in us,<br /> Exactly the same way<br /> The Life-Force abides in all,<br /> And accepts and endures<br /> Each and every human being.</p>
<p>You are the Source<br /> Of Brahma the Creator.<br /> Before You we place<br /> Our supplication, devotion<br /> And adoration-surrender.</p>
<p>No iota of fear have we<br /> While offering You<br /> Our wee, puny and paltry gifts,<br /> For we know<br /> You are the Compassion-Lord<br /> Of our motherless, fatherless, helpless life.<br /> You are the Vision-Light<br /> Of the whole universe.<br /> You are our Eternity's only Friend.</p>
<p><em>Refrain</em></p>
<p>God in human form<br /> Descends from Heaven today<br /> To touch and feel<br /> The breath of earth-dust.<br /> Comrades, His Victory<br /> Let us proclaim, casting aside<br /> All our world-responsibility-obligations.</p>
<p>Like the most insignificant service<br /> Rendered by the morning dew<br /> To the ocean-surface,<br /> We know our service to You<br /> Is equally and unmistakably<br /> Most insignificant.<br /> Notwithstanding, lovingly<br /> You accept our service-flames<br /> To bless us<br /> With Your bountiful Pride.</p>
<p>In fire and water,<br /> In dust and atoms,<br /> Seeing You, Your Meditation-Trance,<br /> Many poets have depicted<br /> Your immortal Beauty.</p>
<p>They are our pioneers.<br /> We are walking along the same road<br /> To reach Your hallowed Feet.<br /> This beautiful morning<br /> We are weaving the garland<br /> Of our heart's message,<br /> Prayerful and soulful:</p>
<p>"Victory, victory, victory<br /> To Sri Aurobindo,<br /> The Guru Supreme of the Universe!"<br /> Sleeplessly and breathlessly<br /> Repeating this incantation,<br /> We shall become<br /> Eternity's sweetness-purity-breath.</p>
<p>O Lord Supreme,<br /> You have donned<br /> An earthly cloak.<br /> We place at Your Feet<br /> Our surrender unconditional<br /> For Your unhorizoned Manifestation<br /> Here on earth.</p>
<p><em>Refrain</em></p>
<p>God in human form<br /> Descends from Heaven today<br /> To touch and feel<br /> The breath of earth-dust.<br /> Comrades, His Victory<br /> Let us proclaim, casting aside<br /> All our world-responsibility-obligations.</p>
