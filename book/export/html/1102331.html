<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, the dream that began with the League of Nations does not need another organisation to fulfil its message. The United Nations has abundant capacity to fulfil the dream of the League of Nations and also to fulfil its own dream, which is far more absorbing, more illumining and more fulfilling.</p>
