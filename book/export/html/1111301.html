<p>When I was running on the Grand Central service road near Jamaica High School, a taxi driver very pathetically asked me how to find Atlantic Avenue.</p>
<p>I am the one who never knows anything about giving directions. I said to myself, "O God, save me, save me!" Then I said to the taxi driver, "Make a right turn and go to Jamaica Avenue, and then ask people there how to go to Atlantic Avenue."</p>
<p>The driver said, "I see the Van Wyck Expressway and Atlantic Avenue when I come from Kennedy Airport."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, you have to make a right turn."</p>
<p>I was so proud of myself that I was able to give him the correct information.</p>
