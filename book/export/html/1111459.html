<p>Altogether there were four loops. It seemed that every time I came near the finish line, they played my flute music over the loudspeaker. When I was finishing, at least three hundred metres before I crossed the finish line, they were playing "Phire Chalo." It was absolutely the correct song to play: the soul was going back to its heavenly home. The last three hundred metres I ran hearing only my "Phire Chalo" on the flute.</p>
