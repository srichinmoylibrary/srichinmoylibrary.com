<p>In Athens I was invited to visit a meditation club that follows all the spiritual Masters, including Ramakrishna and Satya Sai Baba. They liked my meditation book and have translated an abridged version.</p>
<p>They sang bhajans and asked me quite a few questions. At one point they were singing "Ganesha" in various ways, but I couldn't understand what they were saying.</p>
<p>I asked, "What were you singing?"</p>
<p>They said, "You don't know? This is about your God Ganesha."</p>
<p>Then I told them a few stories about Ganesha and they were very happy. Finally they sang one of my Bengali songs, "Usha bala elo." Suhriday and Nikunja had taught them.</p>
