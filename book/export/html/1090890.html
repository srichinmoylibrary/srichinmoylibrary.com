<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to tell you that that kind of meditation is not at all advisable for the beginner, nor even for those who have been meditating for several years. It is only for the most advanced disciples and for realised souls. Others who try to meditate while lying down will immediately enter into the world of sleep or into a kind of inner drift or doze. Furthermore, while you are lying down, your breathing is not as perfect as it is when you are in a sitting position, since it is not conscious or controlled.</p>  </div>
