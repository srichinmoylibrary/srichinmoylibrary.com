<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is a human way of judging the Truth. If I were asked to write one poem now, I would not be able to do it. But there came a time when I was highly surcharged with inspiration; therefore, because of God's Grace, it was possible for me to write 843 poems in one day. So it was all a matter of God's Grace.</p>  </div>
