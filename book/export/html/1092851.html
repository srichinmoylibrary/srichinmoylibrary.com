<p>In 1957 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru travelled to Japan as the first Prime Minister of independent India. While he was in Tokyo, he visited the Renko-ji temple, where Netaji Subhas Chandra's ashes have been so faithfully and lovingly preserved by his Japanese friends. Nehru was asked to offer a message about Netaji. He wrote in his own hand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"May the Buddha's message bring peace to mankind."</p>
<p>(13 October 1957)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and signed his name. The framed copy of this message and Nehru's photo have been kept on display. The message is also engraved on a marble plaque which is mounted outside the temple near a statue of Netaji.</p>
<p>The messages of two other leaders of the Indian nation are shown on the same slab. The first is that of President Rajendra Prasad. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I consider it my happiness to be able to visit this temple to offer my prayer to the sacred ashes of Netaji."</p>
<p>(4 October 1958)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second message is that of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Nehru's own daughter, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"May the light of Netaji guide us towards the heart of truth and peace for eternity."</p>
<p>(26 June 1969)</p>
