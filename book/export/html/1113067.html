  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: How do we unlearn the teachings of the mind?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The first and foremost way is to bring the soul's light into the mind and also into the teachings of the mind. Then the soul's light will either illumine or obliterate everything that the mind, the physical mind, the doubting and suspicious mind has taught us. The ordinary human mind has taught us many things. The mind is constantly suspecting, the mind is constantly doubting, the mind is constantly bringing the truth to us in its own way. But with the soul's light, the things that we have learned can easily be cast aside or illumined.</p>
<p>Again, if we constantly try to bring the heart to the fore and do not pay any attention to the physical mind, then we automatically unlearn what the mind has taught us. This is the second best way. It is like "out of sight, out of mind." If we do not review the teachings of the mind, naturally we will forget them. At the same time, in order to unlearn old things, the teachings of the mind, we have to pay attention to the new things, the teachings of the heart. The more we learn things in the heart and from the heart, the sooner we forget the old things we have learned from the doubting and suspicious mind.</p>  </div>
