<p>He is not the same man<br /> I accepted as my divine Guru.<br /> The changes in his personality,<br /> Appearances and interests<br /> Have badly disappointed me.<br />            Alas!</p>
<p>He is not the same man<br /> I accepted as my true disciple.<br /> His sleeping heart,<br /> His doubting mind,<br /> His roaring vital life,<br /> His physical impurity<br /> Have sadly disappointed me.<br />            Alas!</p>
