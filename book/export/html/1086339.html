<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It all depends. If we use the will of our mind, it will not be very effective. It will not last. There is also the will of the heart, and of the vital. There may even be a physical will which comes from the subtle body. If we use the will of the vital, it may be aggressive rather than dynamic, and it may actually interfere with our progress. Even the heart's will may not be lastingly effective. Only the soul's will can inspire our aspiration with a burning flame. If we use the soul's will, then nothing can stand in our way.</p>  </div>
