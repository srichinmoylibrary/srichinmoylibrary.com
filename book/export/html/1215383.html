  <h1 class="book-heading">Corn or blueberry muffin?</h1>
  
 
<p>Early this morning, at five o'clock, I walked to Queens Boulevard. As I approached the courthouse, I became very thirsty. I said to myself, "Let me finish my two miles and on the way back I will eat or drink something."</p>
<p>I went to my two-mile mark and I was coming back. After 500 or 600 metres, I saw a man standing there selling doughnuts and drinks. At least two hundred people were standing in a queue in front of the courthouse. They were very polite; there was no screaming, no riot.</p>
<p>I was more thirsty than hungry. Then hunger also attacked me. I took an apple juice. Daily I drink apple juice. Then I saw some nice doughnuts. My favourite is coconut. Inwardly I was saying, "Here I am desperately trying to lose weight. How can I think of eating a doughnut? Yesterday I took a solemn oath not to go off my diet and now another hostile temptation-attack has come!"</p>
<p>But my hunger was too strong. I surrendered. I said, "Again, there is tomorrow. I will be serious again tomorrow."</p>
<p>So I took the drink and I was about to tell the vendor to give me a doughnut when I saw at another place five or six corn muffins. An American man and I were standing practically together. He said to me, "Let me take mine first."</p>
<p>But the vendor was an Indian like me. He said to me, "Take, my Indian friend."</p>
<p>I do not know who the vendor is, but he was Indian. Then the American said, "I, too, am Indian."</p>
<p>"Says who?" asked the vendor. Then he served me first.</p>
<p>I said, "I would like to have a corn muffin." There were five corn muffins and one blueberry muffin. The vendor said, "You are asking for a corn muffin, but you are pointing to the blueberry." I looked and I saw that he was correct.</p>
<p>Then the American said, "Look, he does not know the difference between corn and blueberry muffins!" That was my experience at around seven o'clock.</p>
