<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> I always do. The one thing I pray for is that everyone will compete well and that no one will get injured. That’s the only thing; everything else will take care of itself. As I told Narada a while back, when I compete I don’t really concentrate; I just let things flow. Narada said the power of concentration inspired me to come up and meditate here. I have been practising Christianity, but I haven’t been able to settle down and get into meditation, relaxation and concentration. That’s something I find very interesting. That’s one reason I'm glad to be here — so I can get a better grasp of these things.</p>  </div>
