    <title>Question: When somebody like Stu Mittelman or Yiannis Kouros or Fred Lebow says, &amp;quot;You know, if Sri Chinmoy were not doing this now, nobody would be doing it,&amp;quot; it is very impressive. They say it would be a huge loss if you ever stopped conducting these races. You do not respond to that at all? In other words, you might stop the events when your Inner Pilot told you to stop them, even if it meant the end of the ultramarathon?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This creation is not mine. It is God's creation. Again, I am absolutely sure that God does not want anything that is good to disappear from His creation. Today He has inspired me to serve ultra-distance running. But if He sees that I am not doing well, or if He has had enough experiences in and through me, then He can easily choose another instrument. But I am absolutely sure that God will not ask human beings to give up long-distance running.</p>
<p>"Run and become, become and run" â€” this is the motto of our Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team. Something that is good in God's creation will always last; it will only make progress. From time to time we may see setbacks, but eventually it is bound to flourish.</p>  </div>
