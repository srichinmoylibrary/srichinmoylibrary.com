<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The role of music in the spiritual life is extremely important and significant. God is the Supreme Musician, and His entire creation is His divine Music. At every moment we can be His conscious instruments. And spiritual music itself is an instrument to show us our universal Reality.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Then you agree with the traditional idea of man being a hollow bamboo flute that God plays?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, that is what we are all striving for â€” to be the instruments of the Supreme.</p>  </div>
