<p>This morning I did not warm up even for a minute. Only I took a shower. Then I said, “Now, God, save me!” First I used the seated double-arm machine and then I lifted 250 pounds in each arm. Because I did not warm up at all, I was warming up during my first three lifts. I was just pushing it. Then I lifted it seriously three times. All three were excellent. I was so thrilled with my performance. But I still feel I will be able to lift it one inch higher.</p>
<p>Then I went to my 300-pound dumbbells. Unmilan has kept them there on the side. Knowing that the camera would not work even if I lifted them, I was just trying them to get the feeling. I was just fooling around.</p>
