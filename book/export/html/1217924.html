<p>Sri Chinmoy has started a Course on the great Indian spiritual epic, the Bhagavad-Gita. The Course of lectures began on Tuesday, Feb. 13, 1968 with the Introductory Lecture, from which we have printed the three paragraphs shown on the opposite page.</p>
<p>The course will continue for eighteen weeks until June 18, 1968. Each lecture will deal with one chapter of the Gita's eighteen chapters.</p>
<p>Those who are interested are welcome to attend the Course. Lectures are held each Tuesday evening at 7:30 p.m.; the fee is Aspiration.</p>
<p>Aum Centre, Inc. 504 East 84th Street New York, N. Y. 10028</p>
<p>The Gita Course in Puerto Rico will be conducted by Miss Carmen Suro (Sudha). She is translating the whole series of lectures into Spanish for the Aum Centre, Puerto Rico, at 659 Miramar Ave., Santurce and she will read these out each Monday night along with the original English.</p>  </div>
