<p>What have I offered to my Beloved Supreme? I have offered my Beloved Supreme my soulful cry. What have I received from Him in return? I have received from Him His blessingful Smile.</p>
<p>What have I given to man? I have given man my loving service, my selfless service, my devoted service. What have I received from man in return? I have received from man his suspicion-night.</p>
<p>What am I offering to my Beloved Supreme? 1 am offering my Beloved Supreme my surrender-heart and my gratitude-life. What am I receiving from my Beloved Supreme in return? I am receiving from Him His Satisfaction-Sky.</p>
<p>What am I giving to man? I am giving man my determination-vital. What am I receiving from man in return? I am receiving from man his total indifference.</p>
<p>What shall I offer to my Beloved Supreme? I shall offer my Beloved Supreme my doubting mind. What shall I receive from my Beloved Supreme in return? I shall receive from Him His illumining Assurance.</p>
<p>What shall I give to man? I shall give man my sleepless, untiring body. What shall I receive from man in return? I shall receive from man his deliberate and endless ridicule.</p>
<p>Shall I stop serving mankind? No, never, for mine is not the way to stop. I walk along Eternity's Road, not serving man as such, but serving the Inner Pilot in each individual being.</p>
<p>The Inner Pilot is my own Eternity's All. Him to please in His own Way, in His creation, is my only goal. To love Him and serve Him, what I need is a fleeting aspiration-flame. To love Him and serve Him in mankind, what I need is Eternity's unconditional self-offering. My Lord Supreme, the Author of all Good, wants me to serve Him in all of His creation: in His desire-creation and His aspiration-creation, in His earth-bound creation and in His Heaven-free creation.</p>
<p>It is my bounden duty to love my Beloved Supreme and serve my Beloved Supreme in each member of His creation. Therefore, to the president of this international organisation, I wish to offer my soulful gratitude from the inmost recesses of my heart, for he has given me a golden opportunity to be of devoted service to the hundreds of sincere seekers present this evening. Nothing gives me greater joy, greater satisfaction, than to be of service to my Beloved Supreme in sincere seekers. Therefore, to you, dear president, I am extremely grateful, and to all the sincere seekers who are present here, I am offering my heart of soulful gratitude.</p>
