<p>If You but knew, Father,<br /> What I have done for You:<br /> Planted and raised a climbing tree<br /> For You to dance on its top, smiling free.</p>
<p>If You but knew, Father,<br /> What I have done for You.<br /> I have become the world's lowest slave<br /> Your Breath to serve in man, the grave.</p>
<p>"If you but knew, child,<br /> What I ever think of you.<br /> You are My Life's revealing<br /> Soul, You are My Vision's fulfilling Goal."</p>
