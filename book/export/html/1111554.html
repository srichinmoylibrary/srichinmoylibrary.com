<p>In today's race X very nicely surrendered. First she gave me a fight for one or two miles. Then I went ahead of her. I am so bad. Each time somebody was about to pass me, I looked around to see if X was coming. If I saw that X was not coming, I felt I was safe.</p>
<p>In the New Jersey marathon last week it was she who did not want to be behind me. She would increase her speed if I started to come up behind her. This time it was my turn to look around to see if she was coming.</p>
