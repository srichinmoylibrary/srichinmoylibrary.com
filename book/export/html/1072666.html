<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is possible. This is what mediums often try to do. It often happens spontaneously, especially in children. They speak to their parents and the parents observe that the children have a peculiar expression on their face, a different personality with a different way of expression. At that time the child is possessed by some other spirit.</p>  </div>
