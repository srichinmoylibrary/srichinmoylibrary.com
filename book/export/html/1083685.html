  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: How many paintings can God paint in an hour?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God can do countless paintings in a fleeting second. If He has to paint for an hour, then you have to multiply Infinity by Infinity. Now, will you or anybody be able to watch infinite paintings? It seems that nobody will be able to watch and appreciate countless paintings. God, out of His infinite Compassion, paints the number of paintings that can be watched and appreciated by the seekers and lovers of art so that they will not be totally lost in an infinite sea of paintings.</p>  </div>
