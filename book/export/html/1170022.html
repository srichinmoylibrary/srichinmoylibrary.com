<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can learn to conquer self-doubt by consciously asserting your faith in God and God's faith in you. Your faith in God will tell you that you will realise Him without fail. God's faith in you will tell you that God has already done everything for you. You have only to watch and enjoy.</p>  </div>
