<p>Today I lifted 300 pounds with one arm eight times. At one point the sign fell down and I had to replace it. Then I had so many things to think of — calling my sister and so forth — so I was unable to concentrate properly. In spite of that, I do not think I lifted 300 pounds this high twelve years ago. Grow older, become stronger!</p>
