<p>When I arrived back at the airport, the lady at the counter looked at my ticket. She saw that I was supposed to stay there for three days but I was leaving after one day. She said to me, "Why are you not staying here?"</p>
<p>I said, "I don't like this place at all." There was no sun, and it was dark and cloudy.</p>
<p>She said, "I don't blame you."</p>  </div>
