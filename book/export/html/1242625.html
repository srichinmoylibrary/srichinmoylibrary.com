<p><em>Governor Macias:</em> How did you bring running into your ministry?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A few minutes ago I was saying that we have to be instruments of God. I pray and meditate for God's inner Guidance and try to become a devoted, faithful instrument of His. According to my receptivity to His Will, I have entered into various activities in this lifetime. But if I say that I have done it, then I am the worst possible liar. Only I try to become an instrument and allow God to work in and through me and utilise me in His own Way. And whatever I do in this life is all due to His Grace and Compassion.</p>
<p><em>Governor Macias:</em> What is the value of running?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Running is of paramount importance because it is symbolic. Whether you run 100 metres or 20 miles, you always have a destination. In our inner life also there is a destination. We are all pilgrims, and from time immemorial we have been walking, marching and running along Eternity's Road with the message of love: love of God and love of mankind.</p>
<p>So physical running is a symbol of our inner running. Running means speed; running means inner courage; running means enthusiasm. Again, there is also a practical benefit to running. Running helps us keep the body fit. And only if our body is fit will we be able to get up early in the morning to pray and meditate. Only if we are physically fit will we be able to do all the things for God that we have to do in life. So I give the utmost importance to physical fitness. We are not aiming at becoming the greatest athlete. Only we want to keep the body fit so that we can do whatever we are supposed to do in our inner and outer life.</p>
<p>My students have told me about your kind hospitality and words of oneness. For that I am extremely, extremely grateful to you. We are in the same boat sailing towards the same destination.</p>
<p>[He offers the Governor the "Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart award.]</p>
<p>I offer this to people of inspiration and dedication to honour them for what they have done for mankind. I would like to present it to you.</p>  </div>
