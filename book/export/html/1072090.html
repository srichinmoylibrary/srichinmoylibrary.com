<p><em>Yogi:</em> God has no key-ring like we have. Since He has no fear of any kind of robbery, He leaves His keys on the street right after He has left His palace. Furthermore, He not only wants us to open His palace, but He also wants us to open His heart's door freely and constantly.</p>  </div>
