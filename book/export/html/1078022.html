<p>My eyes have betrayed me.<br /> They have told me<br /> That God is very far from me.<br /> Now I know that it is all false.</p>
<p>My mind has betrayed me.<br /> It has told me<br /> That God is for others and not for me.<br /> Now I know that it is all false.</p>
<p>My life has betrayed me.<br /> It has told me<br /> That it cannot hold God's heavy weight.<br /> Now I know that it is all false.</p>
