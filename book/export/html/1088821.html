<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you don't aspire, then you may or may not have physical health. But if one wants to be spiritually healthy, then one must aspire. If you aspire, then you won't worry; you will be happy. Your happiness will be reflected in your outer life and your outer life will have considerable strength.</p>  </div>
