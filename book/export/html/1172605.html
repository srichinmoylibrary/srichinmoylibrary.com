<p><em>(Surya’s room. Enter Vayu and Vishwakarma.)</em></p>
<p>VAYU: Surya, I have found the person who can help you.</p>
<p>VISHWAKARMA: Surya, I am the architect of this universe. I can take away enough of your brilliance so that my daughter will be able to live with you again. Here is my lathe. I shall grind off an eighth part of your brightness and power. This eighth will fall to earth shining and blazing. But before it touches the ground I shall transform it, I shall shape it. It will become three particular things. From this eighth part of your brilliance will come the discus of Vishnu, which is the Sudarshan chakra; the trident of Shiva and the lance of Kumara.</p>
<p><em>(Vishwakarma carves off a portion of Surya’s light. Vishnu, Shiva and Kumara appear momentarily, side-stage, with their weapons.)</em></p>
<p>SIURYA: You have saved me, dearest Father. You have given me another chance to live happily with my beloved wife. <em>(He touches Vishwakarma’s feet.)</em></p>  </div>
