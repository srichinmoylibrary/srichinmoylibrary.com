<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you go to New York on my birthday, it will be much more worthwhile for you. If you come on my birthday, then you will see all your brother and sister disciples. You will have their inspiration, plus the power of group meditation. There will be morning meditations almost every day, and other big meditations. There will be two weeks of spiritual activities every day, two weeks of joy and inspiration. But, if you go on your birthday, you will see only the local disciples. You will not get the strength of the long group meditations or the inspiration of multifarious spiritual activities every day.</p>  </div>
