<p>Pilgrimage, My Divine Pilgrimage.</p>
<p>My Beloved Lord, My Beloved Friend, My Beloved All. You have given me my simplicity. You have given me my sincerity. You have given me my serenity. You have given me my purity.</p>
<p>Simplicity You have given me so that I can start my pilgrimage along the road of my body-consciousness. Sincerity You have given me so that I can march along the road of my vital-dynamism. Serenity You have given me so that I can start my pilgrimage along the road of my mental vision. Purity You have given me so that I can start my pilgrimage along the road of my heart’s delight.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, You have also told me that my simplicity, sincerity, serenity and purity will reach their acme of perfection only when my heart’s gratitude flowers petal by petal, blossoming to perfect perfection. And for that what I need is constant self-giving — conscious, soulful and unconditional self-giving. In order to have conscious, constant and unconditional self-giving, what I need is a real approach to You — not as a beggar but as a lover; not as a beggar-destitute but as a lover-friend. If I approach You as a beggar, You will give me what I need or what I want. But my receptivity-vessel is so small that even if You give me what I need, it will not be much, it will be far from my full satisfaction. And if You give me what I want, it may not be the right thing. You will give me, but what You give me will ultimately be a source of true frustration and never a source of satisfaction.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, even if You give me an iota of what You want to give me, that very iota will not only please the real in me, the soul, but immortalise the human in me. The human in me is my human hope, my earthly hope. Hope before it bears fruit is nothing short of illusion and delusion — mental hallucination, to say the least. But even this very hope You will be able to immortalise. Once my hope is immortalised, I shall see my hope in the form of Your own Reality’s Vision, transcendental Vision, and Your own Vision’s Reality, universal Reality.</p>
