<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is kind to those people. He says, "Children, you are taking so much responsibility on your shoulders; you are shouldering My responsibility. Because you are carrying such a heavy load, you deserve a little bit of joy and encouragement. The most effective way to relieve you of some of this weight is to make you laugh: laugh at the world, laugh at your stupidity, laugh at your responsibility, laugh at everything. In that way you can relieve the burden that is on your shoulders."</p>  </div>
