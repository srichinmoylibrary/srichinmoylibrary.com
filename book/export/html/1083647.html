<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God does not get nervous because, unlike us, He is too smart. He knows that nervousness never pays. He does only the thing that satisfies Him well. There are quite a few things that really enchant Him: straightforwardness, determined will and love for all. Since God has these qualities in boundless measure how can He be and why should He be nervous of anybody or anything?</p>  </div>
