<p>Some were running fifty metres and walking fifty metres. You won't believe it, but three elderly men walked faster than I could run. I was running — "Huh, huh!" — and they were walking, but my running was not as good as their walking.</p>
<p>One of them was mischievous enough to laugh at me. He was laughing at me because I was running and he was beating me while walking. But after two miles I saw him; he had become so tired that he went to drink ERG or water, and he did not appear for a long time.</p>
