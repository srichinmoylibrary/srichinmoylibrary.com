<p>His is the life of a miracle maker.<br /> He started with himself.<br /> Himself he loved.<br /> Himself he caught.<br /> Himself he taught.</p>
<p>He has started teaching.<br /> Nobody passes through him unchanged.<br /> His life is a constant movement upward and inward.<br /> Doctrine he has none.</p>
<p>His heavenly beauty and God<br /> Live under the same roof.<br /> His earthly duty and God<br /> Live in the same room.</p>
