<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people say that they do not believe in God, but I wish to say that they do believe in something. We believe in God — that is the positive aspect. They believe that God does not exist — that is the negative side. But in the end, they will reach a particular place that is another extension of God. It is like electricity. There is a positive and a negative aspect. We need both positive and negative to get the light.</p>
<p>Right now we are caring only for the positive aspect of God, but if some people are caring for darkness, we shall not mind because we know that eventually they will come to the same light. A day will come, after a few years or a few centuries, when they will realise that something is missing in their lives. They will be miserable because they have no satisfaction. God is light. How long can one deny light? Those who do not believe in God feel that there is no light. But one day they will be sick of staying in a dark room. They will say, "How long can we remain in this place? Let us open the door and see the daylight. Then only will we be satisfied."</p>
<p>Having known the absence of light, these non-believers will sincerely love and adore the light. Once upon a time, perhaps we too were non-believers. That is why I always say that those who believe in God should show the non-believers utmost concern. If we speak ill of them or criticise them, it will only delay their progress.</p>
<p>In your family, when your children do not listen to you, you know that if you insult them, then they may take much longer to listen to you. But if you show them your concern, compassion and affection, then they will develop goodwill towards you, and they will listen to you long before they would have done otherwise.</p>  </div>
