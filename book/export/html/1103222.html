<p>Every day, with folded hands, I give these prayers for you, for humanity. I do this not for myself. I do it for all my spiritual children. I do not think about what I am going to say on any particular day. I just throw myself into the Universal Consciousness and identify myself with this person or that person. It is like plucking a flower from a garden. The flower that I like most, I take. I see that one particular prayer is most appropriate for that person on that day. Tomorrow I will identify with someone else. It is all oneness, oneness, oneness. Where my spiritual children are, I also am there. If you take me to hell, even there I will go, but with the hope that one day I will be able to bring you to Heaven.</p>  </div>
