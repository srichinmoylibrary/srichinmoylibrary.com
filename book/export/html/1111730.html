<p>I ran ten and a half miles before the San Francisco Marathon started. Then I was in the car while X and others started running the actual race. I watched them run for several miles. Then I ran six and a half miles in the marathon.</p>
<p>At the seventeen-mile point, Y said to me, "X is coming up behind you."</p>
<p>I said, "Let me enter into the car. Take me at least two miles ahead of her."</p>
<p>So Y took me about two miles in the car, but she couldn't go any farther because of the beach. Then I started running very peacefully. After that, I saw Z running in the other direction. Then I saw X coming from a different direction and she was shouting to Z.</p>
