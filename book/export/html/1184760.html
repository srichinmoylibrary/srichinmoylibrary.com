<p>His life was sick with desire.<br /> He knew no other thing but desire.<br /> But<br /> There came a time<br /> When even his desire-thoughts left him.<br /> Then he sang the song of separation.<br /> But<br /> In separation he still found no peace.<br /> He found peace<br /> Only in the heart of aspiration-cry-tree.</p>
