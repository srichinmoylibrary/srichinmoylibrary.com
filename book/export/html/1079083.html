<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This twisted feeling is nothing but an opening of the heart centre. Now the heart centre may take a few months or a few years or many, many years to open, but when you feel a kind of twisted feeling, a twinge, it signifies the inner opening of the heart centre. What causes the feeling? It is your inner aspiration. When you have intense aspiration, you will get that type of feeling inside the heart. It is very good. But this feeling that you get is not in the physical heart; it is inside the spiritual heart. So when you feel that kind of twisted feeling, it is a sign of tremendous progress.</p>  </div>
