<p>"He was the head coach of the 1968 U.S. Olympic team [in Mexico] that won more Olympic medals and established more records than any other team in history. He was an assistant coach at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and was voted track coach of the year in 1966. And he was meet director for two of the most successful track and field events in U.S. history â€” the 1960 Olympic Trials and 1962 U.S.-Soviet Union dual meet, both at Stanford Stadium."</p>
