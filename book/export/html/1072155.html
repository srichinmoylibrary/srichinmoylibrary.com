<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everybody has to have artistic capacity. Either in this incarnation or in a previous incarnation or in some future incarnation everybody will have artistic capacity. One form of artistic capacity is to be able to draw something or play some instrument. But life itself can also be an art. How sincere one is to oneself, how sincere one is to God, how devoted one is to Truth â€” that is also an art. That particular art is not denied to anybody. That art, which is the supreme art, everybody can have. The other kinds of art are like branches which branch out from the art that is the life-tree. If one particular branch has most delicious fruits or beautiful flowers, naturally it adds to the beauty and wealth of the tree itself.</p>  </div>
