<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> My drills are basically centred around bounding. I do just a few very small sprint or jumping drills. If you want to increase the strength of the quads, you have to go through the full range. I do a lot of weight and leg drills. Most of the ones I do are basic. I donâ€™t have any mysterious schemes or take any special vitamins. Everything I do is basically natural.</p>  </div>
