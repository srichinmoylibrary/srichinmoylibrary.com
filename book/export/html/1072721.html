<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> With the power of aspiration one can consciously enter into Sat-Chit-Ananda and bring down delight into the mind, vital and physical, provided one cares constantly for his Source. He has to feel that his Source is all he needs, he does not need anything else. He wants only the Source and nothing less.</p>
<p>We all know how affectionate our parents can be to us. When we are children, we feel our very existence depends on their kindness, their affection, their loving words, their smile. Always the child runs back to the source, the father and mother. Here our Source is Sat-Chit-Ananda. If we want to go back to our Source with loving joy, loving adoration for the Supreme, then without fail we can bring down the delight that we experience. When we either go deep within or climb high, higher, highest, we can bring down Peace, Light and Bliss and change the mental world in us, the vital world in us and the physical world in us.</p>  </div>
