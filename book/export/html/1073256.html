<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that time what you should do is to breathe in as slowly and quietly as possible and feel that around you and before you there is flowing a river of energy. If you see and feel this river of energy, try to bring it into your system. When the river of energy enters into you, your breath will flow continuously and spontaneously, without disturbing your meditation.</p>  </div>
