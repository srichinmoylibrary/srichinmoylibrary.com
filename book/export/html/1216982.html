<p>For the first time, I met with the President and Prime Minister of a country and the head of their spiritual community, all in a matter of two hours. This happened in Iceland.</p>
<p>First I met with the Prime Minister for about ten minutes or so. He had agreed to meet with me because some Members of Parliament had requested it. But he did not know anything about me. He asked so many questions!</p>
<p>The room where we met was simplicity incarnate. Even the mayors' offices that I have been to are all decorated very gorgeously. But this room was simpler than the simplest.</p>
