<p>I was running behind two ladies — an old lady and her friend. For a while I got stuck there. First I was behind them. Then I went ahead of them 15 or 20 metres. When the old lady saw I was going ahead of them, she couldn't bear it. She started running side by side with me. Then I started taking long strides. My knee was hurting me, and I said to myself, "Is it worth it?" Then I said, "Yes, it is worth it!"</p>
<p>Finally the old lady gave me a smile and fell back. Near the end I looked behind to see where she was, but I couldn't see her at all.</p>
