<p>The desiring man tells me that human life is full of difficulties. The aspiring man tells me that human life is full of opportunities. The self-giving man tells me that human life is God's constant Vision-Manifestation.</p>
<p>Each difficulty discourages and delays our success-life. Each opportunity encourages and expedites our progress-life. Each Vision-Manifestation of God helps us march faster toward our destined Goal.</p>
<p>Life is love, love is oneness, oneness is perfection and perfection is satisfaction.</p>
<p>Human life fails; divine life succeeds.</p>
<p>Human love binds; divine love liberates.</p>
<p>Human oneness is a rope of sand; divine oneness is at once birthless and deathless.</p>
<p>Human perfection disappears in the twinkling of an eye; divine perfection constantly transcends its own heights.</p>
<p>Human satisfaction is the fulfilment of our desire-life; divine satisfaction is the fulfilment of ourselves in and through the fulfilment of our Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Human satisfaction says, "My will must cover the length and breadth of the world." Divine satisfaction says, "Let Thy Will be done.</p>
<p>Human satisfaction is necessary as long as we care for the animal in us, the hungry wolf in us. Divine satisfaction is necessary only when we care for God for God's sake.</p>
<p>We start our journey with the desire-life. The desire-life helps to free us from the world of sloth, inertia and ignorance. Then we come to the aspiration-life. The aspiration-life helps us to reach higher goals, higher ideals and higher realisations. The self-giving life constantly makes us feel that we are of the One and for the One. Him to please in His own way is our sole choice.</p>
