<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Depend on your sincerity. If you see something, you can acknowledge it for what it is or you can just call it a mental hallucination. I am meditating in my highest. I am offering Peace, Light and Bliss in abundant measure, infinite measure. You are watching me and immediately you are seeing the reflection of God-Consciousness in me. My consciousness is changed to such an extent that you are bound to see that I am somewhere else. My face will radiate and you will see something inside me if you are meditating well. The other day one of the disciples meditated extremely well and received light from me. Then a visitor, who is not a disciple, asked her, "Is he your father?" She is my spiritual daughter, and she received so much light that a stranger said that we looked alike. Now, what kind of philosophical proof is needed?</p>
<p>Philosophy is in the mind; spirituality is in the heart. If you want philosophy, then you have to see something which you can easily define. If you want to define God with your mind, you will never be able to do it. You have to see God with your heart. If you use your mind, you will feel that I am showing off, rotating my eyes and all that. But if you use your spirituality, easily you will be able to see the proof. In this world the best proof is your own consciousness. If you come to a spiritual Master and meditate for a few minutes, you will see the difference in your consciousness. Let your sincerity be the judge.</p>  </div>
