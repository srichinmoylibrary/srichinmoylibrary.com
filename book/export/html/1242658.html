<p>This is my ninth visit to Cambridge, and my aspiration-heart and dedication-life received tremendous, boundless blessings from the soul and the heart of Cambridge University.</p>
<p>Each successive time my joy increases. This time my joy is limitless. This time I have accomplished something, by the Grace of my Lord Beloved Supreme, which is absolutely new. I was able to be inside one of the rooms where Sri Aurobindo actually studied. It was over a century ago.</p>
<p>If you have a spiritual connection, inner connection, you can feel Sri Aurobindo’s very Presence inside that room because of his Divinity which he unconditionally offered to the world at large.</p>  </div>
