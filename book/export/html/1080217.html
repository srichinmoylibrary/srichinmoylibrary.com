    <title>Question: When I meditate on my own, I take it as my own personal meditation. But I was wondering whether I should come here with the idea to meditate on the United Nations for the United Nations?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes we meditate for ourselves, for our own benefit and sometimes we meditate on others, or for others. But we have to know that even when we are meditating on others or for others, we are actually meditating for ourselves. Humanity is only our enlarged and expanded self. There is no difference between our meditation when we meditate for peace, light and bliss for ourselves and when we meditate for the soul of the United Nations to receive light, delight and harmony from the highest Absolute Supreme, because it is on the strength of our oneness that we claim the body, heart and soul of the United Nations as our own. There is no difference when we pray and meditate for others or when we pray and meditate for ourselves. If we have a wider outlook and larger vision, then no matter when we pray or where we pray or for whom we pray or meditate, it is all for ourselves. For all are part and parcel of our universal family.</p>  </div>
