<p>Vivekananda was a torrent of fire.<br />Tagore was a sea of beauty and delight.<br />Vivekananda was a Clarion-call.<br />Tagore was a soul-stirring Flute.</p>
<p>Both Narendranath (Vivekananda) and Rabindranath loved humanity much, the former speedily and the latter steadily.</p>
<p>Vivekananda says, in effect, "No time to linger. Awake, O India! and measure the loftiest Height with your dauntless head."</p>
<p>Tagore says in effect, "First look everywhere, and then to the Highest, O Ind, raise your proud head."</p>  </div>
