<p>What was wrong with Anupadi? She didn't run the two-mile race tonight at Flushing Meadow Park. I would have given her a very hard time in the race!</p>
<p>Then I saw her running on 150th Street. She was running by as Snigdha was coming out of her house.</p>
<p>Sandhani ran the race — very good!</p>
