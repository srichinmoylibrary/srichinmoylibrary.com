    <title>Question: I always expect that the light will subside when I want to withdraw from meditation; but it doesn&#039;t, and that is why I want to continue meditating instead of going to sleep.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What you are calling light is not real light; it is false light it is your mental conception of light. Real light will fill you with dynamic energy. It will bring you out of ignorance. If you are really receiving so much light during your meditation then you will be divinely energised and your body will not need as much sleep as I see you do need.</p>  </div>
