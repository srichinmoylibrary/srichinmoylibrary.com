  <h1 class="book-heading">Love</h1>
  
 
<p>With human love I try to see what I can do for others, and what others can do for me.</p>
<p>With divine love I see what God has already done for me in and through me, what God is doing in and through me for others, and what God wants to do for me in and through others. What does He want to do? He wants to smile in and through all of us the Smile of Oneness-Height and Perfection-Light.</p>  </div>
