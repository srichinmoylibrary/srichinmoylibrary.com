<p>ALONE WITH THE MASTER</p>
<p>When you are alone with your Master,<br /> You are not happy.<br /> You feel sad that nobody is there<br /> To appreciate you,<br /> To admire you,<br /> To consider you exceptional.</p>
<p>When you are in a group with your Master,<br /> You are not happy.<br /> You feel sad that you have to share<br /> Your Master's presence with others,<br /> His smile with others.<br /> You are one of the many,<br /> And in no way exceptional.</p>
