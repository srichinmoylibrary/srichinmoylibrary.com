<p>After I ran about four miles today, two little boys on bicycles came up behind me. One of them said to me, "I can easily beat you."</p>
<p>I said, "Fine!"</p>
<p>Then they passed me, and one of them turned around and shot me with a water pistol. Then they both rode away very fast. I thanked them.</p>
