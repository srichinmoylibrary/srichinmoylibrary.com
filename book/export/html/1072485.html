<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To some extent you have already conquered it. If you had not conquered the animal in you, you would not have become a human being. So let us say, how can you conquer the human in you, human weakness? Human weaknesses you can conquer only by paying all attention to the divine strength, divine capacity, divine potentiality within you. Always look ahead, look forward; do not look backward. From the animal kingdom you have already come to the human. But that is not enough. You want to enter into the divine kingdom. Always try to remember the divine in you, not the human. Then the human in you, which is imperfection, limitation and bondage, will leave you, or you will transcend it.</p>  </div>
