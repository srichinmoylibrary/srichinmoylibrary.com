<p>The difference<br /> Between<br /> Saying and doing<br /> Is this:<br /> Saying is man-power,<br /> Doing is God-shower.</p>
<p>The difference<br /> Between<br /> Giving and receiving<br /> Is this:<br /> Giving is the stamp of the individual man,<br /> Receiving is the stamp of the universal God.</p>
