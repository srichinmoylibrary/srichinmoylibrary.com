 <p>
Sri Chinmoy delivered these short inspirational talks during meditations that he held at the United Nations.</p>
<h2>The seeker in me</h2>

<p>The seeker in me says, “I wish to see God.” But do I not know that God is continually looking at me?</p>
<p>The seeker in me says, “I wish to love God.” But do I not know that God is continually loving me?</p>
<p>The seeker in me says, “I wish to give God my life’s best achievement: surrender.” But do I not know that God has already given me His Eternity’s best achievement: oneness?</p>
<p>Seeing is a two-way experience. Loving is a two-way realisation. Giving is a two-way perfection.</p>
<p>Experience makes us infinite. Realisation makes us eternal. Perfection makes us immortal.</p>
<p>Infinite is dream. Eternal is reality. Immortal is progress.</p>
<p>Dream is God the cosmic Seed. Reality is God the cosmic Fruit. Progress is God the universal and transcendental Tree.</p>
