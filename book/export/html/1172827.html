<p>Today is our Oneness-Dream-Boat-Shore Joy Day. We have practically two thousand divine “soldiers” in our Oneness-Dream-Boat-Shore Centres.</p>
<p>Out of two thousand, very few disciples from Oneness-Dream-Boat-Shore have been able come to New York over the years. Even when I went there, many disciples could not come to see me, because they could do only one thing; they could not do two things. If they had come to see me, they would not have been able to support the activities during my visit. They decided to send love-offerings instead of spending money to travel and see me. Some of them perhaps will never be able to see me in this life. This is their love for me; this is their heart.</p>
