<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I would like to say in all sincerity, instead of ‘recognition’, our term is ‘the manifestation of God’s Compassion’. Name and fame as such, what most of the world craves, is not what I want. Only I want the manifestation of God’s Will, to show that the spirit can be manifested in and through the body. Previously spirit and matter were separated. Matter was one thing and spirit was another. Spirit wouldn’t touch matter; matter wouldn’t touch spirit. Everything I have achieved is by virtue of my prayer, meditation and spiritual life. Now my Lord wants my prayer-life and meditation-life to work through my physical, earthly body in this way. So we use the term ’manifestation’. From my weightlifting, there will be many people who will be inspired to enter into the spiritual life. Again, spiritual people will be inspired to enter into the physical world. Otherwise, if one’s body is not fit, one cannot get up in the morning to meditate; one cannot do anything well.</p>
<p>The physical and the spiritual must go together. While transcending myself, if I achieve something unprecedented, then that is quite spontaneous. My goal is not to be a bodybuilder or a weight-lifter of the highest magnitude. If what I am doing is considered unprecedented, then it is well and good. But I will not aim at a world record as such. It is not that I will try to break a world record by hook or by crook — far from it! I will try to transcend myself. While transcending myself, it is up to the Will of the Supreme if I will do a little better than others have done.</p>  </div>
