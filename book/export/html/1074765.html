<p>He barks and barks;<br /> That is what he knows.</p>
<p>He bites not, he bites not.<br /> How can he bite?<br /> Since he knows not,<br /> Since he knows not.</p>
<p>He barks and barks;<br /> That is his self-styled role.</p>
<p>He bites not and bites not,<br /> That is his God-ordained Goal.</p>
