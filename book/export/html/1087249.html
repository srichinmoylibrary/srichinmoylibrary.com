<p>People can be so kind! I was buying a garment for A. at a store in Kuching, Borneo. The man said, "$90," but I said the price was too high. Then he came down to S70.</p>
<p>I said "$50."</p>
<p>After some time he said, "Yes, yes!"</p>
<p>Then I gave him $50 and left with the garment to go to another store.</p>
<p>While I was in the second store, the fellow from the first store came running up to me and gave me $35.</p>
<p>I asked, "Why?"</p>
<p>He said, "You gave me $50, but the price we agreed on was only $15!"</p>
<p>From the beginning he was saying $19, whereas I thought he was saying $90. Then when he said $17, I thought he was saying $70.</p>
<p>So he came running after me to give me $35 back. I looked at him and gave him a $10 tip. He was so happy with that $10.</p>
<p>How nice he was! He could easily have kept the $35.</p>
<p>While giving him the $10, I said, "It is time for me to visit the ear specialist!"</p>
