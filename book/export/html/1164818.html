<h2>5 January 1992</h2>

<p>Happy Birthday! most esteemed Sister Raisa Maximovna Gorbachev.</p>
<p>On this most auspicious occasion, I am praying to the Absolute Lord Supreme to grant you His choicest Blessings, Love, Joy and Satisfaction.</p>
<p>You are the only real Queen of the immortal Soviet Union that proudly embodies our Beloved President Gorbachev's unparalleled Hope and Promise. You are the only woman down the sweep of centuries to help her husband with the loftiest inspiration and the strongest encouragement to transform his dream-sky into his reality-sun.</p>
<p>To the extreme joy of the aspiring humanity, our President chose the 25th of December, (the day the Saviour Christ blessed the earth), to render his vision-flooded, historical resignation.</p>
<p>Our President is not dethroned. No, never! On the contrary, he is unquestionably and permanently enthroned inside the gratitude-heart-garden of the freedom-searching and peace-loving humanity.</p>
<p>O First Lady of the Soviet Union, I have read your book <em>I Hope</em>. Your book at once houses and reveals the Illumination of your radiant mind, the Aspiration of your blossomed heart and the Dedication of your self-giving life in a unique way. May we request you most fervently to enrich the Gorbachev-thirsty and Gorbachev-hungry world with many more successors of your <em>I Hope</em>.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>P.S. My very best greetings of the New Year to the President and all members of your family.</p>
