<p>“God, You have asked me to give away my toys to others. Not only my toys, but also many things, do I give away to people; and they take things from me gladly, but they do not say even one ‘Thank you’ to me.”</p>
<p>“My child, I am so sorry to hear that. Don’t worry, I shall scold them. But Aaron, I thank you twice every day.”</p>
<p>“God, when? Please tell me when You thank me.”</p>
<p>“I thank you, Aaron, in silence through your father, when you give him a most beautiful smile before you go to bed at night. I thank you in silence through your mother early in the morning, when you give her the most beautiful smile before you leave your bed.”</p>  </div>
