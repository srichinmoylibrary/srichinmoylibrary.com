<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fairies give joy: inner joy, outer joy. They give joy to sweet, innocent people through dreams. Sometimes, during meditation, they dance around. On a limited scale, they can fulfil wishes. They are always happy. They donâ€™t create any problems. They are divine to some extent. We have disciples who are very well-liked by the fairies.</p>  </div>
