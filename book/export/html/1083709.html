<h2>Question: Why do we like music?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We like music because it teaches us how to love, whom to love and why to love. How do we love? We love by self-giving. Whom do we love? We love God. Why do we love? We love because the divine lover in us has no existence of his own without feeling his oneness-reality with his Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Let us not try to understand music with our mind. Let us not even try to feel it with our heart. Let us simply and spontaneously allow the music-bird to fly in out heart-sky. While flying, it will unconditionally reveal to us what it has and what it is. What it has is Immortality's message and what it is is Eternity's passage.</p>  </div>
