<p>In the Inspiration Marathon last year, Chris' brother, Carlos, was behind me. I will never forget how all of a sudden I heard him scream, "Guru!"</p>
<p>At that time he stood fourth.</p>
<p>I will also never forget what happened four or five years ago on the course in Breezy Point. There he stood first in our four-mile race. Like a horse he was galloping! He is so short, but his stride was so long. Such a big stride! He was returning, and I had not yet gone half the way.</p>
