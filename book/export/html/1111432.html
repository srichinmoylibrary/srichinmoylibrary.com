<p>The other day at about five in the morning I was running near Flushing Meadow Park. A man stopped his car to ask me if there were any apartments available near there. What do I know about apartments? I said, "I don't live around here." He said, "Damn you!" No "Thank you!" or anything. He was so mad at me — absolutely furious. What was he doing at five in the morning looking for an apartment?</p>
