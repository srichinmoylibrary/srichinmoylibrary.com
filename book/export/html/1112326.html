<p><em>(The Abode of the ever-transcending Heights. The Absolute and the World-soul are having a conversation.)</em></p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> Father, Lord, Beloved, my All. What is wrong with You? I have always seen You as infinite Delight. You have always been the Source and Flow of boundless Delight. Today I notice blighted sorrow and chilled depression on Your Face. I beg of You a thousand times not to torment my heart's inseparable oneness with Your Universal Heart.</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> Stop, stop, you culprit!</p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> Father, my Lord, Beloved, am I the culprit? May I know what I have done?</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> Go deep within You and your daughter will immediately realise what you have done.</p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> My daughter, too? She is also a culprit?</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> She is a worse culprit!</p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> But Father, You have blessed me out of Your infinite Bounty with a number of daughters. Like me, which one has wronged You?</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> I tell you, the term 'wronged' is a shameless understatement. You and your England-daughter!</p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> What have we done?</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> What have you <em>not</em> done? And I tell you, one more person is involved. Do you want to know who she is?</p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> Yes, Lord, I do want to know.</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> She is your grand-daughter, America. Your daughter and your grand-daughter are constantly fighting, and most ruthlessly. Look what they have done! They have killed My Heart of Joy. They have killed all My unhorizoned inspiration. They are destroying My Vision's new creation. And you, you fool, you have done nothing!</p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> Father, I am not a fool. I am just weak.</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> You are not only weak but also stupid! During the day you swim in the sea of stupidity and during the night you swim in the sea of weakness. You can't even control your own daughter and your grand-daughter. What prevents you from throwing some illumining light on them?</p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> Father, I have tried. I am still trying. But neither of them is ready to listen to me. They are eager to fight and kill each other. Lord, I am helpless.</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> You are not helpless. You are useless, that's all. Listen, tomorrow at 5:00 a.m. sharp I want you and your daughter and her daughter here.</p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> Father, You have saved me. <em>(Clasping His Feet.)</em></p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> Not yet, you mountain-high fool, you sea-deep coward. Don't forget to come tomorrow!</p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> Father, I assure You tomorrow my daughter England, my grand-daughter America and I shall come without fail and place ourselves at Your all-fulfilling Feet.</p>
<p><em>Absolute.</em> Okay, okay.</p>  </div>
