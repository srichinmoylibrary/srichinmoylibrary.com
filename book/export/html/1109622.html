<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Philosophy does have consolation-power deep inside it. When people suffer from the injustices and other shortcomings of the world, at that time philosophy can offer consolation. Philosophy will tell us: “This suffering is unimportant. God’s Light from Above is all we need; we do not need anything else.” In this way, philosophy can console people who are in the philosophical world.</p>  </div>
