<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to unite the two is to convince the politicians that the political world, as such, has no peace and will never have peace unless and until it receives some illumining light from the inner world. This inner light, which has to come to the fore from the soul, is always for all who want to remain united and, at the same time, enjoy real freedom in co-existence and oneness-light.</p>  </div>
