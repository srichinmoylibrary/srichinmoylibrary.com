    <title>Question: If we stay in the same room all the time, then it is quite easy to keep our mind still. But when we have to work every day and deal with problems and people, it is quite hard to keep the mind still.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am telling you a secret. When you go to work, you get a salary at the end of the week. This money you use throughout the week to buy food and other necessities. Today you use a little money to buy some food. Tomorrow you will buy something else. Then, when the week is over you will get another paycheck.</p>
<p>In exactly the same way, you can get spiritual wealth from your morning meditation. This spiritual wealth comes in the form of peace, love, joy and inspiration. When you pray and meditate early in the morning, you get many divine qualities from God. This inner wealth you will keep inside your heart-pocket. Then, throughout the day when you are in need of peace or some other quality, you will draw on this inner wealth.</p>
<p>You are a science teacher. If one of your students is misbehaving or if you have a conflict with another teacher, immediately think of the time that you spent meditating early in the morning. Then the love and peace that you acquired will come to you as something very solid, and you will not be disturbed by the person who is bothering</p>  </div>
