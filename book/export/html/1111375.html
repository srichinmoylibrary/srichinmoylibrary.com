<p>In the race, the young children were the problem-makers. They had indomitable energy. As soon as I saw a child, I would say to myself, "I am surrendering." When children run, they don't know how to become tired. They smile, and their strides are so wonderful. They go this side and that side, running back and forth.</p>
