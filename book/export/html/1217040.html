<p>Then I went to the store next door to buy something else. At this store, the sales assistant was fatter than the fattest. And you cannot imagine how kind and how compassionate she was! She was speaking to me so kindly and compassionately. She made me feel that even if I did not buy anything, she would not mind. But I did buy quite a few things.</p>
<p>Then A wanted to buy some placemats. The young girl went outside the store to show A where to buy them. She was so kind to A.</p>
<p>So you see, my wish was fulfilled. In the first store I said, Perhaps if this girl had been a little fatter, then she would have been nicer to me." Then, in the very next store, a fat girl was so kind and compassionate.</p>
