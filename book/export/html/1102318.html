<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul of the United Nations has many, many divine qualities, but the most important quality that it wants to offer to the world is universal oneness. This universal oneness houses both the one and the many. At the United Nations the many have become one and, again, the one has become many. The United Nations is like a tree with countless branches. This moment the United Nations is the tree; the next moment it is the countless branches. A tree without branches is not a tree. Again, if the branches do not belong to a tree, they cannot exist.</p>
