<p>Desire was death. I discovered this supreme truth. Aspiration is life. I discover this sublime truth. Realisation is satisfaction. I will discover this unparalleled truth.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wrote good things; therefore, my Lord Supreme was pleased with me. He shook hands with me. Today I have good thoughts; therefore, my Lord Supreme is more pleased with me. He is blessing my devoted head and surrendered heart. Tomorrow I shall do good things; therefore, my Lord Supreme shall be most pleased with me. He shall bless me unreservedly.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was a power-hungry animal. Today I am a peace-hungry man. Tomorrow I shall try to become a love-hungry God.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was God-preparation. Today I am God-dedication. Tomorrow I shall be God-perfection.</p>
<p>I knock at God's Heart-Door because my sweet Lord has once shown me His Heart's Door.</p>
<p>I pray to God because my sweet Lord has once taken me into His Soul-Room.</p>
<p>I cry and cry for my Lord Supreme because my sweet Lord has once made me sit on His Silence-Throne.</p>
<p>I have seen God once; therefore, I wish to see Him again.</p>
<p>I have loved God once; therefore, I wish to love Him again.</p>
<p>I have surrendered to God's Will once; therefore, I wish to surrender my existence to God's Will again.</p>
<p>I know it will not be difficult for me to see God once again. I know it will not be difficult for me to love Him again. I know it will not be difficult for me to surrender my earthly existence to His Heavenly Will again. But there is something that will be extremely difficult for me, for I have not yet done it before. I have not claimed God as my own, very own, for it is difficult, extremely difficult, for me to claim Him as my very own. The day I claim God as my very own, He will proclaim me as His chosen instrument, His Dream-fulfilled Boat.</p>
