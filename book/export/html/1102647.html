<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My sense of perfection need not and cannot be the same as your sense of perfection. Everyone has to define perfection according to his own receptivity and his own realisation of the truth. But however we define perfection, it always has to include one thing: satisfaction. And what gives everyone satisfaction is progress, which is nothing less than self-transcendence. According to me, perfection is self-transcendence; perfection is constant progress, which is always transcending itself. It is in self-transcendence that we can get real satisfaction. And where there is continuous satisfaction, glowing satisfaction, illumining satisfaction, we have to know that that is perfection. Perfection is in the satisfaction that glows and grows inside our hearts.</p>
