<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people do not agree with us that aspiration and manifestation can go together. If they don't believe us, then I have to remain millions of miles away from them. If an individual says he does not believe in manifestation, that he believes only in aspiration, then he is not following my philosophy. If any of my disciples feel that they want only realisation and not manifestation, I wish to say that realisation is helpless without manifestation. They go together. Some people are more than eager and anxious to manifest, but a few have a wrong conception of our spiritual life. Let us feel always that aspiration and manifestation not only can but must go together. Like the right eye and the left eye, they both are needed. When both eyes function properly we can see the world. If one eye is defective, then we are half blind. Take aspiration and manifestation in that light. One eye is aspiration, the other eye is manifestation. We need both in order to be complete.</p>  </div>
