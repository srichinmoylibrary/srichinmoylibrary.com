<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My songs give such wonderful results because my songs are my inner experiences. Most of the experiences I get from you people. So they are really your own experiences. My inner experiences I get from you â€” from your heights, from your sufferings and from your joy. Your own experiences I bring to the fore and use for humanity. They are something of yours that secretly I have stolen. In your own way you do not know how to express them, but I do know how to express them. Therefore, when you receive or hear my songs, your inner being makes you feel something of your own, although your outer being is not aware of it. When somebody shows you or tells you about your own thing, you get tremendous joy. Your outer mind is not aware of it, but your inner being is fully aware of it.</p>  </div>
