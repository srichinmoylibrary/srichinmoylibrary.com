  <h1 class="book-heading">I wanted to bind you</h1>
  
 
<p>My sweet Supreme, I wanted to bind Your Power with my desire-life. I failed.</p>
<p>My sweet Supreme, I wanted to bind Your Peace with my aspiration-life. I failed.</p>
<p>My sweet Supreme, I wanted to bind Your Bliss with my dedication-life. I failed.</p>
<p>My sweet, sweeter and sweetest Supreme, I wanted to bind Your Love with my surrender-life. I failed.</p>
<p>Please tell me why I failed each and every time. Why, my sweet, sweeter and sweetest Supreme?</p>
<p>"My sweet child, my sweeter child, my sweetest child, you failed because you wanted to bind My possessions. You will succeed only if you bind Me and not My possessions."</p>
<p>My sweet, sweeter and sweetest Lord Supreme, then tell me what You are.</p>
<p>"My sweet child, my sweeter child, my sweetest child, I am My Infinity's Compassion for you. I am My Eternity's Concern for you and I am My Immortality's Love for you.</p>
<p>"If you can bind Me, then automatically you will be able to bind My possessions as well. But if you try to bind My possessions, you will never succeed and, at the same time, I shall always remain far, far, far, infinitely far away from you.</p>
<p>"Possess Me, claim Me and own Me with your oneness-light and oneness-height. Lo and behold, all My possessions will immediately become all yours."</p>  </div>
