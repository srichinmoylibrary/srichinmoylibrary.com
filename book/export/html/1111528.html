<p>Pratyaya is my best disciple. She stays behind me in all distances. When I collapsed after a few miles in the thirteen-mile race in Puerto Rico, she was still following me. So I gave her a ride in the car. But it seems that in the one-mile race I ran faster than she could run, so she could not run near me.</p>
