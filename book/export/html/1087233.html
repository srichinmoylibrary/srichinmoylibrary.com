<p>Some Indian shopkeepers show me such devotion! In one store I gave an Indian man $10, and he was supposed to give me $5 change. But I said, "I don't need the change. You keep it."</p>
<p>He followed me outside to the car with folded hands to give me back the money. He wanted to give me the full $10 back. I wouldn't take it, but later we found that he had slipped the $10 bill inside the car.</p>
