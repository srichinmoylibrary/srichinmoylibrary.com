<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is very unfortunate but true that a developed soul can be a witch. Somebody can be developed in purity, humility, or some other good qualities, but if he does not develop wisdom, then the danger is there. If a bad person invites someone who has purity and aspiration but no wisdom to come visit him, the other person may go and perhaps he will also become bad. So if wisdom is lacking, no matter how pure he was, he may do all kinds of undivine things. If a person is pure, that pure soul will become a better witch.</p>  </div>
