<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible for an advanced seeker or a great spiritual Master to experience constant delight in the inner world. For the beginner, however, it is only a passing experience. But one does not remain a beginner forever. A child grows up and, as a grown-up, he acts the way his father or his mother does. In the same way, it is quite possible that there will come a time when one can experience delight constantly. Again, if one is not sincere enough, devoted enough or spiritual enough, naturally delight will always remain a passing experience.</p>  </div>
