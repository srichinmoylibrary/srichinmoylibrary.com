<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is always advisable to concentrate on the Compassion aspect of the Supreme for our personal transformation or world transformation because it is the Compassion aspect of the Supreme that expedites our progress. If we concentrate on His Heart aspect or Delight aspect or Peace aspect or any other aspect, we may have in our mind the idea of give and take. We have given the Supreme a drop and now He may give us the ocean. Always there is a feeling of an exchange. He is infinitely richer and more powerful than we are. So if we give Him what we have, then He will give us what He has, which will be infinitely more. If we have that kind of feeling, then transformation will occur very slowly.</p>
<p>But if we approach the Supreme through His Compassion aspect, we feel that we are in no way adding to what He has or offering Him anything that He needs. Instead, we feel that we need our own transformation and world transformation and, out of His infinite Bounty, unconditionally He is giving this to us. If we have that kind of feeling, then our heart's gratitude will overflow and it will accelerate our progress. Gratitude is the fastest way to make individual and collective progress, and gratitude comes when we approach the Compassion aspect of the Supreme.</p>
