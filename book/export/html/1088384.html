<p>Bama had a close disciple who was in the habit of stealing. From time to time he used to steal money and material things that belonged to Bama. Once he stole a very large sum of money, and both the disciples and the Master were furious. Bama asked a lawyer-disciple of his to press charges against the individual.</p>
<p>The day the case was supposed to go to court, Bama quite unexpectedly came before the judge and pleaded with him to forgive the disciple.</p>
<p>The lawyer-disciple said, "You asked me to be so strict with him. We have filed the case, and today I am here with the judge. What will the court think of us?"</p>
<p>Bama said to his lawyer-disciple, "Rascal, do I have to be afraid of your court?" Then, pointing to the judge, he added, "Here is another rascal. It seems he is not going to listen to my request."</p>
<p>The judge knew Bama's spiritual power, so he said, "No, sadhu, I am at your command. The court listens to me, but I listen to you. You take back your disciple-thief."</p>
<p>The Master said to the judge, "I am so grateful to you, I am so proud of you. Now again, I can chat with my dear disciple. He has stolen my money, but who needs money? I need his devoted love and service."</p>  </div>
