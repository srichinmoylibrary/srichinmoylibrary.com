    <title>&lt;em&gt;Donna Halper:&lt;/em&gt; Sri Chinmoy will play another selection at the end of the program. I could listen to your music all day, I really could. Why is that music so relaxing? I&#039;ve heard music before, but it didn&#039;t relax me as much as that music. Is there something special about your music?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In my case, I do not just play music. I pray, I meditate, I contemplate while I am playing. I try to be in close communion with my Inner Pilot, who is the Supreme Musician. And according to my capacity of receptivity, I try to offer His Light and Peace to the world through my music. So when I play, the esraj is not the real instrument; it is I who am the instrument.</p>  </div>
