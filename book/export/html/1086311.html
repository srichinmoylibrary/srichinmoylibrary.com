<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you have received some light from your meditation, concentrate on your heart and feel that there is a magnet, a spiritual magnet, there. When you can feel that magnet, use it to pull all the lower vital sex forces from the navel centre up into the heart. Then feel that there is another magnet inside your heart which is facing in the opposite direction. With this magnet you will pull everything that is inside your mind down into the heart. Then feel that there is a third magnet in the crown centre, which is constantly taking everything within you beyond, beyond the physical consciousness. This third magnet will release all these undivine forces from the heart. When the vital is purified, sex forces will be transformed into dynamic energy, fulfilling and eternal strength, and you will get all kinds of divine power.</p>  </div>
