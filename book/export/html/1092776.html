<p>To me, a child of twelve in the hills of Lanka,<br /> The friendly captain of the nearby camp, Sengupta<br /> Hailing from Sonar Bangla of poetic dreams,<br /> Spoke of its heroes of science and letters,<br /> And gallant fighters for India's liberty:<br /> Bose the scientist, Bankim the novelist,<br /> Tagore the poet of infinite wisdom.<br /> But the hero of his heroes-and thus, indeed, mine too-<br /> Was none other than that man of steel,<br /> NETAJI who urged action while others chose words.</p>

<p>-From <em>Ma Väni Bilińda,</em> an autobiographical poem</p>
<p>written in Sinhala, Colombo, Sri Lanka, 1988.</p>
