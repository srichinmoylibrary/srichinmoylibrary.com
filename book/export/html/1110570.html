<p>Realisation is our discovery that we are not finite but infinite. In realisation, we come to know that it is inside the finite that the Infinite is playing its tune. Tagore, India’s greatest poet, said,</p>
<p><em>Simar majbe asim tumi bajao apan sur</em><br /><em>Taito eta madhur</em><br /><em>Amar majbe tomar Prakash</em><br /><em>Taito eta madhur</em></p>

<p>Inside the finite, O Absolute,<br /> You are playing Your own Tune.<br /> I am a tiny body;<br /> Inside my finite body,<br /> You play Your infinite Melody.<br /> That is why oneness is so sweet, so gentle.</p>

<p>God is both inside the Infinite and also inside the finite. But it is very difficult to imagine or to think of God when we see a tiny object, say a grain of sand. For us, to think of God inside that tiny grain is very difficult. But if we think of the Himalayas or something very majestic, then it is quite easy for us to think and feel that God is there.</p>
<p>When the Infinite plays through the finite, it uses the finite as its instrument. When the finite can claim the Infinite as its very own in the field of realisation and in the field of manifestation, then only can God the Infinite and God the finite — God in Heaven and God on earth — become totally fulfilled.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
