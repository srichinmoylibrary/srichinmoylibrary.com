<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, dark depression has been calling me for the last few months. My heavy mind does not allow me to do anything with <em>alacrity</em>. I need your advice badly.</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, just think that you are good, just feel that you are great, just realise that you are divine. Lo, the train of depression has gone. Lo, the plane of illumination is come. God now gives you a new name: <em>cheerful quickness and dynamism</em>.</p>  </div>
