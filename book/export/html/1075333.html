<p>Three times<br /> I looked for a hiding place.<br /> Alas, each time<br /> I failed.</p>
<p>First time<br /> I looked for a hiding place in God.<br /> God did not allow me<br /> To hide inside Him.</p>
<p>He said<br /> I am too restless,<br /> I would not stay inside Him<br /> For good.</p>
<p>He said to me<br /> That I have to<br /> Hide inside Him either<br /> Forever or never.</p>
<p>He knew that I would not<br /> Be able to stay inside Him forever.<br /> Therefore, He did not care<br /> To fulfil my prayer.</p>
<p>Second time<br /> I looked for a hiding place in man.<br /> Alas, it all ended in vain.</p>
<p>Man said to me,<br /> "I shall allow you to hide inside me<br /> On one condition.<br /> You have to offer me daily<br /> A sea of gratitude<br /> And<br /> A sea of plenitude."</p>
<p>I immediately told man<br /> That his demands were extravagant,<br /> Impossible and unthinkable.<br /> I left man with my transcendental disgust.</p>
<p>Third and last time<br /> I looked for a hiding place<br /> Inside Ignorance-sea.<br /> Lo, I have done it.</p>
<p>And nothing need I<br /> Offer my Ignorance-sea in return.<br /> Here I shall hide,<br /> I shall eternally hide.</p>
