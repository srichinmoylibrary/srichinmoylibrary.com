<p>I have never seen any disciple as happy, delighted and excited to see me while running as Mitali. Two days ago I was at my 400-metre mark and she was at the 500-metre mark. When she saw me, she started screaming with joy. I said, "Who can be screaming?" Then I saw her screaming and beaming with joy.</p>
