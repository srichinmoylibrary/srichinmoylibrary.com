<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In itself, the 27th has no special significance. Millions of cats and dogs were also born on that day. But if you identify yourself with me and my birthday, then the 27th will give you a kind of inner joy and your love, devotion and surrender to the Supreme in me may increase. Your own birth date also should make you feel happy. God wanted you to take birth on a particular date, so that particular date should make you happy.</p>  </div>
