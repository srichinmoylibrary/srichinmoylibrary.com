<p>My Lord,<br /> No matter how hard I try,<br /> No matter how many ways<br /> I kill myself to please You,<br /> I can never please You.<br /> Now it has come to a point<br /> That I am arguing with myself<br /> Whether I should continue trying<br /> To please You.<br /> Is it really worthwhile?<br /> "My child,<br /> I am sharing a top secret with you.<br /> I have been also doing<br /> The same thing.<br /> You have no idea how hard<br /> I have been working<br /> To make you happy.<br /> Alas, it is of no avail.<br /> But something within Me<br /> Is telling Me to continue,<br /> So I shall continue.<br /> And I am requesting you<br /> To do the same.<br /> I am sure there will come a time<br /> When both of us will succeed.<br /> As you know, our philosophy<br /> Is never to give up.<br /> So before long,<br /> We are bound to succeed."</p>
