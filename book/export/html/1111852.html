<p>The day before the marathon I was running on 150th Street. At about the 800-metre mark a dog came near me. The owner lifted his head and saw me. Then he became so excited. He shouted, "Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>Three days ago I was doing intervals — walking 100 metres and then running 300 metres. The same man saw me on 150th Street while I was walking. He asked me, "Why do you get exhausted so soon?"</p>
<p>He thought I was only walking.</p>
