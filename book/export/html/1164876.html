<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to maintain your present physique, which is quite strong, then I don't advise you to take candy bars regularly. On alternate days if you take candy bars, your soul will bless you and your heart will love your life more than it does now. So please your heart, please your soul. This is the only way you can become a perfect instrument of the Supreme.</p>  </div>
