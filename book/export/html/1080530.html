<p>My Lord's Name is Forgiveness. My name is hope.</p>
<p>To forgive the outer world I need peace. To forgive the inner world I need perfection.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is the seeker's immeasurable accomplishment in both the world of self-giving and the world of God-becoming.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is man's happiness-house. Forgiveness is God's Oneness-Home.</p>
<p>If you are deplorably weak, then you will sleeplessly remember, strongly harbour and ceaselessly suffer. If you are soulfully brave, then you will immediately forgive, completely forget and unimaginably prosper.</p>
<p>Forget the injustice-world. Forgiveness-joy will be all yours.</p>
<p>Cry for the world. Look, forgiveness-light is within your easy reach. Smile at the world. Look, forgiveness-delight is preceding you and following you.</p>
<p>Forgive the world. The world will sit at your compassion-feet. Forgive yourself. God will be dancing inside your meditation-heart.</p>  </div>
