<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes yes and sometimes no. People come to us and say they are victims of occult forces, but they themselves practised occultism or black magic. They don't have the power to control these powerful forces, so when the forces they are invoking come and attack them, they cry to me to save them. We have one disciple who said that her husband had hired a witch to attack her with an evil force. But actually she herself also used to practise witchcraft.</p>  </div>
