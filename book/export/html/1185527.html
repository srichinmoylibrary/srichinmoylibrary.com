<p>The client phoned up his lawyer and said: “What is going on? Give me the news.”</p>
<p>The lawyer said: “News? I have great news for you. Truth has at last won. You have lost the case.”</p>
<p>The client said: “I have some good news for you. You are a rascal, your father is a scoundrel, and your grandfather was a jackal, and your great-grandfather was a squirrel.”</p>  </div>
