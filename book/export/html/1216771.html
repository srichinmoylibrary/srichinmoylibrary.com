<p>When I was leaving the Kensington Royal Gardens Hotel to catch the famous plane, the Concorde, I waited for the porters for fifteen minutes. The porters were not coming, so I had to bring down three heavy suitcases myself. As soon as I came down, two or three porters came running towards me to help me take them to the car. But before that, when I really needed them, they never appeared.</p>
