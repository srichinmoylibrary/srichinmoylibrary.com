<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, meditation is for everybody whether he is consciously seeking God or not. But each one has to decide for himself how far he wants to go. Somebody can study only at the kindergarten level. Again, somebody else will go on to high school, college and university and get a Master's degree or Ph.D. Someone may be satisfied with an iota of inner wisdom, whereas someone else will be crying for boundless peace, light and bliss. So it depends on where the seeker wants to stop.</p>
<p>Just as we go to school for outer knowledge, we have to meditate in order to get inner wisdom. If the seeker wants to be satisfied with only an iota of peace, light and bliss, then he will get it. And if he wants to get boundless peace, light and bliss, then he shall also get that provided he continues to meditate regularly, devotedly, soulfully, unreservedly and unconditionally.</p>
