  <h1 class="book-heading">IV. Character</h1>
  
 
<p>Among the fearless soldiers that fight for your victory in life, character has no equal.</p>
<p>Character is the colossal hope of human improvement within and without.</p>
<p>Character is blazing sunshine in the soul's abode, the body.</p>
<p>A perfect society is built upon mutual trust. Character is the source of that trust.</p>
<p>He whose character is nothing need hope for nothing either in Heaven or on Earth.</p>
<p>Character is just what we inwardly are and outwardly do.</p>
<p>The secret of inner success is constancy to our highest character.</p>
<p>Character gives the key to open the most beautiful doors of life: Peace of Mind and Delight.</p>  </div>
