    <title>Question: My worst qualities are my impurity and impatience that brings bad temper to me. When we come to meditate with you and you look into our souls, do you get a general feeling of impurity or negativity, or do you know exactly if it has been bad temper or impurity?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I'll attempt to answer this question from many aspects and levels of consciousness. When I look at you plainly, I'm always five to fifty miles above your consciousness. At that time, I can easily feel and tell what your problem is. But when I go fifty miles or fifty thousand miles above your consciousness <em>(Sri Chinmoy demonstrates this by entering a higher state of consciousness)</em>, at that moment I go beyond duality. I see no impurity or purity. There is no you or him or her; there is only a vast expanse of light. There is only myself; you are all extensions of my own consciousness.</p>
<p>I am like a tree. I go fifty thousand miles high, but I have my roots here with you and I claim your consciousness as my very own. You cannot claim my consciousness, because you can't believe that it is also yours. What happens is you see only the body, only the form. You see my eyes move back and forth when I enter into my highest consciousness, and you see the expanse of light that is being focused through my eyes. But you do not feel that it is yours.</p>
<p>I am like a big bird that flies very, very high but whose leg is tied at your level. I can soar to my highest height, but still I am connected to you. When I am in my highest, at that time there is no form. I am formless. I am not this Indian. I do not see this imperfection, that imperfection. I see nothing bad; I don't even see good. It is all Light. I never see your body, never, never. If I looked at your imperfections, I would not have disciples. I deal only with infinite Consciousness.</p>  </div>
