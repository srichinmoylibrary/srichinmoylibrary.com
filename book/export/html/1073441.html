<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we pray and meditate, we give and receive; we offer and achieve. Right now we feel that ignorance is our possession. Although we say that ignorance is very bad, we don’t want to give it away. But we have to know that ignorance is not our real possession; our real possessions are Peace, Light and Bliss. During our prayer and meditation we should offer to God our false possessions and receive from God our real possessions. We should ask God to take what we have and what we are and to give us what He has and what He is. What we have is aspiration, the inner cry to become divine. What we are is ignorance. We ask God to take both our aspiration and our ignorance and to give us what He has and what He is: Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. When we breathe in, we can feel that we are breathing in God’s immortal qualities, and when we breathe out, we can feel that we are offering God our ignorance.</p>  </div>
