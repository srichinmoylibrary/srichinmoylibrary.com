  <h1 class="book-heading">A seeker’s experience-realities</h1>
  
 
<p>Aspiration-heart is within, dedication-hands are without. Illumination-mind is within, transformation-face is without. Liberation-vital is within, perfection-body is without. Realisation-man is within, satisfaction-life is without.</p>
<p>There are two inseparable and everlasting experience-realities: self-examination and God-manifestation. The more we examine ourselves, the sooner we manifest God within us and the sooner we expedite our God-journey.</p>
<p>Self-examination is a flood of light and God-manifestation is a sea of delight. This is what a seeker feels in the inmost recesses of his heart.</p>
<p>The human in a seeker changes from ignorance-night to knowledge-sun as he succeeds in his outer life and proceeds in his inner life. The seeker has come to realise that unless he sees the world constantly for God today, how can he see the world through God tomorrow?</p>
<p>Unless he acts for God today, how can he act with God tomorrow? Unless he speaks for God the Vision today, how can he speak for God the Reality tomorrow?</p>
<p>A seeker has come to realise that there are only two questions from time immemorial. There have been only two breathless and deathless questions: where is God? Who am I?</p>
<p>Where is God? God abides inside His Heart’s Gratitude-Room. God abides inside His Life’s Surrender-House.</p>
<p>And who am I? This is another question of paramount importance. Each seeker in his spiritual journey has to answer this question while he walks, marches, runs and sprints along Eternity’s Road. And the answer comes from the very depths of his heart, from the immortal receptivity of his heart: I am at once God’s eternal instrument and God’s infinite music. </p>
