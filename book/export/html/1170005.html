<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A child can be educated without losing his spontaneity and freedom only when the teacher consciously feels that God Himself is an eternal Child who does everything spontaneously by exercising His divine Freedom. And what is His divine Freedom? His divine Freedom is constant, conscious and unconditional Self-giving.</p>  </div>
