<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, I have a friend whose son is vociferous in his absurd statements with regard to the spiritual life. Please tell me, Chinmoy, if my poor friend can do something to change his son’s attitude?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, if your friend’s son is excessively loud and vocal in his silly statements about the spiritual life, then tell your friend that he has to be either more compassionate or more forceful in dealing with his son. One of the two medicines will surely bring peace to your friend.</p>  </div>
