<p>There were two friends. One friend said to the other:</p>
<p>“How is it that you seem to be so happy nowadays? Previously, you were so unhappy, so miserable.”</p>
<p>“I am so happy nowadays because God has taken my wife to take care of Him.”</p>
<p>“And who is taking care of you?”</p>
<p>“In the morning my conscience takes care of me. At noon my lower vital takes care of me. In the evening my frustration takes care of me, and at night my destruction takes care of me. And the following day, again in the morning, my conscience starts taking care of me.”</p>  </div>
