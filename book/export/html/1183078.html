<p>She was the Master’s first official secretary. She was extremely devoted to the Master while she was with him. However, she had two problems. First, her daughter failed to live a pure life, to say the least. She created many problems in the school where she studied, near Poughkeepsie. The Master did help the girl considerably in coming out of her vital life, but that was not enough for her mother. The mother wanted a radical transformation in her daughter. Also, she wanted the Master to use a special power so that her French husband would not beat her when he was drunk. Since the Master could not succeed totally in solving either of these two problems — the one with her husband and the one with her daughter — she disappeared.</p>  </div>
