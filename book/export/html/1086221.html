  <h1 class="book-heading">Complaint and solution</h1>
  
 
<p>I have received an open complaint, and I have an open solution.</p>
<p>Today a disciple told me that when two other disciples work together in a Divine Enterprise, they talk and talk and talk and talk. They ruin his concentration and his inner communion with his Guru while he is also working.</p>
<p>I wish to say that work is work. Work cannot be replaced by unnecessary talking. Please give importance to your work. When it is necessary, definitely you can talk. But unnecessary talking is not good, either for you or for others who do not want to lose their concentration or their love for work.</p>
<p>This request applies to all the Divine Enterprises.</p>
