<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is entirely a matter of love. When the developed countries offer their guidance, sometimes the less developed countries show a kind of unfortunate resentment. Some countries feel miserable that they are not already endowed with the qualities and capacities that they have been crying for. Their resentment is almost akin to a rebelling, sulking nature. When this occurs, the developed countries must invoke the qualities of earthly parents. They have to bring to the fore the parent-child relationship when dealing with the little members of the family who are at times unconscious, ungrateful or resentful.</p>  </div>
