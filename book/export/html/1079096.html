<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You cannot see me clearly sometimes because your meditation is not high. It is like cooking something. If someone is an ordinary cook, then one day he cooks well and the next day he cannot cook well because he is not an expert. But when this same person becomes an expert, he cooks extremely well every day. In the beginning, one cannot dance well; his steps all go wrong. Then a few months later, sometimes he dances perfectly, sometimes he does not dance well. But there comes a time when he becomes a great dancer and he always dances well. So here also, when you continuously pray and meditate, you become an expert. Then you are bound to see me clearly all the time.</p>
<p>A little child can crawl, but his aim is to stand up and walk. Right now he can stand up for one fleeting second and then he falls down. But he knows that his aim is to stand up and walk. Your aim is to see me clearly all the time; that is your goal. Like the child who wants to stand up and walk, if the goal is clear, then you are bound to reach that goal.</p>  </div>
