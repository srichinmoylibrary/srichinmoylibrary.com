    <title>Question: I have been told that we should meditate by using our heart. But when you talk about silence, it means to make the mind still. At that moment, how do we use the heart?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The followers of Lord Buddha try to silence the mind because the mind is like a restless monkey playing tricks at every second. Without silencing the mind, they cannot enter into <em>savikalpa samadhi</em> or <em>nirvikalpa samadhi</em>. But on our path we do not pay so much attention to the mind. Our way is to meditate on the heart and in the heart. The results will be the same. If you can make your mind calm and quiet, then you will get peace. Again, if you meditate in the heart, you will swim in the sea of peace. You can follow the path of the mind or you can follow the path of the heart. But you have to be in one boat. If you have one leg in this boat and one leg in another boat, then you will fall into the sea of ignorance. So you have to choose the boat and the boatman in which you have utmost faith.</p>  </div>
