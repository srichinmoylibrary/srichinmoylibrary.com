<p>Today something very significant took place. When I arrived at the airport, there were only 12 minutes before the plane was scheduled to take off. I went hurriedly to the last check point. As soon as I came near the door and saw the man who was in charge of checking, he came running towards me and grabbed my right arm powerfully. Then he embraced me and said, "Sri Chinmoy, you are a man of peace. The other day I got so much peace from your meditation at the Pan Am Games."</p>
<p>He asked me how old I was, and I said, "Forty-nine."</p>
<p>He said, "You look younger every year. I need peace. The world needs peace badly."</p>
<p>Then he asked me for my ticket. I had my ticket and boarding pass. But I was looking for my passport, because they always ask you for a passport when you are leaving Puerto Rico. He said, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>I said, " I am looking for my passport."</p>
<p>He said, "You are a saint. You don't need a passport. You are universal. A man of peace is universal."</p>  </div>
