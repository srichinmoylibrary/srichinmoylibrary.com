<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on who. You mean for yourself? Very good! The Supreme says that you can take 699 calories â€” during the whole day, mind you. For 699 calories a day He will take responsibility. More than that if you take, you will be responsible. And drink four glasses of water, at least! If you do this, then your health problems will be solved.</p>  </div>
