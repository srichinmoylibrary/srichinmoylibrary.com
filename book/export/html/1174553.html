<p>Why disbelieve in God?<br /> Many are doing so.<br /> You will be in the same boat as many others.<br /> The boat will be overloaded.<br /> Slowly, very slowly, it will sail.<br /> Believe in God.<br /> Very few are doing so.<br /> You will have very few fellow passengers.<br /> Yours will be a safe, smooth and speedy journey.<br /> Plus, the goal is certain.</p>
