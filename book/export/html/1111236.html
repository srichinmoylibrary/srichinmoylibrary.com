<p>One night I wanted to go for a sixteen-mile run. I started about 3 a.m. at Flushing Meadow Park and my road crew was following me in a car. After I had gone six miles, it started raining heavily. It was a real torrential downpour which lasted the whole night. But still I went on, went on, with my faithful crew.</p>
