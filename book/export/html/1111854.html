  <h1 class="book-heading">A Conversation with a seeker</h1>
  
 
<p>This morning during our 24-hour race at Francis Lewis High School, people were bothering me while I was walking along the track. One man stood in my way and said, "Are you running 24 hours?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He said, "Crazy! They are crazy people!"</p>
<p>Then ten minutes later he came back to me and asked, "This is a meditation group?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>Then he asked, "Are you connected with the meditation group?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>I thought the conversation was over, but a few minutes later he came back to me again and asked, "Are you the teacher?"</p>
<p>When I said, "Yes," he started trembling.</p>
<p>Then he said, "I am going to a class taught by one of your students. His spiritual name I don't remember, but his American name is Jeremy. He is very tall. I like his teaching very much. But right now I am in trouble. Can you help me?"</p>
<p>I said, "What kind of trouble?"</p>
<p>He said, "Just before I joined his class, I ordered Edgar Cayce's tapes. Now they have come, but I have not listened to any of them yet. I wonder if I should listen to the tapes or continue with the classes."</p>
<p>I told him, "Continue with the classes and at the same time listen to the tapes. Then make your choice. If my teachings give you more joy, then continue with the classes. But if Edgar Cayce's tapes give you more joy, then follow his path."</p>
<p>The man said, "Such nice advice! Thank you."</p>
