<p>While I was in Florida for the marathon, I went into a bookstore with Savyasachi. When I opened up a sports book, what did I see? The face of the little girl who lives next door to me in New York. Her soul appeared right in front of the page, looking at me. I said, "What is she doing here?"</p>
<p>Then when I came back to New York, as we were driving up to my house, she came out of her house and stood looking at me, not saying anything.</p>
<p>In Florida her soul came for my blessings, although outwardly I never talk to her.</p>
