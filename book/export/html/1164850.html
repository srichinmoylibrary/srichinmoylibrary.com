<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, you should get up immediately. At that time you should feel that God has knocked at your door. He is paying you an unexpected visit. When God comes and knocks at your door, if you don't respond immediately, He will go to someone else's door and your opportunity will be lost.</p>  </div>
