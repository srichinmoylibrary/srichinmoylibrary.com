<p>After my concert in the Cathedral last night, the soul of the church was very pleased and the heart of the church was very pleased. What more can I say?</p>
<p>Mother Teresa's soul did come. Then, when the disciples were singing the Mother Teresa song, Jesus Christ was dancing in front of me, saying, "She is my darling." He was pointing to Mother Teresa and saying, "She is my darling."</p>
<p>Mother Teresa had so many things to tell me and so many things to command me to do. The soul does not have to take a physical form when it visits us. But, in this case, the soul was wearing a white garment and Jesus Christ was also wearing white. The Christ is extremely, extremely fond of Mother Teresa.</p>
<p>About the Cathedral, I wish to say that the heart and soul I fully appreciate but something was missing. They could have used candles, incense and so forth. The Cathedral in Cambridge, even though it is part of a University, has absolute sanctity, sanctity, sanctity.</p>
<p>Prabhakar said that during the concert, he saw one of the boys who worked there sleeping under the nativity scene. At least it was not one of our boys. If they had seen Pulak there sleeping, who knows what might have happened!</p>
