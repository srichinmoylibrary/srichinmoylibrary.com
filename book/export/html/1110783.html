<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Love. Whom are you loving? You are loving the Supreme in each individual. When you love the body, you bind. When you love the soul, you free yourself. It is the soul in the individual, it is the Supreme in each human being that you love. Nothing can be greater than love. God is great only because He is infinite Love. If one wants to define God, one can define Him in millions of ways; but I wish to tell you that no definition of God can be as adequate as saying, "God is all Love." If fear comes into our mind when we say 'God', then we are millions and billions of miles away from God. When we repeat the name of God, if love comes to the fore, then our prayers, our concentration, our meditation and our contemplation are genuine</p>  </div>
