<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not like earth’s day and earth’s night. In Heaven also, wrong forces, undivine, hostile forces, attack; so you can call it night. Here, when undivine forces assail your mind, it is night. When divine forces surround you, it is day. Night means wrong forces that are not clearly progressing. Anything that is progressing is day.</p>  </div>
