<p>The day before yesterday I was running behind John in the 1,000-mile race. I said, "I will never be able to pass him."</p>
<p>But then I went ahead of him. I also went ahead of Trishul two times. I said to myself, "Can you believe it? Never did I think I would be able to pass these two excellent runners! I will give both of them very nice gifts."</p>
<p>Of course, Trishul had been running for four days. He is planning to complete the 1,000-mile race. And Jason had also run more than 200 miles by that time.</p>
