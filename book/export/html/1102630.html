<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only a slight difference between delight and bliss. Delight is like water; it flows and spreads like a liquid. Bliss is something thick and dense. It does not have the capacity to spread, nor does it want to spread. It has everything, and it stays in one place. But delight wants expansion, the expansion of its capacity. Also, in delight there is subtlety and transparency, for inside delight there is light in a flowing form. Light is flowing in delight.</p>
