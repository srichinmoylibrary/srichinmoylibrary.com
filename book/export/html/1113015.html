<p>On 30 April 1976, the United Nations Meditation Group welcomed members of the United Nations community to a special showing of Sri Chinmoy's art at the Jharna-Kala Gallery in New York's Soho art district. Following is Sri Chinmoy's reply to a special presentation by members of the Group.</p>
<p>This evening you are honouring the seeker in me. I am not a teacher; I am just a seeker and I shall always remain a seeker. Now here in the United Nations Meditation Group we are all seekers; we meditate on God, we pray to God to grant us out of His infinite Bounty peace in the outer world and peace in the inner world. I wanted to give a talk in response to the most inspiring offering that you have rendered to the Supreme in me. The singers have sung with their souls' aspiration and delight; the singers have conveyed my feelings about the United Nations infinitely better than I could have ever imagined. Therefore, I wish to offer to each seeker here something else which I consider to be the best in me, and that thing is my prayerful meditation. Just before I offer my prayerful meditation, I wish to say just a few words.</p>
<p>Greatness, goodness and oneness. Here at the United Nations, what the seeker in me observes right now is the message of greatness. Inside greatness there shall come a time when we shall hear the song of goodness, and there shall come a time without fail when inside goodness we shall see the dance of oneness. Greatness, goodness, oneness. We have started our journey with our inner cry, which we call aspiration, to become great. This is the first rung of our evolving ladder, which will ultimately reach the highest heights. The second rung is goodness. The third and ultimate rung is oneness. God, the Author of all good, will shower His devoted Blessings upon our surrendered heads and hearts, and at His Choice Hour He will teach us the significance of goodness. He has already taught us the message of greatness; now, at His Choice Hour, He will teach us the significance of goodness. Then finally He will teach us the dance of oneness. At that time, each aspiring soul in God's creation will fulfil God the absolute Truth, the transcendental Light, the universal Peace in His own way. On behalf of the United Nations Meditation Group, to each seeker present here I wish to offer my prayerful meditation, which is the only thing that I have and that I am in God's ever-fulfilling and ever-illumining Vision.</p>  </div>
