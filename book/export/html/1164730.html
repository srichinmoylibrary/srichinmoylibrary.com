<p><em>(Krishna and Arjuna are walking along the street. All of a sudden they see a man drawing a cart loaded with flowers.)</em></p>
<p>ARJUNA: Krishna, look! A man is drawing a cart loaded with all kinds of flowers. Are they not beautiful?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Yes, they are really beautiful.</p>
<p>ARJUNA <em>(to the cartman):</em> What are you doing with these flowers, my friend? Where are you going?</p>
<p><em>(The man pays no attention to Arjuna. He continues pulling the cart.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Exit cartman)</em></p>
<p>KRISHNA: Arjuna, let us follow him.</p>
<p>ARJUNA: That's a nice idea.</p>
