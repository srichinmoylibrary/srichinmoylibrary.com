<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In my case, as far as I can remember, it happened suddenly. Over the years, on rare occasions I did lift weights â€” once in a blue moon. But from the 26th of June of this year I have been regular. So it was a sudden inner decision. Of course, my decision is nothing other than obedience, immediate obedience, to my Inner Pilot.</p>  </div>
