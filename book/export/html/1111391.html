<p>As I was running, three young girls came and stood in front of me. They asked, "Can you please take our picture?" I was running, and they had to come and stand in front of me with an instamatic camera!</p>
<p>Since I have that kind of camera also, I didn't have any difficulty using it. They stood together and I took their picture. But that was not what they had in mind. They wanted something else. "We want you to be in the picture with us," they said.</p>
<p>So I stood with them, two at a time, while the other one took the picture. They know some of the disciples and they have been wanting to meet me for a long time. So they were all very happy and they thanked me.</p>
