<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, all parts of the being can create art just by appreciating something. As soon as we appreciate somebody or something, we are creating art. Our appreciation itself is a form of beauty, a creative capacity or a form of art. Our appreciation becomes an act of offering. Offering is creation and creation is art. Even in eating food, if we appreciate the food, immediately our appreciation itself is a form of art, because our appreciation is giving life to the thing that we are eating. Otherwise, it is all lifeless. When we see a flower, when we appreciate the flower, immediately we add beauty to the flower. If we use our third eye, we shall see that the flower is already beautiful; but the moment we appreciate it, our appreciation becomes an added life to the beauty of the flower itself. So every part of us, if we use it properly, can create a form of art.</p>  </div>
