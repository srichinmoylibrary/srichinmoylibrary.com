<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends entirely on your inner faith. If you meditate on my highest transcendental consciousness, you are bound to feel my spiritual presence. During your meditation, if you can feel that while I am in that consciousness I am all for you — for your spiritual success and progress — then your meditation will be extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Right now I am relaxed and answering questions, but you are trying to listen to me devotedly and you are seeing the spiritual inside the physical in me. Similarly, when I am physically absent and you are meditating on my transcendental picture, you have to feel the physical inside the spiritual. Then easily you can make progress.</p>  </div>
