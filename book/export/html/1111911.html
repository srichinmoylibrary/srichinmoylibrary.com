<p>In the Boston Marathon I ran for a while and then walked slower than the slowest. An old man grabbed me by the shoulder and said, "Your heart is working very hard. You have to drink!"</p>
<p>I said, "No, thank you."</p>
<p>But he said, "You have to!" and he forced me to drink.</p>
<p>Because I was tired, he sympathised with me.</p>
