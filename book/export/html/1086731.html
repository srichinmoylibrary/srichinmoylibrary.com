<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can see God if you pray and meditate when you are alive most devotedly and soulfully. When you die you don't actually die. Your body dies but your soul remains alive and always alert. At that time you are nothing but your soul. Now you are nothing but your body. When you are the body, you have to pray and meditate to see God. When you are the soul, you just spread your wings. Lo, you will see that God too has wings.</p>  </div>
