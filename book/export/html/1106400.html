<p>Today from a seated position I lifted 130 pounds with both arms together. This is great fun! As you know, that particular machine was made by Sumadhur and Bishwas. It is like the mechanics and the pilot. Without the pilot, the mechanics cannot fly the plane. And without the mechanics, the pilot cannot fly. So Sumadhur and Bishwas are the mechanics and I am the pilot. We cannot do each otherâ€™s jobs.</p>
