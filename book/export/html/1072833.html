<p>My dear Supreme, my sweet Supreme, my Beloved Supreme, I talk too much, too much, too much. My Eternity's Supreme, how is it and why is it that You do not change my nature? How and why?</p>
<p>Not only do I talk too much; what is worse, I literally die for a listening ear. And as if that were not enough, I also want to give advice to each and every soul on earth, with no exception.</p>
<p>When I give advice, I expect appreciation and admiration from everybody. I expect everybody to extol me to the skies. Alas, nobody pays any heed to my advice. Nobody needs or appreciates my advice. Yet I go on talking and talking, giving advice to each and every human being on earth.</p>
<p>I also advise the members of my earthly existence â€” my body, vital, mind and heart. But they do not listen to me either. I even advise my soul. I advise my soul-bird not to leave this beautiful cage called the body, for if it leaves this cage, then I shall die. I want to be immortal. I want to remain on earth forever and forever.</p>
<p>I even dare to advise You, my Beloved Supreme. Lord, O my Eternity's Lord Supreme, I know You have many names, whereas I have but one name. Since it is not fair for You to have many names while I have only one, I beg of You to have only one name. If You cannot agree to my proposal, if You do not listen to my advice, then please have only two names. More than two names I do not want You to have, especially for me. Your two names will be Compassion-Sun and Forgiveness-Ocean. When I need compassion, I shall call You Compassion-Sun. When I need forgiveness, I shall can You Forgiveness-Ocean. These are the two names I would like You to have from now on. All Your other names will no longer be used by me.</p>
<p>O my dear Supreme, O my Lord Supreme, I have advised You time and again. Now is the time for me to beg You to grant me a most special boon. I do not want to remain an idle talker any more. I wish to become an active doer. Finally, I would like to become a selfless lover. Then I shall love You with my self-giving heart, with my self-giving life and with my self-giving oneness-existence.</p>  </div>
