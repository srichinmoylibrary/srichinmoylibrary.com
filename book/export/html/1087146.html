<p>In Australia, A, Kishore and I went to an Indian restaurant. From the window we could see that all the food was already cooked.</p>
<p>When we went inside, they drew a screen around the kitchen so they could tell us that everything was being cooked fresh. They were delaying like anything â€” just pretending they were making it fresh.</p>
<p>After ten minutes I told them that we had already seen the food cooked and to please give it to us. They didn't deny it; they just laughed and gave us the food. Otherwise, they would have kept us waiting an hour, pretending that they were cooking it.</p>
