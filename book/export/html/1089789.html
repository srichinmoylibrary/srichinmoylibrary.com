<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are quite a few ways to develop one's intuition. The easiest way is to remain in the heart, become one with it, and cry and try to become what the soul has and what the soul is. You have to enter into the heart and cry for the soul, cry to have the soul and to become the soul. If you can remain in the heart and feel that the heart is a child who is all the time crying to become as good, as divine, as perfect as the mother or father, the soul, then automatically you develop the power of intuition.</p>
<p>This way is very easy and, at the same time, most effective. It is for beginners and for those who don't want to go through austere discipline in order to develop intuitive power.</p>  </div>
