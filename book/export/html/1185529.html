<p>A young man knocked at a door. The lady of the house came out and said: “What can I do for you?”</p>
<p>The man said: “Please do me a favour. Please call up the police and ask them to arrest me.”</p>
<p>“Why, what have you done wrong?”</p>
<p>“I have done something really wrong.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I am in love with your soul. Since your soul is inside your body cage, since it is in a prison, I feel that I also should live in a prison cell, because I don’t want to lead a better life, a freer life than you do. I want to be imprisoned as your soul is imprisoned.”</p>  </div>
