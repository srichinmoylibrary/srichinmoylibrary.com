<p>Today, my bad luck started right from early in the morning. I have two pairs of running shoes, but they were all inside the car. So I was running in my tennis shoes. My tennis shoes are heavy. They kept striking the ground while I was running, hurting me like anything.</p>
<p>I ran five and a half miles. Then I said, "Why run anymore?" Then I walked two miles.</p>
