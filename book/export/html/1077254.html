<p>Incredible, but true. During the post-War decade from 1946 to 1956, the immortal runner ran 50,000 miles during his training. Who else is entitled to the supreme honour of being called the "Czechoslovakian train."</p>
<p>Brave he was, courageous he was, soulful he was, spontaneous he was. Therefore, it was possible for him to cover such frightening distances. Scientist he never was, but a new vision dawned on him. Therefore, he was able to be the pioneer runner in interval training.</p>  </div>
