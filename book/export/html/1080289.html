<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we invoke purity, all our vital problems can be solved. Purity, purity, purity. Purity is so important in the seeker's life. Nothing is as important as purity. Every day you should meditate on purity. If you practise breathing, every time you breathe in, try to repeat "Supreme" seven times. If you can't do it seven times, then you do it three times. When you are breathing out, again repeat "Supreme" three times. Each time you breathe in, if you can say "Supreme" three times, you will feel that you are bringing down universal Purity into your physical system. And while you are breathing out, feel that you are breathing out all your rubbish and ignorance. It helps considerably.</p>  </div>
