<p>The Self-Division of the Supreme proclaims the birth of creation.</p>
<p>Creation is the descent of Consciousness. Creation is a never-tiring march. It marks the beginning of an inner and outer development.</p>
<p>What is evolution, if not a veiled determination of an apparent unconsciousness seeking conscious formation and growth?</p>
<p>Nature is the evolving phenomenon, while Consciousness is its guide in evolution. At each stage, nature transcends the limits of its own species and presses forward to new conquests.</p>
<p>The real development and progress of life must always sit at the feet of the Dynamic Divine and not at the feet of the Static Divine.</p>
<p>In the march of ablution, each period has a demand of its own. Each incarnation of God fulfils that very demand.</p>
<p>Our self-division can play, at most, with the divided selves of the Supreme and never with the Supreme's inseparable Oneness.</p>
