<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am very grateful to you, for you have given me the opportunity to be of service to so many of your countrymen. Thousands and thousands of people will have the opportunity to see that my heart of oneness is sincere and that I have come to serve all the people of Davao through my prayers and meditations.</p>  </div>
