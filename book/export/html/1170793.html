<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is your way of thinking. I am not flattering you, but when you come here, I see that your aspiration is quite high â€” right from the very first day. I do not want others to be jealous of you, but when I see you in New York I am very pleased, very pleased!</p>
<p>Before you come to New York, if you have problems with your consciousness, just try to imagine as often as possible, during the day and at night, that you actually are here with us in New York. Only think of Aspiration-Ground and of your Guru; dream of everything in New York that inspires you. Physically you are still in your country, but inwardly and spiritually you will already be in New York. If you do this, it will solve your problem.</p>  </div>
