<p>We have already possessed the body-consciousness but we have not yet possessed the soul-reality. If we know what the United Nations truly is and what it stands for and what it can do to serve, illumine and fulfil mankind, then only we can embody fulfilling hopes for tomorrow’s dawn.</p>
<p>U Thant, the United Nations pilot, while most successfully steering the United Nations boat, voiced forth during a United Nations Day address in 1964: <em>“The United Nations... is simply an Organization, serving all nations but dominated by none, which has the continual obligation to avoid disaster and misery and to provide for a better and more productive future for all peoples. The emergence of such a mechanism is both a great step forward and a historic challenge. This is, indeed, an idea to possess men’s souls.”</em></p>  </div>
