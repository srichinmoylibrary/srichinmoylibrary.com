<p>A few days ago I was at Victory Field walking very slowly by the discus area. A man was there talking to his friend. As I passed by, I heard him say, "I believe in God. God speaks to me. And I believe in Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>First he tells his friend that God speaks to him, and then he says he believes in me. I do not know him or his friend, but still he believes in me. Can you imagine!</p>
