<p>A woman had been asking her husband to buy new clothes for himself. He was very miserly, so he would not buy them. Finally the wife said, “If you do not buy new clothes today, I am going to buy something for you which you have to wear.”</p>
<p>The husband said, “Your taste and my standard do not go together. We are not one in our selection. Your taste is very bizarre.”</p>
<p>The wife got mad and said, “Your taste is very poor. Only a beggar could wear the things that you buy for yourself.”</p>
<p>“ I am a beggar?” asked the husband. “So what is wrong with that? When you buy anything for me, it is extremely expensive and I don’t like it at all. It is so fancy that I don’t like it.”</p>
<p>The wife said, “All right, but today you have to buy something because there are many respectable people in your office. I don’t want you to continue going there in torn clothes.”</p>
<p>In the evening the husband returned from work without anything new. He said that he had to work late in the office, so he didn’t have a chance to go shopping.</p>
<p>The following day the wife went and bought him a pair of trousers and a long-sleeved shirt. She was so happy because she felt they were very beautiful. She planned to tell lies about the cost, saying that they were not so expensive, so her husband would not be mad at her. When the husband came back in the evening, the wife was so eager to show him her gifts. When the husband put on the long-sleeved shirt, he saw it was too long for him. The sleeves were even covering his fingers. He said, “It is too long for me.”</p>
<p>The wife said, “Don’t worry, don’t worry, it will be all right. You will grow taller. Once you grow taller, it will fit you.”</p>
<p>Then the husband said, “The neck is too tight.”</p>
<p>The wife told him, “If you wear it a few times, then automatically it will stretch. You neck is so powerful that each time you wear it, it will stretch.”</p>
<p>He said, “But the trousers are too big. They are so loose. What will I do with the trousers?”</p>
<p>“I have always told you,” said the wife, “to eat more. You are too thin, too skinny. If you eat more, then they will fit. So everything that I got you will fit. It is just a matter of time. Look how beautiful these things are!”</p>  </div>
