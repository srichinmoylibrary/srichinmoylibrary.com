<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are all God’s children. God has created us precisely so He can give us what He has and what He is. But we need to have the inner hunger. He who is hungry will eventually be fed. But if one does not have any hunger, then he won’t eat. So who will go to feed him? When somebody is thirsty he looks around for water. If he is not thirsty, he remains where he is. In the spiritual life also, he who has an eternal, sincere thirst for Light, Truth and Bliss will eventually have his thirst quenched.</p>  </div>
