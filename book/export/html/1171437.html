SCA 954-961. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in Curitiba, Brazil on 27 December 1999.</p>
<h2>Question: Could you please say something about Sahadeva from the Mahabharata?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sahadeva of the Mahabharata was a palmist. He had occult power also to some extent. He was not an excellent archer, but he was very, very wise. Both of the twins, Sahadeva and Nakula, were very close to Arjuna. Being the youngest brother, Sahadeva received utmost affection from their mother, Kunti. Nakula was very, very beautiful, and Sahadeva was extremely wise.</p>
<p>When Draupadi was humiliated by the Kauravas, Sahadeva was the first one who wanted to fight and defend her honour. He was extremely fond of Draupadi, so he wanted to fight and destroy the Kauravas. Arjuna, Bhima and Nakula were unwilling to disobey Yudhishthira, but Sahadeva came forward. He wanted to destroy the Kauravas.</p>
<p>All the brothers cherished Sahadeva because he was the youngest. When they were in exile in the forest, their mother Kunti suffered so much for Sahadeva because he was her youngest son.</p>
<p>One personal experience of mine I can relate. In this life I am very fond of Arjuna. When I was five years old, I was supposed to play the role of Sahadeva in a play. At our stage rehearsal I had such trouble. The organisers forced me to wear a dhoti wrapped like a girl's sari. It was too much for me. I was crying and crying, "Why do I have to wear a sari?" The following day, during the performance, I had only one line to say. On the stage I completely forgot the line. Nervousness attacked me ruthlessly. I was supposed to say that line to Arjuna. Arjuna prompted me to say the line, but still nothing was coming out. This was how I performed Sahadeva's part. That was my five-year-old experience. The director was my cousin, who was extremely fond of me.</p>  </div>
