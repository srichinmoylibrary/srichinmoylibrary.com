<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to get illumination, you have to know that illumination is already there inside you. By practising Zen, you can bring this illumination to the fore. What is within will eventually come without; it is true. God is there within us but we do not see Him, we do not feel Him. By practising spirituality, Yoga, we bring Him forward and try to see Him and feel His presence in all our multifarious activities. In the inner world we have everything, but in our outer life we have not yet been able to bring it forward. In the inner world we have Peace, Light and Bliss in abundant measure. In the inner world we have illumination; in our outer life we do not have it. So when you practise Zen or follow any other path, you have to know that it is the inner awakening, the inner reality, that you are trying to bring to the fore.</p>  </div>
