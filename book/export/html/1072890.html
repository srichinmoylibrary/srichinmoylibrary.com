<h2>Question: I see you wearing yellow and that, in a way, signifies Gautama Buddhaâ€™s teaching. He said that the soul would come back with an immediate incarnation.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, Gautama Buddha did not care for reincarnation. In his philosophy, once you enter into Nirvana, then the cycle of rebirth is finished. Once you have entered Nirvana, you do not care for reincarnation. The Lord Buddha did not care for reincarnation. He simply said that once you enter into Nirvana, then your role is finished. But other spiritual Masters do want to come down into the world again to serve humanity.</p>  </div>
