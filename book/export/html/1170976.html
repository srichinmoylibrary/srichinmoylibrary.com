<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, souls have done this. The soul easily can and does end its relationship with another soul. In one incarnation, two or three souls may come into the same family but in the following incarnation, the souls may not keep any connection whatsoever. One may be reincarnated in Africa and one in France, and they may not keep any outer connection.</p>  </div>
