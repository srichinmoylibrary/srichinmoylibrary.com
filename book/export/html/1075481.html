<p>Father, I think of You so much,<br /> Do You ever think of me?<br /> "Daughter, I do think of you.<br /> But I think of you in My own Way."<br /> Father, I meditate on You so much.<br /> Do You ever meditate on me?<br /> "Daughter, I do meditate on you.<br /> But I meditate on you in My own Way.<br /> Father, I love You so much.<br /> Do You love me?<br /> "Daughter, I do love you.<br /> But I love you in My own Way."<br /> Father, what will happen<br /> If You once please me in my own way?<br /> "Daughter, if I please you<br /> In your own way,<br /> Your little 'I' will be overfed and fall sick<br /> And die before it gets its own Illumination,<br /> And<br /> Your divine Self will starve,<br /> And remain unmanifested.<br /> Further, this will engender<br /> My immediate death."</p>
