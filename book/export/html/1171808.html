<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A real spiritual Master is he who has inseparable oneness with the Highest. On the strength of this oneness, he can easily enter into the seeker, see his growth and development and aspiration, and know everything about his inner and outer life. Then, if you want to be under the guidance of such a Master, his silent gaze will teach you how to meditate. The Master does not have to explain outwardly how to meditate or give you a specific form of meditation or a <em>mantra</em>. He will simply meditate on you. Your soul will enter into the Master's soul and bring the message, the knowledge of how you should meditate, from his soul.</p>
<p>Outwardly, I have given very few disciples a specific way of meditation. But I have a few hundred disciples, and most of them know how to meditate. How do they learn? When I meditate at the Centres or at public meetings they see something and feel something in me. And what actually sees this? It is their souls. Their souls enter into my soul and learn from my soul, and then with this wisdom they teach the disciples how to meditate.</p>
<p>All real spiritual Masters teach meditation to their disciples and admirers in silence. When a genuine spiritual Master meditates, Peace, Light and Bliss descend from above and enter into the sincere seeker. Then automatically he learns how to meditate from within.</p>  </div>
