<p>During the seven-mile race today, one man was with me for the entire time. I followed him and he followed me.</p>
<p>After three miles he took two glasses of ERG and offered one to me.</p>
<p>At one point, he went five or six metres ahead of me. I said, "Where is he going?" Then I ran fast and caught him.</p>
<p>He finished just a little ahead of me.</p>
<p>Then he shook hands with me and said, "It was such an honour to run with you."</p>
