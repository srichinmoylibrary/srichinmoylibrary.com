<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In graveyards and in cremation grounds too, you can see how ghosts and evil forces fight and scream at night. People who live nearby can hear them.</p>
<p>The place where we went the other day for a picnic — <em>X</em>’s house — I saw many evil forces. Many people have committed suicide on that estate. Usually there are ghosts and evil forces moving around in an area where people have committed suicide.</p>  </div>
