<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He went to Puri and a few other religious places where he studied the Sanskrit language and Indian scriptures. In Benares he studied Indian languages. In Chittagong there is a temple where they believe the Christ spent a number of years. Three or four other places in Chittagong he was also said to have visited, and his belongings remain there. But whether Jesus Christ came to India or not is of no consequence to the real seeker. For the seeker, Christ's place is not in a country but inside the heart. If you are a seeker, you have to find him not in Bethlehem or India but inside your heart.</p>  </div>
