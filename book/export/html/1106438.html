<p>Yesterday I tried lifting 250 pounds with each arm for the first time, and my second and third attempts were successful. Unfortunately, I did not use the video. Today was my second day with this weight.</p>
<p>When I made my first attempt, the camera started clicking and then it ran out of film. But both the dumbbells did move considerably.</p>
<p>When I was making my second attempt, A. came and I invited her to sit down and watch.</p>
<p>My third attempt was absolutely the best, specially the final push.</p>
