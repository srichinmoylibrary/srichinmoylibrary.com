<p>I was showing a video of myself lifting 340 pounds. On the tape there was a section where the actual weight was 110 although the sign next to it mentioned 340. The disciples had taken off some of the plates in order to weigh them.</p>
<p>I saw how easily I lifted the 110. Not long ago, I would make such loud sounds while lifting this kind of weight. Now, I am lifting 230 pounds more than this.</p>
<p>Then Agraha said, “Guru, in another year you will be lifting 700 pounds, and 330 pounds for you will be like lifting a feather.”</p>
<p>The Supreme was definitely speaking through Agraha.</p>
