<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My talk was based on my own inner experiences, my own inner realisation. I was born a Hindu, so you can say that my religion is Hinduism. Others will say that. But I wish to say, being a spiritual man, that I welcome all religions as my own. And at the same time, being a lover of God, a seeker of the infinite truth, my inner Being compels me to say that I transcend all religions. Each religion is right, absolutely right in its own way, but when one cries for the highest Ultimate truth, at that time God becomes his only religion.</p>
<p>So in my case, what I have said is on the strength of my own inner experiences and realisations.</p>  </div>
