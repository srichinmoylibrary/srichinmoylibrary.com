<p>One day while running, I was talking to myself in Bengali, in my Chittagong dialect: "I can't go any farther."</p>
<p>What could I do? I was dying! I kept saying, "I won't be able to go any farther."</p>
<p>Then, a child about eight years old came up to me and said, "Don't talk. It will make you more exhausted. Don't talk."</p>
