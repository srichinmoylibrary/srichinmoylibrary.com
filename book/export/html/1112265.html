<p>This morning one lady got a little bit mad at me. She wanted to know the time, but instead of asking me, she was just pointing to her left wrist. I did not understand what she wanted. She was just pointing and pointing. What could I do? Then she got annoyed. I did not know why she was angry. Then afterwards, when I walked away, I realised what she meant. She did not have a watch. I also was not wearing a watch.</p>
<p>This happened when I came to the Grand Central Parkway Service Road and crossed Parsons Boulevard. She was standing on the corner waiting for a car or something. She was pointing to her wrist, but I did not understand what she was asking. I have such funny, funny experiences when I go out.</p>
