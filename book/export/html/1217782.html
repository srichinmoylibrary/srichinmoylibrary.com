<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> By thinking of God's all-pervading consciousness. This consciousness is not something that we have to achieve. This consciousness is already within us and we have just to be aware of it. Further, while we are in meditation we have to develop it and illumine it infinitely. In the meantime, to our wide surprise, the ego will be buried in the bosom of death.</p>  </div>
