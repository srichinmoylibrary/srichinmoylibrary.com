<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. I am not in a position to tell society that it is making a mistake because society is not paying special attention to me; it is not following my path. If it followed my teachings I would be in a position to tell society "This is the Truth." For those who do not believe me, why should I interfere in their way of approaching Truth? Society has a particular method of approaching Truth. Hippies have the belief that they know a better truth. I have my own way of approaching Truth. I think that in this world instead of trying to correct somebody, the best thing that we can do is to try to correct ourselves.</p>  </div>
