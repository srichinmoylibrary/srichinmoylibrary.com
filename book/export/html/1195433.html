<p>Who says<br /> That joy is not available<br /> On earth?<br /> Just ask a self-giving seeker<br /> Of the Absolute Supreme!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195435" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9702</h1>
  
 

<p>Remember, it is God's world.<br /> No matter how many times<br /> You displease Him,<br /> He may still keep you with Him.<br /> For after all, even poor God<br /> Does need some instruments.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195436" class="section-2">

<p>When you think you are responsible<br /> For yourself,<br /> You create tremendous confusion<br /> In the mind<br /> And tremendous frustration<br /> In the vital.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195437" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9704</h1>
  
 

<p>How to inspire others<br /> When inspiration deserts you?<br /> Speak of the bright sunny days,<br /> Which you have seen countless times<br /> Inside you.<br /> Perhaps others have never had<br /> Even one sunny inner day.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195438" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9705</h1>
  
 

<p>There are so many ways<br /> To see the divine in yourself<br /> And not the undivine.<br /> Do not think of<br /> What you were yesterday<br /> Or even what you are today,<br /> But only of what<br /> You want to become tomorrow.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195439" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9706</h1>
  
 

<p>You want to know<br /> Who is your real friend?<br /> Ask your heart.<br /> Your heart will tell you<br /> Who can inspire you,<br /> Who can help you<br /> Run the fastest.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195440" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9707</h1>
  
 

<p>O seeker,<br /> Who can be more fortunate<br /> Than you?<br /> For the Lord Supreme feels<br /> It is His bounden Duty<br /> To become better acquainted with you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195441" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9708</h1>
  
 

<p>If you ask the question<br /> Who is right and who is wrong,<br /> The only answer is:<br /> Our Beloved Supreme is always right<br /> And our ignorance is always wrong.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195442" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9709</h1>
  
 

<p>Man's attachment to man<br /> Binds man.<br /> Man's devotion to God<br /> Liberates man.</p>

<div id="node-1195443" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9710</h1>
  
 

<p>You think I am foolishly enjoying<br /> Mental hallucinations<br /> Because I feel I need God.<br /> I think you are a rank fool<br /> Because you think you do not need God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195444" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9711</h1>
  
 

<p>Employ your inner will<br /> To identify itself<br /> Not with dry imitation-prayers<br /> But with warm aspiration-dedication-days.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195445" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9712</h1>
  
 

<p>As everybody has to leave,<br /> He will also one day leave<br /> This earth.<br /> But he will be able to say<br /> That he left something<br /> For both Heaven and earth to treasure:<br /> His Transcendental Consciousness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195446" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9713</h1>
  
 

<p>You fool,<br /> Do you want God to pay the penalty<br /> Like you?<br /> By fulfilling your desires<br /> He will only delay His Manifestation!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195447" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9714</h1>
  
 

<p>If you are meant to do something great<br /> For God,<br /> Then the desire-life is not meant<br /> For you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195448" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9715</h1>
  
 

<p>If God wants you to manifest His Light<br /> In a certain way,<br /> Rest assured He will provide you<br /> With the necessary opportunities.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195449" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9716</h1>
  
 

<p>Alas,<br /> Your soul cannot do anything for you.<br /> Even God cannot do anything for you!<br /> Why?<br /> Because you do not have any obedience<br /> To the Divine Will.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195450" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9717</h1>
  
 

<p>Every morning ask yourself<br /> If you are ready to remain obedient -<br /> If not unconditionally,<br /> Then cheerfully;<br /> If not cheerfully,<br /> At least reluctantly.<br /> If you want to stay<br /> In the Golden Boat of the Supreme,<br /> Your last resort is reluctant obedience.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195451" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9718</h1>
  
 

<p>Only if we are insincere<br /> Can we fool ourselves<br /> Into feeling that we have done<br /> More than we were supposed to do<br /> For God and man.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195452" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9719</h1>
  
 

<p>When he failed to obey<br /> His inner world,<br /> He saw that the world outside<br /> Was waiting for him.<br /> Alas, he was more than prepared<br /> To become a member<br /> Of that outer world!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195453" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9720</h1>
  
 

<p>Poor God<br /> Has been getting a series<br /> Of most deplorable experiences<br /> From His spiritual children.<br /> Now He wants you to bring Him<br /> Encouraging, inspiring<br /> And illumining experiences.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195454" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9721</h1>
  
 

<p>If a seeker neglects<br /> His God-ordained task<br /> And deceives the world,<br /> He is only adding more pain<br /> To God's Heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195455" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9722</h1>
  
 

<p>Be cheerful!<br /> You will get a lion's strength.<br /> Immediately you will be able<br /> To throw aside the burden of your past:<br /> The elephant of depression,<br /> Frustration and failure.</p>

<p>Once upon a time<br /> He was an excellent instrument.<br /> But alas,<br /> Obedience and enthusiasm<br /> Left him<br /> And he only descended and descended.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195457" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9724</h1>
  
 

<p>God's instruments may fail<br /> One by one,<br /> But God's Manifestation<br /> Will still succeed,<br /> For new passengers will arrive<br /> Who will be able to please<br /> The Supreme Pilot<br /> In His own Way.</p>
  </div>

<div id="node-1195460" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9727</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1195461" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9728</h1>
  
 

<p>It may take centuries,<br /> But I shall one day definitely become<br /> An unconditionally surrendered seeker<br /> Of the Lord Supreme.</p>

<div id="node-1195462" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9729</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1195463" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9730</h1>

  <h1 class="book-heading">9733</h1>
  
 

<p>If you hesitate<br /> In your aspiration-life,<br /> Then God is never going<br /> To make you a candidate<br /> For His Satisfaction-Crown.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195467" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9734</h1>

<div id="node-1195483" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9750</h1>
  
 

<p>Although it is an unfair trade,<br /> My heart is more than willing<br /> To offer its light to my mind<br /> In return for my mind's darkness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195484" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9751</h1>
  
 

<p>You do not have to convince<br /> The spiritually blind<br /> That there is light on earth.<br /> Let them remain<br /> In their self-styled darkness.<br /> But offer more and more illumining light<br /> To those who are awakened<br /> And have a little God-Vision.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195485" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9752</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1195488" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9755</h1>
  
 

<p>O my mind,<br /> Do you know what you have done?<br /> You have taken away purity's breath<br /> From my life<br /> And sincerity's light<br /> From my heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195489" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9756</h1>
  
 

<p>Because you are a seeker,<br /> The world rightfully expects<br /> Your soulful and devoted service.<br /> Your sincere service will contribute much<br /> To the harmony and peace<br /> Of the world.</p>

<p>When he asked God to fulfil his desires,<br /> He took God's Silence<br /> As His Approval.<br /> But God was only waiting<br /> For his foolish desires to go away.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195494" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9761</h1>
  
 

<p>An irony of fate:<br /> His cheerful obedience<br /> Has turned into<br /> Powerful disobedience,<br /> Because God has not pleased him<br /> In his own way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1195495" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9762</h1>
