<p>Dear Ramona:<br /></p>
<p>You have written to me that your daughter constantly asks you for money, while your son constantly demands time from you. You need my advice. I wish to tell you that you should give money to your daughter when she <em>needs</em> it, and that you should give your son time when he <em>demands</em> it. Otherwise, you will suffer for the rest of your life from your daughter's lack of love and from your son's lack of knowledge.<br /></p>
Your wisdom-giving friend,<br /> Chinmoy<br /><em>Jan. 12, 1969</em><br />  </div>
