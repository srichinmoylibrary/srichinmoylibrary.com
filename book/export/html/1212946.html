<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, among your friends and acquaintances does anybody think that it was just a <em>caprice</em> that took you away from the Eastern shore to live on the Western shore?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, if anybody thinks that it was a <em>mere whim, an abrupt and unmotivated decision</em>, and not an express Command from my Inner Pilot, the Supreme, then I am afraid my sweet and devoted Western spiritual children — not to speak of my fanatic disciples — will, without fail, sue that person in the Supreme’s Supreme Court.</p>  </div>
