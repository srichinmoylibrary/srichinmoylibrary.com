  <h1 class="book-heading">A knife fight in south Brooklyn</h1>
  
 
<p>This week I ran along the New York Marathon route twice, going by car to different sections of the course. The first time, we went from the start to the thirteen-mile point so that I could run all the hills. Between the eighth and ninth mile is the worst hill. It is 1,200 metres long.</p>
<p>When I was in South Brooklyn, between the third and fourth mile, I saw a Puerto Rican gang that had been challenged by a black gang. The blacks were coming from behind me, and the Puerto Ricans were coming toward them. There were about four or five on each side, and I was running in between them!</p>
<p>The blacks had on the proper uniform — all black. I was wearing a dark navy blue sauna suit that also looked black.</p>
<p>One of the Puerto Ricans showed the blacks such a big knife! I just smiled to myself and kept running, because I knew that the knife was not meant for me. The boys on the road crew also saw the knife. Dhanu got the shock of his life. What an experience!</p>
