<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Politics, as such, does not enter into our work. But we do feel that politics can be illumined by spirituality and raised to a very, very high state of consciousness. We pray and meditate to purify our mind. The mind constantly creates confusion, doubt, worry, anxiety and so many other problems for us. We believe that when the mind is purified and illumined, it will become a perfect instrument for bringing about a better world. We do not use politics as such, but on the strength of our sincere prayer and meditation, we try to bring into politics the light and the bliss that we have obtained here so that the political world can also be illumined, perfected and fulfilled.</p>
