<p>Yesterday was the time for me to sympathise with the suffering humanity. Today is the time for me to express my genuine concern for the bewildered humanity. Tomorrow will be the time for me to offer my loving service to the desiring humanity. But now, now is the time for me to express my oneness-heart with the hungry humanity.</p>
<p>Sympathy, concern, service, oneness-heart: these are the real members of my inmost family, and these members of my inmost family I wish to share with the rest of the world, with God's creation, with God the Creation.</p>
