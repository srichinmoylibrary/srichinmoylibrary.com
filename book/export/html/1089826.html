<p><em>Francisco Matos Paoli:</em> And what do you believe of evil?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In our philosophy we don't see it as evil. We see it as limited reality. Anything that is limited creates problems for us. But if we see something as evil, then our mind becomes polluted, the mind becomes dark.</p>
<p><em>Francisco Matos Paoli:</em> There is no existence of evil?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, there is only limited light. One person will have tremendous light and wisdom, while another will have less. But if we say that the one who has less light is evil, then we are making a mistake. A child does not have the knowledge of a university graduate, but he has the capacity to gain that knowledge. Just because the child does not have the knowledge and cannot read college books, can you call him an uneducated, illiterate fool? No, you have to allow him to grow up and get the same opportunity. Gradually, gradually, over the years he will go to primary school, high school, college and university and get the same knowledge. Anything that has very limited light we tend to see as evil, but it is only at the beginning of the gradual process of evolution of our reality.</p>  </div>
