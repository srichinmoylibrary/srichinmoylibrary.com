<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the Supreme Himself is the driver, then He usually sticks to His command because He feels that if He Himself does not listen to His own command, who will? But if anybody else is driving, if His chauffeur divine is driving, then the Supreme asks that person, if necessity demands, to go over fifty miles an hour, for the Supreme believes in the theory that every rule admits of exception.</p>  </div>
