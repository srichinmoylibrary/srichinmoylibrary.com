  <h1 class="book-heading">VII. Has your soul a special mission?</h1>
  
 
<p>Your soul <em>has</em> a special mission. Your soul is supremely conscious of it.</p>
<p><em>Maya</em> (Illusion or Forgetfulness) makes you feel that you are finite, weak and helpless. This is not true. You are not the body. You are not the senses. You are not the mind. These are all limited. You are the soul, which defies all time and space. Your soul is infinitely powerful. Your soul is infinite in every way.</p>
<p>Now, can you ever realise your soul? That means, can you be fully conscious of your soul, and be one with it? Certainly, you can. In fact, you are nothing other than the soul. It is your soul that represents the natural state of consciousness. Hence to realise the soul is not impossible. But doubt makes it difficult. Doubt is the fruitless struggle of man in the outer world. Aspiration is the fruitful confidence of the aspirant in the inner world. Doubt struggles and struggles. Finally it defeats its own purpose. Aspiration flies upward to the highest. It reaches the Goal at its journey's end. Doubt is based on outer observation. Aspiration is founded on inner experience. Doubt ends in failure because it lives in the finite physical mind. Aspiration ends in success because it lives in the ever-climbing soul. A life of aspiration is a life of peace. A life of aspiration is a life of bliss. A life of aspiration is a life of divine fulfilment.</p>
<p>To know what your special mission is, you shall have to go deep within. Hope and courage must accompany you in your tireless journey. Hope will awaken your inner divinity; courage will make your inner divinity flower. Hope will inspire you to dream into the Transcendental; courage will inspire you to manifest the Transcendental here on earth.</p>
<p>To feel what your special mission is, you have always to create. And this creation of yours is something which you ultimately become. Finally, you come to realise that your creation is nothing other than your self-revelation. True, as many as there are souls, so many are there missions. But all missions fulfil themselves only after the souls have achieved some degree of perfection. The world is a divine play. Success depends on each participant. The role of the servant is as important as that of the master. In the perfection of each individual part is the collective fulfilment. And at the same time, the individual fulfilment is perfect only when the individual has realised and established his inseparable connections and relations with all human beings of the world.</p>
<p>You are one from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head. Yet at one place you are called ears, at another place you are called eyes. Each place in your body has a name of its own. Strangely enough, although they all belong to the same body, one cannot perform the action of another. Eyes see, but they cannot hear. Ears hear, but they cannot see. So, the body being one, yet it is many. Similarly, although God is one, He is manifesting Himself through many forms.</p>
<p>And God will tell us our mission. But we do not understand God's language, so He has to be His own interpreter. When others tell us about God, they can never tell us fully what God is. They misrepresent, and we misunderstand. God speaks in silence. Also He interprets His message in silence. Let us also hear and understand God in silence.</p>
<p>Has your soul a special mission? Yes. Your mission is in the inmost recesses of your heart and you shall have to find and fulfil it there. There can be no external source for the fulfilment of your mission. The deer grows musk in his own body, in a certain part of his stomach. He smells it and becomes enchanted. He tries to locate its source. He runs and runs. He cannot find the source. In his endless search, he loses all his energy and finally one day he dies. But the source for which he was so desperately searching, was within himself. How could he get it elsewhere?</p>
<p>Such is the case with you. Your special mission — which is the fulfilment of your divinity — is not outside of you, but within you.</p>
