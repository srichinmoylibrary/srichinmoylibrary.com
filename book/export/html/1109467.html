<blockquote>
<p>"The best use of life is to spend it for something that outlasts life."</p>
<p>â€” William James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, what is something that outlasts life? Before I answer this question, I wish to add something to it. My final question is: What is that something that outlasts life for the longest period of time? We have seen that man's inner hunger for the highest Truth outlasts life. But there is only one thing that outlasts life for the longest period of time, and that thing is called sacrifice. Sacrifice is by far the best of all immortal treasures on earth and in Heaven.</p>  </div>
