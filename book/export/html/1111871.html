<p>Most people I saw running in Japan were very short, and their strides were also very short. They were very slow.</p>
<p>After I came back, the soul of Japan came to me and said she was so grateful that I had come to Japan. She said for that she would grant me a boon: "In this incarnation you will be able to run a marathon in under three hours."</p>
<p>I laughed.</p>
