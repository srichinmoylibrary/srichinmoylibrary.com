<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Indian tradition says that if you sleep during the day, a snake will bite you. But I am of the opinion that people should take rest for fifteen minutes or half an hour during the day so that the physical body can absorb the capacities of the sun. Even if it is raining, the light that illumines the earth during the day can be absorbed. So fifteen minutes to half an hour during the day is good. But again, to sleep two, three or four hours during the day is too much.</p>  </div>
