<p>Usually I go out running for the third time at about quarter to seven each morning. Starting at four or five o'clock, every hour I go and run. Many times at quarter to seven I see Harry's son, Bruce, who is so nice to us when we use P.S. 86 for functions. Bruce has a small van. Quite often when he drives by he says, "Guru, Guru! Hello, Guru!"</p>
<p>The bus drivers also are very nice to me. I can be on the other side of the street, but still they will honk and wave. Often I go out to run, so now they recognise me.</p>
