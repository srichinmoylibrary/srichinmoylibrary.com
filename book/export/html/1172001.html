<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. There is nothing wrong in your realisation, but you have to know that Christianity is a religion, whereas what we are following is not a religion. We are following a path.</p>
<p>There is only one Master and that Master is God, the Absolute Supreme. A spiritual Master is only an elder brother in your family. The younger brothers do not know where the Father is or they do not know all about the Father's capacities. The elder brother teaches them about the Father's capacities or he takes them to the Father. Then his role is over. So there will be no conflict if you follow my path because I am not the destination. I am just a messenger; I take you or your message to the Supreme.</p>
<p>If I say my Hinduism is by far the best religion and if you say your Christianity is by far the best, then we shall only quarrel and fight. But we say, "No, you stay in your religion and let me stay in mine, and let us meet together to do something great for God and for humanity." We will meet together and do the needful. Then we will go back to our respective homes, our religions, to take rest.</p>
<p>When we follow a path, we do not encourage any seeker to look down on religion. On the contrary, we feel that our love for religion is strengthened because we follow Yoga. Yoga means oneness with God. If we can establish our oneness with God, or if we can have a free access to God's Heart, then we can add our strength, our light, to our own religion. Right now, like a divine beggar, we are trying to grab everything from our religion. But a day will come when we get light from within, when our being is surcharged with light. At that time we will be able to offer light to religion.</p>  </div>
