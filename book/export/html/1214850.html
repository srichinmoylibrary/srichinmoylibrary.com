  <h1 class="book-heading">The past, the present and the future</h1>
  
 
<p>The past is important, The future is more important. The present is most important. The present is infinitely more important than the past and the future put together.</p>
<p>The past is a promise, an unfulfilled promise. The future is a hope, an uncertain hope. The present is necessity’s reality and reality’s necessity. The present is the eternal Now. The ‘eternal’ is God the Name. The ‘Now’ is God the Form. When God the Form enters into God the Name, God the Form becomes the transcendental Vision. When God the Name enters into God the Form, God the Name becomes the universal Reality.</p>
<p>Transcendence and universality, Vision and Reality, are inseparable and invaluable. When we want to become members of the world of Vision-Dream, transcendence is invaluable. When we want to become members of the world of Reality-manifestation, immanence is invaluable. Transcendence is the seed. immanence is the fruit. A seed is no seed if it does not reveal the fruit. A fruit is no fruit if it does not embody the seed. So the seed and the fruit are at once inseparable and invaluable. In Heaven we are all seeds of God’s Dream. On earth we are all fruits of God’s Reality.</p>
