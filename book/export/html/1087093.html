<p>I went to a bookstore and saw a book called <em>Who's Who in America.</em> My name is in a book called <em>Who's Who Among Indians in America,</em> so I was looking for my name in this one.</p>
<p>A very fat lady was looking for books to help her fight fatness. She said to me in a sarcastic way, "I'm sure your name is there!"</p>
<p>I didn't have the heart to enter into conversation with her, so I just gave her a smile.</p>
<p>Thomas Chinmoy or somebody was mentioned in the book, but my name was not there. They didn't have anything under Ghose or Chinmoy. So I gave up.</p>
