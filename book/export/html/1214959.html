<h2>Food and God</h2>


<p>Food has God.<br /> God is Food.<br /> Food has life.<br /> God is Life.<br /> Food has reality.<br /> God is Reality.<br /> Food has sound-success.<br /> God is Sound-Success.<br /> Food has silence-progress.<br /> God is Silence-Progress.</p>

<p>I eat. I eat to survive. From my very birth I have been seeking nourishment. Food saves my life from starvation. Food saves my life from extinction.</p>

<p>Mine is the hunger that does not permit me<br />     To think soulfully.<br /> Mine is the hunger that does not permit me<br />     To act selflessly.<br /> Mine is the hunger that does not permit me<br />     To pray to God constantly.<br /> Mine is the hunger that does not permit me<br />     To meditate spontaneously.<br /> Mine is the hunger that does not permit me<br />     To love God unconditionally.</p>

<p>I know my food-hunger is reasonable and inevitable. But my power-hunger is unreasonable and unpardonable. Finally, my God-hunger is incomparable and insurmountable.</p>
<p>To my great sorrow, poverty attacks plenty. To my widest astonishment, plenty invades poverty. One of the lofty principles of the United Nations is: "Poverty anywhere in the world is a threat to prosperity everywhere." Indeed, this is a heart-unifying and lifefulfilling message. The United Nations was founded upon the vision-hunger for world peace. I am sure there shall come a time when that vision will be transformed into reality — in spite of today's teeming, threatening and frightening clouds over the firmament of the United Nations.</p>

<p>O body, I tell you a supreme secret:<br />     "Shortage is poverty."<br /> O vital, I tell you a supreme secret:<br />     "Rivalry is poverty."<br /> O mind, I tell you a supreme secret:<br />     "Doubt is poverty."<br /> O heart, I tell you a supreme secret:<br />     "Insecurity is poverty."<br /> O life, I tell you a supreme secret:<br />     "Impurity is poverty."<br /> O truth-seeker, I tell you a supreme secret:<br />     "Disobedience is poverty."<br /> O God-lover, I tell you a supreme secret:<br />     "Ingratitude is poverty."     I eat to live.<br /> Indeed, this is my wisdom-light.<br />     I live to eat.<br /> Indeed, this is my ignorance-night.<br /> God says to my desire-life:<br />     "Love to live."<br /> God says to my aspiration-life:<br />     "Live to love."<br /> God says to my realisation-life:<br />     "Love to become a oneness-heart.<br />     Live to be a perfection-life."</p>
