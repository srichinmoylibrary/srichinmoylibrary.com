<p><em>(Nolini's first contact with Sri Aurobindo. He avails himself of a tramcar and arrives at Wellington Square, Raja Subodh Chandra Mullick's residence. On his arrival he asks the gate-keeper to inform Mr. Ghosh that he wants to see him. In those days he was not called Aurobindo, but Mr. Ghosh. It is 4 p.m.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Shortly after enter Mr. Ghosh)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Who are you, please? Where do you come from?</p>
<p>NOLINI: Barinda has sent me to take you to our garden.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Tell Barin that I have not yet had my lunch. So it is not possible for me to go there to-day. I shall go some other day.</p>
<p><em>(With a respectful pranam Nolini takes leave of Aurobindo. Those few first words are still a cherished memory with him.)</em></p>  </div>
