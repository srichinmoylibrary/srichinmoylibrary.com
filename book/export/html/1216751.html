<p>Once I went to Bermuda for three days alone. The hotel I stayed in was near the water. It was very beautiful. But it rained heavily the whole time I was there. I could not even go out. It rained cats and dogs. Only once I went across the street to a Chinese restaurant. My only consolation was that I wrote two hundred poems while I was there. But I was not able to go out walking or running at all!</p>
