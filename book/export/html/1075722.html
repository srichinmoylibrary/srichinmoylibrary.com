<p><em>(The Abode of Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. Mind has not been born there. The One without a second and the Mother of the Trinity are rapt in trance in the holy Fire. The teeming Gods go round the Infinite and the Mother of the Golden All, singing anthems to them.)</em></p>
<p>1ST BAND OF THE GODS: The face of Truth is covered with a brilliant lid; that do thou remove, O Fosterer, for the law of the Truth, for sight. [fn:1]</p>
<p>2ND BAND:</p>

<p>From the non-being to true being,<br /> From the darkness to the Light,<br /> From death to Immortality.<br /> OM. Peace! Peace! Peace!<br /> So be it. [fn:2]</p>

<p><em>(Their creation has compelled the primaeval parents to descend upon earth for the Divine Play and thus to terminate the earth's ceaseless pangs.)</em></p>
<p>BRAHMA: It is I who create. None save I is the Infinite's creative Power. Therefore, no equal have I.</p>
<p>VISHNU: It is I who uphold. I am His preserving Power. Hence, matchless am I.</p>
<p>SIVA: I am Rudra. I am His force of Destruction. Boundless also is my Compassion for the doleful earth. It is I who lead the earth and her children towards a new creation. Therefore, unique am I.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Earth sows, Heaven reaps. Our supremacy amongst each other can be proved only on the earth, and there alone shall we be able to find which of our devotees are truly superior.</p>
<p>VISHNU: I see eye to eye with you.</p>
<p>SIVA: Needless to say, I shall accompany you. We are but the triune limbs of the Supreme. We exist simply because we must needs help Him in his Divine Play.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Has the earth invoked our presence there? Without their mounting cry how can we descend?</p>
<p>VISHNU: I shall sow the seed of yearning in the heart of the mortals. With a heart full of devotion they will pray to us.</p>
<p>SIVA: Remember, the Asura with his hosts will not remain asleep. How can the earth hail our advent, she who has been under the octopus tentacles of the brooding Giant of Evil?</p>
<p>BRAHMA: We are fully aware. Mahadeva, you will be our Captain! It is you who will ruthlessly destroy the Adversary and found our victory on the aspiring soil.</p>
<p><em>(Behind the curtain a tremendous call and yearning)</em></p>
<p>O, save the earth! O, save the creation! Do flood the earth with the sanctified waters of the Truth and cast the Falsehood down into the Chasm of Nothingness. Set the earth-life free from the roaring den of Death. Brahma, Vishnu, Siva! deign to alight on this orphan earth where Ignorance reigns supreme. We yearn to see your divine Play on the sorrowful dust.</p>

<p><em>OM. Anandamayi Chaitanyamayi Satyamayi Parame.</em><br /><em>OM. Anandamayi Chaitanyamayi Satyamayi Parame.</em><br /><em>OM. Anandamayi Chaitanyamayi Satyamayi Parame.</em></p>

<p>THE MOTHER: Alas, the earth is inundated with ceaseless sorrows and pangs. Her throbbing heart compels my descent. I am the Mother. Who but I can save my children?</p>
<p>THE INFINITE: I, too, on earth shall descend. My advent the East shall acclaim, thine the West.</p>
<p>THE MOTHER: My Grace shall give Immortality to earth. With me will I carry the flame of fire-pure Transformation.</p>
<p>THE INFINITE: I will found thy supernal Kingdom on the neglected earth.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(The residence of Dr. K.D. Ghosh. A smiling garden in front. Swarnalata, his wife, while plucking flowers, sings.)</em></p>
<p>"What shall we mortals do? O, ours to meet With worshipping brow the flowers of His feet!"</p>
<p><em>(Enter K.D. Ghosh)</em></p>
<p>KRISHNA DHAN: I cannot believe my ears! You sing surprisingly sweetly. They say you are 'the Rose of Rangpur' and I know you to be a matchless woman. But I have never heard you sing.</p>
<p>SWARNALATA: Truth to tell, I am not inclined to music; at least, music is not my forte.</p>
<p>K.D.: Who was it singing then like an angel?</p>
<p>SWARNA: Ah! don't you know that alone anybody can sing?</p>
<p>K.D.: Not always. The singer in me, if any, wouldn't sing, even if alone.</p>
<p>SWARNA: I believe you, too, would sing if you dreamt my dream.</p>
<p>K.D.: Dream! Do open your heart. Am I not your husband?</p>
<p>SWARNA: True, you are my confidant. But it's not the proper moment to give away the secret. Let me see if my dream comes true.</p>
<p>K.D.: Swarna, you too! — you appear to be my eighth wonder.</p>
<p>SWARNA: That is a long story. It would be a Mahabharata if I told it. To be brief, I had a toy Krishna when I was a child. As I grew up, I was wont to pray to Sri Krishna in the evening when the earth sank into silence. My sole desire was to be the mother of the embodied Divine.</p>
<p>K.D.: We are too human for a divine dream. Kausalya, Devaki, Sachi — was there anyone on earth who suffered more than they? What a fanciful desire, indeed! What a lofty dream!</p>
<p>SWARNA: But you have not yet heard me out.</p>
<p>K.D.: Do say your say. I will keep it to myself. I give you my word of honour.</p>
<p>SWARNA: But do you know yourself? You are an atheist.</p>
<p>K.D.: Atheist! My father was a Hindu, so am I. I am a worshipper of Kali. My father's mother is at Varanashi. A devotee of Lord Siva is she. Am I an atheist because I move in European society?</p>
<p>SWARNA: Let it be. My dream demands your heart's encouraging, your true sympathy!</p>
<p>K.D.: Swarna, I empty my heart to you.</p>
<p>SWARNA: My prayer shall bear fruit before long. He, the Light of the world, is within me. <em>(A bashful smile.)</em></p>
<p>K.D.: Is He? <em>(A broad smile.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter a poor Muslim in hot haste)</em></p>
<p>ABDUL: Babu, Babu! cholera has broken out in our village. I am very, very poor. Two of my sons were snatched away to the other world last week. My youngest, my dearest, my last son threatens to go. I pray, do call at my hut. Your very presence shall cure my dying son.</p>
<p>K.D.: I shall try my best. My life on earth has no other aim but to protect the weak and help the needy. Those who wallow in wealth can call in eminent doctors. But my hand and bottle are for those whose friend is poverty itself. My work is to have money from the haves and contribute to the funds of the have-nots.</p>
<p>ABDUL: Babu, Babu! I can pay the flood of your sympathy only with my tears of delight.</p>
<p><em>(Exit K.D. Ghosh and Abdul)</em></p>
<p>SWARNA: <em>(With tears streaming)</em> Alas! him to call an atheist whose heart is a surge of sympathy — the living image of philanthropy? O Merciful! O Light of the blind! your pardon, your high pardon my sharp tongue desires.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Scene 3</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(The Himalayas. A galaxy of Kuthumis. The ingress and egress of the aspirant souls.)</em></p>
<p>1ST KUTHUMI: The largesse of the mind is almost come to an end. Mind is the fount of problems. A permanent solution is not to be had there.</p>
<p>2ND KUTHUMI: True, mind is unable to solve all problems. Dangers weave their meshes around the human souls. But who or what can make the impossible possible?</p>
<p>3RD KUTHUMI: I know, I know. It is the pinnacled light of the Supermind which is utterly empty of all problems. It is a fount of harmony, of unity-in-multiplicity.</p>
<p>4TH KUTHUMI: The endless urge of the Supermind is to descend upon the earth and change her consciousness.</p>
<p>1ST KUTHUMI: To serve the purpose God's human birth is the supreme need.</p>
<p>2ND KUTHUMI: Many a time He has descended on the earth across the centuries. But earth seems to have made no satisfactory progress. He comes and goes at His chosen times. Each and every time His Mission appears to be thwarted by the wild ignorance of the earth. The wide hunger of Time devours all the spiritual wealth that He brings down. A ruthless oblivion lords it over the mortals.</p>
<p>3RD KUTHUMI: It is victory and not defeat that is the first and last word of God. Soon the Infinite shall alight on the throbbing heart of the soil.</p>
<p>4TH KUTHUMI: When, why, how, where?</p>
<p>3RD KUTHUMI: It is in India, it is in the land of the sages and the spiritual giants that He will see the light of day.</p>
<p>2ND KUTHUMI: And what is expected from us?</p>
<p>1ST KUTHUMI: Ours is to be a flower offering to Him, to His Mission.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(The residence of Rishi Rajnarayan Bose. He adores the formless Aspect of the Brahman.)</em></p>
<p>RISHI: Swarna, Swarna! Take your seat right beside me. Swarna, I had a dream last night. To me that dream seems more vivid than reality itself.</p>
<p>SWARNA: Father, may I have a share?</p>
<p>RISHI: Certainly, my dream concerns you much. You all know that I have been a votary of the Nirakara Brahman for a couple of decades. But now no more. I saw Him ... It is beyond my power of expression. My eyes swam in light and delight.</p>
<p>SWARNA: Who was it, Father?</p>
<p>RISHI: The Light of the world, Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>SWARNA: Where?</p>
<p>RISHI: My daughter, in you, in you and nowhere else. Since the small hours of the morning I have been a torrent of ecstasy. I have also seen the Gods bow down on their knees before Him, your coming son. Swarna, you are my matchless jewel.</p>
<p>SWARNA: Father, you are my greatest pride. You stand very high in the estimation of all. You are the polestar of the Nation. Your voice has rung out the inmost voice of India. Now it is my hope that God will make me worthy of your prophetic vision.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(The abode of Manomohan Ghosh, a Barrister and close friend of Or. K.D. Ghosh. Behind the screen.)</em></p>

<p>The Birth of the Infinite<br /><em>(5 a.m., August 15, 1872)</em></p>
<p>The golden dawn of the cosmos rapt in trance,<br /> Awaits the birth of the All.<br /> The seven worlds' bliss converges in her heart<br /> With august and sun-vast call.</p>
<p>Slowly the Peak unmeasured of rapture-fire<br /> Climbs down to our human cry.<br /> His diamond vision's deathless Will leans low<br /> Our mortal frames to dye.</p>
<p>Suddenly life's giant somnolence is stirred.<br /> His all-embracing Wing<br /> Declares, "I come to end your eyeless fear:<br /> To me alone now cling!</p>
<p>"No fleeting dreams your teeming births do trace:<br /> Now own my infinite bloom.<br /> In me the flood of Immortality!<br /> Nowhere shall be your doom."</p>

<p>MANOMOHAN: My joy knows no bounds that your son takes birth in my house.</p>
<p>K.D.: No doubt, it will be a matter of great rejoicing if the dream of my wife comes true.</p>
<p>MANOMOHAN: How does her dream run?</p>
<p>K.D.: Friend, to me it is just a dream, a chimera's mist, but to her it is a blazing truth.</p>
<p>MANOMOHAN: Krishnadhan, I wish to hear her dream and not your comment on it.</p>
<p>K.D.: Well, during her confinement she dreamt that it was Sri Krishna who would take human birth through her.</p>
<p>MANOMOHAN: I see nothing wrong in her dream. You are a pessimist from head to foot. Come, let us hurry to the child. Who knows, we may find the Marvellous One?</p>  </div>

<p><em>(The child is in the lap of his mother. She is fondling him.)</em></p>
<p>SWARNA: My child, are you the Lord of my dream? I have seen you time and again. To-day my dream has donned the cloak of reality.</p>
<p><em>(Enter her father, Rishi Rajnarayan)</em></p>
<p>RISHI: Swarna, I have come to see my Beloved, the Lord of the Gods.</p>
<p>SWARNA: There you are, Father. <em>(Swarnalata places the child on her father's lap.)</em></p>
<p>RISHI: <em>(With a broad smile he lifts the child onto his head.)</em> Ah! It is Aurobindo, it is a lotus, still in the bud.</p>
<p>SWARNA: Father, I see no wonder in his face. In my dream he was the Wonder of Wonders.</p>
<p>RISHI: My daughter, do not look at him with your earthly eyes. To me he remains the same as in my vision when I saw him as the Light of the world. Never forget that God is the Thaumaturge of thaumaturges. Therefore, his appearance has put a mask on his real nature. Swarna, what a pride now tingles through my blood! My heart is swayed by a riot of joy. Krishna, Krishna is come. Dark clouds of doubt must not blight your vision. He is our Aurobindo. He is the Divine Lotus. Petal by petal He will bloom to a perfect perfection.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(The parlour of Dr. K.D. Ghosh. Evening sets in.)</em></p>
<p>K.D.: I have a fine proposal, Swarna. I would like to call in an Englishman.</p>
<p>SWARNA: What for?</p>
<p>K.D.: To tutor Benoy and Mano in English.</p>
<p>SWARNA: And then ...</p>
<p>K.D.: For Auro an English governess.</p>
<p>SWARNA: If my approval has any value then you have it hundred per cent.</p>
<p>K.D.: Something more ...</p>
<p>SWARNA: What is it?</p>
<p>K.D.: Starting from to-day, indeed from to-day on, Bengali is not to be spoken in our house. English, only English. How I wish my children could speak in English, write in English, think in English and even dream in English! They must be Englishmen to the core. I shall soon send them to Darjeeling and place them in a convent school. A few years later, I shall take them to London. My sons must be among the brightest jewels in India's crown.</p>
<p>SWARNA: An exquisite plan, indeed. But before that why not say that you want to send me to the land of Death? How dare you think that I can endure the absence of my sweet children? Shall I not go mad?</p>
<p>K.D.: I knew it well that the mother in your heart is too strong. You are a typical Bengali woman. You want your sons to be helpless, mere babes in arms. Your pale, pathetic look pierces my heart. Swarna, your skin must not lose its colour because of worry. Do not be upset.</p>
<p>SWARNA: I am sorry. It is not in me to cross you. But you have given me a great shock.</p>  </div>

<p>A VILLAGER: Sadhuji, please give me some religious knowledge.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: All I can give you is a bit of advice. I am afraid, although my advice will reach your sceptic ears, you will never apply it in the practical field. <em>(Some of the villagers burst into a peal of laughter.)</em> My advice, you know? The world is an illusion. Have no link with it!</p>
<p>A MERCHANT: Be pleased to read my palm.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: You, you wallow in the pleasure of wealth. Am I right?</p>
<p>MERCHANT: Absolutely perfect. But, Sadhuji, I have not seen the face of peace even for a fleeting second.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: Ah, peace! peace is not to take birth here in this world. It is the offspring of another world. This world is made of din, dust and dizzying demonstrations.</p>
<p>MANMOHAN: Please run your eyes over my palm, and drop a few hints about my years to come.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: Ah, a poet, a fine poet. This is what your future says.</p>
<p>MANOMOHAN: <em>(Pointing at Auro)</em> And how does the fate of my younger brother run?</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: <em>(Looking ahead he meets Aurobindo's curious eyes; and in the twinkling of an eye sprints off.)</em> His future is at his command.</p>
<p>MANMOHAN: Only a few days back Auro composed a beautiful poem on Kanchanjunga. The teachers have appreciated it greatly.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: No wonder, he is not a common boy. He will be a great Yogi who has to play a great part on the world scene! Brahman! Brahman! O Lord of my breath, Thou art verily Thy unfathomable mystery.</p>  </div>

<p>MANO: Poor Auro, he has to learn the meaning of poverty at the very start of his life.</p>

<p>AUROBINDO: I, too, shall sit for the I.C.S. But I shan't serve the British Government.</p>
<p>2ND MEMBER: To be sure, the freedom of India can never be won by us, for we are unimaginably weak. And if it is not true, show us the way.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: At the very outset we must make the people of India feel the unavoidable necessity of being a free country.</p>

We are not to sacrifice our valuable lives, and again we are not to commit the ghastly sin of putting an end to English lives.</p>

<p>5TH MEMBER: Where do you get so much inspiration from?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: I do not really know. Just last night I had a terrible dream. I saw a demon drinking the blood from the very breast of an old woman. We all went in hot haste to her rescue. To our joy we saved her life. But some of us were removed to the other world by that demon. I was just pondering who that woman was. Soon I heard a voice, so vivid, so pathetic! "I am your Bharatmata." And there ends my dream. From to-day the sole aim of my life is to make India as free as a bird in the sky.</p>
<p>6TH MEMBER: There is a secret society here at Cambridge named "Lotus and Dagger." Would you like to be a member of it?</p>

<p>BHARATMATA: My son, I am come at last. India demands your express arrival. For you will awake the slumbering nation. Darkness has begun to thicken in front of me. It will serve no use to lengthen my story by fruitless emotional gestures. Make me free, make me free, my son.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Mother, I offer my heart and soul to abide by your high command. No more shall you utter the wail of misery. I shall turn the wind of/Swadesh/ into a gigantic tornado.</p>

<p>AUROBINDO: Certainly, you do have. But our India must have freedom to save all humanity from peril. In the years to come, India and Britain will cherish a unique amity. No futile wrangling — the flood of peace shall inundate both countries.</p>
<p>DEITY: My sole request to you is that you will not do away with my language and literature. Nothing more, nothing less I ask of you.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: To you I am immensely indebted. My pen shall ever serve your language and thus I shall as well serve you.</p>

<p>MOTHER: Why not, why not? At the divine hour I shall go and stand beside you in India. Down to earth we shall carry our highest Truth. You and I shall be the harbingers of a new humanity. I know, but you do not yet know that you are the new Sri Krishna of India. You are my Lord.</p>  </div>

<p>My Auro! Auro! all world-pain in flood<br /> Within my finite breast.<br /> My pride, my country's pride, O earth's hope-noon,<br /> The all-transforming Crest!</p>
<p>Alas! to feed my longings high, no more<br /> Shall I see my Auro, my son.<br /> The sombre night envelops my mortal sheath<br /> To-day my heart is undone.</p>

<p><em>(A trip to Kashmir. The Maharaja of Baroda and Aurobindo on Shankaracharya Hill.)</em></p>
<p>MAHARAJA: Arvind Babu, now we are on the top of the hill. We have ascended a thousand feet above the level of the valley of Kashmir. As we climbed higher and higher I felt as if a screen were slowly lifting up and revealing the splendid beauty of Kashmir. It seems you, too, are thrilled all over by the scenery of this place.</p>
<p>AURO: My feeling is at once overwhelming and inexpressible.</p>
<p>MAHARAJA: What is it? I must hear it from you, I must <em>(He comes closer to Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>AURO: I made no effort, yet I have had an experience of something so vivid, so astonishing.</p>
<p>MAHARAJA: Do confide it to me, my young friend!</p>
<p>AURO: It is the vacant Infinite! It cannot be described in words. I am sure this experience will leave an abiding impression upon my mind.</p>
<p>MAHARAJA: How wonderful you are! You have spiritual experiences while I merely enjoy the beauty of the scenery. By the bye, do you know the funny story about the Hill?</p>
<p>AURO: No. I would like to hear it from you.</p>
<p>MAHARAJA: The story is that during his itinerant life the great Vedantin, Shankaracharya, with some of his disciples paid a visit to Kashmir. For some time they made their stay on this hill, and it was at his instance that this temple of Shiva was first set up. Hence this hill has been known as Shankaracharya Hill.</p>
<p>AURO: Now what about the funny portion?</p>
<p>MAHARAJA: Ah, have patience, I am coming to the point. I have told you that Shankara came over here with his disciples. Soon they ran short of provisions. But from the neighbouring villages nobody turned up to offer hospitality to them. It was after some days that a few pundits came to meet them. The disciples of Shankara flew into a rage. They said to the pundits: "Are you not ashamed of your indifference? Are you so ignorant of the Shastric injunctions on hospitality to guests? Did you care to know that we have been without food for some days?" The pundits did not hesitate to defend themselves and asked: "How on earth could you expect us to know this?" Then they turned to Shankara and said that if he had any spiritual power he could have easily fed his disciples. Thereupon Shankara said: "I don't believe in Shakti. The world is an Illusion." The pundits cried out: "No, never, the world is real. It is Reality itself. The world is neither illusion nor hallucination."</p>
<p>AURO: The pundits are right, absolutely right.</p>
<p>MAHARAJA: Ah, but let me complete the story. I have come to the end. The miracle begins. One of the pundits invoked a Goddess by chanting some mantras and placed his right palm on the ground. Lo, jets of water began springing up from below the very spot. Poor Shankara had to admit the existence of Shakti.</p>

<p>"Dearest Mrinalini,</p>
<p>... You have, perhaps, by now discovered that the one with whose fate yours is linked is a very strange kind of person. Mine is not the mental outlook, the aim of life and the domain of action which the generality of people in this country have at present. It is quite different in all respects, it is uncommon. Perhaps, you know by what name the generality of people call extraordinary ideas, uncommon actions, unusually high aspirations. They label all these things as madness, but if the mad man succeeds in the field of action then instead of calling him a lunatic they call him a great man, a man of genius."</p>
<p>MRINALINI: <em>(Saying to herself)</em> I fully agree with you, my Lord. I am sure your efforts will be crowned with success.</p>
<p><em>(She continues reading.)</em></p>
<p>"... it is my firm faith that whatever virtue, talent, higher education and knowledge and wealth which God has given me belongs to Him."</p>
<p>MRINALINI: O Merciful God, Thy Grace knows no bounds. I bow to Thee with all my heart and soul for giving me a husband who has no equal on earth.</p>
<p><em>(She continues reading.)</em></p>
<p>"... I know I have the strength to uplift this fallen race; it is not physical strength, I am not going to fight with the sword or with the gun, but with the power of knowledge. The power of the warrior is not the only kind of force, there is also the power of the Brahman which is founded on knowledge. This is not a new feeling within me, it is not of a recent origin, I was born with it, it is in my marrow, God sent me to the earth to accomplish this great mission."</p>
<p><em>(She is thrilled with joy and jumps up.</em></p>
<p>MRINALINI: I know, I know, you are not an ordinary human being. You are a Godlike man. Your great mission must succeed.</p>
<p><em>(She goes on.)</em></p>
<p>"... You should always offer to Him this prayer: - May I not come in the way of my husband's life and his ideals and his path to God-realisation; may I become his helper and his instrument. - Will you do it?"</p>
<p>MRINALINI: My Lord, I fail to believe my eyes. How could you imagine that I might come in the way of your life and your ideals and your path to God-realisation? I have no existence without you. I am entirely yours, within and without.</p>  </div>

The Professor said, "Well, it is a proof that we are living in the midst of honest and good people." "But you never keep an account which may testify to the honesty of the people around you?" I asked him. With a smiling face he said, "It is God who keeps account for me. He gives me as much as I want and keeps the rest to Himself.

<p>MOTHER BENGAL: My child, you come to me in my moment of utter distress. Look at my state. How long will you suffer me in this way to grovel in the dust?</p>
<p>AURO: Mother, look into my bleeding heart. The stab in your heart is a stab in the heart of every one of us, your children. We are determined to let you, our mighty Mother, no longer lie prostrate and dismembered. Our first task will be to restore you to your full stature, whole and strong, and at the same time to launch a supreme effort to free you for ever from your thraldom. The fire that we shall kindle here will spread all over the world. For the moment, our love for you will be the love of fire; there will be a fire everywhere till the black forces ranged against our Bharatmata are a heap of ashes, and her benign face shines with the light of liberty. We stand vowed to do or be vanquished. If our efforts are crowned with success, then only shall we begin our second task — the task of the spiritual liberation of our sisters and brothers at home and abroad. Rest assured, we shall look to your great need first. Nothing will see us swerve an inch from our path. Bless us, O Mother.</p>
<p>MOTHER BENGAL: Your words are worthy of the great soul in you that speaks them. Your Mother will be with you at all times. Mother India expects her children in Bengal to rise and join hands with her children everywhere from North to South, from East to West. Godspeed to you and your sisters and brothers in the vast sacrifice you have undertaken.</p>  </div>

<p><em>(The residence of P. Mitter, Bar-at-law, Aurobindo and Barin. Jatin Banerjee, whom Aurobindo had helped to get into the Baroda army for military training.)</em></p>
<p>P. MITTER: Aurobindo Babu, Barin and Jatin did their best to organise the youths. But of late there has been a sharp difference of opinion between them. Barin differs from Jatin's principle of military discipline with regard to the youths who, he says, will do better through love and sympathy than under subjection to a military regime. He fears that strict discipline may scare away the tender ones. Jatin insists on military discipline as essential to an effective basis for our organisation. Until the two views are harmonised, there will be no progress in the work. It is now yours to do the needful.</p>
<p>AURO: Both of them are right, each from his own point of view. <em>(Looking at Jatin)</em> You and Barin have sacrificed so much for the Mother. The spirit of sacrifice and self-accommodation must govern your actions. First of all, let there be love and sympathy in dealing with the new recruits. Then let them be inspired by love of the country to sacrifice their life. Once this love has taken firm root in their youthful hearts you have to introduce military training and discipline to make of them strong, obedient instruments. Jatin, certainly you can co-operate with Barin and Barin with you through the next necessary stages. Don't you agree to this?</p>
<p>BARIN and JATIN: <em>(In one voice)</em> Certainly that is the best course.</p>  </div>

<p>RASH BEHARI: Aurobindo Babu, please do not take me amiss. We admit that Nationalism is an invaluable thing. But to preach it in the College, we believe, is not advisable. You always insist on admitting the boys who have been rusticated from Government institutions on political grounds. You say that they are just the sort of stuff that you want for this College. Moreover, it is not safe at all. The Government have already started looking upon our College with an eye of suspicion.</p>
<p>AURO: <em>(After heaving a deep sigh)</em> I think our College must have an ideal of its own. Will you be pleased if it follows other Colleges <em>in toto</em>?</p>
<p>GURUDAS: Not at all. But the thing is, if the students pay more attention to politics and nationalism than to their studies, then their studies will go to the dogs.</p>
<p>AURO: I don't think politics and nationalism stand as a bar to their mental culture. One has to adore one's Motherland first. Mere mental information is of no use. I believe, one who has no love for his country is no better than a learned fool, although one may be rich in mental attainments.</p>
<p>GURUDAS: I must say, you are quite ahead of our age. Nationalism, politics and mental culture — these three cannot go together.</p>
<p>AURO: I am sorry, I fail to share your views. The name of our College is Bengal National College. Will it not be a negation of the <em>raison d'être</em> of the College if it keeps clear of Nationalism?</p>
<p>NAGENDRA: Aurobindo Babu, you are always noted for your clarity of thought and expression, depth of understanding and the facility with which you make the abstruse intelligible. I am deeply convinced that your own lofty spirit of Nationalism will fill the country with a powerful idealism that will build up our Nation. But our College is a different matter ...</p>  </div>

The <em>Bande Mataram</em> has now become much too big a burden for me to carry single-handed. I need your personal help as Assistant Editor. It must cope successfully with the rapid growth of the Nationalist movement. I could think of no better person to take up the job than you. Besides, I have every hope that from your powerful pen it will go on producing the needed type of food the country requires from day to day. Now tell me 'yes.'</p>
<p>AURO: Thank you for your confidence in me, Mr. Pal. I agree to take up this work provided I have a free hand in the matter.</p>
<p>PAL: Assuredly you will have everything entirely your own way. It's no business venture. There is no clash of ideals in the Party. So there is no question of interference with your work.</p>
<p>AURO: Thanks again, Mr. Pal.</p>
<p>PAL. Now that the <em>Bande Mataram</em> has your magic pen, I am sure India will no longer remain a slumbering Nation.</p>

<p>PAL: Ah, pray, do not extol me to the skies. My voice, you may at best compare it with a sword. But who can ever deny that the pen is mightier than the sword?</p>
<p>AURO: If I have extolled you to the skies, to what super-skiey ether would you be said to have extolled me?</p>
<p>PAL: Now, Aurobindo Babu, I expect you to join hands with me at once. The rising tide of Nationalism must suffer no stemming because of any failure on our part to rise to the situation as it develops, henceforth perhaps from moment to moment.</p>
<p>AURO: His work will be done by Him. We are mere instruments. But as instruments, we must be ready, too.</p>

<p>BHUPEN: But why? May I know the cause of your objection?</p>
<p>AURO: It is very simple. Bhupen, it does not become you, a fiery revolutionary, to recognise an alien court. You must always be ready to meet prosecution with absolute indifference. You must accept all punishments in utter silence as a matter of course with erect head and dauntless heart. This is the spirit with which you must be surcharged to drive away the British from India.</p>

A day shall come when this Religion of ours will be the future Religion of the entire world. Our high mission is to purge barbarism out of humanity and to Aryanise the world. To this end India must recognise herself first. This is the peerless work. To initiate this work Sri Ramakrishna came into the world. His dearest disciple, Naren, walked through fire and water to preach it all over the world.</p>

<p>AURO: <em>(Bursting into laughter)</em> That's fine. You are not much indebted to God. Only for one thing ... And what is it?</p>

Now, Chief, you have come on the scene. I am sure you, too, will meet with tremendous success. If God had sent all the three at a time, undoubtedly I would have been a terrible loser.</p>

<p>AUROBINDO: I was striving hard to see Narayana within me as Friend, Master or Providence, but could not. Family ties, attachment to work and a number of other things stood like a wall between Him and me. Now those whom you call my enemies have peremptorily broken those attachments and whisked me away as if from my moorings and put me here in this splendid isolation where I can, quite undisturbed, dive into my depths and see my Lord, my Friend, my Guardian, my Guide, my All-in-all face-to-face. That is why I find in this solitary cell my precious seclusion for union with the Self of my self. He gave me an affectionate family, loving relations, friends, well-wishers, admirers countless in number but more than any one of them, more than all of them put together, my so-called enemies have done me the greatest good. They are no longer my enemies. They are the best of my friends. And this is not the only instance. It is one out of many. Hence, I say, enemies I have none.</p>  </div>

He was a contemporary of mine in the I.C.S. We both won honours at the University and, at the final examination of the Indian Civil Service, Arabindo the prisoner beat Beachcroft the Judge to second place in Greek and Latin. This is called the irony of Fate! Poor Arabindo!</p>
<p>NORTON: "To me it appears a matter for regret that a man of Arabindo's mental calibre should have been ejected from the Civil Service on the ground that he could not, or would not, ride a horse. Capacity such as his would have been a valuable asset to the State. Had room been found for him in the Educational Service of India I believe he would have gone far not merely in personal advancement but in welding more firmly the links which bind his countrymen to ours. The new era of reform, in spite of local and I believe temporary cleavage, illumines India's political sky and promises a future as much a matter of just pride to the Englishman as of hope and contentment and advance to the Indian."</p>  </div>

Since my acquittal, many telegrams and letters have reached me and the love which my countrymen have heaped upon me in return for the little I have been able to do for them amply repays any apparent trouble or misfortune my public activity may have brought upon me. I attribute my escape to no human agency, but first of all to the protection of the Mother of us all who has never been absent from me but always held me in Her arms and shielded me from grief and disaster, and secondarily to the prayers of thousands, which have been going up to Her on my behalf ever since I was arrested. If it is the love of my country which led me into danger, it is also the love of my countrymen which has brought me safe through it.</p>

<p><em>(May 30, 1909. The memorable Uttarpara speech. A gathering of about ten thousand people. Aurobindo is profusely garlanded. Michhari Babu, son of Raja Piyari Mohan of Uttarpara, has specially got a garland prepared for Aurobindo, which reaches to the feet. The meeting is held under the auspices of the Dharma Rakshini Sabha, just after his acquittal from the Alipore Bomb Case.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(After triumphant cheers from the audience)</em> "When I was asked to speak to you at the annual meeting of your Sabha, it was my intention to say a few words about the subject chosen for to-day, the subject of the Hindu religion. I do not know whether I shall fulfil that intention, for as I sat here, there came into my mind a word that I have to speak to you, a word that I have to speak to the whole of the Indian Nation. It was spoken first to myself in jail and I have to speak it to my people ... I walked under the branches of the tree in front of my cell but it was not the tree, I knew it was Vasudeva, it was Sri Krishna whom I saw standing there and holding over me his shade. I looked at the bars of my cell, the very grating that did duty for a door and again I saw Vasudeva. It was Narayana who was guarding and standing sentry over me. Or I lay on the coarse blankets that were given me for a couch and felt the arms of Sri Krishna around me, the arms of my Friend and Lover. This was the first use of the deeper vision He gave me. I looked at the prisoners in the jail, the thieves, the murderers, the swindlers, and as I looked at them I saw Vasudeva, it was Narayana whom I found in these darkened souls and misused bodies ... Afterwards when the trial opened in the Sessions Court, I began to write many instructions for my Counsel as to what was false evidence against me and on what points the witnesses might be cross-examined. Then something happened which I had not expected. The arrangements which had been made for my defence were suddenly changed and another Counsel stood there to defend me. He came unexpectedly — a friend of mine, but I did not know he was coming. You have all heard the name of the man who put away from him all other thoughts and abandoned all his practice, who sat up half the night day after day for months and broke his health to save me — Srijut Chittaranjan Das. When I saw him, I was satisfied, but I still thought it necessary to write instructions. Then all was put away from me and I had the message from within, 'This is the man who will save you from the snares put around your feet. Put aside those papers. It is not you who will instruct him. I will instruct him.' From that time I did not of myself speak a word to my Counsel about the case ... I had left it to him and he took it entirely into his hands, with what result you know ... Always I listened to the voice within: 'I am guiding, therefore, fear not. Turn to your own work for which I have brought you to jail and when you come out, remember never to fear, never to hesitate. Remember that it is I who am doing this, not you nor any other. Therefore, whatever clouds may come, whatever dangers and sufferings, whatever difficulties, whatever impossibilities, there is nothing impossible, nothing difficult. I am in the nation and its uprising and I am Vasudeva, I am Narayana, and what I will, shall be, not what others will. What I choose to bring about, no human power can stay.' ... I said, 'Give me Thy Adesh. I do not know what work to do or how to do it. Give me a message.' In the communion of Yoga two messages came. The first message said, 'I have given you a work and it is to help to uplift this nation. Before long the time will come when you will go out of jail for it is not my will that this time either you should be convicted or that you should pass the time, as others have to do, in suffering for their country. I have called you to work, and that is the Adesh for which you have asked. I give you the Adesh to go forth and do my work.' The second message came and it said, 'Something has been shown to you in this year of seclusion, something about which you had your doubts and it is the truth of the Hindu religion. It is this religion that I am raising up before the world, it is this that I have perfected and developed through the Rishis, saints and Avatars, and now it is going forth to do my work among the nations. I am raising up this nation to send forth my word. This is the Sanatan Dharma, this is the eternal religion which you did not really know before, but which I have now revealed to you ... When you go forth, speak to your nation always this word, that it is for Sanatan Dharma that they arise, it is for the world and not for themselves that they arise. I am giving them freedom for the service of the world. When therefore it is said that India shall rise, it is the Sanatan Dharma that shall rise. When it is said that India shall be great, it is the Sanatan Dharma that shall be great. When it is said that India shall expand and extend herself, it is the Sanatan Dharma that shall expand and extend itself over the world. It is for the Dharma and by the Dharma that India exists' ... I say that it is the Sanatan Dharma which for us is nationalism. This Hindu Nation was born with the Sanatan Dharma, with it it moves and with it it grows. When the Sanatan Dharma declines, then the nation declines, and if the Sanatan Dharma were capable of perishing, with the Sanatan Dharma it would perish. The Sanatan Dharma, that is the Nationalism. This is the message that I have to speak to you."</p>
<p><em>(Exit Aurobindo)</em></p>
<p><em>(Some members of the Dharma Rakshini Sabha speak to one another.)</em></p>
<p>1st MEMBER: I have attended big political meetings addressed by veteran leaders. But this meeting, could I or anybody else foresee it? A set subject had been placed before him to speak on with sufficient time given him to think over it. But you see, how he soared unexpectedly higher over it to another subject of far-reaching scope and of deep significance.</p>
<p>2nd MEMBER: Yes, he soared not only above the fixed subject but above the environment. He made us forget that we were at Uttarpara listening to one of our invited guests.</p>
<p>3rd MEMBER: He spoke not in a human voice and I doubt whether it was he who spoke.</p>
<p>CHIEF ORGANISER: I agree with each of you. I feel strongly that Uttarpara will go down in history as an obscure point on India's map from which the whole of India and then the whole of the world will listen to India's Godman, speaking to all humanity India's godman, speaking to all humanity. The cadence of his sentences raised waves of power in my heart. What power is this? It looks as if he will leave the political field. But I feel assured that what India will lose in him as a political leader she will gain infinitely in having him as a dynamic force to create a superior India and a superior world.</p>  </div>

<p>FRIEND: <em>(Addressing Mrs. Mitra)</em> Sister, a thought has just occurred to me and I have come to tell it to you.</p>
<p>MRS. MITRA: Yes, I am all ears.</p>
<p>FRIEND: Aurobindo Babu is in your house. The Intelligence Department knows it. Krishna-da is in detention in Agra Jail. The I.B.'s report, that you are harbouring the terror of the British Government in your own house, will spell disaster. Who knows that your house will not be a centre of the watch-dogs? For your friends and relatives to visit your house will certainly be to risk their safety. You can never want that your neighbours, friends and relatives should be the objects of the I.B.'s attentions. Harassment of innocents, I am sure, is the last thing you could think of. Over and above all this, there is the case of Krishna-da. If he is detained simply on suspicion, Aurobindo Babu's stay in your house will confirm it. All this will surely mean his indefinite detention.</p>
<p>MRS. MITRA: <em>(Smiling)</em> Now...</p>
<p>FRIEND: Now for your safety and for the safety of all else concerned as well as for an early release of Krishna-da I should like you to request Aurobindo Babu to remove to some other place apart from his relations.</p>
<p>MRS. MITRA: I appreciate your good will and your concern for our well-being. But, dear sister, to be on God's earth and at the same time to be in constant fear of danger to personal safety and personal interest, without believing in His Protection, is it not sacrilege? <em>(In a choking voice)</em> Auro is more than my Auro. He is Mother India's chosen child. If my friends and relations dare not visit my house, I shall be sorry for them. Mother India needs her children to be of sterner stuff. If they cannot rise to the occasion, I repeat, I shall be sorry for them. But I cannot do otherwise. My heart revolts against the very idea of seeing Auro off from his beloved uncle's house. And what would your Dada think of me? I know him, perhaps, more intimately than anybody else. His love of truth, his love of country are the same in substance and in spirit as his love for Auro. So, my sister ...</p>
<p>FRIEND: A true consort of a true leader. I feel ennobled by your lofty stand. I leave you and your darling Auro in the hands of Divine Providence in whom you have such flaming faith.</p>  </div>

<p>NIVEDITA: <em>(With a note of anxiety in her voice)</em> Will that suffice?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: It will. And you will agree with me when you read it through.</p>

<p>NIVEDITA: <em>(Raising her head)</em> Listen, Sudhira, and tell me who could write like this? <em>(She reads out)</em> "All great movements wait for their Godsent leader, the willing channel of His force, and only when he comes, move forward triumphantly to their fulfilment ... Our ideal of Swaraj involves no hatred of any other nation nor of the administration which is now established by law in this country. We find a bureaucratic administration, we wish to make it democratic; we find an alien government, we wish to make it indigenous; we find a foreign control, we wish to render it Indian. They lie who say that this aspiration necessitates hatred and violence. Our ideal of patriotism proceeds on the basis of love and brotherhood and it looks beyond the unity of the nation and envisages the ultimate unity of mankind ..."</p>
<p>SUDHIRA: Who but Mr. Ghosh?</p>
<p>NIVEDITA: Right. These words will pass into history and materialise in the life of India. Mr. Ghosh is not simply India's glory. He is the glory of God in the world.</p>
<p>SUDHIRA: It is a thousand pities that the Government should think of him as a menace to their existence.</p>
<p>NIVEDITA: Menace, no doubt, to a ruthless engine of repression that the Government are. I am, however, strongly persuaded that Mr. Ghosh's present letter to his countrymen will do the job. It is as clear as it is outspoken and well within legal bounds. Aurobindo is the Truth that is India. And the Truth will triumph.</p>  </div>

<p>All day within me only one music rings.<br /> I have become a lyre of helpless strings,<br /> And I am but a horn for thee to wind,<br /> O vast musician! Take me, all thy mind<br /> In light, in gloom, by day, by night express.<br /> Into me, minstrel, breathe thy mightiness.<br /> On solitary shores, in lonely skies,<br /> In night's huge sieges when the winds blow wild,<br /> In many a lovely land of mysteries,<br /> In many a shadowy realm, or where a child,<br /> Dawn, bright and young, sweet unripe thoughts conceives,<br /> Or through the indifferent calm desireless eves,<br /> In magic night and magic light of thee,<br /> Play on thy instrument, O Soul, O Sea.</p>

<p>C.R. DAS: Could any rendering be more beautiful than this? I, too, have attempted an English translation of the book. But mark the difference here between a born poet and a made poet. It can easily pass for original work, and as a true poet he has taken the liberty to improve upon the original in many places. To read his work is to enter into the splendour of Beauty that is Aurobindo. God has listened to my prayer. He had acted through me as an instrument in the Alipore Bomb Case and it was He who brought about Aurobindo's release. Aurobindo is now His chosen instrument in His Play to save man from himself, the world from itself and set up His own Empire upon earth.

<p>B: Only this much that in France she was carrying on Sadhana almost on Aurobindo's lines — of course, without knowing it; and, what's more, she had several visions of someone she called Sri Krishna!</p>
<p>A: Interesting! Wonderful, too! Then?</p>
<p>B: And the very moment she saw Aurobindo, she recognised him as the Krishna of her vision.</p>
<p>A: What predestination! This is the way the Divine does His work!</p>
<p>B: And you have marked how simple and affable she is as if she has come home to her own people.</p>
<p>A: That's my feeling too. Over and above that, she inspires regard.</p>
<p>B: Quite natural for her personality, for one who could see Aurobindo inwardly from across the seas and who could tread the path the Master has chalked out for us here.</p>
<p>A: I marvel at the coincidence.</p>
<p>B: We may marvel, without doubt. The coincidence seems a symbol of West joining East in a great synthesis.</p>
<p>A: That is exactly my feeling.</p>
<p>B: Let us put this question to the Master. Let us hear him on the point.</p>
<p>A: Very well. To-morrow itself, if possible.</p>  </div>

<p>AUROBINDO: Anything you want to ask?</p>
<p>A: A little about the French lady who visited you yesterday, if you please.</p>
<p>B: The striking thing about her is that she seems to be home here among us, strangers, in a strange land in strange surroundings.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Long before her arrival here I had been aware of her. You will know her more and more from day to day. Even then she will be far above what you can know. As regards her being at home here, or in any other place, nothing would make any difference for her. She is in all the world and all the world is in her. In a large sense, she is an Indian soul born in a European body.</p>
<p>A and B: <em>(Almost in one voice)</em> A similar thought struck us yesterday — as if she would link up East and West in a golden chain.</p>

<p>Here's a reader of the <em>Arya</em> asking me how I, a literary man and a politician, could become all on a sudden an out-and-out philosopher! It has struck him rightly. I must write to him that I knew precious little about philosophy before I did the Yoga and came to Pondicherry, How did I manage to do it and why? Because X proposed to me to co-operate in a philosophical review — and my theory was that a Yogi ought to be able to turn his hand to anything ...</p>
<p>AMRITA: But it has never struck me as strange. Your articles, even your speeches, were at no time unmixed politics or pure literature. They have always been a happy blend of all the three, each at its best — I mean, politics, literature and philosophy, although the fire of love of country and her freedom predominated,</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: But hasn't the <em>Arya</em> a different complexion altogether?</p>
<p>AMRITA: Undoubtedly.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Then you concede that he is justified in asking me...</p>
<p>AMRITA: I do. Oh, that the man in question could see you filling page after page without halting anywhere, as if your very fingers were inspired!</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: But that is exactly the truth! Strange to say, a Power comes directly into the fingers, as if it did not have to pass through anything else! Just now I said that a Yogi should be able to turn his hand to anything. Well, the word "hand" can be applied in a very literal sense where the <em>Arya</em>-articles are concerned .</p>

<p>A: I have time and again told you that the Mother and Sri Aurobindo are one.</p>
<p>B: But have you ever felt it?</p>
<p>A: I have no need to feel it. I know they are one.</p>
<p>B: But how?</p>
<p>A: How? Sri Aurobindo has clearly said that his Consciousness and the Mother's are one and the same.</p>
<p>B: You think I have no faith in Sri Aurobindo?</p>
<p>A: If you have, then why such hesitation?</p>
<p>B: Not actually hesitation, but ...</p>
<p>A: You must not call yourself a disciple of Sri Aurobindo if you fail to believe in him. Apart from it, it is you who will be the loser, if you are wanting in faith in him. I can tell you something quite striking. Just yesterday when my mother had a heart attack I called upon Sri Aurobindo to protect her. Whom I actually saw, you know, was the Mother by the side of my mother. And to the surprise of the doctor and others my mother has come round. And to-day when I concentrated on the Mother out of the fulness of my grateful heart I saw Sri Aurobindo before me with his benign smile.</p>
<p>B: <em>(Clasping A)</em> True! I fully believe you. Now tell me a little more about their oneness of being and action.</p>
<p>A: Sri Aurobindo says: "The Mother's consciousness and mine are the same, the one Divine Consciousness in two, because that is necessary for the play. Nothing can be done without her knowledge and force, without her consciousness — if anybody really feels her consciousness, he should know that I am there behind it and if he feels me it is the same with hers."</p>  </div>

<p><em>(Ashram. Sri Aurobindo alone in his room, surveying within himself his ideal and his mission.)</em></p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: "It is not for personal greatness that I am seeking to bring down the Supermind. I care nothing for greatness or littleness in the human sense. I am seeking to bring some principle of inner Truth, Light, Harmony, Peace into the earth-consciousness. I see it above and know what it is — I feel it ever gleaming down on my consciousness from above and I am seeking to make it possible for it to take up the whole being into its own native power, instead of the nature of man continuing to remain in half-light, half-darkness. I believe the descent of this Truth opening the way to a development of divine consciousness here to be the final sense of the earth evolution. If greater men than myself have not had this vision and this ideal before them that is no reason why I should not follow my Truth-sense and Truth-vision. If human reason regards me as a fool for trying to do what Krishna did not try, I do not in the least care. There is no question of X or Y or anybody else in that. It is a question between the Divine and myself — whether it is the Divine Will or not, whether I am sent to bring that down or open the way for its descent or at least make it more possible or not. Let all men jeer at me if they will or all Hell fall upon me if it will for my presumption, — I go on till I conquer or perish. This is the spirit in which I seek the Supermind, no hunting for greatness for myself or others.</p>
<p>"I have no intention of achieving the Supermind for myself only — I am not doing anything for myself, as I have no personal need of anything, neither of salvation <em>(moksa)</em> nor supramentalisation. If I am seeking after supramentalisation, it is because it is a thing that has to be done for the earth-consciousness and if it is not done in myself, it cannot be done in others. My supramentalisation is only a key for opening the gates of the Supramental to the earth-consciousness; done for its own sake, it would be perfectly futile."</p>  </div>

<p>SRI AUROBINDO: "We are not working for a race or a people or a continent or for a realisation of which only Indians or only Orientals are capable. Our aim is not, either to found a religion or a school or philosophy or a school of Yoga, but to create a ground and a way of spiritual growth and experience and a way which will bring down a great Truth beyond the mind but not inaccessible to the human soul and consciousness.

There is a special personal tie between you and me, between all who have turned to Sri Aurobindo's and my teaching, — it is well understood, distance does not count here, you may be in France, you may be at the other end of the world or at Pondicherry, the tie is always true and living. And each time there comes a call, each time there is a need for me to know so that I may send out a force, an inspiration, protection or any other thing, a sort of message comes to me all of a sudden and I do the needful ... With those whom I have accepted as disciples, to whom I have said 'yes,' there is more than a tie, there is an emanation of me."</p>  </div>

<p><em>(January, 1928. The old Library room in the Ashram. An interview with the Mother. Having turned his back upon his old life, K.D. Sethna, afterwards renamed Amal Kiran by Sri Aurobindo, sits smartly dressed in European style, facing the Mother across a table.)</em></p>
<p>SETHNA: Mother, I have seen the world thoroughly. No more of it. I am sick of intellectual pursuits as well. Now I want nothing except God.</p>
<p>MOTHER: You have seen the world thoroughly? How old are you?</p>
<p>SETHNA: Twenty-three.</p>
<p>MOTHER: Only twenty-three and ...</p>
<p>SETHNA: Yes, Mother. Can I stay here for good?</p>
<p>MOTHER: <em>(Compassionately)</em> Don't decide in a hurry. Stay here now and see how it suits you. Then ...</p>
<p><em>(The Mother rises)</em></p>
<p>SETHNA: Wait a moment, Mother. Let me make my pranam to you. You know, we Indians make a pranam to our Guru.</p>
<p><em>(The Mother smiles. She does not mention that at least a hundred times each day the Ashramites make pranams to her.</em></p>
<p><em>Sethna prostrates before her. She blesses him. Later she relates to Sri Aurobindo how a young Parsi "taught" her the Indian way with one's Guru! Sri Aurobindo enjoys the joke.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Some weeks later. Sea-side, Pondicherry. Sethna, meditating alone in the morning, on the pier. He was worrying in his mind about not having an opening in the heart or any extraordinary spiritual experience. He had been told that he might think of a book in the heart, opening. The mention of a book had put him out a little, for he was sick of the mental pursuits associated with books. In the course of his meditation now, he felt as if the sea were swaying right through his heart in a rhythm of wide delight.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Some time after February 21, 1928, when Sethna has his first Darshan of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. Sethna and the Mother.)</em></p>
<p>SETHNA: May I ask if Sri Aurobindo has said anything about me?</p>
<p>MOTHER: "He has a good face." That's what Sri Aurobindo has said.</p>
<p><em>(The remark strikes home. Sethna is all surprise. He at once remembers that he himself had fixedly scanned Sri Aurobindo's own face at the Darshan moments and found it "good"!</em></p>
<p><em>August 15, 1928. Sethna had his second Darshan, and offers to Sri Aurobindo a poem of his. He comes downstairs into Purani's room and sits still, head bent in dejection. He seemed to have lost the inner consciousness that had abided with him for a long time, almost starting from that moment at the sea-side. He had somehow faced Sri Aurobindo now with the outer mind again.)</em></p>
<p>PURANI: What's the matter?</p>
<p>SETHNA: I don't know.</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly he feels as if a huge solid mass were pressing from above into his head, causing giddiness, bringing strange tears into the eyes and making the heart beat wildly with joy.</em></p>
<p><em>In the afternoon he comes to the Mother to receive a Blessing-garland from her. The Mother takes him into her interview-room.)</em></p>
<p>MOTHER: Do you know what Sri Aurobindo has said this time? There is great change in you, he has said, and he is very pleased.</p>
<p><em>(Sethna falls at the Mother's feet and takes her Blessing.)</em></p>  </div>

<p><em>(Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry. Time: 10 a.m. May 29, 1928. Sri Aurobindo and, at a distance, the Mother.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Aurobindo had sent his secretary Nolini Kanta Gupta to receive Rabindranath Tagore on board the steamer when it was berthed at the pier, and escort him upstairs into the Darshan Room. The Poet came up the stairs and, throwing off his cap and shoes, rushed in, hands outstretched, at the sight of Sri Aurobindo standing at the other end of the room. Sri Aurobindo caught his hands and requested him to sit in a chair.</em></p>
<p><em>At this first look and touch, the Poet appeared overwhelmed and drawn back within himself.)</em></p>
<p>TAGORE: It is eighteen years since you left Bengal. All this time I have longed, off and on, to see you. My longing is fulfilled to-day. But I know it couldn't have been if you hadn't made a special concession for me. Hence, I am all the more grateful to you. As I have already written to you, I am now on my way to Europe. I ask: if they want to know of you, what shall I tell them?</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: I, too, am glad to meet you. As for Europe, if they want to know of me, they are free to come here. My Ashram is open to sincere seekers from anywhere.</p>
<p>TAGORE: I wonder how you can run your Ashram and do your world-wide work from within your room in a corner of the earth. My wonder increases a hundred-fold when I think of my tremendous struggle and labour, in India and abroad, for the Viswabharati. Now I am out seeking help overseas.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: I am not troubled about the future. It's the Divine's work which the Divine does.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Rabindranath quite a different man. He had come all the way upstairs, talking with Nolini Kanta, complimenting him on his literary abilities, appreciating his originality and terseness of expression of thought and wishing him to turn to short stories: In a word, he was vivacious and "social". After the interview with Sri Aurobindo, he came down concentrated and silent. Returning to the steamer he shut himself up in a cabin and spent a long time alone. The Poet's classic reaction to the interview came out in the </em>Modern Review/ of Calcutta some time after.)/</p>  </div>

<p><em>(1940. An eminent Indian political leader and a well-known disciple of Sri Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>LEADER: What does your Guru say about the outcome of the War?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: He says the Allies will win and he is doing his best to see that they win.</p>
<p>LEADER: The Allies despite their series of reverses and their ineptitude? And, even if they win, won't their victory reinforce and perpetuate their imperialism?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: None knows the Allies, their ins and outs, more than Sri Aurobindo, and none has given the British Empire a greater shake-up than he.</p>
<p>LEADER: And yet he lends them his support? Indeed, it is a puzzle to me.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: No puzzle. He has given his crystal-clear and far-reaching reasons for his stand.</p>
<p>LEADER: Tell me, please.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: The Allies will stand for freedom and progress, whereas the axis-powers for world domination. And the axis-powers in the ascendant will throw the world back into serfdom. He has written, speaking for the Mother and himself:</p>
<p>"We feel that not only is this a battle waged in just self-defence and in defence of the nations threatened with the world-domination of Germany and the Nazi system of life, but that it is a defence of civilisation and its highest attained social, cultural and spiritual values and of the whole future of humanity. To this cause our support and sympathy will be unswerving whatever may happen; we look forward to the victory of Britain and, as the eventual result, an era of peace and union among the nations and a better and more secure world-order.</p>
<p>LEADER: Those who know Sri Aurobindo well may share his view but the multitude ...</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: <em>(Interrupting)</em> The Seer and the multitude ... When did they ever see eye to eye?</p>  </div>

<p><em>(On the eve of India's Independence, August 15, 1947. Sri Aurobindo's room. A disciple and Sri Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>DISCIPLE: to-morrow is your birthday and India's — India's rebirth in independence. A divine coincidence. The occasion has attracted an unusually large number of visitors for Darshan.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: It is no accident, to be sure.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: It is the victory of the struggle for independence you led under the captaincy of God, the fulfilment of the word He gave you in Alipore Jail. The Mother has had a flag-staff set up on the top of your room. To-morrow she is going to hoist the flag, because it is India's spiritual flag as well.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: You are right. But a divided India is a mixed blessing. It will entail on the Mother a continuing burden of problems till India has attained her integral solidarity.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: I am sure, if that is God's Will the Mother will bear it with your help and guidance. No truth can rest divided for long.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: That's it. All divisions all over the world must go before it becomes one for the ONE. His Will will triumph over human folly.</p>  </div>

<p>SRI AUROBINDO: Take up <em>Savitri</em>. I want to finish it soon.</p>
<p><em>(Puzzled at the words Nirod looks at the Master's face and finds it impassive. He reads out.)</em></p>

<p>A day may come when she must stand unhelped<br /> On a dangerous brink of the world's doom and hers.</p>
<p>In that tremendous silence lone and lost<br /> Cry not to heaven, for she alone can help.<br /> She only can save herself and save the world.</p>

<p>SRI AUROBINDO: Ah, it is finished? What is left now?</p>
<p>NIROD: The Book of Death and the Epilogue.</p>

<p><em>(December 4, 1950. Sri Aurobindo has not been keeping well for some time. But to-day he seems to feel better. He sits in a chair in spite of his attendants' objections.)</em></p>
<p>AN ATTENDANT: At last, our prayer has been heard! Are you not using your force to get rid of the disease?</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: No.</p>
<p>AN ATTENDANT: <em>(Failing to believe his ears)</em> Why not? If you don't use the force, how is the disease going to be cured?</p>

<p>"To grieve is an insult to Sri Aurobindo, who is here with us conscious and alive."</p>
<p><em>(A profound stillness fails over all. Into drooping spirits passes the force of the Mother's words. An air of assurance reigns. Tears give way to confidence.)</em></p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Scene 6</h1>
  
 
<p><em>(Outside the Ashram. A and B, two disciples of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, in a reminiscent mood.)</em></p>
<p>B: Mother's words have put heart into me. Oh, what a folly had overtaken me! Sri Aurobindo is above Life and Death — the one cannot bind Him, the other cannot touch Him.</p>
<p>A: That's what the Master Yogi is. And even more. His physical presence in the Ashram was never its confinement. With the whole earth for his sphere of action, he was wherever his presence was called for. Space and Time are for us humans, not for the Master of Supramental Yoga. Let us never forget what the Mother has said:</p>
<p>DECEMBER 9, 1950</p>
<p>TO THEE WHO HAST BEEN THE MATERIAL ENVELOPE OF OUR MASTER, TO THEE OUR INFINITE GRATITUDE. BEFORE THEE WHO HAST DONE SO MUCH FOR US, WHO HAST WORKED, STRUGGLED, SUFFERED, HOPED, ENDURED SO MUCH, BEFORE THEE WHO HAST WILLED ALL, ATTEMPTED ALL, PREPARED, ACHIEVED ALL FOR US, BEFORE THEE WE BOW DOWN AND IMPLORE THAT WE MAY NEVER FORGET EVEN FOR A MOMENT, ALL WE OWE TO THEE.</p>
<p><em>(The plates bearing these words of the Mother in English translation and in the French original are fixed on the two sides of the Samadhi, north and south. They attract an assembly of sadhaks, coming up, reading it and pausing beside it, file after file, in a meditative silence.)</em></p>  </div>
