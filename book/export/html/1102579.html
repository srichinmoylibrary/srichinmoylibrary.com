<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us say that you are suffering from certain mental difficulties. You have surrendered to frustration and depression owing to countless problems in your life. You feel that there is light inside your heart, but you find it difficult to go deep within and bring that light into your mind. What you have to do is go to someone who can bring to the fore the light that you have within you. The light that you so desperately need is in your own house. But you have misplaced the key and you do not know how to open the door. So a friend of yours comes and helps you look for the key. After he finds it, he opens the door for you and then he goes away.</p>
<p>If you are ready to search by yourself for the key that you have lost, then you can try. But if you take the help of an expert friend, then you will have more confidence in finding the key. A spiritual teacher is an eternal friend who helps you in your search. He will advise you and offer light so that you can free yourself from your mental suffering.</p>
