    <title>Question: I am familiar with the weightlifting that you have done. Maybe you can give us a little better idea how you prepare for lifting the heavy weights, because I’m sure you don’t just work out with heavy weights all the time.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is mainly a question of my mental preparation, my mental attitude, towards the weights. To start with, I do stretching exercises for 40 or 50 minutes. Sometimes I may take up to an hour. Then I do repetitions with a 10-pound dumbbell and then with 20 pounds. From 20 immediately I go to 300, 310 and 320 — like that. So it is not a gradual progression. I just use my prayer, my meditation and my surrender-life to God’s Will. I pray and meditate and, at the same time, I surrender the results to God’s Will. This is what I do.</p>  </div>
