<p>When I enter into my weightlifting room in this hotel, I feel that prison cells are better. So many huge machines are there, so many cameras, lights. I feel that I cannot breathe. Every second I have to look at my feet to see what is happening, or at my shoulders to make sure I do not bump into a piece of machinery. How can one concentrate?</p>
