<p>As I was walking on the beach this morning, I saw that six or seven Balinese men had gathered to play volleyball. When I walked by, the leader came up to me, folded his hands, and said, "Amitabha, Amitabha!" I said also, "Amitabha, Amitabha!" Then, in case I did not understand, the man told me, "Lord Buddha, Lord Buddha." Soon after that, a Balinese lady saw me and said, "Wise man, wise man."</p>
