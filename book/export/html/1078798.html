<p>Two trains: the train of desire and the train of aspiration. The desire-train starts at the nothingness-hunger-station and stops at the frustration-starvation-station. The aspiration-train starts at the soulfulness-thirst-station and stops at the illumination-feast-station.</p>
<p>If you are a passenger on the desire-train, you may not actually know what is good for you and what is bad for you. You will enter into the desire-train only to suffer. If you are a passenger on the aspiration-train, you do not have to know what is good and what is bad for you, for God Himself chooses for you. Therefore, once you enter into the aspiration-train, you will only prosper and prosper both in the inner world and in the outer world. The inner prosperity is your heart's breathless cry. The outer prosperity is your life's sleepless smile.</p>
