<p>God, I just thought of You.<br /> Let us resume our old friendship.<br /> Let us not quarrel,<br /> Let us not fight.<br /> After all, we are no longer kids.<br /> After all, once upon a time<br /> We were not only good, but best friends.<br /> And in the hoary past<br /> Not only did we love each other,<br /> But also we made tremendous sacrifices for each other.<br /> So, God, let us resume our old friendship,<br /> Since I cannot brook any further delay.<br /> I am sure Your sufferings, too,<br /> Are unbearable.<br /> "Daughter, I loved and still love<br /> And will always love you<br /> Infinitely more than you have ever loved Me.<br /> Therefore, for you to say my sufferings are unbearable<br /> Is a great understatement."</p>
