    <title>&lt;em&gt;Mr. George Riddell:&lt;/em&gt; We have one question from our radio audience. Someone has called in with a question. Her question is: “What do you think of the communication between the living and the dead? Do you think there is a communication?”</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a way to communicate with the dead. As a matter of fact, there are various ways. If one has occult powers or spiritual powers, one can easily communicate with anybody living or departed. What we call "death" is not the extinction of consciousness. It is only a transition. Today I am here; tomorrow I will be in New York. Similarly, now I am here on this earth; after some years, I will be somewhere else in one of the other worlds. On the strength of our Self-Realisation, we can enter into the soul of a person who is either here or elsewhere; either in heaven or in hell.</p>
<p>On earth we can make either a short-distance call or a long-distance call to any part of the world. The telephone is the medium. Similarly, our conscious oneness with God or, we can say, our Self-Realisation, enables us to commune with anybody, whether here on earth or there in heaven.</p>  </div>
