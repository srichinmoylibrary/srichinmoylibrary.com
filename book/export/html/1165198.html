<p><em>N</em> — No</p>
<p>I needs must say "No" to desire's arrival, "No" to fear's embrace, "No" to doubt's poison, "No" to ignorance's leadership, and "No" to death's reign.</p>
<p><em>O</em> — Open</p>
<p>I needs must open myself to the smile of the farthest beyond, to the love of the deepest beyond, and to the blessings of the highest beyond.</p>
<p><em>W</em> — Without and With</p>
<p>Without God's Dream, I was. Now, with His Dream, I am. Without the living, protecting, transforming and immortalising God, I was. That past of mine is buried in oblivion's hush. With me NOW is God's living Breath, His protecting Silence, His transforming Will and His immortalising Delight.</p>  </div>
