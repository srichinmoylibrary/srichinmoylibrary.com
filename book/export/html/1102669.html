<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The goal of religion is to bring God into one's multifarious activities. God has to be felt as a living Reality. Otherwise, if we are just believers in God, we cannot and will not accomplish much. The role of religion is to make each person feel that God is Somebody living and real and that God has infinite Peace, Light and Bliss. This conviction can be brought to the fore by religious feeling or by following a religious faith.</p>  </div>
