<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here on earth not only physical manifestation but all kinds of manifestation can take place. Heaven is perfect. You take rest there after you have played your game. You are tired; you have worked very hard on earth and now you can enjoy yourself. But in Heaven there is no realisation, no manifestation; and that is why we do not give importance to Heaven right now.</p>
<p>Only here on earth can we reveal the Highest. Here we have come into the physical form and here we have to aspire. Real achievement or manifestation we have to win. God is acting through the earth-consciousness. Now we have to know how far we want to go. If we want to climb up the tree and reach one branch, we can stay there or we can continue climbing up the tree. It depends on how far we want to go.</p>  </div>
