<p>The manager of the Ambassador Hotel in Bangkok wanted to talk to me. He had been smoking a cigarette, but as soon as he saw me, he took it out of his mouth and cupped it in his palm because he wanted to show me respect.</p>
<p>This is similar to what happened in India when a friend of mine saw me. But in my friend's case, he put his burning cigarette in his pocket!</p>
