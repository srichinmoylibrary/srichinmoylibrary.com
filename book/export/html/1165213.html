  <h1 class="book-heading">My humility</h1>
  
 
<p>God is my Superior, my only Superior. I am humble to Him. This is my supreme duty. God's children are my equals. I am humble to them. This is my greatest necessity. Pride is my inferior. I am humble to pride. This is my surest safety.</p>
<p>My humility is not self-denial. My humility in silence affirms what I truly have in my world without and what I surely am in my world within.</p>
<p>My humility is not the abstinence from self-love. I love myself. I really do. I love myself because in me the highest Divinity proudly breathes.</p>
<p>Self-conceit tells me that I can easily destroy the world. Self-exploit tells me that the world is at my feet. My humility tells me that I have neither the capacity nor the desire to destroy the world. My humility tells me that the world and I do have the real capacity and the sincere desire to cry for perfect perfection. My humility further tells me that the world is not at my feet, far from it. I carry the world devotedly towards its self-realisation. The world carries me lovingly and openly towards my self-manifestation.</p>
<p>When I am all humility, I neither underestimate nor overestimate my life. What I do is to judge my life exactly, the way my Lord Supreme judges my life.</p>

<p>My soul's owner is Divinity.<br /> My heart's owner is sincerity.<br /> My mind's owner is clarity.<br /> My vital's owner is capacity.<br /> My body's owner is purity.</p>
