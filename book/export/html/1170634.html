<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the soul's world, our faces are very beautiful. But when we enter into the earth-consciousness, we lose much of that beauty. When we are in the soul's world, or when the soul's consciousness permeates our entire body, we become so beautiful, so ethereal â€” with absolutely unimaginable beauty. But when we are in the vital consciousness or physical consciousness, there is such a difference!</p>  </div>
