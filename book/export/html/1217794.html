<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A finer soul does not enter him. But if the person's body and consciousness are transformed totally, then the soul that he already possesses will be in a position to fulfil its Divine Mission here on earth most effectively, in all its supernal, detailed perfection.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Does a change, such as purification, during the lifetime, change the soul?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is the same soul which accepted ignorance and now, throwing away the veil of ignorance, comes closer to its own Divine plenitude and Divine Manifestation.</p>  </div>
