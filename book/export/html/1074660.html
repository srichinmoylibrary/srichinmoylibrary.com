<p>His life is full of din,<br /> His life is full of rush,<br /> His life is full of hurry.<br /> He is a picture of insincerity,<br /> He is a picture of ingratitude,<br /> He is a picture of failure.<br /> He fails to silence the storm of his flesh,<br /> He fails to come out of the abyss of his doubt,<br /> He fails to bury the coffin of his fear.<br /> Yet<br /> He shall be saved,<br /> He shall be liberated,<br /> He shall be fulfilled.<br /> For<br /> He has heard his Master's footfalls.</p>
