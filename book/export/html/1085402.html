<h2>Question: If all Gurus are one instrument of God, why is it so important to have exclusive devotion to only one Guru?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not a question of exclusive devotion. Only you have to know in whom you have implicit faith. All are one, true. But you have all love for your father and for your mother and not for somebody else's father and mother. A real Guru is like a parent. He personally guides you on your spiritual journey and takes you back home safely. Others, like your uncle, can take you, but you have more faith in your father because you know that your father has more concern, more love for you than your uncle does. All Gurus are one, but you have to know that some are like uncles, some are like cousins and some are like nephews. So naturally you have to pay more attention to your father.</p>
<p>One particular Guru has taken utmost responsibility for you, and has promised to take you to your destined goal. So he deserves your exclusive devotion. He is taking the full responsibility to show you the Face of God. Others are only inspiring you, giving you a little help. But in his case, he takes it as his own responsibility. Unless and until he can show you the Face of God, he will not be satisfied.</p>  </div>
