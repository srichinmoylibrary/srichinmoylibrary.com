  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: When will the Russian soul find harmony?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em>: I do not know when the Russian soul will find harmony, but I do know how I as an individual and you as an individual can help the Russian soul have more harmony. If we pray to God to become better human beings, then our good qualities will definitely help the Russian soul to have more harmony, peace and oneness.</p>
<p>It is you who can make the Russian soul happy and proud of you with your own spiritual life. If the children behave well, if they pray and meditate and do the right thing, then the parents feel tremendous joy and satisfaction. So it is up to you and me and others to help the Russian soul have more joy, love and harmony.</p>  </div>
