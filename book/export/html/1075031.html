<p>Death, how often do you speak to God?</p>
<p>"I speak to God constantly."</p>
<p>Can you tell me<br /> What both of you talk about?</p>
<p>"We talk about our achievements<br /> And<br /> Our disappointments.<br /> I tell Him about my achievements<br /> On earth<br /> And my disappointments in Heaven.<br /> God tells me about His achievements<br /> In Heaven<br /> And His disappointments on earth."</p>
<p>I see.<br /> Thank you, Death.</p>
