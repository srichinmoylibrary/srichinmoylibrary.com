<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sincerity means constantly living in the presence of light; that is to say, seeing light within and without at every moment. If you feel light and see light constantly, then automatically sincerity grows. But in order to see and feel light within us, we have to make the mind calm and quiet. If the mind is restless, then we can never be sincere in the purest sense of the term. At that time, from the highest point of view, we are bound to be insincere. If the mind is wanting in peace, then there will be many waves and surges of falsehood inside the mind-sea. These waves have to be brought under control through aspiration. Otherwise, no matter how many years we practise the spiritual life, there is no sure guarantee that we will become sincere.</p>  </div>
