<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People who please me here on earth win definitely go to my place in Heaven. But if you people don’t please me here, will I be such a fool to believe that you will please me in Heaven? Here you say, “Guru please take me to Africa, Australia. Then I will be your best disciple. Here, because of my jealousy I can’t please you. ” Then on the way to Australia in the plane your mind is thinking of somebody else and jealousy again starts. People who please me here will not only go to Heaven, they will go everywhere with me. Anyone who is in my consciousness, wherever I am, he or she will also be. Inwardly I am moving to various planes. If you please me you can go everywhere inwardly, not only to Heaven.</p>  </div>
