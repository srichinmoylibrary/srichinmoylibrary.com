SCA 683-693. Excerpts from an interview with Mr. Edgar Tcheporov, US correspondent of the <em>Literary Gazette</em> (Moscow), on 28 February 1993.</p>
<h2>Question: How would you answer one of the major philosophical questions — “What is the purpose of creation?”</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God the Creator wanted to become God the creation. The tree wanted to bear fruit. Let us say I am the tree. As a tree, I want to bear fruit and then eat the fruits to my heart’s content. Again, I shall sow the seeds that come from the fruits in order to continue my creation.</p>
<p>Originally God’s Message was, “I am.” He was His own Transcendental Reality. Then He said, “Now that I am, I want to have something.” God the Creator wanted to satisfy Himself in a different way — in the role of God the creation. The creation is something that God has and the Creator is something that God is.</p>  </div>
