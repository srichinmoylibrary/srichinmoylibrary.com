<p>"N" No.</p>
<p>I needs must say 'No' to desire's arrival,<br />'No' to fear's embrace, 'No' to doubt's poison,<br />'No' to ignorance's leadership and 'No' to death's reign.</p>
<p>"O" Open.</p>
<p>I needs must open myself to the smile of the farthest beyond, to the love of the deepest beyond and to the blessings of the highest beyond.</p>
<p>"W" Without and with.</p>
<p>Without God's Dream, I was. Now, with His Dream, I am. Without the living, protecting, transforming and immortalising God, I was. That past of mine is buried in oblivion's hush. With me NOW is God's living Breath, His protecting Silence, His transforming Will and His immortalising Delight.</p>  </div>
