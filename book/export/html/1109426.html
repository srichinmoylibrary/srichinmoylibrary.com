<p>"The happiest man is he who can connect the evening of his life with the beginning."</p>
<p>â€” Dante</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we are sincere seekers of the ultimate Truth, then our journey begins with surrender to our parents, who are our well-wishers, our nearest and dearest ones. When we surrender our existence to them, we get joy in abundant measure. Then, when we walk along the path of spirituality, at every moment we try to listen to the dictates of our inner being. The more we listen to our inner being, the greater is our joy, and the higher our fulfilment. And then, when our term is over, when we have to enter into another world for a short rest, if we consciously surrender to God's Will, ours will be the supreme joy, the glory supreme.</p>  </div>
