<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please meditate on the Supreme of each student of yours. You do not have to meditate on each student individually, but try to feel them all as one being meditating right in front of you. When you feel the presence of the Supreme inside the students, please feel that the Supreme in them is learning from the Supreme within you. You have to feel that the Supreme within you is the elder brother. If the elder brother teaches the younger ones, slowly and steadily they will get the wisdom of the elder brother. If you can feel what they are, then you will be able to see that they are part and parcel of what you are.</p>  </div>
