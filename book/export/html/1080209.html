<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The United Nations has a seeking heart and also a oneness feeling. This seeking heart and this feeling of oneness we may not outwardly see; and even if we do see these, we don't see them all the time. But in my case, I see and feel them all the time. These two things please me most: the United Nations feeling of inner oneness, its feeling of world family, and also its seeking heart. These two achievements of the United Nations always please me most.</p>  </div>
