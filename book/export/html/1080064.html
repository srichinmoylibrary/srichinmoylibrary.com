<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many, many qualities but universal oneness is the most important quality that the soul of the United Nations wants to offer. This universal oneness houses both the one and the many. The United Nations is like a tree with countless branches. Here many have become one and, again, one has become many. This moment the United Nations is the tree; the next moment it is the countless branches. A tree without branches is not a tree. Again, if the branches do not belong to a tree, then they cannot exist. Many become one for realisation and one becomes many for manifestation.</p>  </div>
