<blockquote>
<p>"So free we seem, So fettered fast we are."</p>
<p>â€” Robert Browning</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Man is bound <em>to</em> the finite, but he cannot be bound <em>by</em> the finite. Man has surrendered himself to time and space, but neither time nor space has compelled him to surrender. Man tries to possess the beauty of the finite. He thinks that if he can bind himself to the finite, he will be able to possess its beauty. Alas, instead of possessing, he has been possessed. Time and space have lured him. He thought he would be able to possess them with his surrender. They gladly accepted his surrender. But he has been possessed by them mercilessly.</p>  </div>
