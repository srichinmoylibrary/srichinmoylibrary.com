<p>As I was finishing the 5-kilometre race, I saw many people near the finish line. In the last 100 metres, an old man was telling an old lady, "Sri Chinmoy is finishing. He is going ahead of you. Go ahead of him!" But I was sprinting and she could not go ahead of me.</p>
<p>After we finished she asked me what our timing was. But how could I tell her her timing when I was ahead of her? I heard 31:07 for myself, but she was 10 or 15 metres behind me.</p>
