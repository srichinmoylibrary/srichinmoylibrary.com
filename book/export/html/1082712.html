<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Mother Earth becomes extremely, extremely proud of a person who realises God. That is her most precious contribution to Heaven. She says to Heaven, "You gave me the seed, but I germinated it. You brought the soul here, but inside the soul I prepared the body, vital, mind and heart to realise the Highest."</p>
<p>So Mother Earth is extremely proud, and Father Heaven is also proud that Mother Earth did not mistreat this particular person who realised God. Mother Earth helped the person in every way with her compassion, affection, love and concern. Mother Earth gave the person countless opportunities to grow in a spiritual way.</p>  </div>
