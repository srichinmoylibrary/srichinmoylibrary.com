<blockquote>
<p>"They will come back, come back again, As long as the red Earth rolls. He never wasted a leaf or a tree. Do you think He would squander souls?"</p>
<p>â€” Kipling</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again and again we shall have to come back into the world. We have to work for God here on earth. There is no escape. We have to realise the Highest here on earth. We have to fulfil the Highest on earth. God will not allow us to waste or squander the potentialities and possibilities of the soul.</p>  </div>
