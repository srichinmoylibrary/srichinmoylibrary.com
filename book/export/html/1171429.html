<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One thing is to die with God's approval. Another thing is to die with God's tolerance, and a third thing is to die by accidental death. These accidental deaths are caused by hostile forces. There are many who are not destined to die, but some hostile forces attack them either directly or through other individuals who are on earth, such as through assassination. God can approve of someone's death â€” at the age of eighty, someone may die a natural death. At the same time, some extremely powerful hostile forces can snatch away someone's life at an early age for some reason that we may not be able to know. There is no hard and fast rule as to whether the Supreme sanctions someone's death or not. Only this much I can say: hostile forces do exist. We cannot say that all of the deaths that are occurring are fully and gladly approved by God.</p>  </div>
