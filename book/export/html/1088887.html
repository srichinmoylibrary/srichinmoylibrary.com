<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> If the Guru wants to play another selection it's fine with me. Everyone here in the studio was just absolutely flipped out when he was playing. There is a recording on the Folkways label, called 'Music for Meditation." Would you like to do another selection before the show is over?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly.</p>  </div>
