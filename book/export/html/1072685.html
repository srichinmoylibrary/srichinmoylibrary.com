    <title>Question (About the month of September, 1972, which was a period of great turmoil in the inner world): Wouldn&#039;t it be easier on you if some of the things that are happening in the inner world were manifested on the outer plane, instead of your having to take them all on yourself in the inner world?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it would be worse. If they were manifested on earth it would be very frightening, very frightening. This death force is hovering around us like anything. It is just snatching. Whom will it snatch next? It is like a mad elephant. A mad elephant moves around indiscriminately. It does not know where to trample and whom to kill. The forces of this month of September are like that. They are very bad.</p>
<p>I am so happy that in the month of September<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> we have not lost anybody. This month has been really the worst month. Sometimes I literally cry when I walk along the street. I say, "O God, why have You created this particular month?"</p>
