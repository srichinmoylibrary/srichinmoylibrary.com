<p>When he deals with men,<br /> First he takes them<br /> And then he leaves them.</p>
<p>When he deals with angels,<br /> First he ignores them<br /> And then he invokes them.</p>
<p>When he deals with God,<br /> First he loves God with his love,<br /> And then he kills Him with his surrender.</p>
