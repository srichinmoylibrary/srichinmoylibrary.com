<p>"Brother C,<br /> Tell me, how is everything<br /> On earth?"<br /> Earth is crying.<br /> Do you know why?<br /> "No, I do not,"<br /> Earth is crying<br /> Because<br /> All its protests<br /> Against its transformation-life<br /> Are ending in vain.<br /> Brother, this is why<br /> Earth is suffering<br /> And, as you know,<br /> Its suffering will never come to an end.<br /> Before, only earth's heart<br /> Was frightened<br /> By brooding ignorance-night.<br /> Now, earth's entire body-life<br /> Is frightened to death<br /> By illumining-consciousness-light.</p>
