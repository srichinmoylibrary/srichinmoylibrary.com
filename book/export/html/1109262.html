<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Use your imagination-power and feel that this imagination-power is reality-power and not hallucination-power. Imagination and hallucination are two different things. You know that some people have realised God. You have not realised Him, but you do believe that the Christ, Sri Krishna and the Buddha realised God. You accept the Christ's utterance that he and his Father are one, and you accept it because of your imagination. It never crosses your mind that it was his mental hallucination when he said, "I and my Father are one." So when you believe, you exercise your imagination-power.</p>
<p>Imagination-power is very good. Try to make it as big and as vast as possible. You have to stretch and expand your imagination far, farther, farthest; high, higher, highest; deep, deeper, deepest. The sooner you can expand your imagination-power, the sooner you can realise God. Before the scientist discovers something, he uses his imagination-power. Imagination-power is inside the head, but it is not produced by the mind. The mind produces thought. Thought cannot expand; only it binds the world. But imagination-power is constantly expanding. Thought is just one iota of reality, for good or for bad. But imagination is like the vast sky. So if you want to realise who I am, just expand the capacity of your imagination-power.</p>  </div>
