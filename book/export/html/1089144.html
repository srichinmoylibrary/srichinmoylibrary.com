<p>All over the world people have seen quarrels, fights, battles and wars. People are tired of seeing these old things. In Hiroshima the old things reached their lowest abyss. So Hiroshima is the proper place for an absolutely new thing to take birth and to spread its world-illumining light. And this light is oneness-peace in humanity's home.</p>
