<blockquote>
<p>"Love in France is a comedy; in England a tragedy; in Italy an opera seria; and in Germany a melodrama." — Marguerite Blessington</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And love in India is self-dedication.</p>
<p>Love is all-where. It is the common messenger of God and man. Tagore writes: "We know that we are born of love — our relationship is of love, and we feel that our father and mother are the true symbols of our eternal relationship with God." To quote one of his most beautiful lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One word keep for me in thy silence, O world, when I am dead: 'I have loved.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is but love which is never anxious of satisfying itself. And it is love alone that runs across the giant breast of Death, and perhaps beyond.</p>  </div>
