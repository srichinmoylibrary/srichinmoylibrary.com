<p>When I go out to run early in the morning, as soon as Sona hears me coming, he comes out of his bed where he sleeps to see me and get attention. Sometimes he cannot open his eyes even; he comes to me with his eyes closed!</p>
<p>Then he lies down and makes unconditional surrender at my feet. The trouble is that his surrender lasts only for a second — like my disciples’ surrender!</p>
<p>Sometimes when I am going out, Sona looks at me so soulfully and pitifully. Then, when I come back inside, he will not let me come in unless I bless him and show him affection.</p>
<p>See how the animal world is responding to my love and concern! The amount of affection, love and concern that I shower on human beings is unimaginable! But these innocent dogs are responding to my divine qualities most satisfactorily.</p>
<p>27 August 1982</p>  </div>
