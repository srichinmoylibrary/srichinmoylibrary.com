<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Suppose we want to know something that is happening. If we use our intuition power, then we may know the thing without any conscious effort. We don't have to use our intuition power consciously. It is automatic. When we develop intuition power, we do not have to use it consciously. Intuition will just do its inner job. But occult power we have to use consciously in order to know something. Occult power has tremendous force. But we also have to know how to apply occult power consciously for it to work.</p>  </div>
