<p>When I was upstairs today, I heard a peculiar noise. Then I went down to the porch, and I was still hearing the noise. I said, “What is that?” It was really puzzling me.</p>
<p>Today I was hearing that same noise again, so I went down to the bird room to see if the noise was coming from there. When I entered into the bird room, I saw that one of the birds was saying, “Ahh! Ahh!” It was whining!</p>
<p>The bird is not actually suffering. It just whines.</p>
