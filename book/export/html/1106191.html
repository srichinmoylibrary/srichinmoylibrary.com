<p>Today’s weightlifting prayer that I gave before I tried to lift 400 pounds is different from some of my other weightlifting prayers. That is because, in the intuitive world, I knew that I would succeed in my lift today. That much intuition I have. I knew at least a half hour in advance. So today my prayer was:</p>

<p>My Lord Supreme, my Beloved Supreme,<br /> I know, I know, each miracle performed<br /> Here on earth by human beings<br /> Is the descent of Your special Compassion-Blessing<br /> From Your high Vision-Light-Heaven to earth<br /> So that she can inspire her children<br /> To believe in Your higher worlds and inner worlds<br /> And thus become Your choice instruments<br /> To manifest Your Divinity here on earth.</p>
