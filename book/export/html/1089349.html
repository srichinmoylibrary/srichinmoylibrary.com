<p>Amagiri destroyed the boat,<br /> But failed to touch<br /> The pride of the boatman.<br /> No, not as a destroyer does the world know Amagiri,<br /> But through its fateful link with a unique soul.<br /> The Solomon isles suffered with the boatman;<br /> Also with him triumphed.</p>
<p>The swimmer in Kennedy saved his master,<br /> the individual:<br /> An individual whose bosom ached to save the world<br /> From the fetters of ignorance,<br /> From the hunger of poverty,<br /> From the dance of utter ruin;<br /> An individual who visioned the Hour of God,<br /> Tomorrow's Dawn in the very breast of<br /> Today's roaring Gloom.</p>
