<blockquote>
<p>"A life of nothing's nothing worth, From that first nothing ere his birth, To that last nothing under earth."</p>
<p>â€” Tennyson, <em>Two Voices</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But let us sing just the opposite with regard to the life of Tagore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A life of fulness's fulness worth, From that first fulness ere his birth, To that last fulness beyond earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Our lives," Tagore says, "are famished for want of neglected joys within our reach, while we are pursuing chimerical impossibilities."</p>
<p>He writes elsewhere something about life which is very significant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In our life we have one side which is finite, where we exhaust ourselves at every step, and have another side, where our aspiration, enjoyment and sacrifice are infinite."</p>
