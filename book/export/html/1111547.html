  <h1 class="book-heading">The inner and outer running</h1>
  
 
<p>As in the outer running I struggle and struggle and struggle in order to survive — while winning the race is far, far beyond my imagination — even so, most of my disciples struggle and struggle and struggle in the inner running. Unfortunately, the goal is still a far, far cry for them.</p>
<p>But who knows, in the near or distant future I may make satisfactory progress in my outer running, although I just completed half a century. Similarly, my disciples can and will make satisfactory progress in their inner running.</p>
<p>This is my fervent hope, and I do hope that my Beloved Supreme, out of His infinite Bounty, will fulfil my soulful and prayerful wish.</p>
