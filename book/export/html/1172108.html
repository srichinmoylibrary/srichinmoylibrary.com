    <title>Question: I am a student of a Chinese Master, and my Master suggests that when we sleep we should recline on our right side, with one leg straight, and the other one tucked up, with the hand like this. I suppose it is like the images of Buddha. Do you feel that this is appropriate for sleep?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not want to pronounce my judgement when it is a question of something your Master has said. If you follow a path, you have to have implicit faith in what your Master says. I am a Master, and I expect the same kind of implicit faith from my students. When a Master says something, it is absolutely correct according to his understanding for his own followers and disciples, just as what I say is absolutely correct for my followers and disciples. So I cannot pronounce any judgement. If you have a question which concerns your own aspiration, I will say what is best and what is not. But if you follow another Master's path, you should have implicit faith in what he says. I have no right to encourage you to doubt him. If you do not follow his path, naturally you have every right to suspect or doubt a Master. There are some teachers who indulge in judging other Master's teachings, but I am not one of those. If he is a Master, he has every right to offer his views, because God is expressing Himself through this particular Master in a unique way. God is expressing Himself not only through this Master, but through each of us in a unique way.</p>  </div>
