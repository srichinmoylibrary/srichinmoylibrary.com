<p>In Nolini-da's room. "Today's story will be about 24 November 1926. Most of you have read and heard of it from different persons. Today you will hear the story from me. First I shall read it out in English and then in Bengali."</p>
<p>After he read out the English version he said: "Next time I shall read it out in Bengali. Today I have a severe sore throat."</p>
<p>Needless to say, everybody was deeply moved and we all learned something new and special from his talk.</p>  </div>
