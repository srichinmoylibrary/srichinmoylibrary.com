<p>In Lima, Peru, I left my bag in the car with Savyasachi. I had all my money in the bag, as well as my passport. Because the car door was a little open, the bag was almost stolen.</p>
<p>One person came up to Savyasachi's window and tried to distract him by showing him some keys and asking if they were his. Meanwhile, two other people opened the door on the other side and tried to take the bag. Fortunately, Savyasachi had tied the bag to the stick shift, so they couldn't take it.</p>
<p>Now we can laugh about it, but if they had taken it, we would have cried!</p>
