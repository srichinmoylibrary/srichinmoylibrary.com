<p>My mind says to my heart:<br /> "My dear friend, heart,<br /> How have you become so rich?"<br /> I have become rich by spending myself sleeplessly.<br /> "Thanks, my dear friend, heart.<br /> Your way is a little bit difficult for me.<br /> Can you tell me an easier way?"<br /> Yes, I can.<br /> Just expand yourself,<br /> So you are as rich as I am.<br /> Then we will be equal.<br /> Something more:<br /> At long last<br /> We will be one.<br /> "Thanks, my dear friend,<br /> You have not only illumined me<br /> But also fulfilled me."</p>
