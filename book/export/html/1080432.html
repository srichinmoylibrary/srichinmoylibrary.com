<p>When I live in the body-consciousness, I must give due value to fleeting time. When I live in the soul-consciousness, I must give due value to Eternal Time. Fleeting time makes me aware of what I am missing and what I will be gaining. Eternal Time makes me aware of what I have to give to God's creation, His universal Life. It also makes me aware that God the transcendental Vision and God the universal Reality are bound together for me by the bridge of my self-giving. My connecting link is founded on my self-giving.</p>  </div>
