<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He will tell the youngest son that he is not the Father, but he is on intimate terms with the Father. I always tell my disciples that the real Master, the real Guru, is God Himself, not any human being. But the spiritual Master is like the eldest member of the family. He knows all about the Father and he knows where the Father is. He tells the little ones that he can take them to the Father. Once he shows them where the Father is, then his business is over. Once the younger ones see the Father and see Him operating, then the rest of their progress is something between them and the Father.</p>  </div>
