  <h1 class="book-heading">The lady and her dog</h1>
  
 
<p>An old lady had a dog which was extremely dear to her. Her friends felt that she loved the dog more than she loved her children or even her husband. One day the dog left her house and got lost. Where it went, nobody knew. The lady was very sad and miserable. She and the members of her family went looking for it in so many places. Finally she phoned up the police and said, “I will give you a big reward if you find my dog.”</p>
<p>One of the policemen said, “Certainly we shall look for it, but now it is raining heavily.”</p>
<p>The lady said, “My dog has not eaten for one day.” The policeman assured her, “Even if your dog does not eat for two or three days, the dog won’t die.”</p>
<p>The lady was very happy to hear that. She said, “Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“I am sure,” said the policeman. “What colour is it?”</p>
<p>“White and brown,” the lady told him. Then she said, “I will tell you a secret. You must not tell anybody.”</p>
<p>The policeman said, “No, I won’t tell anybody.”</p>
<p>She said, “My dog has started talking. He talks like a human being.”</p>
<p>The policeman said, “Who knows, perhaps your dog is trying to call you right now. I had better hang up.”</p>
<p>He was a joker, so he relayed the story to one of his friends. His friend, who was an infinitely worse joker, said to the police man, “Your part is over. Now my part will start.”</p>
<p>“What will you do?” asked the policeman.</p>
<p>“I will do something. Then I will let you know,” the friend answered, and he took the phone number of the lady from the policeman.</p>
<p>The friend had a very ugly, dirty dog that he wanted to get rid of. He did not like the dog at all, but his son liked it. Now he thought of giving his son a beautiful new dog.</p>
<p>So he took his own dog and tied it to a fire hydrant. Then he phoned up the lady and said, “My friend spoke to me and gave me a description of your dog. The description seems to fit the dog that I have found. Again, I see it likes to talk like a human being. I can’t understand the diction, but it uses a human voice. Does your dog talk?”</p>
<p>The lady said, “Yes, yes!”</p>
<p>The man said, “I tied it to a fire hydrant on a leash. I will tell you the address and you can go and get it.”</p>
<p>The lady said, “I want to give you a gift or a reward. How can I give it to you if I just go to get the dog without seeing you?”</p>
<p>The man said, “You don’t have to give me any money. We are policemen. Our job is only to help anyone who needs help. We want only peace and happiness in this society. This is our job. We cannot accept any rewards.”</p>
<p>The lady was so excited. She called her husband on the phone to say a policeman had found the dog. At first the husband had doubts, but because the wife was so excited, he also believed it. He felt that perhaps the policeman had been telling the truth. So the lady, her husband and two of her grandchildren went to the spot. She was so excited and happy, but as soon as she saw the actual dog, she cried out, “O my God, this is not my dog!” and she fainted.</p>  </div>
