<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A few days ago, on our way back from Washington D.C., we went to a service station to buy chocolate. I was outside the car. Two young American men came out. They were looking at me with utmost contempt, but I was smiling at them. One was a bad fairy and the other was a good fairy. Bad and good were mixing together. If the good one had seen me alone, perhaps his reaction would have been different. But because he was with the bad one, they both looked at me with contempt.</p>  </div>
