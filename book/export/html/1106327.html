<p>Yesterday I had splendid talk with five Yogi-Friends of mine. I asked them if God was ever displeased with them after they had won their realisation.</p>
<p>My Yogi-Friend A said, "Oh yes, God has been displeased with me quite a few times. He wants me to discard all my disciples. He wants me to have only that person as my disciple who is all love, devotion, and all surrender to me."</p>
<p>My Yogi-Friend B said, "God has been displeased with me many times. He says that I am incredibly indulgent to my disciples. He wants me to act like a commander."</p>
<p>My Yogi-Friend C said, "Twice God has been extremely displeased with me: once when I said that my disciples are worse than useless, and once when I said I want to leave the earth."</p>
<p>My Yogi-Friend D said, "God has not only been displeased with me on many occasions, but also has scolded me mercilessly a good many times. He says that I am a real fool. In my Boat there are many insincere passengers. The Boat is heavily loaded. According to God, there is every possibility of the Boat capsizing because of the thunder-doubts, dragon-worries and shower-fears of the insincere passengers. He also says that the very few sincere seekers who are in the Boat unfortunately will have the same fate as the useless passengers have. He wants me to tell the unaspiring passengers to leave my Boat immediately."</p>
<p>My Yogi-Friend E said, "I badly displease God when I cry to Him to nullify and to forgive the consequences of my disciples' misdeeds. I also considerably displease Him when I embrace the punishment caused by the disciples' misdeeds. Otherwise, God has been fairly pleased with me."</p>
<p>Now My Yogi-Friend asked me whether God has ever been displeased with me or not. Before I ventured to open my mouth, God opened His Mouth on my behalf.</p>
<p>"I utilize all My time in thinking of him. I have no time left to be displeased with him."</p>
<p>"My Lord, may I say something?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. But be sure to see eye to eye with Me."</p>
<p>"Of course. My Lord eternal Compassion, Your time is supremely precious. My Lord, You are doing the right thing. Out of Your infinite Bounty, You are not wasting Your time by showing Your Face of displeasure to me, the eternal culprit."</p>
<p>"I see you have not listened to My express request. This time, I must punish you."</p>
<p>"Oh Lord of my life, Oh Lord of my soul, Oh Lord of my goal, Your strong punishment I always deserve. Your true punishment I always pray for. To me, nothing is sweeter, nothing is dearer, nothing is more intimate, nothing is more illumining and fulfilling than Your kindest punishment."</p>
<p>"My Son, I wish I could be as earthly clever and heavenly wise as you are."</p>
<p>â€œMy Lord, do not worry, I shall grant You that boon. Just allow me touch Your ever-forgiving Feet."</p>
<p>"Touch My Feet. You can pinch My Feet. You can bite My Feet. You can kiss My Feet."</p>
<p>"My Lord, I am not going to pinch Your Feet. I am not going to bite Your Feet. I am not going to kiss Your Feet. I am going to devour Your Feet of ceaseless Compassion."</p>
<p>"All right. You have devoured My Feet. What about your boon to Me? When are you going to make Me as clever and as wise as you are?"</p>
<p>"My Lord, right now."</p>
<p>Having placed my Lord's Feet on the life-breath of my soul,</p>
<p>I said, "Amen."</p>  </div>
