<p>I had to bring from my house my suitcase, my bag and my other things. Also, I had to say farewell to my sister because she was not going to come to the airport. My usual farewell is to meditate with her. We went inside to meditate, and then, can you imagine? The Florida lady, who was outside in the street, had to come inside our house! The door was open because I had gone back to collect my things, and suddenly the Florida lady was standing inside the house. It was too much!</p>
<p>My sister said, “Don’t be mad. This is not the time. Prove that you have got poise; you have got poise; you have got poise. Don’t be mad. For God’s sake, don’t ruin your day! And I have seen your disciples. They are no better than this crazy lady! I know all your life you have been crazy. That’s why you are blessed with all crazy disciples. All your disciples are crazy and you are crazy, so now here is another crazy person. For God’s sake, don’t get mad! Don’t ruin the meditation.”</p>
<p>Then I entered into my sister’s room. The Florida lady was inside our house, but luckily, not inside my sister’s room. I meditated with my sister for five or six minutes. Very nicely I went into my highest consciousness to prove that I can meditate. My sister was extremely pleased.</p>  </div>
