<p>The people at Sears told me about another shop very nearby which sold flowers, plants and so forth. When I went there, I saw two toy elephants for six dollars. Sometimes I tell you people what you were in your previous animal incarnations. In X's case, in her last animal incarnation she was an elephant, so I wanted to buy her these elephants. By this time she has a very large collection of elephants.</p>
<p>I said, "Let me buy these two toy elephants." I went to give the lady behind the counter six dollars. She said, "Why six dollars?"</p>
<p>I said, "It is mentioned there, six dollars."</p>
<p>She said. "The price is three dollars."</p>
<p>I said "Three dollars?"</p>
<p>She said, "Yes."</p>
<p>Here this lady was telling me that I was giving too much money, and just two minutes before that I was about to be arrested.</p>  </div>
