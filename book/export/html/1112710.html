<p>Another time I went to Bermuda for three days alone. The hotel was beautiful. It was near the water. But that time also it was raining heavily the whole time and I could not even go out. I only went across the street once to a Chinese restaurant. During those three days I wrote two hundred poems; that was my only consolation.</p>  </div>
