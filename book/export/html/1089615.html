<p>A father and mother were both extremely fond of their child, who was only six years old. They were a very, very happy family. One day the child did something wrong and the father was very upset, so he gave the child a smart slap. Then the child cried and the father felt absolutely miserable. The father tried to console the child by giving him four rupees.</p>
<p>When the child got the money, he started crying more loudly and pitifully. The father said, "Why are you crying? I gave you a slap, but now I am consoling you. I will not slap you any more. Why are you still crying?"</p>
<p>The son said, "I am crying more powerfully and pitifully because I have to ask you something."</p>
<p>"What do you have to ask me?" the father said.</p>
<p>The son said, "Will you promise me that each time you give me a slap, you will increase the amount of money you give me?"</p>
<p>"What?" cried the father.</p>
<p>The son said, "I did something wrong, and you gave me a slap. Now I will do something even worse. Each time I do something worse, will you not give me another slap and more money?"</p>
<p>The father said, "What are you saying?"</p>
<p>The son said, "I want to be punished by you every time I do something wrong. Each time my crime will be worse, so you can give me a harder slap if you wish. I will not mind at all. But you have to give me a larger amount of money, too."</p>
<p>The father said, "What kind of son do I have? He is ready to be slapped for money. Why did I make the mistake of giving him money the first time? Each time he wants the slap to be harder. He does not mind being slapped if he receives a larger amount of money!"</p>  </div>
