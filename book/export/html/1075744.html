<p><em>(Baroda. Aurobindo's own chamber. He is rapt in his studies. His room is a treasure-house of the Goddess of Learning. Suddenly he closes his book.)</em></p>
<p>AURO: I simply don't know how man can go on doing anything against his inner preference for long. My nature revolts at the Administrative Service. The work I am doing is not at all congenial to me. I'll ask the Gaekwar to shift me to his College.</p>
<p><em>(Enter a peon and hands Aurobindo a letter)</em></p>
<p>PEON: Sir, His Highness the Gaekwar requests the favour of your company at lunch and he seeks for your advice to settle a serious matter.</p>
<p>AURO: I see. Thank you.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Dinendra Kumar Roy)</em></p>
<p>AURO: Dinen Babu, His Highness has asked me to lunch. So I have to miss your company to-day.</p>
<p>DINENDRA: It is so kind of the Gaekwar. But isn't it time for you to be there?</p>
<p>AURO: <em>(Looking at his watch)</em> Yes, it is. I'm off.</p>  </div>
