<h2>Editor's preface</h2>

<p>The Reverend George Pattison, Dean of King’s College Chapel, Cambridge University, invited Chinmoy to offer a talk about Sri Aurobindo and a Peace Concert in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Sri Aurobindo’s <em>Mahasamadhi</em>.</p>
<p>Chinmoy’s visit to Cambridge took place on November 1st, 2000. After attending evensong in the Chapel where Sri Aurobindo used to pray, Chinmoy offered the following talk and gave a Peace Concert in Keynes Hall.</p>
<p>This was the second time Chinmoy had been invited by the Dean to observe Sri Aurobindo’s most significant connection with Cambridge University. On November 12th, 1997 Chinmoy offered a talk on Sri Aurobindo and a Peace Concert at King’s College Chapel in honour of the 50th anniversary of India’s independence.</p>  </div>

<p>Dear Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>It was a great pleasure and honour to welcome you to King’s College last week, and to be able to share in your tribute to Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p>I’m sure that everyone who was present felt something of the special bond uniting you to Aurobindo, a spiritual relationship that has been so fruitful for the cause of peace in the world, and that will continue to be an inspiration to many.</p>
<p>I was touched by the reverential participation of your students in our Chapel service. Also the College staff were appreciative of their co-operativeness and efficiency in setting up and clearing away afterwards.</p>
<p>Your kindness to me personally was humbling. Praise to the Spirit in which and by which we are set free and made one!</p>
<p>With every good wish for your work in the future.</p>
