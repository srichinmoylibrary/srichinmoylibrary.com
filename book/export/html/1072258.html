    <title>Bill Pearl: I really, truly appreciate that. So would you say that what you’re attempting to do is to show people what can be done and how far a person can go if he puts his mind and heart and soul into a specific endeavour?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is precisely what I am doing! I am not a bodybuilder, I am not a weight-lifter; I am a God-lover. Because I am a God-lover, my Beloved Supreme is trying, in and through me, to inspire people who are trying to aspire. Among the bodybuilders and weight-lifters there are also people who love God and want to have a higher life, an inner life. So He is trying to utilise me to be of service to them.</p>  </div>
