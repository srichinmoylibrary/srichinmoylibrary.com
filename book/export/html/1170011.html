<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When will the Supreme introduce a new educational system? The Supreme will introduce a new educational system only when our consciousness becomes more receptive, more aspiring, more self-giving.</p>
<p>How will the Supreme introduce a new educational system? The Supreme will introduce a new educational system by making us feel that the new educational system is nothing but self-illumination and life-perfection.</p>  </div>
