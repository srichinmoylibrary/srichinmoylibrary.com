<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People experience delight in different ways according to their power of receptivity. If different individuals have the same level of consciousness, they will experience delight in the same way and with the same intensity. Again, seekers who are not on the same plane of consciousness will experience delight in different ways. For example, when you see something from the top of a tree, you see it in one way. When you climb down to the middle of the trunk, you see the same thing in a different way. And when you stand at the foot of the tree, you may see it in still a different way. But again, if you have wide vision, very powerful vision, then from the top of the tree, from the middle of the tree and from the foot of a tree you will see a thing in the same way. This is also true of experiencing delight.</p>  </div>
