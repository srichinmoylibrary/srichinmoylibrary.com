<p>From December 13, 1985 to January 13, 1986, Sri Chinmoy gave a total of nine concerts in Tokyo, Kamakura, Nagoya, Kyoto, Fukuyama, Hiroshima and Beppu as part of a worldwide Peace Concert series begun in 1984. The following pages record some of the peace activities of Sri Chinmoy and his students during the Japan concert tour, including messages for the people of Japan, interviews with eminent Japanese, songs composed during the trip and press and television coverage.</p>
<p>Through these many diverse events Sri Chinmoy offered his universal message of peace to the people of Japan. In so doing, he expressed his love for the nation whose own unique message of peace he deeply reveres.</p>  </div>
