    <title>Question: So what you are saying is that maybe some of the qualities that were missing in the West are starting to take hold. Is there a need for a spiritual leader to leave the West and go to the East to teach frankness and honesty to the East?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The East still needs these qualities. But it is up to the Supreme to decide when the time is ripe. We call it God's Hour. When God's Hour strikes, I am sure the Supreme will send some spiritual figures to the East to cultivate the qualities that they badly lack. The hour has struck for the West; therefore, spiritual leaders came to the West to be of service. Similarly, the hour will strike in the East when someone will be inwardly asked or commanded to go to the East and do the needful there.</p>  </div>
