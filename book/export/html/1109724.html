<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am not at all involved in the politics at the United Nations. I am involved only in the aspiration. I do not deal with the politics of the politicians, diplomats and delegates. I do not discuss with them anything about their political activities. I go there only to pray and meditate. There are some people at the United Nations who feel that the way we are trying to bring about peace — through prayer and meditation — is the right way. But on the political level I have no voice. My way is the way of prayer and meditation. I am not involved in any political activities.</p>  </div>
