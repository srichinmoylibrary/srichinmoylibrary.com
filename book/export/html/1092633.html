<p>Our mother's human brother saw the earth<br /> Eighteen long years before his sister of lore.<br /> Tranquillity was in flood in Mother's core,<br /> But to ruthless ire he opened his bosom's door.</p>
<p>One day he saw his anger as hell's own breath;<br /> He pushed it for ever far with his hero-will;<br /> And from that hushful hour he cherished its death,<br /> And lived true kin to his sister-sovereign-still.</p>
