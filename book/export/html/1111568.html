<p>In the four-mile race, Pulin was behind me most of the way. When we turned around to go back at the two-mile point, I saw that he was behind me and I was very happy. Then after three and a half miles, he increased his speed and passed me. Then he went ahead of Hangsa. I said, "Good!" Then he went ahead of some other people. He was showing off.</p>
