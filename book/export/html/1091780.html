<p>Once Akbar grabbed Birbal and said, "Now let me see how much strength you have. Can you release yourself? Can you escape from my grip?"</p>
<p>Birbal did not struggle or try to force his way out of the Emperor's grip. He simply started repeating, "Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama!"</p>
<p>Akbar cried, "What is this? By repeating 'Rama, Rama, Rama,' do you think that you will be able to release yourself and escape? I am holding you very tightly. 'Rama' will never release you. You fool! Exercise your power to come out of my grip!"</p>
<p>Birbal said, "You know that when one is haunted by a ghost, repeating Rama's name makes the ghost leave the body. It seems that you are worse than a ghost."</p>
<p>Akbar said, "No, no, no! I do not want to be worse than a ghost!" And he immediately released the Minister, who laughed and laughed.</p>  </div>
