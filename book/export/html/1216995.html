<p>The funniest thing happened with my dearest Sulochana in Athens.</p>
<p>I was standing in one place and Sulochana was about twenty metres away. She started coming towards me very fast, but she didn't see me. When she was three or four metres away, I said, "Sulochana!"</p>
<p>Then she saw me standing there and was so surprised!</p>
<p>Like a magnet I was pulling her towards me, but she didn't see me at all.</p>
