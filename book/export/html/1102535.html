<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind can be self-giving like the heart. But right now the mind that we use is the limited mind. When we live in the limited mind, we feel that we have only five cents to our name, and if we give it away, then we will have nothing. But there is also an unlimited mind. If we become one with the unlimited mind, then there is no question of becoming impoverished in life. If the mind comes to feel that it is limitless, then no matter how much it gives of itself, it remains infinite.</p>
