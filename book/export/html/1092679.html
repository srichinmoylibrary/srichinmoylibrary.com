<p>On 5 July 1943 in Singapore, Netaji announced to the world the existence of the Indian National Army. He voiced forth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have said that today is the proudest day of my life. For an enslaved people, there can be no greater pride, no higher honour, than to be the first soldier in the army of liberation. I assure you that I shall be with you in darkness and in sunshine, in sorrow and in joy, in suffering and in victory....</p>
<p>"My soldiers! Let your battle-cry be 'To Delhi! To Delhi!' How many of us will survive this war of freedom I do not know. But I do know this: that we shall ultimately win and our task will not end until our surviving heroes hold the victory parade on another graveyard of the British Empire."</p>
