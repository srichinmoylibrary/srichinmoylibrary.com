  <h1 class="book-heading">Dr. Davis: This is very interesting. The path to spirituality is a very complex one.</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The path to spirituality is not complex. Only there are different roads. If you want to go to Rome from some place in Europe, you can go by car, you can go by boat, you can go by airplane. If you go by plane, it is faster than the fastest. But if you take a boat, God knows how many days it will take. And if you are stupid enough to just start walking, then the road will never end!</p>
<p>In the spiritual life there are two main roads to take us to our destination. One road is longer than the longest; it is zig-zag and serpentine. That is the road of the mind. The other road is the road of the heart. This road is shorter than the shortest. You can say it is a sunlit road.</p>
<p>If you choose the mind-road, you will be constantly haunted by self-doubt: "Am I doing the right thing?" Or you will bring into your system the doubts of others. You will ask yourself, "What are they thinking? Are they saying that I am on the right course?" But if you follow the heart, it is not like that at all. Here there is a magnetic pull between God and you. He is your dearest Father and you are His dearest child, so both of you are using your own special magnets to pull one another closer."</p>
<p><em>Dr. Davis:</em> So I am on the right track! It is good that I came to see you. I needed this confirmation. It is truly amazing. It is incredible. I started meditating on the heart because I feel that to protect myself, I must keep my heart pure. I like to radiate peace, love and joy, and I like my face to give off a smile and brilliance. In order for my face to show that, I must feel it inside. I am trying to keep my heart as an open vessel. There's a trait of youthfulness in me. I try to feel youthful, alive and energetic inside, and I hope it radiates.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day if you think of yourself as a child of four or five years old, then a childlike simplicity, sincerity and purity will abound in your life.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Davis:</em> That is how I think of myself. What you are saying to me is very timely.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your childlike qualities will always inspire others. The very presence of a child gives inspiration. When a child comes into a room, he brings spontaneous joy. And his joy is contagious; it enters into the elderly people who may be quarrelling and fighting there.</p>
<p>Each child is a new dream of God, bringing love, sheer love. When God's Dream enters into these elderly people who are quarrelling and fighting, they have to be silent. When a child is running here and there, he does not look at my face or your face to see how beautiful you are or how ugly I am. He just runs and shares his spontaneous joy with everybody. Your very presence radiates that kind of love. You do not have to look at somebody; you just have to be there and the love spreads.</p>  </div>
