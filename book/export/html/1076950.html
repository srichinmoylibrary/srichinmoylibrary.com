<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is only through Yoga that man can realise God. Yoga means "union" â€” man's conscious union with God.</p>
<p>There are three major kinds of Yoga: Bhakti Yoga, the path of love and devotion, Karma Yoga, the path of selfless service and Jnana Yoga, the path of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p>Now, all paths lead to Rome, but one may get us there a little quicker or easier. My path, which we call the Sunlit Path, is the path of love, devotion, and surrender.</p>
<p>It is up to the individual aspirant which path he feels best suited for. One has to be careful, however, not to follow a false teacher. A false teacher can bring your life to ruin.</p>
<p>But again, I must say, if one follows a real spiritual path, he will eventually reach the goal. All paths lead ultimately to the same goal.</p>  </div>
