  <h1 class="book-heading">VI. Equanimity</h1>
  
 
<p>Equanimity is the hyphen between God's Compassion and man's surrender.</p>
<p>Equanimity is the all-covering, all-protecting umbrella of true wisdom.</p>
<p>Whatever takes place in the divine Providence is not only for the best, but also inevitable, because there is no alternative.</p>
<p>A realised soul is he who is above likes and dislikes. He lives in the world cheerfully, but he is not of it.</p>
<p>Equanimity can by no means imply an inert acceptance. Far from it, equanimity is the living faith of a seeker in the divine Dispensation.</p>
<p>To be able to endure the buffets of life firmly and calmly is to have the full taste of matchless equanimity.</p>
<p>To take the inevitable, unmoved, for our Goal is a divine blessing. The cheering motto of our life can ever be:</p>
<p>"It is Love's supreme decree, That only Good can come to me."</p>  </div>
