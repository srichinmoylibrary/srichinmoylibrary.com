<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> According to my inner feeling the United Nations has definitely contributed something very sublime to the consciousness of America. At every moment the United Nations is aiming at world brotherhood, world peace, world harmony and world oneness. America is undoubtedly the right place for the United Nations to be, for America is constantly offering hope and promise to the world at large. America embodies at once humanity's hope and Divinity's promise.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the United Nations is getting ample opportunity from America as regards hope and promise. On the other hand, the United Nations itself, through its inner capacities, is transforming hope into reality and promise into fulfilment. The United Nations needs a few things from America and it has found them. Again, America needs a few things from the United Nations, and the United Nations is more than willing to offer them. The soul of America is promise and the soul of the United Nations is the fulfiller or, you can say, co-ordinator of that promise. They go together. The soul of the United Nations looks around and offers the reality to those who need it and care for it. And the soul of the United States, from above, looks down to the foot of the tree and offers Divinity's promise to all those who are aspiring to climb up to the topmost branches.</p>  </div>
