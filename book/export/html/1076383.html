<p><em>(A few weeks later.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Naren sings:)</em></p>

<p><em>Ore mor kheya ore mor neye</em><br /><em>Ore ananda bani</em><br /><em>Niye jao mor trishita kshudhita</em><br /><em>Supta chitta khani</em></p>
<p>[O my boat, O my Boatman, <br /> O Message of Transcendental Delight,<br /> Carry me. My heart is thirsty and hungry,<br /> And it is fast asleep at the same time.<br /> Carry my heart to the other shore.]</p>

<p>VIVEKANANDA: Still I have not received a reply from my divine Mother. But just last night I had a most significant dream in which I saw Sri Ramakrishna proceeding to the West over the waves and waters. This I have taken as approval of my plan.</p>
<p><em>(Enter a peon. He hands Vivekananda a letter.)</em></p>
<p>VIVEKANANDA: Thank you.</p>
<p><em>(Exit the peon)</em></p>
<p>VIVEKANANDA: Ah! From my divine Mother! <em>(Reads the letter.)</em> I have received wholehearted permission from my spiritual Mother. Now with redoubled faith I am able to undertake the voyage to America. A spiritual force of Sri Ramakrishna’s power will forever retain its dynamism. It will spread beyond the narrow limits of one little province, of one country, of one continent. The renown of my Master’s spiritual teachings shall travel far and wide, touching the heart of the world and awakening its slumbering soul.</p>  </div>
