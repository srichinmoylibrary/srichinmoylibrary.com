<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely good intentions count even if they are not carried out. But if these good intentions are carried out eventually, then you are successful. Just to have good intentions is to get 20 or 30 out of 100. But if the good intentions are carried out, then you get 100 out of 100. If you do not have good intentions, then you get zero. If you have bad intentions, then you get infinitely worse than zero. To have good intentions itself is like taking a giant step towards a remote destination.</p>  </div>
