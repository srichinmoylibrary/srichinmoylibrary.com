<p>To athletes who are not doing satisfactorily and are experiencing failure, Carl Lewis’s life — with its “Never give up!” motto — is a source of inspiration and encouragement. In the earlier part of his athletic career, unlike his present and abiding golden days, he was quite accustomed to sad failure and frustration. But he did not give up. He continued, only to be gloriously and enduringly successful, not in one, not in two, not in three, but in four events: the 100 metres, the long jump, the 200 metres and the relay.</p>
