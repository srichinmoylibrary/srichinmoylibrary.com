SCA 634-644. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 14 December 1997 at Lake Atitlán, Guatemala.</p>
<h2>Question: If the soul of a dog has the opportunity to advance to a human life, why would it choose to have another animal incarnation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have the opportunity to realise God in this incarnation, and you have such a wonderful spiritual Master! Then why are you wasting your time? The spiritual Master brings nectar, but the disciples do not drink. Do all the disciples not have the opportunity to run faster than the fastest? Who does not have the opportunity, specially when a spiritual Master of my calibre comes? But how many of you are taking advantage of this opportunity? The limit is only how much receptivity one can have.</p>
<p>Believe me, right now I can give you people very high experiences — high, higher, highest. Sri Ramakrishna had the capacity to touch someone and bless him with the highest experience. Naren (Swami Vivekananda) was doubting whether Sri Ramakrishna had realised God. When Sri Ramakrishna touched his head, he started entering into trance. Then he cried, “I have a mother, I have a father! Bring me down, bring me down!”</p>
<p>The difficulty is that we are not ready. God is ready to give God-realisation to everybody at this very moment, but who is ready? If you put a dollar in front of a child, he is so satisfied. That dollar becomes his whole world. Even if you bring thousands of dollar bills and put them in front of the child, he does not care. Right now one dollar is so sufficient for him that he does not want more. So, to come back to your question, in exactly the same way, the dog is satisfied with another animal incarnation.</p>  </div>
