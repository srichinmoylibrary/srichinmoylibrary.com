<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If a person is not a sincere seeker, then weightlifting can cause many problems. It can increase the ego. It can increase aggression. It can increase many negative qualities. Again, there are many weightlifters who are not excellent seekers but who have good hearts and a conscious feeling of love. In their case, they do not and cannot have aggression. But if there is no aspiration behind ones weightlifting, then there is every possibility that one can become a victim to aggression.</p>  </div>
