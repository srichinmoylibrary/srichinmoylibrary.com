<p>After I finished running, I went to buy a new tennis racquet. The shopkeeper said that he wanted my jacket. It was the jacket with the hood. He asked, "Where did you get it from?" I said, "I do not know. It was a gift." This was the jacket that Nilima gave me. The man said, "I want to keep it and sell it in my store."</p>
