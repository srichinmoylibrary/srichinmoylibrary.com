<p>Last night in Puerto Rico, Kamalakanta and I were running in the heavy rain. The streets were in very bad condition, and we passed two or three bars where the people were very undivine. But the rain gave us extra energy. Even though I hadn't eaten in days, we walked and ran over four miles. So if you don't eat, perhaps you get extra energy.</p>
