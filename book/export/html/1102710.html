<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We say that someone is an atheist because he says that there is no God. I say there is a God, but he says, "No God, no God, no God!" When he goes to that extreme, he will see that his negative feeling itself is a form of positive feeling. At the extreme, he says that there is nothing. But what he calls nothing is, for us, something; and that very thing we call God.</p>
<p>Sometimes the sky is overcast with clouds and no moon or stars are visible. We know that when these clouds are dispersed, we will immediately be able to see the moon and the stars. But an atheist cannot see beyond the clouds.</p>
