<p>Nehru's entrance into the world: November 14, 1889<br />Kennedy's departure from the world: November 22, 1963</p>

<p>Slowly, steadily, unerringly<br /> Nehru fought.<br /> He won the fight.<br /> Youthfully, speedily, dynamically<br /> Kennedy ran.<br /> He won the race.</p>
<p>Kennedy-Nehru.<br /> Nehru-Kennedy.<br /> Two are the hearts<br /> That ached to fling wide<br /> The windows of slumbering faith<br /> In the house of humanity.</p>
<p>God's Fragrance of Peace,<br /> God's Bliss of Freedom<br /> In measureless measure<br /> They knew how to inhale,<br /> They knew.</p>
<p>Never were they parched<br /> In the deserts of false hopes.<br /> Desires they had for the world.<br /> God slaked their thirst<br /> In His own mystic way.</p>
<p>Nehru-Kennedy.<br /> Kennedy-Nehru.<br /> They are one, indivisible.<br /> They are one, invincible.<br /> They are one, a tornado Of God's stupendous smile<br /> Toppling the towers of sorrow,<br /> Fear and defeat.</p>
