  <h1 class="book-heading">Humility and compassion</h1>
  
 
<p>What I have is humility, and what God has is Compassion. Humility is my soulful gift to my Lord Supreme. Compassion is my Lord's fruitful gift to me.</p>
<p>My humility is supported by two significant members of my inner family: softness and tenderness. God's Compassion is supported by two sublime members of His inner family: Love and Concern.</p>
<p>My hidden treasure is my fully blossomed humility. God's open treasure is His fully revealed Compassion.</p>
<p>My humility has a free access not only to those who love me and need me, but also to those who do not love me and who do not need me. God's Compassion is always unconditional. God's Compassion is for all. It is the seeker in me, on the strength of his receptivity, who receives God's Compassion. God the Compassion is only for those who try and try, but for whom success still remains a far cry. Just because God the Compassion is for them, ultimately they will not only receive God the Compassion, but they will also become most perfect instruments of God.</p>
<p>I am my humility-tree to please my Lord Supreme in His own way. God is His Compassion-rain to fulfil me and immortalise me in His own supreme way.</p>
