<p>My Lord,<br /> If I dislike someone vehemently,<br /> What is the best way to deal with<br /> That person?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> There is not just one,<br /> But there are many ways<br /> To deal with that person:</p>
<p>"First,<br /> Do not express<br /> Your volcanic anger.</p>
<p>"Second,<br /> Think and feel<br /> That you have the capacity<br /> To mould and shape that person<br /> Into a perfectly lovely human losing.</p>
<p>"Third,<br /> Discard all your preconceived ideas<br /> And judgements about the person,<br /> For if you cherish hostile attitudes<br /> Towards any person,<br /> Then your own hostility<br /> Will devour you.</p>
<p>"Next,<br /> Just imagine that right now<br /> Your so-called enemy is having<br /> Nice thoughts about you.<br /> Not only that,<br /> To your wide surprise, your enemy<br /> Is speaking highly of you<br /> To others.</p>
<p>"Finally,<br /> Ask your mind to be a peace-maker.<br /> Ask your heart to be a peace-lover.<br /> Ask yourself to be a peace-observer<br /> Here and everywhere<br /> In the Eternal Now."</p>
