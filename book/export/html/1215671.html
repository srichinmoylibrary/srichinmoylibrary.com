<p>In his dream he saw<br /> A Russian, an American, a German,<br /> A Chinaman, a Japanese, an Indian,<br /> A Pakistani, a Frenchman, an Englishman<br /> and a Canadian<br /> Fighting over the nationality of God.<br /> The Russian said,<br /> "God can be of any nationality, but not<br /> American."<br /> The American said,<br /> "I shall ask God to leave me for some time,<br /> Change His nationality<br /> And stay with the Russian.<br /> Russia needs God's inner Presence,<br /> Whereas I can stay for some time<br /> Without God's outer Presence.<br /> Needless to say, God is an American."<br /> The German said,<br /> "God is a clever fellow.<br /> He changes His nationality quite often.<br /> When a nation becomes powerful<br /> He adopts the nationality of that country<br /> Quickly and devotedly."<br /> The Chinaman said,<br /> "Although God's Presence does not add<br /> Anything to my nation,<br /> God secretly indulges His Chinese nationality."<br /> The Japanese said,<br /> "We all know that God<br /> Most secretly and convincingly<br /> Enjoys His sole nationality: Japanese."<br /> The Indian said,<br /> "Before God started<br /> Taking human incarnation,<br /> He assured India that<br /> He would assume only one nationality,<br /> Forever and forever."<br /> The Pakistani said,<br /> "We know it.<br /> That is why we do not allow God<br /> The eternal Hindu<br /> To darken our country."<br /> The Frenchman and the Englishman<br /> Fought bitterly<br /> And then divided God's nationality<br /> Into two gigantic halves.<br /> The Canadian saluted the American and said,<br /> "God's eternal American nationality<br /> Will one day be proved indisputable."<br /> The American embraced the Canadian and said,<br /> "Take what I have and what I am.<br /> What I have is outer assurance.<br /> What I am is inner gratitude."</p>
