  <h1 class="book-heading">Hitler took care of his father</h1>
  
 
<p>One day Mr. Gruber and I were walking together through Central Park. He was asking me about my parents. I said, “I lost my parents when I was quite young, ten or eleven years old.” Then I said to him, “What about your parents? What about your father?”</p>
<p>“My father?” he said, “Hitler was so compassionate to my father. He took care of my father.”</p>
<p>In this way I came to learn that his father had been killed in the war.</p>  </div>
