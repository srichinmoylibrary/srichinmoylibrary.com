<p>McEnroe does not deliberately try to get angry. Far from it! Spontaneously he loses his temper and starts saying bad words. But a point comes when he says, "Instead of wasting my time using bad words, let me concentrate on the game itself." Inwardly be decides that he will not allow his thoughts to dominate him. He tries to control his thoughts and then his game improves.</p>  </div>
