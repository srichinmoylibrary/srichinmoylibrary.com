<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we do not keep our awareness, we become friends with inconscience and ignorance. When we keep our awareness and remain alert, we go much faster. Alertness is speed in life. If we are alert, nothing can distract us or prevent us from running the fastest toward the goal. Suppose our goal is to get a Master's degree. If we spend all our time going to movies and nightclubs, how will we reach our goal? Only if we discard unnecessary things and focus all our attention on the goal will we be able to reach it sooner than the soonest. So if we are always aware of our goal and thinking of our goal, then there will be inspiration, aspiration and an inner urge to reach the goal as soon as possible.</p>
