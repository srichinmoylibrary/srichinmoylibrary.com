<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now, for a beginner-seeker meditation <em>is</em> the highest reality. But when he becomes an advanced seeker, then he knows that meditation <em>leads</em> to the highest reality. He who has been for a long time or all the time in ignorance, who has never prayed in his whole life even for a minute when he starts meditating, at that time his meditation is naturally the highest reality in his consciousness. But when he has practised meditation for a couple of years, he knows that meditation itself is not the highest reality. The highest reality is something he achieves or grows into when he walks along the road which is called meditation.</p>  </div>
