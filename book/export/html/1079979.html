  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Is your path a religion?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, mine is a path. A path cannot be a religion; a path only accepts — gladly accepts — the votaries or followers of all religions. It is a path, therefore, that anybody can follow. People from different countries, different cultures, different backgrounds can walk along the same path, but they perhaps will not be able to follow the same religion. One can walk along the spiritual path regardless of religion, regardless of culture, regardless of his inner and outer growth.</p>  </div>
