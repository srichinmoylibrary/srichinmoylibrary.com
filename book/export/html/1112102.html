<p>During the New York Marathon, I was crossing the street around the six-mile mark. All of a sudden somebody grabbed me and embraced me.</p>
<p>It was an older gentleman from Hawaii who had run one of our races. He said, "My wife and I are your great admirers. We ran your 24-hour race, and tomorrow we shall come to your concert at Lincoln Center."</p>
<p>He was wearing all kinds of plants and leaves around himself and a Hawaiian skirt. It was his costume for the New York Marathon.</p>
<p>â€” 11 November 1985</p>  </div>
