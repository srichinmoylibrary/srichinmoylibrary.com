<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are free this Wednesday evening, we will have a special meditation at P.S. 86. About 400 people come to meditate with me. Collectively we try to raise the consciousness of mankind on the strength of our silent meditation.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Davis:</em> I will try very, very hard to come on Wednesday.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you would like to meditate for three or four minutes personally with me on the stage, I would like to offer you my special way of meditation.</p>
<p>It is better not to eat for two hours before the meditation. You can drink a cup of tea or liquid substance, but if you take solid food, the heaviness you feel will create lethargy. We have to be dynamic when we meditate. Peace is nothing but inner dynamism. When we are at peace, twenty things we can accomplish in one second in the inner world. If we are not at peace, we are not able to accomplish even one thing in twenty hours.</p>  </div>
