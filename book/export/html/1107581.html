  <h1 class="book-heading">I shall go on loving God</h1>
  
 
<p>I shall go on loving God, even if God does not love me. I know that God, being the Justice-King, will not remain indebted to me. He, too, one day shall start loving me.</p>
<p>I shall go on thinking of God, even if He does not think of me. I know that God, being the Justice-Light, will not remain indebted to me. He, too, one day shall start thinking of me.</p>
<p>I shall go on serving God, even if He does not help me. I know that God, being the Justice-King, will not remain indebted to me. He, too, one day shall start helping me.</p>
<p>I shall go on manifesting God, even if He does not manifest me. I know that God, being the Justice-Light, will not remain indebted to me. He, too, will one day start manifesting me.</p>
<p>Is it true that God does not love me? No, He does love me. I do not feel God’s Love precisely because I live in a desire-net and feel that this desire-net is God Himself. But my real God lives a few inches away from my desire-net, because He does not want to be caught by it. My desire-net I love; I feel that it is nothing short of God. But, to my wide surprise, my desire-net does not love me. Therefore, I feel that God, my Lord Supreme, does not love me.</p>
<p>Is it true that God does not think of me? No, God does think of me. But I do not feel that He thinks of me. Why? Precisely because I live in my thought-world. I extol my thought-world to the skies and feel that it embodies the highest Transcendental Reality. Poor God! He lives right beside my thought-world with His adamantine Will to illumine, perfect and, thus, to fulfil my thought-world. But I give Him no chance. I feel that I am self-sufficient. I feel that inside my thought-world I have the entire Creation — not only the entire Creation but also the Creator Himself, which is absurdity on the face of it.</p>
<p>Is it true that God does not help me? No, He does help me. But when I serve God, I feel a strong sense of pride. Constantly I see pride deep within me looming large. Poor God! My Lord Supreme enters into the chasm of my pride and feels that He is being suffocated. Therefore, He runs away.</p>
<p>Is it true that God does not manifest me? No, He does manifest me. But, unfortunately, I love my disproportionate ego. I feel that by loving my disproportionate ego, I will be able to cover the length and breadth of the world and thereby derive satisfaction from my life. My Lord Supreme tells me, “My son, I wanted to grant you satisfaction. Now I see that you have acquired satisfaction in your own way. I do not want to stand in your way. But a day shall come when you will feel that your satisfaction is nothing short of frustration. On that red-letter day, if you approach Me, I shall be more than willing to grant you My Way of satisfaction. Right now, since you want to be satisfied in your own way, I shall remain in pindrop silence. And when the hour strikes for you to have divine satisfaction, all-illumining and all-fulfilling satisfaction, then come to Me. I shall give you all that I have for you and all that I am to you. All that I have for you is my infinite Compassion and all that I am to you is your Source, your Eternity’s Beloved Supreme.”</p>
<p>To feel God’s Love, what I need is a new purity heart.</p>
<p>To see that God thinks of me, what I need is a new serenity-mind.</p>
<p>To know that God helps me, what I need is a vital stronger than the strongest. This vital has to be founded on my boundless receptivity. In essence, what I need is a receptivity-vital larger than the largest in order to feel that my Lord Supreme at every moment helps me.</p>
<p>To observe that God manifests me, what I always need is a divinity-life. In my life of divinity and self-giving, without fail I shall observe my Lord Supreme’s constant, immortalising activity in and through me. My life of divine self-giving is based on my conscious awareness of who I am and what I am. Who am I? I am a supremely chosen instrument of my Beloved Supreme. Out of His infinite Bounty He has made me so. What am I? I am the eternal seeker and the eternal server. I seek and seek, endless is my search as I walk along Eternity’s Road. Sleeplessly and breathlessly I serve my Lord Supreme as I walk along Eternity’s Road soulfully, devotedly, unreservedly and unconditionally. This capacity of mine I have received unconditionally from my Eternity’s Beloved Supreme. </p>
