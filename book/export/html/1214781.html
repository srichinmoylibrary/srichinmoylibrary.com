<p>After talks with Indian Prime Minister Shastri, U Thant expressed his optimism that the India-Pakistan conflict would be solved. Speaking at Delhi airport on 15 September 1965, he declared:</p>
<p><em>“I would, however, like to say here that even if an end to the fighting has not yet been achieved, that is no reason for any cessation of the efforts of all men of good will to achieve it.</em></p>
<p><em>“For myself, I shall continue to work toward a ceasefire and a peaceful solution to this tragic problem in the light of the very frank and useful talks I have had in both countries in the last few days. I look forward to the co-operation and support of both Governments and of public opinion in this effort and I dare to express the hope and the belief that we may soon see better days.”</em></p>  </div>
