<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Even a child knows what is right and what is wrong. He has something in his inner being which we call conscience, and this has been there from his very birth. Seekers of the infinite Truth, who walk along the path of spirituality, will especially be able to know what is right and what is wrong, because at every moment they try to listen to their inner voice or, you can say, conscience. The further we go along the path of reality, the deeper within we go, the clearer it becomes to us what is right and what is wrong. When we live on the surface, it is next to impossible for us to distinguish what is right from what is wrong. But when we follow the inner life and have the capacity to bring forward the inner message, then at every moment we are safe. From within we get the inner urge to do only the right thing.</p>
<p>The very purpose of spirituality is to enable us to have conscious oneness with the ultimate Truth. If somebody has this conscious oneness, naturally he will be able to distinguish right from wrong. Whoever practises the spiritual life has a special advantage as well. When he gets an inner message, he also gets the inspiration to obey the message. He gets additional inspiration or, let us say, aspiration, to do the right thing. But an ordinary person very often does the wrong thing in spite of knowing that he is doing something wrong. Why does he do it? Because his inner urge is not strong enough to compel him to do the right thing. In the case of a spiritual seeker it is otherwise. When a seeker feels the right thing, he gets abundant capacity from within to do it.</p>  </div>
