  <h1 class="book-heading">Art</h1>
  
 
<p>Creation itself is the Art of arts, although unrecognised.</p>
<p>One truth is clear, very clear. Whatever is, is art. How can any creation of the Supreme Artist be a denial of Him? Even beneath the ugliest and the most loathsome shines His all-loving Face of beauty.</p>
<p>Love is the most charming of all arts. Love is so because it is 'life' itself and not the translation of life.</p>
<p>Art is the outer vesture of love. Art, like love, is a force of oneness with the Infinite. When we create a piece of art, we are really recreating or reflecting some beauty of the Infinite.</p>
<p>Imagination is an essential attribute of the creative power of the mind. It is that son of the mind that sees a thing before it is brought into the material plane.</p>
<p>Imagination, too, has to surrender to its Master: Will. If it is incapable of that, it can never originate anything.</p>
<p>Art is an exacting goddess that demands one's offering of heart, mind and body.</p>
<p>The relation between life and art is as between seed and fruit.</p>
<p>Nature is the mother of an artist. She serves the artist with a presentation of her beauties, visible and invisible.</p>
<p>Nature is the unmistakable evidence of evolutionary growth, and growth is the evidence of life; life, divinely organised and governed, is the evidence of art at its highest.</p>
<p>Keats' address to art:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Thou foster-child of Silence and slow Time"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is but half-truth. It is the child of Silence, no doubt, but it transcends Time.</p>
<p>Beauty without grace is a flower without fragrance.</p>
<p>As man is, after all, an integral being, art has its claim, like knowledge and religion, to be one' of his true occupations in life.</p>
<p>Art is creation solidified and concretised.</p>
<p>Art is the joint fulfilment of Truth and Beauty.</p>
<p>Art is the wonderful convincing bridge between the sweetest harmony and the most perfect rhythm.</p>
<p>Physical beauty in a human being is an external manifestation of some inner harmony and truth. This inner beauty is at its highest in the full opening of the soul towards God.</p>
<p>The supreme Art is to know the Supreme Artist intimately, within and without. This knowledge, well-established, cannot but guide all our movements on artistic lines. And this knowledge will be the basis of a perfectly beautiful life within and without. Art in the most effective sense of the term is a sublime truth that draws our soul from within towards the Infinite Vast.</p>  </div>
