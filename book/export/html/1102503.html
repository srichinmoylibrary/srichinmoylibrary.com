<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people use mantras in their spiritual practice. Again, there are many people who do not repeat mantras; they aspire and meditate in a different way. We cannot say that mantra is superior to prayer and meditation or that prayer and meditation are superior to mantra. No! We can call mantra one road that leads to realisation, but there are also other roads.</p>
