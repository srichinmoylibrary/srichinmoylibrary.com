<p>WHEN I WAS A PROPHET</p>
<p>When I was a prophet<br /> I made four<br /> Proud prophecies:</p>
<p>I shall have to touch<br /> The feet of man.<br /> I shall have to treasure<br /> The dust of his feet.<br /> I shall have to destroy myself<br /> To grant man a new life.<br /> I shall have to transform him<br /> Into tomorrow's God.</p>
<p>My prophecies are coming true.<br /> At least,<br /> So I think.</p>

<p>O good deeds,<br /> I am following you all<br /> With a good life.</p>

<p>O God,<br /> Try to understand me<br /> When I go away<br /> From You.<br /> I do not think less of You,<br /> I do not assail You,<br /> I do not wish to dethrone You.</p>
<p>Now<br /> Let me tell You<br /> Why I leave You.<br /> I leave You<br /> Because<br /> I feel that Your<br /> Other children<br /> Also<br /> Must be given a chance<br /> To love You,<br /> To please You,<br /> To claim You.<br /> You, only You.</p>

<p>Each day<br /> Is<br /> The birthday of either my failure<br /> Or<br /> My victory.</p>
<p>Each day<br /> Is<br /> The birthday of either my vital Satan<br /> Or<br /> My psychic God.</p>

<p>ONE DAY</p>
<p>One day<br /> Everybody will turn against him.<br /> He knows it,<br /> Yet he loves them.</p>
<p>One day<br /> Everybody will hate him.<br /> He knows it,<br /> Yet he loves them.</p>
<p>One day<br /> Everybody will leave him.<br /> He knows it,<br /> Yet he loves them.</p>
<p>One day<br /> Everybody will try to end his life.<br /> He knows it,<br /> Yet he loves them.</p>
<p>One day<br /> Everybody will destroy his breath.<br /> He knows it,<br /> Yet he loves them.<br /> And after that<br /> Everybody<br /> Will love him dearly,<br /> Adore him unreservedly<br /> And<br /> Claim him soulfully.<br /> Alas, this is the common story<br /> Of this uncommon world.</p>
