<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If your government does not help, what can you do? If your government wants to destroy nature in order to build factories and other things, it will do so. The only answer is prayer. We have to pray to God for nature's protection. We have to pray to God to change the minds of those in government. After all, God is omnipotent, so if we approach the Omnipotent to preserve the beauty of nature, then at His own Time, He will listen to our prayer. To preserve the beauty of nature, the only way is to pray to God, the way we pray to God for everything else.</p>  </div>
