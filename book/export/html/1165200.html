<p>I prayed to God for Power. He said, "Take it and use it." I prayed to God for Light. He said, "Take it and spread it." I prayed to God for Peace. He said, "Take it and unveil your divinity." I prayed to God for Bliss. He said, "Take it and stay in your Source." I prayed to God for Love. He said, "Take Me; I am yours."</p>  </div>
