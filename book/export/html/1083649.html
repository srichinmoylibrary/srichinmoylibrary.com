<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, God has a special way of conversing with children. He tells children that they are not mere children, they are His best friends, they are His best instruments. He plies His boat between their dreaming eyes and smiling heart. His way of conversing with children is to make them feel they are His real, eternal friends and that He and they are eternally equal.</p>  </div>
