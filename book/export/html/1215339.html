<p>This morning I was walking on 150th Street. An Indian gentleman crossed in front of me, but he did not say hello to me, and I did not say hello to him. We did not acknowledge each other. For about ten metres we continued walking. Then God knows what happened to him. At my 200-metre mark, he came back running to say, "Gurudev, good morning!"</p>
<p>I gave him a very broad smile.</p>
