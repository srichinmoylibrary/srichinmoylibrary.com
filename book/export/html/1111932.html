<p>When I ran the Sri Chinmoy Marathon in San Francisco, for the first 13 miles hundreds of people were behind me. Even a Chinese doctor who had given a clinic before the marathon was behind me. He had given a talk on how to run a marathon, but this was his first marathon.</p>
<p>Then I got cramps. I was screaming, and Nirvik and Pradhan were both massaging me in the street.</p>
