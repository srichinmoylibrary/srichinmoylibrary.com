<p>I was on 150th Street, returning from my morning run. I had just passed a few of my girl disciples.</p>
<p>As I was approaching the bus stop, a woman with thickly painted lipstick said to me, "Master, Master, why do you have to run? Why can't your disciples run for you?"</p>
<p>I smiled at her and said, "I run and they run too."</p>
<p>Had one of the disciples whom I had just passed run by at that moment, I could have said to the woman, "Here is the proof. I am running, and they are running too."</p>
<p>How do these people know me? I'm sure this lady was Puerto Rican, or else she wouldn't have used the term "Master."</p>
