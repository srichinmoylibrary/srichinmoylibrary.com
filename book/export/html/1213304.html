<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Aspiration is the only medicine to cure you of your ego-disease. If you want to wait until after your ego is dissolved for aspiration to appear in your life, then you will have to wait throughout Eternity. Along with aspiration you should have constant dedication to someone in whom you have faith, who can mould you, shape you and guide you to your goal. Through self-dedication to his cause, to his mission, to his manifestation, you will see that you are expanding through him. His needs become your needs. Through your faith you cover the length and breadth of the world. Then how can you have an ego? It is all vastness. In the Vast, the infinite Vast, there is no ego.</p>  </div>
