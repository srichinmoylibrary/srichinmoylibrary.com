<p>O my body,<br /> Stay not in the paradise<br /> Of helplessness.</p>
<p>O my vital,<br /> Stay not in the paradise<br /> Of wilderness.</p>
<p>O my mind,<br /> Stay not in the paradise<br /> Of forgetfulness.</p>
<p>O my heart,<br /> Stay not in the paradise<br /> Of ungratefulness.</p>
<p>O my soul,<br /> Stay not in the paradise<br /> Of carelessness.</p>

<p>JUST A HABIT</p>
<p>Why do I speak to God?<br /> It is just a habit<br /> Of my perfection.</p>
<p>Why do I adore myself?<br /> It is just a habit<br /> Of my imperfection.</p>
<p>Why do I love man?<br /> It is just a habit<br /> Of my obligation.</p>
