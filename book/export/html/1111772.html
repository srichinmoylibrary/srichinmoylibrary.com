<p>At one point in the race I passed Gayatri. She was wearing white. Then later, out of the corner of my eye, I saw someone in white coming along my side to pass me. I said, "How can Gayatri be running so fast?" Then I turned a little and saw that the person who was passing me had short hair. I said, "This can't be Gayatri." Finally I turned all the way around and saw that it was a man. Gayatri could not keep pace with me.</p>
