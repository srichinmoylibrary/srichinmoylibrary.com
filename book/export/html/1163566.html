  <h1 class="book-heading">Death, do you have a God?</h1>
  
 

<p>Death, do you have a God like me?<br /> "Yes, I do."<br /> Perhaps we have the same God.<br /> "Yes, we have the same God.<br /> But unlike me<br /> You have two Gods."</p>
<p>No, never!<br /> I have only one God,<br /> And I pray to only one God.</p>
<p>"You liar!<br /> When wild frustration<br /> Embraces you<br /> And untold disgrace<br /> Dances around you,<br /> Whom do you pray to?<br /> To me, my child, to me.<br /> You pray to me:<br /> 'O Death, O bountiful Death,<br /> Do come and embrace me.<br /> I need your immediate presence.'<br /> You must know that<br /> Whoever you pray to<br /> Is your God,<br /> Your real God.<br /> Therefore at times<br /> I become your God,<br /> Your only God."</p>
<p>O Death, my stupid curiosity<br /> Deeply admires your Wisdom-Reality.</p>
