<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You do not have to waste your precious time on earth to prove something which has no value in your life. Only you have to prove that you are a projection of God’s transcendental Vision. God’s transcendental Vision projects each and every human being. You can use the word ‘projection’ or ‘manifestation’. Spiritual seekers and spiritual Masters have to prove in their own life that they are a projection of God’s transcendental Vision. They do not have to prove it to others, but in their own life of aspiration and dedication they must prove it.</p>  </div>
