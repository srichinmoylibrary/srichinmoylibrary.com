<p>Once, as I was running about five-thirty in the morning, I saw a young man waiting for the bus.</p>
<p>As soon as he saw me, he became so happy and he ran with me for thirty or forty metres. Then he went back to the bus stop.</p>
<p>After I had covered one mile and was returning, past the same bus stop, the young man ran with me again.</p>
<p>He was so happy to run with me. He said, "You are a good runner."</p>
