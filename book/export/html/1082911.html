<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now you have to know what kind of cry you mean. Desire compels us to cry for name and fame, for material prosperity and so forth. But the soul does not cry in that way. The soul has an eternal cry and that cry is for God-revelation and God-manifestation on earth. The soul comes into the world to reveal God and to manifest God. While it is in the process of revealing God, it feels that so much is still to be done. The revelation that is taking place is nothing in comparison to the revelation and manifestation that is going to take place.</p>
<p>So the soul does have a cry. It is not the human cry, the earthly cry, the cry for earthly possessions. It is an inner cry, a divine cry, an immortal cry for God-revelation and God-manifestation.</p>  </div>
