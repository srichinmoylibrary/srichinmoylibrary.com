<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Who am I to pronounce judgement on the Christ? He is a Saviour in the purest sense of the term, not only of the West but of the whole world. He is one of the Saviours like Sri Krishna, Lord Buddha, Sri Ramakrishna and others. They came into the world and they are still in the world, Our human eyes do not see them but our life of aspiration sees and feels them. They are the World Saviours who are trying to illumine the earth-consciousness.</p>  </div>
