<p>I always have problems when I go shopping. The last time I went to a Christian bookstore to buy an inspirational book, the book that I wanted cost 50 cents. I don't like to carry much change with me because it makes my pockets very heavy. So I had a quarter and three dimes. I gave the man 55 cents for the book, and he said, "Thank you very much." He was thanking me for the extra nickel I gave him. This time, in the same store, I wanted to buy a book called "Flying with the Birds." It is about people who follow birds in a boat. You can't imagine how hard they work, according to the book. Some people don't care for God-realisation; they are only crying for the birds.</p>
<p>The price of the book was 50 cents. This time I had three quarters in my pocket, so I gave the exact amount. The lady took my 50 cents, but this time I didn't even get a "thank you."</p>
