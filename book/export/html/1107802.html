<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First think of a tiny drop of water and then throw that tiny drop into the sea. When you do that, you will not be able to see the drop any longer. You will see the sea itself. You do not want to surrender or you find it difficult to surrender because you feel that if you do, then you will no longer exist. But what happens when the drop enters into the sea is that it becomes one with the sea. When you think of yourself, think of yourself as a drop, and when you look at my transcendental picture, think of it as the ocean. This moment you are a tiny drop; the next moment you are the ocean. This moment you are a tiny drop — outside, alone and helpless — and the next moment you are one with the vast ocean.</p>  </div>
