<p>GRATITUDE</p>
<p>A desiring man<br /> Never gets tired of offering his gratitude<br /> To his own efforts.</p>
<p>An aspiring man<br /> Never gets tired of offering his gratitude<br /> To his own faith.</p>
<p>A surrendered seeker<br /> Never gets tired of offering his gratitude<br /> To his Lord divine.</p>
<p>The Lord Supreme<br /> Never gets tired of offering His Gratitude<br /> To His Infinite Compassion.</p>
