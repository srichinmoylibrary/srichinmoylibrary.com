<p>"I really can't understand how You, my Lord, made everything out of nothing, whereas I can't make a thing out of everything."</p>
<p>"My child, you have to know what you want. Then only will you know how to do it. What you want is perfection in life, and the only way you can achieve this perfection is through your constant self-sacrifice and constant inner cry."</p>
