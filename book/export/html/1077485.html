<p>Concentration is the Arrow.</p>
<p>Meditation is the Bow.</p>
<p>When you concentrate, you focus all your energies upon the chosen phenomenon in order to unveil its mysteries. When you meditate, you rise into a higher consciousness.</p>
<p>Concentration wants to penetrate into the object it strives for. Meditation wants to live in the vastness of Silence.</p>
<p>In concentration, you endeavour to bring the consciousness of your object right into your own awareness. In meditation, you rise from your limited consciousness into a higher and wider domain.</p>
<p>If you want to sharpen your faculties, concentrate. If you want to lose yourself, meditate.</p>
<p>It is the work of concentration to clear the roads when meditation wants to go either deep within or high above.</p>
<p>Concentration wants to seize the knowledge it aims at. Meditation wants to identify itself with the knowledge it seeks for.</p>
<p>An aspirant has two genuine teachers: Concentration and Meditation. Concentration is always strict with the student; Meditation is strict at times. But both of them are solemnly interested in their students’ progress.</p>
<p>Concentration says to God: “Father, I am coming to You.” Meditation says to God: “Father, do come to me.”</p>
<p>Concentration is the commander who orders the dispersed consciousness to come to attention.</p>
<p>Concentration and absolute firmness are not only inseparable, but are interdependent divine warriors.</p>
<p>Concentration does not allow Disturbance, the thief, to enter into his armour. Meditation lets him in. Why? Just to catch the thief red-handed.</p>
<p>Concentration challenges the enemy to a duel and fights him out. Meditation, with its silent smile, diminishes the challenge of the enemy.</p>
<p>Concentration and the surface mind dislike each other. Concentration opens the door to higher states of consciousness, while the surface mind wants to stay where it has always been.</p>
<p>The mind that is incapable of concentration is as changeable as the wind and as elusive as moonlight.</p>
<p>When concentration reaches its acme, revelation dawns. Newton saw the law of gravitation in the falling of an apple; Archimedes discovered the secret of displacement and cried out, “Eureka!"; J. C. Bose discovered life in plants, even in metals. The crown of success is attainable only in moments of deepest concentration.</p>  </div>
