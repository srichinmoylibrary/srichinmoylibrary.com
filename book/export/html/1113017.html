  <h1 class="book-heading">3.</h1>
  
 

<p>Where do You live, O Silence-Guest?<br /> Where is Your Nest, where is Your Nest?<br /> O Silence-Host, where do You stay?<br /> Where is Your Spirit's endless Ray?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1113034" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 

<p>Go away, doubt!<br /> Don't laugh, don't shout.<br /> Alas, doubt-knife,<br /> You have punctured my life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1113035" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 

<p>Lifeless is the seed of Time in me.<br /> Goalless is my eyeless journey's start.<br /> Although I cry, although I sigh,<br /> Within, without looms large death-dart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1113036" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1113038" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 

<p>One thing, for sure, I know: how to cry.<br /> Two things I know, indeed: cry and sigh.<br /> Three things I know: cry, sigh and sink.<br /> What more do I need before I die?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1113039" class="section-2">

  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 

<p>No will to live, no life to love,<br /> No joy to share, no thought to think,<br /> No peace to breathe, no Goal to see:<br /> My life and I, together we sink.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1113042" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>

<div id="node-1113047" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 

<p>An ant like me to save<br /> You came into this world of dust and clay.<br /> A beggar like me to love<br /> And give me a role sublime in<br /> Your Cosmic Play.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1113048" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 

<p>Only once I loved God,<br /> His Love and Height are won.<br /> He now is my perfect slave;<br /> I am His Fulfilment-son.</p>

<div id="node-1113049" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 

<p>None came to me, none came and none<br /> shall come.<br /> Only my Supreme Beloved came, only He.<br /> I cried for His Smile, and He, for my<br /> selfless love.<br /> Sleepless in me He grows His Vision-Tree.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1113050" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7.</h1>
  
 

<p>O high I flew to see God's Home<br /> And far I ran to see God's Eye<br /> And deep I dived to feel God's Love.<br /> Behold the wings of my victory-sky!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1113051" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 

<p>Today, today, today<br /> Alone with God I stay;<br /> Tomorrow and forever<br /> With His Compassion-Ray.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1113052" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9.</h1>
  
 

<p>There was a time when I stumbled<br /> and stumbled,<br /> But now I only climb and climb beyond<br /> And far beyond my Goal's endless Beyond.<br /> And yet my Captain commands:<br /> "Go on, go on!"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1113053" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 

<p>For just a little smile from You,<br /> You I gave my body, heart and soul!<br /> For just a little love from You,<br /> You I made all my lives' only Goal!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1113054" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 

<p>I sighed and wailed with frustration-night,<br /> And then I sailed with Salvation-Light,<br /> And now I sing with Perfection-Height:<br /> Delight, delight, a flood of delight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1113055" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>
  
 

<p>Long dead the night of my mind,<br /> Long awake the dawn of my heart,<br /> Long revealed the sun of my soul.<br /> God and man! Am I not smart?</p>

<p>O Supreme, my Father-Son,<br /> Now that we two are one,<br /> And won by each other, won,<br /> Nothing remains undone.</p>
