<p>In India I used to do 200 metres in 23.4 seconds. But today it became 36.9. I should commit suicide. One or two years in India I stood second. Then after that, every year I was first.</p>
<p>In 400 metres I was always first. One year there was a tie with someone who was in another heat. If we had been in the same heat, God knows, I would have gone faster.</p>
<p>â€” 22 August 1982</p>  </div>
