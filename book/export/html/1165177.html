  <h1 class="book-heading">War and peace</h1>
  
 
<p>Man invents war. Man discovers peace. He invents war from without. He discovers peace from within. War man throws. Peace man sows. The smile of war is the flood of human blood. The smile of peace is the love, below, above.</p>
<p>Peace is the whole truth that wishes to enrapture humanity. War is the whole falsehood that wants to capture humanity. Peace begins in the soul and ends in the heart. War begins in the mind and ends in the body.</p>
<p>War forgets peace. Peace forgives war. War is the death of the life human. Peace is the birth of the Life Divine. Our vital passions want war. Our psychic emotions desire peace.</p>
<p>War is clear futility in dire spear-stupidity. Peace is flowing Infinity in glowing Eternity.</p>
<p>Man seeks war when he thinks that the world is not his. Man invites war when he feels that he can conquer the world. Man proclaims war when he dreams that the world has already surrendered to him.</p>
<p>Man seeks peace because his earthly existence desperately needs it. Man welcomes peace because he feels that in peace alone is his life of achievement and fulfilment. Man spreads peace because he wants to transcend death.</p>
<p>The animal in man wars against peace in the outer world, in the world of conflicting ideas. The divine in man wars against ignorance in the inner world, in the world of mounting ideals.</p>
<p>The animal in man wants war for the sake of war, war to devour the snoring world. The divine in man wants peace for the sake of peace, peace to feed the hungry world.</p>  </div>
