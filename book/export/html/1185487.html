<p>STUDENT: “Sir, how many children does God have?”</p>
<p>TEACHER: “Ah, that’s a nice question. Just the other day I asked Mr. God the same question. Mr. God told me that He has countless children. Mrs. God interrupted Him. She said that He was all wrong. According to Her, He has countless children plus one more, and that additional child is Her worse half, God Himself.”</p>  </div>
