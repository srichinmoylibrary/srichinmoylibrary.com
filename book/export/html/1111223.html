<p>Yesterday, after I had run about three and a half miles, I stopped for a couple of seconds while running up a hill. At that time another runner — a man of about my age — passed me and said, "Come on, you can make it. You are not that old." So I started running and then I passed him. He gave me a broad smile and said, "I told you so." He was very happy that he had inspired me. Then I made a right turn and he made a left turn and we parted.</p>
