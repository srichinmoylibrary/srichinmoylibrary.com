<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, he will know. Even an ordinary man often knows when he is going to leave the body. Sometimes his departed relatives will appear and say, “Come, my friend, now it is your time to follow us. How long we have waited for you! It is time to take birth here, to enjoy Heaven.” They want to celebrate his arrival. Here on earth we die, but there in Heaven we are born to all our departed dear ones.</p>  </div>
