<p>During the marathon, when I was at our 19-mile aid station, I was deeply admiring Upasana. How long she was playing the flute â€” and playing such high notes! She was going on and going on, playing so beautifully and powerfully.</p>
<p>Two middle-aged men who were running the marathon were so excited and delighted with her flute playing. They stopped running and started dancing in front of her instead!</p>
