<p>There was once a Muslim servant who, although he had never gotten any advanced medical degree, knew a lot about herbs and simple medicinal cures. One day one of his master's relatives developed a large boil or carbunkle which was very painful. The village doctor said it was necessary to open the carbunkle with a knife.</p>
<p>The relative was frightened to death. Even though the pain was unbearable, the relative said that he was ready to suffer the pain rather than undergo the operation. "Perhaps it will burst on its own and I will be cured," he said. But the carbunkle was not bursting at all and everybody was quite worried.</p>
<p>The Muslim servant went to his master and said that he could cure the relative. The master said to him, "Nobody trusts you, but you are so confident. Do you really think that you will be able to cure him?"</p>
<p>The servant had such respect for his master. With folded hands he said, "How can I tell you lies?" So the master agreed to let the servant try.</p>
<p>The servant got an eggplant and scooped out the pulp. Then inside the eggplant he put all kinds of things: leaves, mustard oil, ginger and other things that one can get in the kitchen. Then he took the whole concoction and placed it not on top of the carbuncle, but around it. Then he said his own mantra. What happened? The carbunkle burst. It didn't even take ten minutes!</p>
<p>The patient's family wanted to give the servant some money, but he said, "I can't take anything."</p>
<p>The servant's master said, "You have to take something!"</p>
<p>The servant's master was like the head of the village and everybody appreciated him. So the servant said to his master, "If you want to do me a favour, then please tell others that I know a little bit of medicine. I am always ridiculed and insulted because people think I am ignorant. Whenever anybody criticises me, if you just say that I know a little bit of medicine, then that will be more than enough."</p>
<p>So the master told everyone how the servant had cured his relative, and from then on people in the village took the servant seriously.</p>  </div>
