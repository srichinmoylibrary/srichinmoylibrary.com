<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every year we go to a different place, where we give and take. We give the people in the countries we visit our aspiration and they give us their realisations. The experiences that the heart and the soul of Viet Nam have taken centuries to accumulate and all the things that they have taken years and years to realise, we get in a few weeks' time. It is like parents who take a long time to build a house, and then their children use the house.</p>
<p>So we come to give something and to learn something. We give them what we have and what we are and we learn from them what they have to offer.</p>
