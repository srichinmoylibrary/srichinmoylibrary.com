<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can easily ask me, "Shall I do it?" Then if I see that you have the capacity, I will say, "Do it." If I do not see the capacity, I will ask someone else to try. I am very proud of one German girl who has swum the English Channel and, again, six German girls have swum it in a relay. So one has done it all by herself and six have done it together. How can you know if you should try? Just ask me. And if you get permission, then you can try. And if you fail, do not give up. But first you have to know whether you have the capacity.</p>  </div>
