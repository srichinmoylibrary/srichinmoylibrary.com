<p>At one point on the road it said one and a half miles to go. But even before that, people giving water were saying, "Only a mile and a half to go."</p>
<p>Right near the finish of the half-marathon, a man wearing a Citibank T-shirt came up to me and said, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I said I was. Then he said, "Please don't mind if I go a little ahead of you. I won't be able to go very far ahead of you."</p>
<p>I said, "Please go."</p>
<p>He finished not even 50 metres ahead of me.</p>
