<p>Belief tells me that I can be of God if I want to; I can claim God if I want to.</p>
<p>Faith tells me that God has already accepted me. Whether I want to accept Him or not, He has already accepted me. God has claimed me as His very own. Whether I condescend to claim Him or not, He has already claimed me as His very own.</p>
<p>Faith knows that our acceptance or rejection of God will not determine God's acceptance of us. Faith knows that it is God who does everything in and through us, not the other way around.</p>  </div>
