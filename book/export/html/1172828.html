<p>When there are a good many items of prasad, I get tremendous joy — really I do! Whenever you can, if your finances permit, do bring prasad — not only for a spiritual anniversary, not only for your birthday, but also when you feel that your consciousness is very high, very high. Again, even when you feel that your consciousness is not high, you can bring prasad. Then your consciousness will go up! You do not have to tell anyone about your consciousness-standard.</p>
<p>While taking prasad if you can give me a beautiful smile, even if you are in a low consciousness, your consciousness will fly up like a rocket. And if you are in a very high, giving consciousness, then I assure you, you will fly high, higher, highest. Please remember this!</p>
<p>Today one singing group performed so well. We deeply appreciate and admire their performance, but they forgot to bring even one item of prasad. Their leader has told me that they will bring something tomorrow morning. Very good!</p>
