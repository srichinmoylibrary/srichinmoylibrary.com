<p><em>(1923. Sri Aurobindo and a Gujarati disciple, Punamchand)</em></p>
<p>PUNAMCHAND: Before I settle down here as a permanent sadhak, may I have your permission to go home and come back with my wife?</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: Yes. What is Champaklal doing there? Bring Champaklal with you also.</p>
<p><em>(To Champaklal this remembrance of him by Sri Aurobindo and the spontaneous call to him are a most cherished memory. He first came to Sri Aurobindo in 1921 as a boy of 18. Now in 1923 he comes to stay for good.)</em></p>
<p><em>(The Mother and Champaklal)</em></p>
<p>CHAMPAKLAL: My Mother, I intend to wash my Father's dhoti.</p>
<p>MOTHER: I shall speak to Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p><em>(Exit the Mother)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter Sri Aurobindo)</em></p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: You want to wash my dhoti! People will laugh at you, joke about you, mock you. Are you ready?</p>
<p>CHAMPAKLAL: <em>(Firmly)</em> I am, Father.</p>  </div>
