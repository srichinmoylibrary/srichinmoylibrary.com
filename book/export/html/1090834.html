<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One's own witness.</p>
<p><em>Question: It is very difficult in that way?</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is difficult.</p>
<p><em>Question: It is as if you were there, standing there looking at yourself?</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, but first you have to enter into the object and then go beyond it. Then you come back to yourself and become the witness.</p>  </div>
