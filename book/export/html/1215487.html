<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one does not have a teacher, then I advise the seeker to try to make the mind calm and quiet and not allow any wrong thoughts to enter. As soon as a seeker is assailed by a wrong thought, he has to try to destroy it. He has to open himself only to encouraging, illumining and fulfilling thoughts. If hatred enters into my mind while I am meditating, I will try to replace it with love. If insecurity enters into my mind, I will try to replace it with security. And if doubt about my spiritual capacity enters into my mind, I will immediately try to bring faith to the fore to conquer the doubt.</p>  </div>
