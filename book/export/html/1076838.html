<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have come seven times.</p>
<p><em>Did you come to preach your philosophy?</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, I came because I was invited by my most dedicated disciples. I come here because I have disciples. This is our Centre where I give lectures. My disciples ask spiritual questions and I teach them how to meditate and tread the path of spirituality.</p>  </div>
