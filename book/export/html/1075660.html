<p>When I sing the song of duality —<br /> You as an individual,<br /> I as an individual —<br /> The song of sacrifice I sing.</p>
<p>When I sing the song of oneness-reality,<br /> There is no sacrifice,<br /> For in the realisation of oneness-light,<br /> There can be no sacrifice,<br /> Only the song of transformation,<br /> Constant transformation.</p>
<p>The lower and the higher<br /> Fulfil each other.<br /> The lower in me fulfils the higher<br /> By serving the higher.<br /> The higher in me fulfils the lower<br /> By transforming the lower.<br /> In the real fulfilment of one's total existence<br /> There is no sacrifice;<br /> It is only the game of<br /> Oneness-song<br /> And<br /> Oneness-dance.</p>
