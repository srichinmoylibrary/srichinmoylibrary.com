<p>Sudhahota served as Master of Ceremonies for Sri Chinmoy’s first weightlifting anniversary on 26 June 1986. After reading to the audience some of the comments from other athletes and dignitaries congratulating Sri Chinmoy on his weightlifting accomplishments, Sudhahota remarked: “I have really enjoyed reading these because a piece of every one of these lines is in my heart as well, and I think that all of us draw the same inspiration that everyone spoke of.”</p>  </div>
