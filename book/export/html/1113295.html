<p>"Chinmoy, I have something for you to do. Go to Sahana and tell her that when they sing <em>idam shrestham...,</em> in that particular sloka they are making a mistake. I shall point out the mistake. You go to Sahana with my correction."</p>
<p>When I came back from Sahana-di, Nolini-da gave me a big orange and said: "Here is your reward. Now you have to do something else. Go and tell Hriday (my eldest brother) that I wish to have the eighth <em>ashtaka</em> of the commentary on the <em>Rig-Veda</em> by Sayana. I need it badly. I tell you, there are very few people in the Ashram who study the Vedas. Hriday's interest in the Vedas is considerable."</p>
<p>That afternoon when I gave him the book, he said to Rajen-da, who happened to be there: "With this book from Hriday, my collection of the <em>Rig-Veda</em> is complete." Then he said to me: "This morning I gave you a reward. Now I wish to give you a beautiful picture which shows the natural beauty of Japan. I am sure it will inspire you."</p>  </div>
