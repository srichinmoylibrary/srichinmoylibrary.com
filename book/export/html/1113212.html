<p>A young girl named Minu came to offer her <em>pranam</em> to Nolini-da early in the morning. She was born in Chittagong and I had studied with her for about eight months at the Sri Aurobindo <em>Vidya Pith</em> there. She was quite a brilliant student. She came to Nolini-da for his blessings. After she left, he asked me what her name was. I told him that I had studied with her for a few months in our village and that her name was Minu.</p>
<p>"That cannot be her real name. What is her real name?" he said.</p>
<p>"I don't remember what her real name is."</p>
<p>"You studied with her and you do not know her real name?"</p>
<p>Quite embarrassed, I went out looking for Minu. I found her near Sri Aurobindo's <em>Samadhi.</em> I asked her what her real name was and she said it was Amiya.</p>
<p>When I told Nolini-da, he said with a smile: "There is no dearth of <em>Amiya</em> (nectar) at the Ashram, but God alone knows when He will bless us with divine nectar."</p>
<p>In the afternoon, while I was typing in the flower-room, Nolini-da came up to me and said: "Did Rajan tell you that I had enjoyed your article "Ramakrishna, Soul of the East" in the <em>Amrita Bazar?</em>"</p>
<p>"Yes, he did."</p>
<p>"It seems that you worked hard on that article. It is always good to work hard when you write something, especially before you send it for publication."</p>  </div>
