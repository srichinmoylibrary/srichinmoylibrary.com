<p>When God hides Himself<br /> You cry.<br /> You try to find Him.<br /> But do you know<br /> That you have been trying<br /> To hide from God for countless centuries?<br /> What has God been doing?<br /> He has been pleading with you<br /> To come to the fore and replace Him<br /> For He is tired.<br /> He wants you to play His role.</p>
