<p>There was once a great Sanskrit scholar who was also a matchless philosopher. When he was quite young he said to his mother, “Mother, I don’t like this world. This world is not good. Here it is all bondage and illusion. I want to give up this world. I want to accept <em>sannyas</em>, renunciation.”</p>
<p>The mother burst into tears, “My son, how can you accept <em>sannyas</em>? You know the entire creation is God’s. How can you go out of God’s creation? No, no, you cannot accept <em>sannyas</em>. You have to be with me. Without you I will not be able to live on earth. My whole life will be miserable and unbearable. Your absence will break my heart. I cannot allow you to accept <em>sannyas</em>.”</p>
<p>The young man remained silent. He could not accept the life of a <em>sannyasi</em> without his mother’s permission. According to the Scriptures, one has to take permission from one’s parents or guardians. Then only will <em>sannyas</em> bear fruit. So he waited for his mother’s permission devotedly, soulfully and helplessly.</p>
<p>One day he went swimming in a nearby river and there he was caught by a crocodile. He started screaming and his mother came running.</p>
<p>The crocodile said, “If you want to remain in ignorance, then I will eat you up, but if you don’t want to remain in ignorance, then I will let you go.”</p>
<p>Then the son said, “Mother this is the time to grant me my boon. If you don’t allow me my wish, then the crocodile will kill me.”</p>
<p>“I will give you my permission to accept <em>sannyas</em> if you feel that the crocodile will free you,” the mother said.</p>
<p>Immediately the crocodile let him go, and he came up to his mother and said, “Now, Mother, you have to keep your promise!”</p>
<p>The mother said, “I will keep my promise, but my heart will break when you leave me. To lose you is to lose my all.”</p>
<p>He said, “Mother, you will not lose me. Whenever you want me just think of me and meditate on me, and I shall come to you. Normally one does not see one’s family for ten or twelve years after one has accepted <em>sannyas</em>. But in my case, whenever you want I will come. But I will not accept the worldly life and I will not get married. I will follow only the path of <em>sannyas</em>.”</p>
<p>The mother blessed the son and said, “Go, go! You want to please God. Whether it is in God’s Way or your own way, I do not know. But you do want to please God; that much I know. So I will be happy, because I know you are going for God. You feel He should be realised in a specific way. I won’t stand in your way; I give you my full permission. But your absence will kill me. Now go. Go and be satisfied, for I am your dearest and you are my dearest. In your satisfaction I also will be satisfied.”</p>
<p>The boy fell at his mother’s feet for the last time and took her blessings. Then he left home.</p>
<p>This young man was none other than India’s Sankaracharya, the peerless philosopher who introduced our Advaita philosophy, “One without a second.”</p>
