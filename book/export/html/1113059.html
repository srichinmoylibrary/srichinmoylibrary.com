<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If it is impatient, then you will see inside you a wild elephant. A wild elephant is impatient. But if it is dynamic, then you are like a deer, running towards the goal. If you see inside you a wild elephant, then you have to know that your impatience is going to destroy everything. But if you feel you are a deer, the deer is not going to look around, backwards, sideways. Only it will strive to reach the destination. So just think of a deer's speed inside you, not a destructive elephant. An elephant does have solid strength, but if you see the way an elephant moves around, you notice that it destroys. A deer signifies speed, dynamic movement.</p>  </div>
