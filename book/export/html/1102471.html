<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em> You can make your prayer most intense by using your gratitude-heart. While a prayer is coming from your heart, you have to feed it with gratitude. If anybody is going to do something great or good, he needs nourishment. Similarly, if you do not nourish your prayer with the gratitude-fruit, then it will not be intense.</p>
<p>At every moment during the day you are energised by good thoughts or assailed by bad thoughts. The good thoughts that you get are coming directly from the Supreme, and the will to challenge the bad thoughts and destroy or illumine them is also coming from the Supreme. He is inside you as a Warrior when wrong thoughts come to attack you, and He is inside you as the Heavenly Father, the Supreme Beloved, when good thoughts come to illumine you. So, naturally you will be filled with gratitude to Him.</p>
<p>You have to feel grateful for what God has given you and also for what God has not given you. The good things you have prayed for He has given you, and the bad things you have prayed for He has not given you. You have to be grateful for both. If He had fulfilled your earthbound desires, then He would have proved to be your worst enemy. But God has fulfilled only your pure aspiration-cries. Therefore, He is your best Friend.</p>
