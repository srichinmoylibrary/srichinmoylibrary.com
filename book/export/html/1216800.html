<p>In November I went to Puerto Rico to participate in the Conference of the International Yoga Teachers' Association. There were quite a few swamis, spiritual Masters and seekers there.</p>
<p>While I was there, articles about me appeared in three Puerto Rican newspapers. <em>The San Juan</em> Star actually had two articles about me. They mentioned that I would be meditating and doing a few other things at the Conference on a particular day from eight o'clock to twelve. And they said anybody could come for free, since I never charge any fee. Unfortunately, the Conference Officials were actually charging ten dollars.</p>
