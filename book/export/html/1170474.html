<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you are teaching my philosophy in front of seekers, two things you have to do. Before you go to the class, meditate for at least fifteen minutes. There should be nobody around you â€” no colleagues, nobody. You have to feel that there is no one except you and my divinity. You are meditating on my divinity, which is also your divinity. My highest divinity and your highest divinity are the same.</p>
<p>Then, while you are speaking about my philosophy, you have to feel that I am speaking through you. And when you are looking at the students, you have to feel that they are really me. On the one hand, I am the talker, in and through you. On the other hand, I am the listener, in and through the audience. So, if you can feel that I am speaking through you and also listening to you, then you will get tremendous inner strength.</p>
<p>I am coming out of you and also I am entering into you. I am coming out of your heart and entering into the hearts of the seekers. Again, I am coming out of the seekers' hearts and entering into you. Feel that like a rainbow I am going from you to the seekers and coming from the seekers back to you. Or you can feel that you are taking me to the world at large, and again, the entire world you are bringing back into yourself. From the inner world you are carrying me to the outer world, and from there you are bringing me back again. If you can feel my presence in either one of these ways, you will be able to inspire your students and also you will be able to inspire yourself in a most tangible, productive way. Then you will be able to make the fastest progress and also the people who have come to listen to you will be able to make the fastest progress.</p>  </div>
