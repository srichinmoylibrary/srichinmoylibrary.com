<blockquote>
<p>"Time is that which man always tries to kill, but which ends in killing him."</p>
<p>â€” Herbert Spencer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We try to kill time. But what actually happens is that time ultimately kills us, devours us. Our hopes are dashed, our desires are frustrated. When founded on insincerity, doubt, worries and anxieties, our aspiration unfortunately fails to bear fruit.</p>  </div>
