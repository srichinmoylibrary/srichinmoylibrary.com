<p>Yesterday, around eight o'clock, I was walking quite fast when an elderly lady came out of her house. Who she is, God knows. She must live on that street, but I had never seen her before.</p>
<p>She said, "Sri, you look so beautiful."</p>
<p>Five or six steps passed before I said, "Thank you," but by that time she didn't hear.</p>
