<p>When you have to lose weight, it is no joke. Today I took only four hundred calories and ran fifteen and a half miles — only to lose weight.</p>
<p>Usually I weigh more after I finish running than I did before I started. This time I decided to catch the culprit! Before I went out, I weighed my ERG bottle when it was full. It weighed one pound and three ounces. Then I subtracted the weight of the bottle — an ounce and a quarter. From now on after I run I will know how much I have gained from drinking.</p>
