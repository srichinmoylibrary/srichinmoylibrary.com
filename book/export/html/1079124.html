<p>My Lord, I want to have a life of success, and You want me to have a life of progress. My Lord, my Lord, my Lord, is there any way that my success can be turned into my progress and my progress can be turned into my success?</p>
<p>"My child, My child, My child, there is a secret and sacred way.</p>
<p>"As soon as you have achieved any success, pray to Me, and while praying, sing for Me your surrender-song. Then I assure you that your success will be turned into your progress.</p>
<p>"As soon as you have made any progress, meditate on Me, and while meditating, dance for Me a gratitude-dance. Then I assure you that your progress will be turned into your success.</p>
<p>"Needless to say, your new progress and your new success will be My new progress and My new success as well."</p>
