<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is wonderful. You feel strong inside because you bring down divine peace, bliss and light into you. The more you consciously and devotedly bring down from above these divine forces, the stronger you become inwardly. You will feel that these things from above are helping you to expand your consciousness.</p>
<p>Now outwardly you are feeling soft, you say. It is not actually softness. It is the inner peace and inner confidence that grow in your outer being. One who is outwardly strong, like a great boxer or a great sovereign, has inside him infinite confidence and great peace because he fears no one. Inside his confidence, he is totally relaxed. In great power, there is quietude. But if a person is not very strong, he clenches his fists and gets ready to defend himself for he feels that his enemy is right in front of him. He has to show that he can fight with him. But when one has boundless inner strength, one does not have to display it outwardly. He doesnâ€™t have to clench his fists. He is relaxed because his inner strength has given him inner confidence. He is like a divine hero. At any moment, he can defeat the enemy or surmount any obstruction outside himself. He is relaxed because he knows that whoever is in front of him is no match for him. The more inner confidence we have, the more we can outwardly relax.</p>  </div>
