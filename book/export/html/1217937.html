    <title>Question: I wish to ask something further, regarding Sudha&#039;s question. Religion has told us that we have come from the Spirit and we go back to the Spirit at the end of our present incarnation. Now if we go back to our Father, then what is the use of re-incarnation, realisation and so forth?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many religions on earth that do believe in re-incarnation. Re-incarnation is an undeniable fact. Now let me explain to you briefly what we mean by re-incarnation. You play a game, but you cannot play it forever. You cannot play it twenty-four hours at a stretch. You have to rest from time to time. Similarly in the process of evolution through a long series of reincarnations, we are trying to complete the game. This divine game that we are all playing is called the Lila. We cannot complete the game in its fulness during one span of life. Also we are not playing the game in a divine way. We have not reached the Goal. Our Goal is still a far cry. Now if you want to embody your Father's infinite consciousness on earth and want to reveal and manifest your Father, whom you think is in heaven, then you have to play His divine game of re-incarnation. There is no other way. When we go to Him after each lifetime, it is only for a rest.</p>  </div>
