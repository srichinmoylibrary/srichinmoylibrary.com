<p>This is a story about Benjamin Franklin. He was many things combined in one frame.</p>
<p>Once a young man went to Benjamin Franklin's bookstore and started browsing. After a long time, he selected a book that he wanted to buy. He asked Franklin's assistant the price. The assistant said, "One dollar."</p>
<p>The customer said, "The price is too high. Can you not ask your boss? He is in the other room at the printing press. Perhaps he will lower the price."</p>
<p>So Franklin came out and the man asked him the price of the book. Franklin said, "A dollar and a quarter."</p>
<p>The customer said, "Your assistant said a dollar and you have to say a dollar and a quarter? Please be serious and tell me what the price is."</p>
<p>This time Franklin said, "A dollar and a half."</p>
<p>The man asked, "Why do you keep raising the price? Please be serious!"</p>
<p>Franklin said, "I am serious. Do you not see that you are wasting my time? The price of the book is one dollar. But because you are wasting my time, the price of the book has to go up."</p>
<p>The man understood and bought the book for a dollar and a half.</p>  </div>
