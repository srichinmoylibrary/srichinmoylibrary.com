<p>You see the mistakes in your life,<br /> But you are not brave enough<br /> To tell the world that these mistakes<br /> Are all your own.<br /> Unless and until you dare to claim them<br /> As your own, very own,<br /> God the Perfection is not going to claim you<br /> As His Eternity's own, very own.</p>
