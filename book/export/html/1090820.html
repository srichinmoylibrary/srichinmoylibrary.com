<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I expect all my disciples to meditate in the morning before six-thirty. From two o'clock to six-thirty I concentrate on all my disciples. At that time my soul, my existence, my consciousness are responsible for feeding you. After six-thirty my inner beings take the responsibility. I am not saying that my inner beings are inferior to me; no, they are not. But if you want to give me joy in the physical mind, then please meditate before six-thirty. If you meditate after six-thirty my inner beings will have to take care of you. And again, if you meditate in the evening or at night, my inner beings and your inner being will commune.</p>  </div>
