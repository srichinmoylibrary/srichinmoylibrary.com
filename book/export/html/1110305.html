<h2><em>Professor Russell Bradshaw:</em> How can I serve God here on earth when I have to be in the mental world and get so many headaches?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My dear Professor, problems, problems! I am sure your headaches are nothing other than your problems. In human life, some days we can count our problems; some days our problems defy our counting capacity.</p>
<p>When we have a problem, either we try to conquer the problem or we surrender to the problem and try to live with the problem, helplessly or proudly, consciously or unconsciously.</p>
<p>To a seeker, each problem is a challenge and an opportunity, provided we utilise the problem in a correct and divine way. What is the correct and divine way to tackle a problem? The correct way is to implore — as often as possible and as sincerely as possible — God's Grace to come to our rescue. We human beings want to solve each and every problem in our own way, with our own mental capacity, which is next to nothing, although we do not want to believe it. In spite of repeated failures, we feel that our capacity is stronger than the problem itself.</p>
<p>All the problems of the world have only one source: dissatisfaction. And dissatisfaction also has its source: imperfection. Imperfection also has its source: division. Division also has its source: ignorance. Ignorance also has its source: God in the slow process of evolution.</p>
<p>God the Vision wanted to play the role of God the Involution. God the Involution wants to play the role of God the Evolution. God the Evolution will eventually become God the Total Satisfaction.</p>
<p>A problem is our journey's start. Problems loom large during our journey. The same problems receive light in the course of our journey. But at the end of our journey's close there can be no problems. There we shall find Eternity's Smile in Infinity's Sky.</p>
<p>You can serve God here on earth by becoming a divine and supreme hero of God. How do you become a divine and supreme hero? You can become a supreme hero by consciously reminding yourself at every moment of the undeniable fact that you are of God and you are for God. You are chosen by God Himself to love Him, serve Him and manifest Him here on earth in His own Way. Your inner conviction of what you are and what you are supposed to do can easily help you to conquer the pride of all your problems, born and yet unborn.</p>  </div>
