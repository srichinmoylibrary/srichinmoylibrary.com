  <h1 class="book-heading">Freedom</h1>
  
 
<p>Is there any freedom? If so, where is it? There is freedom. It lives in our conscious surrender to the Supreme’s Will. Our unreserved surrender is our infallible oneness with the Supreme. Since the Supreme is the Infinite Freedom, we, in essence, cannot be otherwise.</p>
<p>It was Marlowe who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It lies not in our power to love or hate, For will in us is over-ruled by fate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true only when our fate is determined by the ego’s extremely limited dictates. This deplorable fate of ours undergoes a radical transformation — stark bondage is transformed into boundless freedom — when we, with our ever-mounting aspiration-flame, live in the soul’s unlimited and all-powerful Will. What we have within and what we see without is the consciousness of the evolving, expanding and radiating freedom. No matter what kind of freedom it gives us, physical or spiritual, this freedom is not just to succeed bondage or even to replace bondage, but to transform the very breath of bondage into freedom’s Immortality. And this is freedom, as a world-figure once remarked, without quotation marks.</p>  </div>
