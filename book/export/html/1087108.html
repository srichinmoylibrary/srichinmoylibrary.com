<p>The other day, as I was coming back from shopping, I saw a teenage black girl.</p>
<p>She said to me, "Are you the same guy who teaches meditation?"</p>
<p>I smiled at her. Then she continued across the street. All of a sudden she came back to me and said "I am sorry I called you 'guy'. You are a spiritual teacher."</p>
