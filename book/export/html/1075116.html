<p>WHEN HE SPEAKS</p>
<p>When he speaks to doubt,<br /> He becomes a stream of faith.</p>
<p>When he speaks to fear,<br /> He becomes a stream of courage.</p>
<p>When he speaks to insecurity,<br /> He becomes a stream of confidence.</p>
<p>When he speaks to impurity,<br /> He becomes a stream of purity.</p>
<p>When he speaks to his lower self,<br /> He becomes a stream of concern.</p>
<p>When he speaks to his higher Self,<br /> He becomes a stream of admiration.</p>
