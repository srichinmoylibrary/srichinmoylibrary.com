<p><em>New York University; New York, New York, USA</em><br /><em>Meyer Hall</em><br /><em>12 January 1974</em></p>

<p>You want God. You need God. You have God. You are God.</p>
<p>You want God and you need God.<br /> When you are in your vital, you want God.<br /> When you are in your heart, you need God.<br /> Your vital demands God’s choice Hour.<br /> Your heart devotedly waits for God’s choice Hour.</p>
<p>When your vital knocks at God’s door, no answer. Frustrated, you break open God’s door. Alas, alas, God is not to be found in His room. He is elsewhere.<br /> God knocks at your heart’s door. You immediately answer. God blesses your devoted head. God embraces your surrendered heart.</p>
<p>You want God in order to dominate His vast Creation.<br /> You need God in order to emancipate your little world.</p>
<p>You have God and you are God.<br /> You have God; therefore, you can look up.<br /> You are God; therefore, you can dive within.<br /> You have God; therefore, the world loves you.<br /> You are God; therefore, it is you alone who can expand your universal consciousness, it is you alone who can always transcend your ever-transcending height.</p>
<p>You have God. Your sea-deep eyes can prove it.<br /> You are God. Your sun-vast heart is the proof.<br /> You have God. Your body of sound can prove it.<br /> You are God. Your soul of silence is the proof.<br /> You have God; therefore, death bows to you.<br /> You are God; therefore, Immortality claims you.<br /> You have God; therefore, you are unmistakably great.<br /> You are God; therefore, you are ceaselessly good.</p>
<p>God you want?<br /> Then your first friend is temptation,<br /> Your second friend is frustration,<br /> Your third friend is destruction.</p>
<p>God you need?<br /> Then your first friend is love,<br /> Your second friend is devotion,<br /> Your third friend is surrender.</p>
<p>God you have.<br /> Your first friend is aspiration,<br /> Your second friend is liberation,<br /> Your third friend is realisation.</p>
<p>God you are.<br /> Your first friend is revelation,<br /> Your second friend is manifestation,<br /> Your third friend is perfection.</p>
<p>God you want? Be careful.<br /> God you need? Be hopeful.<br /> God you have. Whom else do you need? No one!<br /> God you are. Who does not need you? No one!</p>
<p>Everybody needs you, for you have God and you are God.<br /> You are the body,<br /> You are the vital,<br /> You are the mind,<br /> You are the heart,<br /> You are the soul<br /> Of what you have and what you are.<br /> What you have is a vast heart.<br /> What you are is a glowing soul.</p>
<p>God you want.<br /> God you need.<br /> God you have.<br /> God you are.</p>
