<p>Yesterday morning Lavanya the Great, Nilima the Great and I the Great ran eight miles. Savita and Pranika happened to see us and ran behind us secretly. When we turned around to come back after four miles, they hid in the bushes until we passed. Then they came out and ran behind us like thieves. None of us saw them; only later they told us about it.</p>
