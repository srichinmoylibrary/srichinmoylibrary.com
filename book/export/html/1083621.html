<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The easiest way to make God love you is to make your mind feel that it is God's business to perfect His entire creation and it is your business to grow into a garland of gratitude to God's ever-illumining Life and ever-fulfilling Will. In your case, God does love you, but where is your heart to feel it? Where is your mind to think of it?</p>  </div>
