    <title>&lt;em&gt;Mr. David Rowe:&lt;/em&gt; The style and personality of the Secretary-General influence numerous individuals and national governments and to a degree determine the performance of the entire United Nations. Don&#039;t you think, then, that it is essential to select a Secretary-General who will not allow possible wrong influences or powers to guide his actions?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We should always try to be true servers and warriors of truth. Therefore, our supreme and only choice has to be an all-loving, all-caring, all-serving and all-fulfilling Secretary-General whose love-power will transform the dominion-power or influence-power of the world, and not the other way around. It is love that inspires us to do the right thing in life, whereas power quite often influences or instigates us to do the wrong thing.</p>  </div>
