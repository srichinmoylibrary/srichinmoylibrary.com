<p>Heart, my heart,<br /> What has made you so dry?<br /> I advise you,<br /> Don't mix with your mind.</p>
<p>Mind, my mind,<br /> What has made you so aggressive?<br /> I advise you,<br /> Don't mix with your vital.</p>
<p>Vital, my vital,<br /> What has made you so lethargic?<br /> I advise you,<br /> Don't mix with your body.</p>
<p>Body, my body,<br /> What has made you so sleepy?<br /> I advise you,<br /> Don't mix with your death.</p>
