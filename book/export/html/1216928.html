<p>This morning in Berlin, I came back from my walk at around a quarter to eight. It had been very cold outside and I had not taken my jacket, so I was shivering.</p>
<p>When I came into the hotel, a middle-aged Englishman came up to me and said, "Do you play tennis?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, I do."</p>
<p>Then he asked, "Could you come and play with me? Nobody is at the courts."</p>
<p>Unfortunately I had not brought my tennis racquet on that trip, so I had to excuse myself.</p>
