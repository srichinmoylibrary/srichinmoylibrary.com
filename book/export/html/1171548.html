<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God always thinks of you as His dream â€” not an old dream but a new dream. Every day He thinks of you as a new dream, specially on your birthday. On that day He thinks of you as an unprecedented dream of His. On every individual's birthday, God thinks of that particular individual as His unprecedented dream, that is unlike any other dream.</p>  </div>
