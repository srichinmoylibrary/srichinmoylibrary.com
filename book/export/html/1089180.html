    <title>&lt;em&gt;Sri Chinmoy:&lt;/em&gt; Five or six years ago I read an article in which you said that you were not running as many miles as Bill Rodgers and that it was not necessary to run so many miles. You said what mattered was how hard and how sincerely you ran, how much concentration you ran with and not how many miles you ran.</title>

<p><em>Seko:</em> When a runner trains, he should have hard days and easy days in order to run a good marathon. He should prepare at least three months in advance. But during these three months he should do a concentrated training run only about ten times. The rest of the time he should run easy and relaxed.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How many miles? <em>Seko:</em> At least ten times one should try to run 40K or 25 miles very hard, very concentrated. I usually run 40K training runs in about two hours and five minutes.</p>  </div>
