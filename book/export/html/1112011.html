<p>When I was giving out oranges to the runners finishing our half-marathon in Flushing Meadow Park yesterday, some of them were mad. One fellow heard he was tenth or twelfth and his friend was eighth. I think his friend was also his rival. He was very disappointed and he said, "Damn it!"</p>
<p>Some runners didn't take oranges. One or two perhaps didn't like oranges, but others were mad at themselves. One or two, when they calmed down, came and took.</p>
