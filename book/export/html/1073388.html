<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has created for us His divine fulfilment. He wants satisfaction, divine satisfaction, from us; He wants manifestation and perfection in us and through us. If God’s Hour strikes for us and we do not play our role, then we will have to complete our task at some other time. It is part of God’s Vision that each and every soul will complete its allotted task, either today or tomorrow. If we miss our opportunity, God will say, “All right, you have missed this opportunity, but I will give you another opportunity.” Again and again He will give us opportunities. But if we constantly ignore them or misuse them, eventually He will use His supreme Authority and compel us to complete our allotted task.</p>  </div>
