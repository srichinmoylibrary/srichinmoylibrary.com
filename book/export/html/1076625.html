<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I was chanting AUM. AUM is the Mother of all mantras. <em>Mantra</em> is a Sanskrit word. Its English equivalent is <em>Incantation.</em> Now, AUM has three sounds: A, U, M. “A” represents God, the Creator. “U” represents God, the Preserver. “M” represents God, the Transformer. So we invoke God in His three Aspects all at once when we chant AUM. I have written considerably on this subject. As a matter of fact, for the beginners I wrote a pamphlet entitled <em>The Significance of AUM</em>. The question that you have asked me has been asked quite a few times by other seekers, and I have answered them elaborately. I have told them how to chant AUM and how to derive the greatest benefit from chanting AUM. The most important thing is to know that AUM is the Mother of all our Sanskrit mantras. AUM has to be chanted first and foremost when we chant any mantra. It is from AUM that the Creation came into existence. Again, the Creation will find its ultimate Goal only in AUM.</p>  </div>
