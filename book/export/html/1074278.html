<p>Man has no fear of the true truth that his body-reality is of God-Consciousness. He has fear because he is not aware of the true truth that his vital-incapacity wants to stay without God-Consciousness. He has fear because he is not aware of the true truth that his mind-concentration is not on God-Consciousness. He has fear because he is not aware of the true truth that his heart-love is not for God-Reality.</p>
