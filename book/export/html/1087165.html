  <h1 class="book-heading">The Bengali film</h1>
  
 
<p>I went into a video store in Queens. The owner was a Gujarati who had lived in Calcutta for many years. So we talked in Bengali about many, many things. Then I asked him if he had any Bengali films. He said, "Many, many!"</p>
<p>I said, "Please give me a spiritual one."</p>
<p>He gave me one about Lord Shiva's sacred place in the Himalayas. I believed him when he said it was in perfect Bengali, so I bought it.</p>
<p>When I watched the film, it was not in Bengali at all. It was in Hindi â€” and with a silly actor whom I do not like.</p>
<p>Vinaya went and got another one, but it was very undivine. And this was from the same man that I was talking to about spiritual things!</p>
