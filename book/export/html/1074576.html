<p>The Master said in public:<br /> "My hope and my faith<br /> Are centred in my young disciples."<br /> The old disciples groaned:<br /> "Master, good-bye.<br /> We are leaving you for good."<br /> The Master then said:<br /> "My real disciples are those<br /> Who have denied themselves."<br /> The young disciples roared:<br /> "Master, we are leaving you, immediately.<br /> We have done so much for you.<br /> Your shameless ungratefulness<br /> Deserves us not."<br /> Who remained?<br /> Only children, Children of the Himalayan caves<br /> For the Transcendental Palace.</p>
