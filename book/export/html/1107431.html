<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. There can be evil forces or it can be a lack of concentration on the part of the pilot or the karma of some of the passengers. The pilot may be good, but all of a sudden the plane catches fire. There may be twenty passengers destined to die on that day; it is their karma. It is not the lack of concentration of the individual passengers. The time has come for them. It was destined that they would die in the plane crash.</p>  </div>
