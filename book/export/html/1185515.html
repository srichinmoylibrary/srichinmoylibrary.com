<p>“Father, are there any divine forces?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my son. Before I married your mother, I thought that your mother was really the best divine force. But to my surprise I see that God forgot to put even an iota of divine force in your mother. God totally forgot. This is very unusual, my son.”</p>  </div>
