<h2>Question: What form do hostile forces take?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Hostile forces can take any form. If you have a weakness in the physical, vital or mental plane, then they may come and attack you. Suppose on the mental plane you are telling a lie. If you can see who the real culprit is, then you will immediately notice the form of a hostile force. Suppose you are a drug addict and you are trying to get rid of your problem. For a time you become sincere, then again you make the same mistake. When you make the mistake, right in front of you, you will see the form of a hostile force. Easily you will be able to see that they are clapping and playing the drum. Once they see that you have fallen, they think that you are giving up and they are happy.</p>  </div>
