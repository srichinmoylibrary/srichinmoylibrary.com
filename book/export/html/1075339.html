<p>Some people<br /> Are grateful to God<br /> Because they feel He is so kind,<br /> Because He fulfils their desires.</p>
<p>Some people<br /> Are grateful to God<br /> Because they think He is so blind,<br /> Because He sees not what they do.</p>
<p>Some people<br /> Are grateful to God<br /> Because God does not fulfil<br /> Their earth-bound desires,<br /> Because He feeds<br /> Their Heaven-free aspiration,<br /> Because He evolves in them,<br /> Because He evolves through them,<br /> Because He is all for them.</p>
