<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two reasons why I am always with you when you are in trouble. The first reason, which is absolutely true, is that your trouble is my trouble. The second reason is that as a gardener picks a flower from a tree and plants it in the ground, even so I picked you from the soul’s world and brought you into your parent’s family and into our spiritual path. So even before you came to earth, when you were in the soul’s world, my responsibility started. Now you are in the physical world but my responsibility in regard to your existence started in the soul’s world. Therefore I will always be in your trouble and I will always be in your progress, success, achievement and fulfilment.</p>  </div>
