<p>Nothing is impossible.<br /> My wise teacher, God, has taught me so.<br /> I have tried everything,<br /> And success is still a far cry.<br /> Yet my God says: "Stop not!<br /> Continue trying."</p>
<p>Nothing is impossible.<br /> My wild teacher, Vital, has taught me so.<br /> I have tried everything,<br /> And failed in everything.<br /> Now my vital says to me: "Stop trying!<br /> Not worth achieving."</p>
