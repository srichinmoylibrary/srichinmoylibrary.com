<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On our path, everything we do has to be part of a disciplined life. Early in the morning a child has to get up to go to school. If he remains at home fast asleep and does not go to school, then now will he ever become a man of learning? But there is something within him that compels him to go to school so that he can become a man of learning. In the spiritual life also, there is something within us that prompts us to pray and meditate on God early in the morning so that we can get peace of mind.</p>  </div>
