<p>A lady at customs in Hawaii was very politely talking to me. Then a man came with a note for her, saying that she was needed somewhere else. So she said to the man, “Just sign here.”</p>
<p>But the man started the whole procedure over again. She said she had done everything; he only had to sign. But for some reason he started harassing me. What is worse, people can never understand my tote-a-tune. I explained how it works: “It is a musical instrument. You can play it like this.”</p>
<p>I was showing him, but the stupid man thought that something electronic was hidden inside it. That was too much!</p>  </div>
