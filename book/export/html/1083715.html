<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That indicates an awakening. But this does not mean that your third eye is about to open. No. When you play most soulfully, an inner vision-light will come to the fore. Vision is within you, yet it is dormant. But now it wants to function properly; it does not want to sleep anymore. So inner vision is starting to operate. The vision of the third eye is trying to come to the fore and that is why you are getting that sensation. So it is a very good experience.</p>
<p>When you sing, you may feel an awakening in the throat centre. Those who have good voices have, to some extent, opened their throat centre. This is also a very good experience.</p>  </div>
