<p>This morning I offered my body's awakening to my Lord Beloved Supreme. I offered my vital's determination to my Lord Beloved Supreme. I offered my mind's willingness to my Lord Beloved Supreme. I offered my heart's surrender to my Lord Beloved Supreme. I offered my life's readiness to my Lord Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme said to my body, "My child, I am so proud of you. I am so proud of your wakefulness. Never, never go back to ignorance-sleep â€” never! For you is My infinite Compassion."</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme said to my vital, "My child, I am so proud of you. I am so proud of your determination. I am now transforming your determination into adamantine will power."</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme said to my mind, "My child, I am so proud of you. I am so proud of your willingness. I shall definitely make you a choice instrument of Mine."</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme said to my heart, "My child, I am so proud of you. I am so proud of your surrender. I shall inundate you with My boundless Delight."</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme said to my life, "My child, I am so proud of you. I am so proud of your readiness. Now that you are ready, I want you to serve Me in My entire creation."</p>
<p>This evening I offered my soul's fulfilled fragrance-promise to my Lord Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme said to my soul, "My child, I am so proud of you. I am so proud of your patience-light. For aeons you have been dreaming in and through the physical consciousness, the vital consciousness, the mental consciousness, the psychic consciousness and the life-river to manifest Me here on earth. I am exceedingly proud of you, My child."</p>
<p>Then my Lord Beloved Supreme said to my body, vital, mind, heart, life and soul, "My sweet children, I began piloting My Eternity's Dream Boat with you, and now with you I have reached My Infinity's Reality Shore. To you all I am offering My Immortality's Blessings."</p>
<p>My body, my vital, my mind, my heart, my life and my soul all said to our Lord Beloved Supreme, "O Supreme, You are our Eternity's All, All, All."</p>
