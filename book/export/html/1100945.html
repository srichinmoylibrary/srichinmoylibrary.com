    <title>Question: Guru, do you remember when you gave us the daily prayers,&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you said that you were giving us an approach that was most compatible with the Western mind, which is &amp;quot;I must conquer, I must conquer.&amp;quot;</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We must conquer fear, doubt, jealousy — everything. Those prayers that I gave a few years ago, alas, alas, many of you do not do. Once again I am sincerely requesting you to offer those prayers on a daily basis.</p>
