<p><em>During a workout at his home in Queens on 20 October 2005, Sri Chinmoy succeeded in doing a partial dumbbell wrist curl of 203 pounds. He completed ten repetitions with each wrist. Many television stations accepted footage of this remarkable feat and Sri Chinmoy offered a formal message to the newscasters thanking them for their kind comments and explaining his philosophy in more detail.</em></p>  </div>
