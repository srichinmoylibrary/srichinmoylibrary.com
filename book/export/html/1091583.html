<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you get pressure in your forehead or in your head, please feel that you are not meditating on the right place. You want to play a game, but unfortunately you have gone to the wrong playing field. When you feel pressure in your head or in your forehead during meditation, it means your mind has pulled down Light and Power beyond its capacity. At that time, immediately focus your attention on the heart. There you will feel peace, joy, love, confidence and everything else you need. Each time you feel pressure, consciously shift your attention to the heart. Then try to breathe in slowly and quietly for a few seconds and this tension will disappear.</p>  </div>
