<p>One day my sister had a fight with the maid, not the nurse. When I went to visit her, my sister made complaints that the maid had struck her. I asked the maid what had happened.</p>
<p>The maid said, "At two o'clock in the morning, she wanted to get out of her bed. I did not want her to get out. Where would she go at that hour? I was not allowing her to get up, so she struck me."</p>
<p>I said, "But my sister is telling me that you struck her."</p>
<p>The maid said, "In order to keep her in the bed, I slapped her three times." I was in between the maid and my sister; both had complaints against the other.</p>  </div>
