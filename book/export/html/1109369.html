<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good! Blue is the light of infinity, the light of spirituality. White light represents the Consciousness of the Divine Mother and also the soul's purity. Similarly, blue represents infinity and the essence of spirituality. My predominant colours are blue and gold. All the colours I embody, but the important colours in my life are blue and gold.</p>  </div>
