<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You yourself are the unmanifest. That is to say, your highest Self is still unmanifested. You, who represent God on earth, and you, who in your highest consciousness are absolutely one with God, are still unmanifested. Your highest is not manifested right now, but this does not mean that it will always remain unmanifested. No, your highest has to be manifested on earth, for then only can the perfect Perfection of the Supreme take place.</p>  </div>
