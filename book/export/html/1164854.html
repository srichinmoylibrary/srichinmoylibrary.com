    <title>Question: From what I understand about ashrams, they go to bed early. But because of our activities, we go to bed at twelve or one o&#039;clock. So, how can we be expected to get up early and meditate?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They go to bed early? Dearest one, you are mistaken. In some ashrams I have visited they go to bed at eleven or twelve or later because every night there is some function or activity. And in many cases they also have to go to work or to school early every morning. In some Indian ashrams, for example in the Himalayas, they do go to bed early. But in the modern ashrams it is a different matter. They do not go to bed early.</p>  </div>
