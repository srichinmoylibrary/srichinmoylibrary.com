<p>Someone is knocking, perhaps God.<br /> God can wait; after all, He deals with Eternity.<br /> Someone is knocking, perhaps man.<br /> I am sure he canâ€™t wait, since he has only<br /> A fleeting second at his disposal.<br /> Therefore, let me go and open the door.<br /> Someone is knocking, perhaps Satan.<br /> Ah, he just breaks open the door.<br /> God, You are kind to me.<br /> Man, I am kind to you.<br /> Satan, you are really something,<br /> You are really impossible!</p>
