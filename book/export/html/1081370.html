<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First, you have to become inseparably one with light instead of with darkness and ignorance. If you become inseparably one with light, which is wisdom, automatically you become one with beauty. First you have to become one with the Source. When you become one with the Source, naturally the possessions of the Source will become yours. If you become one with the consciousness of a tree, then you have also become one with the consciousness of the flowers and leaves of the tree.</p>  </div>
