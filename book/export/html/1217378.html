<p>Things do move faster with a young soul provided that he is a sincere and dedicated aspirant, that he listens to his spiritual Guide unreservedly and that he has not been burdened with too many worldly experiences.</p>
<p>Here again we have to be aware of one thing: It is not the number of incarnations that impedes the soul's rapid journey toward its Ultimate Goal, but the old unlit human habits and propensities which do not open so easily to the Light for purification and transformation.</p>  </div>
