<p><em>(The Asura brothers are in the seventh heaven of enjoyment. Lower vital music and vulgar dancing are all around.</em></p>
<p><em>Enter Tilottama. Immediately Sunda and Upasunda are swayed by tenebrous passion.)</em></p>
<p>SUNDA: Who are you? Your body’s beauty is torturing every limb of mine.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Do you need money? Do you need jewels? Do you need name and fame? I shall give you immediately anything you want. Stand beside me, please. Stay with me, please. My heart needs you badly.</p>
<p>TILOTTAMA: Please let me think over the matter. After all, it is quite serious.</p>
<p>SUNDA: O paragon of beauty, my heart can brook no delay. I love you. You are mine. You are absolutely mine.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Stop, Sunda! I can clearly see that she loves me infinitely more than she loves you. Such being the case, it is I who deserve her, and not you.</p>
<p>SUNDA: I am not sure. Granted, she loves you more than she loves me. But I love her infinitely more than you love her.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: O beauty unparalleled, how do you declare your life on earth?</p>
<p>TILOTTAMA: My name is Tilottama.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Like your beauty, your very name is torturing my heart and soul. You make me dream, and I make the world tremble. You are in all my thoughts. I must have you. I must tell you that I love you only, and I love nobody else on earth.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Tilottama, my darling, Sunda is a stranger to truth and I am a stranger to falsehood. I love you only. I am all yours. You are all mine. The moment I saw you my heart came close to breaking with stupendous ecstasy, my darling.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Upasunda, not once but twice, you dare to call her your darling! She is all mine. I am all hers. You rightly deserve most severe punishment from me for your unpardonable audacity.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Who punishes whom? You fool, you rogue, you brute!</p>
<p><em>(Upasunda severely strikes Sunda with his naked sword. Sunda immediately crosses his own sword with Upasunda’s. A terrible fight starts between the two. The fight is unbelievably fierce. In a few minutes the two brothers kill each other. Enter Brahma and Indra. Tilottama bows down to Brahma.)</em></p>
<p>TILOTTAMA: O my Creator, O my Source, I was a mere instrument of yours. You have blessed the world with your divine victory supreme. Once again this world of ours shall be flooded with light and delight.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Tilottama, you are my greatest joy and highest pride.</p>
<p>INDRA: Tilottama, you have saved me. You have saved my divine pride. You have saved my Kingdom’s life. My heart’s garland of gratitude to you I offer.</p>
<p><em>(Indra garlands Tilottama.)</em></p>  </div>
