  <h1 class="book-heading">71. Humility</h1>
  
 
<p>A humility-man is a God-satisfying life.</p>
<p>God forgot my name because I was disproportionately proud. God gave me not only His Name but also His God-capacities because I was sincerely humble.</p>
<p>A humble seeker-soul accepts both God's Compassion-Height and Justice-Light equally, happily, soulfully and unconditionally.</p>
<p>Humility-foundation holds the realisation-palace.</p>
<p>Excessive humility is impressive unreality and compulsive insincerity. When you pray to God for humility, God grants you humility plus His own Appreciation-Heart.</p>
<p>Pride left him hurriedly and helplessly the day he realised God.</p>
<p>Humility has been living permanently with him and in him since the day he came to know that what he has is a tiny ant-capacity.</p>
<p>Because of my sincere incapacity, humility and its closest friend, divinity, have become my intimate friends.</p>  </div>
