<p>Over two hundred people ran in our five-mile race. Many were excellent runners. How fast they ran! One had been in the Commonwealth Games. He did a 4:22 pace and came in first. The second runner was far behind him and the third was far behind the second.</p>
<p>Abarita was the fifth over-all. For the first mile Abarita ran with the top runners. I was so happy. Then, at the second mile, he fell behind. He could not keep up with them. Among the disciples Abarita was the first boy and Indu was the first girl. The girl who stood first over-all was far ahead of Indu. She was quite fat, but she was such a fast runner!</p>
