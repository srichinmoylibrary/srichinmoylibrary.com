<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Science is the expansion of the physical mind; spirituality deals with what is beyond the mind, with intuition. The domain of science is practicality. On the material plane science calls spirituality a dreamer and spirituality calls science a rascal. But on the highest plane spirituality and science are brothers. Spirituality says to science, “Brother, I need you. You are God’s Body; God is your body. You are God the Body.” And science says to spirituality, “You are God’s Soul; God is your soul. You are God the Soul.” The body needs the soul for realisation and the soul needs the body for manifestation.</p>  </div>
