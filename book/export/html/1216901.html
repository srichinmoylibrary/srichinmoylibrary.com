<p>In the comments book for the Hamburg concert, someone wrote a comment in Bengali. His name is Himangshu Shekar Vadra. He called me `Chinmoy-da' and said he was overwhelmed and deeply moved by the concert.</p>
<p>He and I knew each other so well. My brothers and sisters also knew him. We were brought up together; right from childhood we knew one another.</p>
<p>His brother used to run with me; he was our third best runner.</p>
<p>â€” 24 March 1985</p>  </div>
