<p><em>Maitreyi:</em> My Lord, you have always taught me that material wealth is of no avail. It is nothing in comparison to the inner wealth. Why, then, do you bind me with material wealth? Tell me one thing, my Lord: will this material wealth in any way add to my heart's mounting cry?</p>
<p><em>Yagnyavalkya:</em> Unfortunately, no.</p>
<p><em>Maitreyi:</em> Then why do you impose upon me things that will take me away from the path of Truth, from the path of Divinity, from the path of Immortality? My Lord, my heart pines only for the immortal, transcendental Self. I want nothing but Immortality's Life. <em>Yenaham namrta syam kim aham tena kuryam.</em> What shall I do with the things that cannot make me immortal? Let Katyayani have all your material wealth. Let her cherish your earthly possessions, and I shall treasure your Heavenly possession-your loftiest realisation, your total oneness with the Absolute.</p>
