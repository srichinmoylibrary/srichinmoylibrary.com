<p>This is the story of how I smashed my first camera into pieces. The caretaker at India House, B. R. Gupta, bought me a small camera. It was worth eight or ten dollars. I thought I would use it to take pictures at S. K. Roy’s farewell party. That evening, I took quite a few pictures and I was very happy.</p>
<p>The following day I got the film back, but nothing had come out. I was so disgusted. I said, “A camera is not meant for me. In India I knew it. These things are hostile forces!”</p>
<p>I came out of the building. I remember it was snowing. Then so powerfully I smashed the camera on the street. Afterwards I said, “I have to be a good person.” So I sat down and collected all the pieces. I broke the camera into pieces, so I had to pick them up.</p>
<p>That was my first and last experience in those days with a camera. Some years later, Sudha, the President of our Puerto Rican Centre, gave me a camera and that camera fortunately worked.</p>  </div>
