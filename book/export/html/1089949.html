<p>Ignorance, do you think you are<br /> really powerful?<br /> I tell you, you are not.<br /> My heart's cry is infinitely stronger.</p>
<p>Ignorance, stupidity's height,<br /> futility's night,<br /> Do I have to hear from you<br /> How far or how close<br /> My Beloved Supreme is?<br /> I know where He is<br /> I know who He is.<br /> I know why He is.<br /> Where is He?<br /> He is inside my heart-life.<br /> Who is He?<br /> He is my Eternity's Lord Supreme.<br /> Why is He?<br /> To fulfil Himself in and through me.</p>
