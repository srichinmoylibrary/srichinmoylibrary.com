<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not many people. But 'many' is a vague term. Only you can say that there are more insincere Masters than sincere Masters. This I can say categorically. If you have to use numbers, if you want to make a comparison, then categorically I can say that there are more insincere Masters â€” not only in America, but all over the world.</p>  </div>
