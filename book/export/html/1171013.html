<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God’s favourite toys are human beings. And the ones that love to play with Him all the time are His most favourite. We become tired of playing with our friends or with our parents and our dear ones. But there are some aspiring human beings who constantly, sleeplessly, breathlessly and self-givingly want to play with God. So those people are God’s most favourite toys.</p>  </div>
