<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can best overcome negative forces just by becoming more aware of positive forces. If you want to conquer darkness, use your light-force. There are two rooms. One room is full of light and the other room is full of darkness. If you want to overcome anything that is negative or destructive, then you donâ€™t go to that room. You go to the one that has the positive aspects of life, that has Light, Peace and Bliss. You go to the room that has the positive qualities. Then all these positive qualities you try to assimilate. Once you are inundated with the positive qualities, then you can enter into the room with the negative forces.</p>
<p>So pay no attention to the negative forces. Pay attention only to the positive forces, positive forces, positive forces. Let the positive forces become extremely powerful in your life; then you will be able to overcome the negative forces. But if in the beginning you start to pay attention to the negative forces, then you will be destroyed.</p>  </div>
