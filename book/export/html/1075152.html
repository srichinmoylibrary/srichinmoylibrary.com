<p>EARLY AND LATE</p>
<p>I went to see God<br /> An hour early.<br /> He welcomed me<br /> And<br /> Shook hands with me.</p>
<p>I went to see God<br /> Two hours early.<br /> He welcomed me<br /> And<br /> Embraced me.</p>
<p>I went to see God<br /> Three hours early.<br /> He welcomed me<br /> And<br /> Made me sit on His<br /> Transcendental Throne.</p>
<p>I went to see God<br /> A minute late.<br /> He thoughtfully hesitated to welcome me.</p>
<p>I went to see God<br /> Two minutes late.<br /> He simply ignored my arrival.</p>
<p>I went to see God<br /> Three minutes late.<br /> He refused to open the door.</p>
