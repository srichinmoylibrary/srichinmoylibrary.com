<p>This morning I was walking in front of my house. A police car stopped right at the corner and honked. I said to myself, “I am doing nothing wrong; I am only walking.”</p>
<p>When I came near the car, I stopped. The policeman said to me, “Good morning, good morning!”</p>
<p>I responded, “Good morning, good morning!” Then he opened his door and came out of the car. He said to me, “Sri Chinmoy, God is always with you.”</p>
<p>I said, “So is He always with you as well!”</p>
<p>He said, “No, no. God is always with you.” He was not saying “God bless you,” or anything, but “God is always with you.”</p>
<p>Then he said, “You have made my day,” and he went back into his car. This is a policeman whom I have never met before. He was so nice.</p>
