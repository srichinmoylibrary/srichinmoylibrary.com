<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to say that through meditation we can conquer the fear of death. When we meditate, we enter into the endless Life. But just by entering into the endless Life, we do not possess that Life. It is only by meditating and meditating that we can grow into that endless Life.</p>  </div>
