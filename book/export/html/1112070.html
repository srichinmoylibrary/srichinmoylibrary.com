<p>Mr. Mikio Oda, the Japanese man who visited our Centre in San Juan, failed miserably in the 1920 Olympics. Then, in the following Olympics, he was first. His event was the hop, skip and jump. He was quite short, but he gave all the credit to his ankles. He had strengthened his ankles like anything. He was the Japanese national champion, but he was very, very humble and modest. He told us that he never gives talks about his event or about his Olympic experiences, but he was kind enough to speak at our Centre. He said this was because my simplicity had touched his heart.</p>
