<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Before I realised God consciously, I did not always know Him. But once I realised God, I came to know that I had definitely always known Him from the beginning of His creation, from His highest transcendental Height to when He entered into the heart of inconscience. That was a very long, long time ago.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>I am telling you a great secret: you are a fantastic Dream of God</em>, Agni Press, 1974<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/gsdg-28</p></small>    </div>  </body>
