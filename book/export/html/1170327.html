<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have a Master of your own, he is the best person to answer your questions. If you find it difficult, then you should ask him what to do. When you get a mantra from a Master, or if you were initiated by a Master, it is always best for you to speak to him. Your Master knows what your soul needs, in the same way that a doctor knows what medicine he has given you. If you feel that this doctor cannot cure you, then naturally you can go to another doctor. Similarly, if you don’t feel confidence in your Master and you change Masters, at that time the new one will be able to help you and guide you. But as long as you are under the guidance of one spiritual Master, it is not advisable for another Master to tell you what you should do. Here I can answer general questions, such as, “What is the best time to meditate?” but I cannot become involved in anybody else’s method. It would be a terrible mistake, because each Master has a method of his own which is absolutely right for his disciples. It may or may not be applicable to you. At the same time, my method will be totally different from his. I am not saying that my method is the most effective — far from it — but my method is only for those who will eventually follow my path.</p>  </div>
