<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can be completely surrendered to God and still be responsible to worldly needs, but to worldly needs only according to God's Light. If God feels the need is a real need, that need can easily be fulfilled. Imaginary needs and demands are countless, but our true inner need is only one: illumination. If illumination is someone's real need, naturally God will fulfil that real need.</p>  </div>
