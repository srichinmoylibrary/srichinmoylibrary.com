<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, if you enter into the spiritual life and go deep within, you are bound to recall your promises. When you practise the spiritual life for a few years, the messages come to the fore from the soul itself. So it is only a matter of time. And once you become aware of the promise that you made to God before you entered into the world-arena, you try hard to fulfil it.</p>  </div>
