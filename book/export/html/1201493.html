<p>We suffer<br /> When there is an outer catastrophe.<br /> But do we really care<br /> About our inner catastrophes:<br /> Fear, doubt and anxiety?<br /> Our inner catastrophes<br /> At every moment<br /> Are not only haunting us<br /> But destroying our inner life-breath.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">15729</h1>
  
 

<p>The mind's hesitation,<br /> The heart's frustration<br /> And the life's destruction<br /> Are forced to run<br /> Towards an unknown destination.</p>

<div id="node-1201526" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15733</h1>
  
 

<p>A desire-life<br /> Will, without fail,<br /> Need radical purification<br /> Before it is allowed<br /> To enter into the heart-beauty's<br /> Aspiration-garden.</p>

<p>It is our psychic promises<br /> That are eventually fulfilled.<br /> Our mental promises,<br /> Emotional promises<br /> And all other promises<br /> Quite often are not fulfilled.<br /> Why?<br /> Because they do not have<br /> The necessary perseverance,<br /> Their way of seeing the truth<br /> Is not clear<br /> And their goal itself<br /> Is unclear.</p>

<div id="node-1201540" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15747</h1>
  
 

<p>What does a desire-life do?<br /> It only disappoints us,<br /> Either at the very beginning<br /> Of our journey,<br /> Or in the middle, or at the end.<br /> The desire-life-journey<br /> Is always a disappointment<br /> Either today or tomorrow<br /> Or some other time.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1201541" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15748</h1>
  
 

<p>Each life is caught<br /> By temptation-tentacles.<br /> Again, each life can be liberated<br /> By God's infinite Compassion<br /> And man's sleepless aspiration.</p>

<p>If you are reluctantly ready<br /> To change your life,<br /> Then God does not want it.<br /> He cannot appreciate<br /> Your reluctance-transformation.<br /> What He needs and wants from you<br /> Is a cheerful and willing<br /> Transformation-beauty,<br /> Transformation-perfection and<br /> Transformation-satisfaction.</p>

<p>God has a very special Concern<br /> For the newly-arrived souls.<br /> He does not want them to mix freely<br /> With the old souls,<br /> Who have surrendered to<br /> ignorance-night.<br /> He wants these newly-arrived souls<br /> To fight right from the beginning<br /> Against ignorance-night<br /> And establish His supreme Victory<br /> Here on earth.</p>
