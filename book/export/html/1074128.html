<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There were quite a few warriors who had better muscles, better definition, than Mr. Universe. At that time there were no Nautilus or Universal machines. Those things were not there. But nature helped them. They prayed to nature, they took exercise and they were nourished by Mother Earth. Needless to say, Bhima's physique was in no way inferior to Mr. Universe or Mr. Olympia.</p>  </div>
