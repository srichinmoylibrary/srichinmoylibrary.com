<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to wait for God's chosen Hour, you have to feel that God is thinking of you more than you are thinking of Him. But instead, your mind turns to other things. You become jealous, insecure or frightened. When you get time to think, you think of yourself or you think of others with all your jealousy, envy and hatred. At that time, God is not your God but someone else's, and it is your friends or enemies who claim all your attention. That is why patience does not enter into your life.</p>  </div>
