<p>This morning, when I was lifting the cow, the weight that they gave was totally wrong. When I first tried to lift it, I said, “This will be my first embarrassment.” Then I killed myself and did it!</p>
<p>I wanted to have Samarpana on the platform while I was lifting the cow, but the cow was so heavy that I changed my mind. I said, “Now if I take Samarpana also, it will be too much for me to lift.”</p>
<p>Already the platform that is on top of my shoulders weighs 460 pounds. It is much more difficult than the one which rests on the ground.</p>
<p>In Chittagong we had a cow named Nandini that was almost the same size as the one I lifted today. We had anothercow named Surabhi. Surabhi was quite thin and Nandini was quite heavy.</p>
