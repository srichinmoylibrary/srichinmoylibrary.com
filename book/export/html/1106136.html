<p>While I was lifting 240 pounds this morning, I had the idea to look up at the weight when it was over my head. I was watching it in amazement. My human mind could not believe that I had lifted so much weight — it got an electric shock! I was so stunned that I forgot to move away from the power rack quickly enough when I released the dumbbell. As it fell down, it jumped a little and hit my forehead. Fortunately, I was not hurt although it was very nearly a serious accident. When the dumbbell comes down, the whole house shakes.</p>
