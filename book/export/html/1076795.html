<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Liberation means the actual freedom from fear, freedom from doubt, freedom from ignorance and freedom from death. Now, as soon as you come into this world you become a prey to ignorance, fear, limitation and doubt. But through our spiritual practise and by living the inner life, we enter into the consciousness of the Divine and there we start growing and a day comes when we are well established, fully established, in the spiritual consciousness of inner life. We become totally free from ignorance. Now we are caught by ignorance, we are wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance; but a day dawns when we will be free from ignorance, and the moment that we are free from ignorance, we are liberated for good.</p>  </div>
