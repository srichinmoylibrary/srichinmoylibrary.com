<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The other two souls are integrated inside the new one. They have now disappeared inside the new one, which is vaster than the vastest. The two old ones, the souls in the separated worlds, East and West, are not of the same standard as the new soul. Which is better, which is worse, which is more developed, God alone knows. Then a day will come when these two souls will be taken to rest in the soul's world, according to their soul's development. But still they are staying inside the new one, the one that is guiding the destiny of Germany.</p>  </div>
