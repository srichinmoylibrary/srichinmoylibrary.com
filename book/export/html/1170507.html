<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My students do everything. They participate in sports and they have completely thrown themselves into the peace movement. Every second year we have a Peace Run. In the last run, seventy-six countries participated, and millions of people who are true lovers of peace — from children right up to octogenarians — held our Peace Torch. My students are trying to be of service to mankind, to people who sincerely want peace and who are looking for something that will give them abiding satisfaction.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Thank you very much.</p>  </div>
