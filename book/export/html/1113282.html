<p>On our way to the playground I said to Nolini-da: "Since you are still suffering from your cough, would you please try Sudhir-da's medicine?"</p>
<p>He burst into laughter. "Sudhir is my dear and real friend, but I cannot take him as my doctor."</p>
<p>At the playground Nolini-da said: "Today I shall read out to you two things; two, because they are short. One is a continuation of my previous reminiscences; the other one I won't tell you about right now."</p>
<p>After he had read out the first one he said: "You are all familiar with the concept of 'Hymns to the Light' but you will be surprised to learn why I am writing 'Hymns to the Darkness'." He also read out his English translations of Rabindranath's Bengali songs and of some Bengali poems by modern writers.</p>
<p>On our way back from the playground he asked me and Rajen-da our opinion. Rajen-da said: "Excellent!"</p>
<p>I said to him: "I have learnt something new: at times there is a real need for darkness."</p>
<p>He said: "At times darkness is nothing but a future preparation for a brighter light."</p>  </div>
