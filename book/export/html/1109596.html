  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Are there truths inside us that cannot be expressed, but are real, and at some time will we be able to express them?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there are still millions and billions of truths that have not been expressed outwardly, but they will definitely be expressed at God’s choice time. It is not that man will never be able to express them outwardly, no. It is simply that there are countless secrets which God does not want to be revealed untimely. If you do anything untimely, you will not get the proper result. If you eat a mango that is not ripe, you will not get the same delicious taste. It is not sweet at all. There is a choice hour for everything. When the time comes, God will reveal the truth. No truth in God’s creation will remain unrevealed or unmanifested. The truths that are now hidden or kept safe in the inner worlds, at God’s choice Hour will come to the fore, and they will be able to express themselves. But now if they are revealed, they will create serious problems for man’s present understanding of truth and light.</p>
<p>There is a time for everything. If we do something untimely, instead of giving us illumination, it will only create more confusion. We know that a little child may eventually get a Master’s degree. But now he is ready only to learn the alphabet. Knowing that one day he has to study higher courses, will you bring him the Ramayana or the Mahabharata to read now? His parents may say, “If he studies the Ramayana and Mahabharata, then he will become a great pandit. The whole world is there inside these two sacred books.”</p>
<p>But now that little child is not ready. His receptivity is so limited. He knows only the letters A and B. If the parents compel him to study those big books, they will not be doing the right thing. Similarly, only when God asks them to reveal those secrets will the cosmic gods and others who are holding the truths inside us unlock the doors. Then we will be able to utilise those sublime truths or secrets in our day-to-day life for our own purpose.</p>  </div>
