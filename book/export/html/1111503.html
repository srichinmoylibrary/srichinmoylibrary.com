<p>At one point I saw somebody wearing one of our T-shirts. "Who is over sixty years old and running on our team?" I wondered. His whole body was twisted, and I couldn't recognise him. Then I saw it was Udayan. It seemed he had no hair; he looked practically bald. He was thirty metres away from me, but because of his bald head and totally twisted body, I thought to myself, "How could this old man have our T-shirt on?"</p>
