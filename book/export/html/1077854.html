<p>You want to know who I am<br /> And what I have of late accomplished.<br /> Well, I am your soul.<br /> I have recently done<br /> Quite a few striking things:<br /> I have forsaken your body-cage<br /> Because<br /> It is too dirty,<br /> I have forsaken your vital-window<br /> Because<br /> It is unbearably naughty,<br /> I have forsaken your mind-door<br /> Because<br /> It is very mean,<br /> I have forsaken your heart-cave<br /> Because<br /> It is too weak.</p>
