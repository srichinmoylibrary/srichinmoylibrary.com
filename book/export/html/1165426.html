<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In weight training and bodybuilding, it seems to me that men care more for physical strength and women tend to care more for physical beauty. Although both men and women are trying to have beautiful and powerful physiques, men give more importance to the strength aspect and women give more importance to the beauty aspect.</p>  </div>
