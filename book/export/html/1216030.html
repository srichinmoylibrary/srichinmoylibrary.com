<p>I played with Eternity the other day.<br /> Neither Eternity nor I won the game,<br /> Neither Eternity nor I lost the game.</p>
<p>I sang with Infinity the other night.<br /> Indeed, we two are the singers<br /> Of the transcendental Heights.</p>
<p>I danced with Immortality the other day.<br /> At the end we bartered our lives.</p>
<p>I walked with God the other night.<br /> When He felt tired, I carried Him along<br /> On my shoulders.<br /> When I felt tired, He carried me along<br /> Inside His Heart.</p>
