    <title>Question: Last week in Philadelphia when we visited Independence Hall and went through the rooms, I got a very strong feeling that I had been there before; and I want to know if my soul just was reacting patriotically or whether I really was there during the revolutionary period?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Undoubtedly you were there during the revolutionary period. Unfortunately, you were not one of the high-ranking military men or patriots. You had patriotism in abundant measure, but not in the capacity of a leader. You were a member of the infantry.</p>  </div>
