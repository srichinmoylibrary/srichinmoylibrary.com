<p>We shall not wait. If we wait, we shall lose. If we lose, we shall weep. Who wants to weep? Nobody. We wish only to smile at our Beloved Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>We shall not wait. If we wait, we shall fail. If we fail, we shall die. Who wants to die? Nobody. We want only to live on earth to spread the Light of our Beloved Supreme. We want to live on earth to manifest Him in His own way.</p>
<p>To wait is to make friends with empty hours, empty days, empty months and empty years. To wait is to miss God's Perfection-Freedom-Train which is bound for the ever-increasing Satisfaction-Station.</p>
<p>If we do not wait, our life's inspiration and our heart's aspiration will make us see the Face of our Creator. Our Creator needs no future; He has and He is the eternal Now.</p>
<p>If we do not wait, our Beloved Lord, the Author of all Good, will make us His choice instruments by transforming our life within and without totally, Him to manifest in His own way. We shall be His perfect channels of revealing Light and fulfilling Delight.</p>
<p>If we do not wait, in the inner world revolution will be our name; in the inner world, evolution will be our name; and in our own world, satisfaction will be our name.</p>
<p>We shall not wait. We shall start praying and meditating. We shall pray continuously. We shall meditate continuously. If we continuously pray, one day at God's choice Hour, we shall grow into God's transcendental Height. If we continuously meditate, one day at God's choice Hour, we shall grow into God's universal Light.</p>
