<p>The man-Guru shows you the Throne of the infinite. The God-Guru makes you sit on the Throne.</p>
<p>The Guru is at once the sigh of unaspiring disciples and the ecstasy of aspiring disciples.</p>
<p>A real Guru is the selfless, dedicated and eternal beggar who begs omnipotence and omnipresence from God to feed his unconsciously hungry and consciously aspiring disciples, in perfect conformity with their souls’ needs.</p>
<p>The Guru has only one compassionate Weapon: Forgiveness. The disciple has three naked swords: Limitation, Weakness and Ignorance. Nevertheless, the Guru wins with great ease.</p>
<p>A man may have hundreds of companions. But a spiritual seeker has only one companion: his Preceptor.</p>
<p>The Guru is the one who closes the Door at the Will of God and opens It to the tears of the disciple.</p>
<p>When you go to a doctor, you must tell him all about the disease you have been suffering from. Otherwise he will not be able to help you fully. Likewise you must make a clean breast of your errors and misdeeds to your Guru. Mere acceptance of a Guru, while you secretly move and act at your sweet will, can be of no avail.</p>
<p>There is no better way for a disciple to serve his Guru than to listen to his advice.</p>
<p>He alone is the real disciple who finds no wrong in his Guru. Being one with the Guru, he discovers his Guru’s Consciousness to be perpetual molasses and he himself a lump of transformed sugar.</p>
<p>The Guru is at once the source of his disciple’s achievements and a most faithful servant of his disciple’s love.</p>
<p>The Guru and the disciple must test each other sweetly, seriously and perfectly before their mutual acceptance. Otherwise, if they are wrong in their selection, the Guru will have to dance with failure and the disciple with perdition.</p>
<p>The Guru is the consolation for the disciple’s despair; also is he the compensation for the disciple’s loss, if there be any, during the seeker’s endless journey towards the all-fulfilling Goal.</p>
<p>The Guru’s love for his disciple is his strength. The disciples’ surrender towards his Guru is his strength.</p>
<p>The Mother aspect of the Guru is sacrifice. The Father aspect of the Guru is compassion.</p>
<p>The Guru is not the body. The Guru is the revelation an manifestation of a Divine Power upon earth.</p>  </div>
