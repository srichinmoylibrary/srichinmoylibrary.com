<blockquote>
<p>"Only a Christ could have conceived a Christ."</p>
<p>Joseph Parker: <em>Ecce Deus</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Swami Vivekananda once said that only another Vivekananda could have realised what this Vivekananda had done. Napoleon also said something in this vein. Alas, I too sail in their boat when I bury my head, with ceaselessly brooding disappointments, inside my palms.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1111092" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"In order to see Christianity, one must forget almost all the Christians."</p>
<p>Henri Frédéric Amiel: <em>Journal</em></p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Jesus cannot be our Saviour unless he is first our Lord."</p>
<p>Hugh C. Burr</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He who said, "I and my Father are one," definitely had become our Lord before He became our Saviour.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1111096" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"If ever man was God or God man, Jesus Christ was both."</p>
<p>Lord Byron</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lovingly and devotedly, I have something to add: man the God was made of streaming tears; God the man was made of blossoming Smiles.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Art is the Tree of Life. Science is the Tree of Death. God is Jesus."</p>
<p>William Blake</p>

<p>True, absolutely true. Also, something more to add: God is God-Appointment, God is God-Enlightenment and God is God-Fulfilment.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1111101" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Christianity is a battle — not a dream."</p>
<p>Wendell Phillips</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My divinity is a reality-beauty-dream and a reality-beauty-fragrance, and not a battlefield-reality.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1111102" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Christians have been the most intolerant of all men."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">13.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Christmas is not a date. It is a state of mind."</p>
<p>Mary Ellen Chase: <em>New York Times</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely true. Just a little to add: Christmas is humanity's dream-preparation-beauty and Divinity's Reality-Perfection-Fragrance.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1111104" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"The Church has many critics but no rivals."</p>
<p>Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, humanity's God-worshipping heart-shrine has innumerable critics, but no rivals worth mentioning.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1111105" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"He cannot have God for his father who refuses to have the Church for his mother."</p>
<p>St. Augustine: <em>De Symbolo</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believed God was only mine, but my accomplishment has far surpassed my belief. Now I see that God is for all.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1111109" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"In the matter of belief, we are all extreme conservatives."</p>
<p>William James: <em>Pragmatism</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the matter of self-styled faith, we are all exorbitantly creative.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1111110" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Adversity reminds men of religion."</p>
<p>Livy: <em>Annales, V, 51</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adversity reminds men of their crying heart-beauty and, at the same time, of their smiling soul-fragrance.</p>  </div>

<blockquote>
<p>"God is no respecter of persons."</p>
<p><em>New Testament: Acts 10:34</em></p>

<p>"If God is not in us, He never existed."</p>
<p>Voltaire: <em>La Loi Naturelle: Exordium</em></p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"God is great, and therefore He will be sought; He is good, and therefore He will be found."</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">37.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Even God cannot change the past."</p>
<p>Agathon</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">40.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Conscience is God's presence in man."</p>
<p>Emmanuel Swedenborg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Division is God's absence from man.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1111131" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">41.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"The cross is the ladder of heaven."</p>
<p>Thomas Draxe: <em>Biblioth, Scholas</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cross is the Heaven-ascending ladder. The non-acceptance of God's Will is the abysmal abyss-descending ladder.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">45.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"God is where He was."</p>
<p>English Proverb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God's Compassion-Eye and God's Forgiveness-Heart are where they were before.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1111136" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">46.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"If God loved you as much as you love Him, where would you be?"</p>
<p>Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am all ready to answer this question, but God wants me to keep my mouth sealed. Never mind, since I am always a God-disobedient creature. If God loved me as much as I love Him, then I would be playing, singing and dancing inside my totally isolated mind-jungle.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1111137" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">47.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"God save me from my friends; I can take care of my enemies."</p>
<p>English Proverb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God has saved me from my friends. God has even saved me from my enemies. But, alas, He has not saved me from myself, so far.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1111138" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">48.</h1>
  
 
<blockquote>
<p>"Some people complain because God put thorns on roses, while others praise Him for putting roses among thorns."</p>
<p>Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I praise God for both the thorns and the roses, because I clearly see and feel that thorns are my God-preparation-journey and roses are my God-satisfaction-goal.</p>  </div>
