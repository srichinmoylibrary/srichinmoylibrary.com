<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you see this light, it is a very good experience. The triangle here represents three of my inner qualities in the form of light. You are seeing my Consciousness in the form of light, my Bliss in the form of light and my Power in the form of light: Consciousness, Delight and Power in the form of a luminous triangle.</p>  </div>
