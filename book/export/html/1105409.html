<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one really wants to know, one can. If one wants to learn, one goes to school. If one wants sing, one goes to a musician, a singer. If one wants to know anything, then one goes to someone who already knows. If someone wants to know what his <em>dharma</em> is, then he has to go to someone who knows everybody's <em>dharma.</em></p>  </div>
