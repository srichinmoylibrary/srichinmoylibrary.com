<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. Real music does not depend on words. But if the music does have words, that does not mean that it is not divine or soul-stirring, heart-elevating. Far from it! Music can embody words; again, music need not embody words. When it wants to express its reality, divinity and immortality, it need not have words. Without words it can offer its immortality to the aspiring soul in the seeker. But if music has words, there is nothing wrong in it. With words music can also offer its immortality to the aspiring soul.</p>
<p>From the highest point of view, music is not mere words; it is not a concept, not an idea. Music is Reality in its highest form. God is the Supreme Musician and He is playing the supreme Music in and through us, His chosen instruments. He is playing on us in His own way. He does not need any human instruments or words to convey His Message, to convey Himself. This He can do in silence without taking any help from the sound-world.</p>  </div>
