<p>I was typing in the flower-room when Nolini-da came in.</p>
<p>"This morning I misplaced the file containing my new articles to be added for the new edition of <em>Banglar Pran</em> (the heart of Bengal). Can you look for it?"</p>
<p>Immediately I stood up and rushed into his room. For about half an hour I searched. Finally I found it and gave it to him. With a smile he said to me: "Chinmoy, in this world some people are meant to misplace things and some people are meant to find them."</p>  </div>
