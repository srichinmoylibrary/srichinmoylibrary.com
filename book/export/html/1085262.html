<p>Ashutosh Mukherji was India’s very, very great son and also Bengal’s devoted child. Because of his heroism, Ashutosh was known as the “Bengal Tiger,” and he did many brave and courageous things for his Mother India. As the head of Calcutta University, Ashutosh sacrificed his all so that the University could stand on the same footing as the highest ranking schools in the country.</p>
<p>Once, he wished a particular question to appear for three consecutive years on the final examination for one of the science courses. To please him, the professors posed the question, but not one student was able to answer it correctly.</p>
<p>After the third year Ashutosh asked to review the examination papers himself. Then he called all the professors into his office and said, “Why is it that nobody can answer this question? Do you not teach your students well?”</p>
<p>All the professors remained silent; either they could not or did not dare to answer the president’s question. But Satyen Bose stood up and said, “What can we do? It is the question itself that is causing the problem. How can our students answer it when the question is not correct?”</p>
<p>Then Satyen Bose demonstrated to Ashutosh what was wrong with the question. The other professors were embarrassed and afraid that Ashutosh Mukherji would be angry with Bose. But instead, the president appreciated and admired him like anything: “Oh, I am so glad that you have found the mistake. I need brave people. I need correction from every side. Then only can Calcutta University remain in the vanguard of India’s top-ranking universities. You are very great; again, you are very good. I bless you, for you are truly a great son of our Mother Bengal.”</p>
