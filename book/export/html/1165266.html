<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you go there, it is not like that. Think of it in this way: When you go to bed, you don’t have to put on all your garments. There you don’t have to put on your sari blouse, sweater and so on. In Heaven, you don’t have a physical body as you do here. There, light is entering into light. When you are coming back to earth, at that time you put on different garments: the vital world, this world, that world. Some of the garments may be dirty, filthy. But there is a kind of perfection that you will eventually have: the perfection of everything that you will use on earth. That is called integral perfection.</p>  </div>
