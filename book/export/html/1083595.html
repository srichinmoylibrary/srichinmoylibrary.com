<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God was closest to you during your life five years ago, the day your Guru blessed you from his Transcendental Consciousness and took full responsibility for your inner life and outer life, assuring your soul and your entire being that he would without fail carry them to the highest Heights of the ever-transcending Beyond.</p>  </div>
