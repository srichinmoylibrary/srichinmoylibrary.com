<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When one realises God, one has the capacity to stand above one’s own fate or <em>karma</em>. But if God wants him to accept his own <em>karma</em> and go through the pain and suffering, he will do so and offer it as an experience to God. At that time, he feels that God is having these experiences in and through him. After realisation one can nullify the law of <em>karma</em>. Again, if one wants to accept the punishment or retribution of others’ <em>karma</em>, one can do it. If it is God’s Will, a realised person can nullify his own and others’ <em>karma</em>, or he can consciously, deliberately and smilingly accept both his own <em>karma</em> and the <em>karma</em> of others.</p>  </div>
