<p>Suren Bose offered Nolini-da a few flowers along with the Bengali translation of <em>The Life Divine, Part Two.</em> Nolini-da asked him how old he was, since it was his birthday. He said he was seventy-eight, remarking that he was the same age as Nolini-da.</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "I am only seventy-three. You are much older than I, but I am glad that you are keeping good health."</p>
<p>"It is all the Mother's Grace. I just recovered from a most serious illness."</p>  </div>
