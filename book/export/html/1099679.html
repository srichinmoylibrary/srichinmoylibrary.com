<p>The day after I arrived in Pondicherry, I said, “Let me go and reconfirm my reservation and see if there are any problems.”</p>
<p>When I went there, it was the same story — Chose instead of Ghose. But the fellow who was the agent was a good friend of mine. He spoke to the Madras people in front of me. Madras and Calcutta both reconfirmed my booking, but in Bangkok they said my name was not listed. My friend was screaming at the people in Bangkok: “It is there under Chose. Change it, for God’s sake, in the computer!”</p>
<p>They would not do it. This went on for two consecutive days. The first day I spent an hour and a half; the second day I spent about 45 minutes. My friend was not deceiving me. He was screaming at them, “Why do you do this kind of thing?”</p>
<p>Then he told me, “The Calcutta people could have made the proper spelling change, but perhaps they wanted money from you.”</p>
<p>Finally he got them to change Chose to Ghose.</p>  </div>
