    <title>&lt;em&gt;Mr. George Riddell:&lt;/em&gt; One of the first questions that comes to us: there is evidently a very sacred note in that chant and I was wondering if you might interpret it for us in English, to know what it was about.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Thank you. This chant is one of the most famous chants in India. From time immemorial, this chant has been sung, chanted by the seekers of Truth. The seers, the sages of the Upanishads sang this chant. The significance, the meaning of this prayers is:</p>
<p>Lead me from the untruth to the Truth,<br />Lead me from darkness to Light.<br />Lead me from death to Immortality.</p>
<p>The firmament of India still resounds with this soul-stirring chant of the Vedic and the Upanishadic seers of India.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>AUM -- Vol. 3, No. 9,10, Apr. -- May 27, 1968</em>, Boro Park Printers -- Brooklyn, N. Y., 1968<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/aum-299</p></small>    </div>  </body>
