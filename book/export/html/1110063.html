<p>Alas, hostility reigns supreme<br /> In various parts of the world,<br /> Specially in his own country.<br /> When President Gorbachev wisely resigned<br /> From his Presidency post,<br /> It was mistakenly taken as his downfall.<br /> His arch-enemies,<br /> Stupidity-incarnate souls,<br /> Who ruthlessly applauded his downfall,<br /> Will before long be compelled<br /> From deep within<br /> To heartily and mightily applaud<br /> His world-illumining sunrise.<br /> Their mind will show the white flag<br /> To his blue heart.</p>

<div id="node-1110110" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">46.</h1>
  
 

<p>To join President Gorbachev<br /> Is to join a wisdom-inundated circle<br /> And encircle<br /> The world-transformation-miracle.</p>

<div id="node-1110111" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">47.</h1>

  <h1 class="book-heading">49.</h1>
  
 

<p>President Gorbachev's heart-enlightenment<br /> And his life-commitment<br /> Are two life-long compeers<br /> That are desperately striving<br /> For the blossoming of a new world.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110114" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">50.</h1>
  
 

<p>Alas, world-ignorance is fathomless.<br /> The heart of countless Russians<br /> Expressed their genuine love<br /> For Raisa Maximovna<br /> Only after her earth-departure.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110115" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">52.</h1>
  
 

<p>A German adage runs:<br /> "In America, an hour is 40 minutes."<br /> A Russian adage runs:<br /> "The slower you go,<br /> The farther you will be...."<br /> When I identify President Gorbachev<br /> With the German proverb,<br /> I clearly see that his hour is 33 minutes.<br /> The inimitable way he gave freedom<br /> To Poland, Hungary, East Germany,<br /> Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania,<br /> He himself is the perfect synthesis<br /> Of his saying and doing:<br /> "History cannot wait; people cannot afford to waste time. It may also be too late tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow may never come."<br /> When I identify him<br /> With the Russian proverb,<br /> Slowness is founded upon patience —<br /> Patience, patience, patience.<br /> He has not given up.<br /> He continues with his life-pilgrimage<br /> Slowly, steadily and unerringly<br /> To the farthest destination —<br /> Mankind's nature-transformation.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110116" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">51.</h1>
  
 

<p>I soulfully pray<br /> To my Absolute Lord Supreme<br /> That each and every Russian,<br /> Plus each and every world-citizen,<br /> Sleeplessly adore and breathlessly love<br /> President Gorbachev —<br /> Which he so unmistakably deserves —<br /> Long before he sails his life-boat<br /> To the Golden Shore of the Beyond.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110117" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">53.</h1>
  
 

<p>Immortality's blind bard, Homer,<br /> Voiced forth:<br /> "I am part of all that I have met."<br /> President Gorbachev's life has also sung<br /> Almost the same song:<br /> "We — all mankind — are in the same boat,<br /> And we can sink or swim only together."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110118" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">54.</h1>
  
 

<p>Julius Caesar, the Roman Emperor,<br /> Declared:<br /> "Veni, vidi, vici"-<br /> "I came, I saw, I conquered."<br /> President Gorbachev,<br /> The Soviet Union Emperor, declared:<br /> I came, I loved, I became.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110119" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">55.</h1>
  
 

<p>Cicero, the Roman philosopher,<br /> Proclaimed:<br /> "I carry all my possessions with me."<br /> President Gorbachev also carries<br /> All his possessions with him —<br /> Self-confidence and faith in mankind.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110120" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">56.</h1>
  
 

<p>The purpose of life<br /> Is worthiness and nothing else.<br /> President Gorbachev has proved<br /> This true truth in his own life<br /> In infinite measure.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110121" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">57.</h1>
  
 

<p>The German poet Goethe's immortal pen<br /> Revealed to the world a new way<br /> To the world-awakening consciousness:<br /> "How can you come to know yourself?<br /> Never by thinking; always by doing."<br /> What are<br /> The immortal action-achievements<br /> Of President Gorbachev?<br /> A self-awareness-flower-life,<br /> A self-respect-beauty-mind,<br /> A self-sacrifice-fragrance-heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110122" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">58.</h1>
  
 

<p>To say that President Gorbachev<br /> Is a Russian<br /> Is to shockingly limit his vision-light.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110123" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">59.</h1>
  
 

<p>To say that President Gorbachev<br /> Is a child of the Soviet Union<br /> Is to unquestionably limit<br /> His mission-delight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110124" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">60.</h1>
  
 

<p>To say that President Gorbachev<br /> Is a most beautiful flower<br /> And a most delicious fruit<br /> Of Mother-Earth-Tree for mankind<br /> Is to embrace him<br /> As a cosmopolitan soul.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110125" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">61.</h1>
  
 

<p>President Gorbachev warns<br /> The human chaos on the rise:<br /> Behold! The sunrise-rainbow-beauty,<br /> Harmony, peace and bliss<br /> Are slowly but convincingly arriving.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110126" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">62.</h1>
  
 

<p>To me, not because of his<br /> Himalayan greatness<br /> But because of his Olympian goodness,<br /> He has become the world cynosure.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110127" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">63.</h1>
  
 

<p>His soulful admirers and faithful adorers<br /> Treasure him in the depths<br /> Of their gratitude-pride-heart,<br /> For his life's continuous<br /> Dynamism-speed-lead<br /> In the present-day world.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110128" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">64.</h1>
  
 

<p>President Gorbachev sees the earth-heart<br /> Is bleeding<br /> From her children's wisdom-bankruptcy.<br /> Therefore, his heart is swimming<br /> In the sea of tears.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110129" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">65.</h1>
  
 

<p>President Gorbachev sees the Heaven-soul<br /> Is flying<br /> In Infinity's Ecstasy-Sky.<br /> Therefore, his soul, heart, mind, vital<br /> And body<br /> Are fulfilled, supremely fulfilled.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110130" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">66.</h1>
  
 

<p>President Gorbachev's own nobility-mind,<br /> Magnanimity-heart and luminosity-soul<br /> Speak:<br /> "Suppose we make mistakes. So what?<br /> It is better to rectify them<br /> Than sit and wait."<br /> His compatriots, other politicians,<br /> Have made no mistakes!<br /> Never, never!! Not even in their<br /> Imagination-worlds!!!</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110131" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">67.</h1>
  
 

<p>The seer in President Gorbachev<br /> Graciously illumines us:<br /> "We are all passengers aboard one ship,<br /> The Earth,<br /> And we must not allow it to be wrecked."<br /> Sail we must together in a oneness-heart<br /> And in a fulness-life<br /> Towards the Golden Shore.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1110132" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">68.</h1>
  
 
<p>The Holy Father, who represents the Saviour Christ's spirituality on earth, appreciates and admires President Gorbachev thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I follow with great interest the process of renewal which you have set in motion in the Soviet Union. I wish you success and declare myself ready to support every initiative that will better protect and integrate the rights and duties of individuals and peoples, so that peace may be insured in Europe and the world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, spirituality has its distinct role in President Gorbachev's life.</p>
<p>Him to quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Today our main joy is to lift the individual spiritually, respecting his inner world and giving him moral strength."</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
<div id="node-1110133" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">69.</h1>
  
 

<p>May today,<br /> On his 70th birthday —<br /> March 2nd, 2001 —<br /> The heart of the entire world<br /> Sing most gratefully, most sweetly<br /> And most hauntingly<br /> President Gorbachev-gratitude-songs<br /> Beneath his giant life-tree.</p>
