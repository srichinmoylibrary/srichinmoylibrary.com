<p>Paramahansa Yogananda's father, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, held a very high position with the Bengal-Nagpur Railway. A disciple of Lahiri Mahashoy used to work under him. The name of this disciple was Abinash.</p>
<p>One day Abinash asked his boss if he could have one week's leave in order to visit his Guru in Benaras. Paramahansa Yogananda's father said, "No, No! Think of your family. Spirituality will not help your family."</p>
<p>That evening, Abinash was walking home in a very sad and depressed mood. Paramahansa Yogananda's father came by in a palanquin. He alighted from the palanquin and walked beside Abinash, trying to console him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lahiri Mahashoy appeared before them both in his subtle body. Lahiri Mahashoy said to Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, "Why are you stopping people from following the spiritual life? It is not good." Then the Master disappeared.</p>
<p>Bhagabati Charan Ghosh was dumbfounded. He immediately gave Abinash one week's leave and he said to his employee, "I would be very grateful if one day you could take me with you to see your Master."</p>
<p>Bhagabati Charan Ghosh and his wife became very devoted disciples of Lahiri Mahashoy. A few years later, their son Mukunda (who later became Paramahansa Yogananda) was born.</p>
<p>One day Abinash accompanied the family by train to Benaras to see the Master. When they entered the Master's house, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh very affectionately placed his little son in Lahiri Mahashoy's lap. Lahiri Mahashoy blessed Mukunda and said, "He is going to be a Yogi. He will serve both East and West."</p>  </div>
