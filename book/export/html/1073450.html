<p>Captain, please tell me how many times a day<br /> You think of me.<br /> "Once, My child."<br /> Alas, only once? You are so unkind to me!<br /> Captain, how many times a day<br /> Do You bless my heart<br /> With Your Love?<br /> "Once a month."<br /> Alas, alas, only once a month!<br /> Captain, You are so unkind to me!<br /> Captain, please tell me how many times a day<br /> You speak well of me to others.<br /> "Once in three months."<br /> Once in three months! Alas, alas, alas!<br /> Captain, Your dislike of me is unimaginable!<br /> Captain, why do You think of me<br /> Only once a day?<br /> "My child, what can I do?<br /> When I think of you,<br /> I see that you are thinking of the whole world<br /> And not of Me."<br /> Captain, why do You bless my heart<br /> With Your Love<br /> Only once a month?<br /> "My child, your heart is full of insincerity,<br /> Plus, you keep your heart's door<br /> Closed so often.<br /> Do you not realise<br /> That you give Me a shocking experience<br /> With your frequently closed heart?"<br /> Captain, why do You speak well of me<br /> to others<br /> Only once in three months?<br /> "My child, if I use My Justice-Light,<br /> Then I will not be able to speak well of you<br /> Even once a year.<br /> It is because to you I am<br /> My Heart's Compassion-Height<br /> That I speak well of you once<br /> in three months."<br /> But, Captain, I think of You every day<br /> More than once.<br /> I offer my heart's love to You every day<br /> More than once.<br /> I speak well of You<br /> More than once a day.<br /> "True, you think of Me every day<br /> With no sincerity at all.<br /> Be sincere in your thought!<br /> True, you offer your love to Me<br /> More than once a day,<br /> But your love has no soulful, devoted oneness.<br /> Be soulful in your love!<br /> True, you speak well of Me<br /> More than once a day,<br /> But I clearly see<br /> That there is no inner conviction<br /> In what you say to others about Me.<br /> In a very clever way<br /> You like to draw admiration from others<br /> By speaking well of Me.<br /> Be certain in your pronouncement!"<br /> Captain, that means I will never be able<br /> To please You.<br /> "Not true, My child. You can and you will."<br /> Captain, when?<br /> "From the day you start feeling<br /> That your life is the beauty of surrender<br /> And your heart is the purity of gratitude."</p>
