<p>Had I not been a joker of the first water, then by this time I would have been compelled to go and live in a mental hospital for the rest of my life. Luckily, every day God empties my mind, which is filled with my disciples' tension-worlds. Every day I joke with my incapacity, and God jokes with my poor fate.</p>  </div>
