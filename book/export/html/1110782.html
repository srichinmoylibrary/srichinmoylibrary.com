<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I always say that past is dust, past is dust. And I wish to repeat the message that past is dust. Let the past be buried in oblivion. The past has not given any of us realisation, God-realisation. It is the present that will give to each of us our Self-realisation. It is the message of the golden tomorrow that will enter into the present and change our lives within and without. Each new year signifies progress and there is no end to this progress. Our journey is eternal. Our Goal is the ever-transcending Beyond.</p>  </div>
