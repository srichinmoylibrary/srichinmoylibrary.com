<p>The spring series of classes given by Sri Chinmoy Kumar Ghose on Philosophy, Spiritual discipline and Yoga ended on May 27, 1966.</p>
<p>There were eight classes in all, held in various homes, including those of his friends and students.</p>
<p>The classes took the form of a short opening meditation, chanting of the mantram AUM and Vedic hymns, a talk on the given topic, a closing meditation, and finally an informal discussion or questions and answers while refreshments were being served.</p>
<p>These extemporaneous talks will appear serially in successive issues of AUM, commencing from this issue.</p>  </div>
