<p>Everyone knows about the Taj Mahal, the most beautiful mosque in the world. It was the Emperor Sajahan who built it in honour of his wife, Mamataj. Today it is considered one of the great wonders of the world, and everybody appreciates its beauty.</p>
<p>One day a king and queen went to see the Taj Mahal. The king said to the queen, "Tell me, what do you think of this mosque?"</p>
<p>The queen said, "If you ask me what I think about it, I will speak about the architecture, the workmanship and so forth. But if you ask me what I feel about it, then I will tell you my real feelings. Will you honour my feelings?"</p>
<p>The king said, "Definitely I want to know your feelings, and definitely I will honour them."</p>
<p>The queen said, "All right. I would be willing to put an end to my life tomorrow if you would build a Taj Mahal like this one for me. Are you prepared to do so? I am ready to take my life this moment, but are you prepared to build another Taj Mahal for me?"</p>
<p>The king was speechless. The queen continued, "I can fulfil my promise tomorrow, but I can see that you are not ready to build another Taj Mahal for me. You would not even dare to promise to build me another Taj Mahal!"</p>
<p>The poor king looked at his wife in silence.</p>  </div>
