<p>Father, who was I?<br /> Daughter, you were the frankness<br /> Of desire-life.</p>
<p>Father, who am I?<br /> Daughter, you are the seriousness<br /> Of aspiration-soul.</p>
<p>Father, what shall I be?<br /> Daughter, you will be the sweetness,<br /> Fruitfulness of Perfectiveness-Goal.</p>
  </div>
