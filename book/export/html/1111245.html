<p>Today after I had run a mile and a half, a little dog...it was so ferocious...suddenly jumped at me and tried to bite me.</p>
<p>O God, what could I do? I was running in the street and there were a lot of cars coming. If you go that side, you will end up inside the car and if you go this side, the dog will bite you. Either way is dangerous.</p>
<p>But that is not the story. While the dog was trying to bite me, an elderly woman was enjoying it. And it was her dog! I had to change the position of my legs, scream something and pretend I had a stone. For twenty metres the dog chased me, and the old lady was enjoying it like anything.</p>
<p>I am not an American, and I don't know your American slang. But you people would have gone up to that lady and insulted her. But I just walked in the street, staying as far from the sidewalk as I could. It was very difficult.</p>
<p>From the spiritual point of view, a dog symbolises faithfulness. If a dog bites you, they say that you have lost faith. When have I lost my faith? No, I have not lost it. It was just an attack by the hostile forces. They can act through a dog also. So a dog is supposed to be a divine instrument, but it can be very undivine as well. Here I am having such a serious problem, and the woman is enjoying it.</p>
<p>People should not run in the street. If they do, a dog will come from a house and create such problems! Out of the blue they come, some times three or four at a time. Some bark beforehand and some do not.</p>
<p>Almost every day I have problems at various places with dogs.</p>
