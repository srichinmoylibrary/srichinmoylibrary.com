<p>Can you imagine, can you dare to imagine, that every day my dear Supreme, my sweet Supreme and my Beloved Supreme comes to me seven times? The first time He comes to examine my willingness. The second time He comes to examine my readiness. The third time He comes to examine my newness. The fourth time He comes to examine my oneness. The fifth time He comes to examine my fulness. The sixth time He comes to examine my perfection. The seventh time He comes to examine my satisfaction.</p>  </div>
