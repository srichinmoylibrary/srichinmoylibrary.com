<p>There was once a man who was physically, vitally, mentally and psychically strong. When he was young, he used to play American football. In the course of time, he entered another field and became famous. One day, just for the fun of it, he came to play football with his old colleagues. They could not believe that such a great man had come to play football with them.</p>
<p>A thousand people came to watch because he was the greatest man in his country. During the game, this man collided with someone else and fell down. Immediately all the other players came to see if he was hurt. But he smiled at them and assured them he was all right.</p>
<p>In case you do not know who he was, he was John Fitzgerald Kennedy. He won over the American people with his heart-power, vital-power and mind-power.</p>  </div>
