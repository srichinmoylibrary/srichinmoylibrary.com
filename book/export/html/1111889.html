<p>The last three hundred metres of the marathon were in the stadium. You did not even have to run around the whole track — just three hundred metres. I said, "For God's sake, let me run."</p>
<p>But when I tried to take one step running, there was no power inside my lungs. I had no strength. Walking was far better.</p>
