<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. In the souls' world they have enjoyment. In their eyes, sometimes our enjoyment borders on the undivine or vulgar, to say the least. But in the souls' world it is not like that. When we perform skits about the undivine qualities of others, at that time we cause suffering for others. But in the souls' world, the sense of amusement is different. It is based on utmost purity. There they do enjoy this kind of amusing skit, and from their amusement they get experiences. From anything they do they get experiences. But no matter what they do, whether it is just for fun or whether it is something sublime, it is done with tremendous purity.</p>  </div>
