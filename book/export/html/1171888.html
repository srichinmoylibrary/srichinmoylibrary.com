<h2>Question: When I am asleep, who is it that sees my dreams?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are asleep, one of your inner beings can see your dreams, or the aspiration accumulated in your inner life can watch your sleep, or the Divine Grace and Compassion which wants to manifest itself in and through you can watch your sleep. There is no hard and fast rule that one being or one person or one inner reality observes the sleep state or the dreams that you are having.</p>  </div>
