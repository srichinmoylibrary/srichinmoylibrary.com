<p><em>Compere Geoff Michells:</em> The answer when tension and strains of life become too much is "to seek Heaven inside our pure hearts." Well, that is according to a visiting Indian Yogi and spiritual Master, Sri Chinmoy. With his brand of meditation, on any given day he might dictate fifty pages of a book, write one hundred poems or so and hold a meditation at the United Nations and perhaps give a university lecture or two. It's all in a day's work for the man whose press handout describes him as "A 20th Century Yogi-Executive." Well, he spoke with our interviewer today, and it's fascinating to note that he appears to be going deeper into meditation as the interview progresses.</p>  </div>
