<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to bring a divine consciousness to everyday activities at the United Nations is by making yourself consciously and soulfully feel that you are of the one Source and you are trying to manifest the Source in order to create a new world in the heart of the present-day world.</p>  </div>
