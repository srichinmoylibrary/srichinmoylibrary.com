<p>One day, while I was shopping in the Pondicherry market, an elderly lady placed her hand on my shoulder and said, "Hi, Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>O my God, I was so embarrassed. I didn't recognise her at all.</p>
<p>She was so surprised that I didn't recognise her. She said, "I am Coo-Coo's mother."</p>
<p>Coo-Coo is the nickname for Vinay Verma, the Deputy Ambassador of India to the United Nations. We were brought up together and for a year his mother had taught me English.</p>
<p>She said she was able to recognise me because Vinay Verma had sent her a picture taken of the two of us at our recent meeting in Queens. So she recognised me, but I could not recognise her.</p>
<p>Then she begged me to come to her house. I wanted to go, but as usual, five or ten people were at our house waiting for me. Always so many people come to our house when I am there. I have so many things to tell them and they have so many things to tell me-endless stories!</p>
