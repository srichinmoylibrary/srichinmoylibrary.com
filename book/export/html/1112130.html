<p>I was running near my one-mile mark by Main Street, wearing a Madal Bal T-shirt. God knows what it says on the back. A man with a little umbrella came up to me and said, "Are you a member of the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He said that he had read about the 1,000-mile race in the newspaper. Then he said, "Oh, how I would love to meet Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>Then I said, "I am Sri Chinmoy."</p>
<p>He dropped his umbrella.</p>
