<p>In our invocation to the Supreme there is a line that says, “Thou art one Truth, one Life, one Face.” “Thou art one Truth.” Truth is fulfilment. Only in Truth is there fulfilment; there cannot be fulfilment without Truth.</p>
<p>Then “one Life.” You think of Life as your life now, but you had Life before you were born and this Life will continue after your body’s death. Here on earth your life and death are just stages in your larger Life. So this is what we mean by “one Life.”</p>
<p>Last comes “one Face.” Face is manifestation. The Supreme manifests Himself in many ways and He reveals His Face through His many manifestations. There are two ways to see the Face of God. One way reveals His luminous features, His eyes, ears and nose. The other way reveals His luminous Reality.</p>  </div>
