<p>Self-confidence comes into existence when we feel that there is some higher force that is constantly looking after us and guiding us. If we do not have that kind of feeling or belief, then we can have no abiding self-confidence. We have to cultivate faith in our Inner Pilot. Right now He is unknowable. If we pray and meditate, He becomes knowable. And if we continue along the spiritual path, He eventually becomes totally known.</p>
<p>Self-confidence comes into existence when we offer our very existence to the feet of a higher force. If that higher force is right now only imaginary, no harm. If we have faith and if we surrender our existence to this higher force, then self-confidence is automatically achieved in our life of aspiration.</p>  </div>
