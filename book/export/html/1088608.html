<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If India comes to prominence, it will not be through physical or material power but through spiritual power. India had spirituality, but her spirituality has diminished. If India can revive this spirituality, and if it is God's Will, then India will be able to offer spirituality lovingly, unreservedly and unconditionally to the comity of nations.</p>  </div>
