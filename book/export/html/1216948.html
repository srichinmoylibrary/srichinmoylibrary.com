<p>I went into a restaurant for a salad and onion rings. An elderly couple happened to be beside me. As I was about to leave, the lady said to me, "Are you a boxer? You look like a boxer."</p>
<p>I said, "No, I am not a boxer, but I do lift weights."</p>
<p>The lady said, "I thought you were very strong."</p>
<p>Her husband didn't say anything, but he was very amused that his wife was such a talker.</p>
