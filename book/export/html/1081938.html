<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In God's Eye, the outer life has to be the expression or revelation of the inner life. So, if the inner life is divine, perfect, then the outer life also eventually has to be divine and perfect. There is only one way that is God's Way: what is within today will be used tomorrow to express and fulfil. So, we must come from inside out. From underneath the ground, the tree germinates and grows upward. Thus, God does have a special Will, but it is in the inner life. In the inner life when we recognise God's Will, it becomes easier to recognise His outer Will. God's Will operates first in the inner life and then in the outer life. But it is the same Will. God gives equal importance to both the inner life and outer life.</p>  </div>
