<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> You have given me a heart<br /> That cries for You.<br /> You have given me a life<br /> That wants to serve You.<br /> But, my Lord, is there any way<br /> That I can run fast, faster, fastest<br /> In my heart of aspiration<br /> And in my life of dedication?<br /> "Yes, My child, there is a way,<br /> And this way is very, very simple<br /> And very direct.<br /> This way is the way<br /> Of your gratitude-offering to Me.<br /> The more you can offer<br /> Your gratitude-heart and gratitude-life<br /> To Me,<br /> The sooner you will be able to run<br /> Faster than the fastest<br /> In your heart of aspiration<br /> And in your life of dedication."</p>
