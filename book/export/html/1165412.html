<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a great difference between power and strength. Strength is predominantly in the physical, with the physical and for the physical. Power has a higher and deeper source. But again when a seeker-lifter or bodybuilder invokes the higher power, it can come and act inside the physical and also for the physical. Strength is an outer achievement. Power is an inner achievement. If there is a tug-of-war between strength and power, power will always win, for the source of power is infinitely greater than the physical strength that any human being can have.</p>  </div>
