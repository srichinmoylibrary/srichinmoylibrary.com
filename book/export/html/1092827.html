<p>Their most auspicious second meeting was without doubt a Heaven-blessed coincidence. It took place when Subhas was returning to India in 1921 after his years at university in England, and Rabindranath happened to be a fellow passenger on the boat. Tagore and Subhas engaged in many heart-to-heart conversations. The Poet, who was Subhas Chandra's senior by thirty-six years, did offer the young man his sincere congratulations for having resigned so bravely from the I.C.S. Subhas, on his side, found in Rabindranath a kindred spirit â€” for had not the Poet renounced his knighthood following the massacre of his countrymen by the British at Jallianwalla Bagh?</p>
<p>In his later years, the Poet openly traced the ripening of his esteem for Subhas and revealed his early apprehensions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Subhas Chandra, I have watched the dawn that witnessed the beginning of your political Sadhana. In that uncertain twilight there had been misgivings in my heart and I had hesitated to accept you for what you are now.... Today you are revealed in the pure light of midday sun which does not admit of apprehensions."</p>
