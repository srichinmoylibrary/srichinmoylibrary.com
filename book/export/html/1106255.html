<p>The pursuit of peace through the unification of the spirit and body is a process which leads to a better understanding of the essence of mankind. This path is marked by a series of physical and spiritual challenges, and your efforts to push your body to meet or exceed our present limitations, will lead to the challenging of the mind and the spirit.</p>
<p>Your accomplishments show us that the only limitations to the body and the spirit are the limitations which we place upon ourselves. May the love that you hold for mankind extend from the soul through the body into a real and lasting peace.</p>
