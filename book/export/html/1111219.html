<p>This morning, while I was running near the Grand Central Parkway, a man said, "Wait!" So I stopped and waited, but I didn't know what he wanted. Then he said, "This will be cooler," and he sprayed me with a hose.</p>
<p>He asked me where I was from. I told him, "India," and I asked him where he was from. He said, "Ireland." He was very happy to learn that I had been to Ireland a few years ago and had met the President. On my way back I again saw him working in his garden. I waved to him and he said,</p>
<p>"Good morning."</p>
