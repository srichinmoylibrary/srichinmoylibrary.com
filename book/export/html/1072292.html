<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can see that I do not have tremendous muscle-power. I do not have a superb physique. People who lift heavy weights can show large muscles, but I don’t have that kind of developed muscles. What I wish to show by these feats of strength is that prayer and meditation can definitely increase one’s outer capacities. I hope that by doing this I will be able to inspire many people to pray and meditate sincerely as part of their regular daily routine.</p>  </div>
