<p>This morning, after so many months, I lifted 300 pounds in each arm simultaneously. Can you imagine — 600 pounds is talking! For months and months, 600 and I were not on speaking terms. What was I doing? This proves there is such a thing as God’s Hour. We have to have patience. At what point God will give us the wisdom to go forward, we do not know. Now my dumbbells are one inch further apart. That one inch has made so much difference.</p>
<p>Sunday is usually my rest day. This is how I am taking rest!</p>
