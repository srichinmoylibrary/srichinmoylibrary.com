  <h1 class="book-heading">Preface</h1>
  
 
<p>The Infinite is She. Therefore infinite was my folly to have ventured my pen to set forth her life ever unknowable. But the Mother's Bounty is infinitely more powerful than my error, however grave.</p>
<p>Since the dawn of earth-time the Mother as the Shakti has walked the soil along with her Divine Compeers, the Avatars. Alas, our ignorance paid no heed to her supernal Love and Grace. To the Avatars alone we built our altars. Their Shaktis remained almost concealed, and at times even ignored by humanity. Unnoticed, as it were, they appeared on the scene and unnoticed they disappeared.</p>
<p>But according to our Master, "In her deep and great love for her children she has put on the cloak of this obscurity, condescended to bear the attacks and torturing influences of the Falsehood, borne to pass through the portals of the birth that is a death, taken upon herself the pangs and sorrows and sufferings of the creation, since it seemed that thus alone could it be lifted to the Light and Joy and Truth and eternal Life. This is the great sacrifice called sometimes the sacrifice of the Purusha, but much more deeply the holocaust of the Prakriti, the sacrifice of the Divine Mother."</p>
<p>But this time our Mother, the Mother of the Golden All, has accepted the human cloak at her sweet will with her boundless Power for the full manifestation of the Divine here on earth. Her mission in life is to create a transformed humanity.</p>
<p>She is the sole hope of Nectar-Bliss for those who are burning with an unquenchable thirst for the unique Birth. And She will be crowned with Triumph only when we, her children, cease to be the finite.</p>

<p>O Asia, O Ind, O tree<br /> And the high and proud enormous bough.<br /> Devour your blind and naked pride.<br /> The time is ripe for you to bow</p>
<p>With all your great past blotted out.<br /> Ours alone is the Mother of gleam.<br /> The One has fertilised your large land<br /> To reap in mirth the Light supreme;</p>
<p>Therefore your haughtiness knew no bound.<br /> A galaxy of flames and seers,<br /> Avatars were born in you to found<br /> The Life divine in a world of tears,</p>
<p>And for the fusion of East and West.<br /> But all their efforts ended in smoke.<br /> Behold, the Mother's advent a Grace<br /> Protecting all with a sun-wide cloak.</p>
<p>She is the Bridge unique, divine<br /> Between the two extremities.<br /> Her Birth declares, "All souls will live<br /> With the One in a fire-pure release."</p>

<p>My sister sweet, your eyes are dim,<br /> Too narrow and brief their view.<br /> The Mother for all, all souls will thrive<br /> Under her ruby-Blessing dew.</p>
<p>With Spirit's flame surcharged is my soil;<br /> Therefore her Feet of Light<br /> On my breast shall rest; with scarce a toil<br /> To free the earth from Ignorance' blight.</p>
<p>Her Birth you cherish and I her Play.<br /> She is our deathless Hope.<br /> She is Mother of eternal Day.<br /> No more in gloom we shall grope.</p>

<p>Our mother's human brother saw the earth<br /> Eighteen long years before his sister of lore.<br /> Tranquillity was in flood in Mother's core,<br /> But to ruthless ire he opened his bosom's door.</p>
<p>One day he saw his anger as hell's own breath;<br /> He pushed it for ever far with his hero-will;<br /> And from that hushful hour he cherished its death,<br /> And lived true kin to his sister-sovereign-still.</p>

<p>Offspring, speak out the blue-gold truth.<br /> Where are your words of mail ?<br /> Why dungeon-mates of your sombre past<br /> Why ego at you must rail?</p>
<p>Man:</p>
<p>During our ignorance-dawn she was<br /> Our lonely teacher pure.<br /> But we claimed not our heritage.<br /> So this breach we needs must endure.<br /> Spirit our only changeless guide.<br /> To It alone we bow.<br /> Save It our deathless Form is void.<br /> Thou art the Tree and It the bough.</p>
<p>Mother:</p>
<p>Ego, my erring, doleful child,<br /> Aside you cast your ire.<br /> Inevitable was your gift.<br /> Man now needs the Spirit's Fire<br /> To change his face and sombre fate.<br /> The sky-vast golden Dawn<br /> Can alone slake his sleepless thirst.<br /> He my lion, you my fawn.</p>
