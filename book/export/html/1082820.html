<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to feel that inside your husband, inside your son, is God. You love your husband and son, not because they are your dearest, but because inside them is your Dearest, everybody's Dearest. Inside your family you have to feel the presence of God. If you can vividly see and feel the presence of God inside your near and dear ones, you will see that you are ready to do everything for them.</p>
<p>Right now, when you do something for your husband or child, sometimes you do it unwillingly. You do it because you feel it is an obligation. But when you do something for God, you will see that it is done with pure joy; because when He asks you to do something, He gives you the necessary strength plus the inspiration. So if you can see and feel God's presence inside your husband and son, then you will be able to maintain that same kind of inspiration and joy.</p>  </div>
