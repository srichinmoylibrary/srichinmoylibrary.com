<p>After Nakamura came to our hotel in Tokyo to leave the gifts he had brought for us, I was talking with him on the way to the subway.</p>
<p>He wanted someone to take pictures of us. The one photographer who was with us had no more film left in his camera, but I said, "Just take it anyway!" So he just clicked the button and pretended to take our picture.</p>
<p>Before that, that photographer had taken seven or eight pictures of us. In one picture I was autographing something. In another, Nakamura was putting his hand on my chest after I had put my hand on his heart chakra.</p>
<p>My interview with Nakamura came out in a Japanese newspaper. It was a very significant interview.</p>
