<p>Tagore himself requested Dilip Kumar Roy to dive into music. Then Dilip’s friend, Subhas Bose, said to him, “Listen to Tagore, listen! Dive into music.”</p>
<p>Once it happened that Dilip did not keep in touch with Tagore for some time. Tagore wrote a poem that ran, “Dilip, I have not seen your smiling face for a long time! You have not written to me.” The whole poem was a letter to Dilip.</p>
<p>Dilip said that Tagore used to inundate him with affection. He argued with Tagore so many times, but Tagore always forgave him and once more they became very close. Then, if Dilip did not write for some time because they had had an altercation, Tagore used to say, “Why, why are you silent?”</p>
<p>Look at the close connection between these two great singers!<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
