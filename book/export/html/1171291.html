<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Music is a universal language. I do not know Tamil, but when they play Tamil music, I appreciate it. I do not know German, but when I hear the music of Beethoven, Mozart and all the great classical musicians, their music appeals to me. Thousands and thousands of people who do not know Bengali enjoy Tagore's songs. Why is it that all over India Tagore's songs are on the radio? Does a Gujarati understand Bengali? Tagore's Bengali songs help people considerably. They have peace, poise and joy inside them. They inspire us.</p>  </div>
