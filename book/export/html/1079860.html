<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, we should not worry. We should have implicit faith in God, in our Inner Pilot or in our spiritual Master. We have to feel that not only does God know what is best for us, but He will do what is best for us. We worry because we do not know what is going to happen to us tomorrow, or even the next minute. But if we can feel that there is Someone who thinks of us infinitely more than we think of ourselves, and if we can consciously offer our responsibility to Him, saying, "You be responsible. Eternal Father, Eternal Mother, You be responsible for what I do and say and grow into," then our past, our present and our future become His problem. As long as we try to be responsible for our own life we will be miserable. We will not be able to properly utilise even two minutes out of every twenty-four hours we have.</p>
<p>Let us consciously offer our very existence — what we have and what we are — to God. What we have is aspiration to grow into the very image of God, into infinite Peace, Light and Bliss. And what we are right now is just ignorance, the ignorance-sea. If we can offer our aspiration-cry and our ignorance-sea to God, then our problem is solved. We should not and we need not ever worry about destiny. On the strength of his surrender a spiritual person becomes inseparably one with God's Cosmic Will. Right now we do not surrender to God's Will, and that is why we suffer. We feel that if we do not do something for ourselves then who is going to do it? But this is not true. There is Someone who will do everything for us and that is our Inner Pilot. But what is expected from us? Only conscious surrender to His Will. He will act in and through us only when we become His conscious instruments. When we can feel that we are the instruments and He is the Doer then we will not worry about our destiny, we will not be afraid of our destiny. For we will know and feel that it is in the all-loving hands of God, who will do everything in us, through us and for us.</p>
