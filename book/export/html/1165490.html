<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, on certain birthdays you are more conscious of your inner life, your aspiration and dedication. Those birthdays are infinitely, infinitely more important than the birthdays when you are only thinking of parties and friends and counting how many gifts you have gotten. It is not how many outer or earthly achievements you have attained that matters, but how many hours you have thought of God and offered gratitude to God for sending you into this world to work for Him. If, on the strength of your prayer and meditation, on a particular birthday you are conscious of your goal, that birthday is infinitely more important than other birthdays when you are not consciously and sincerely trying to do something significant or become something good for God.</p>  </div>
