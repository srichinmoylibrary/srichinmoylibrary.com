  <h1 class="book-heading">Confidence</h1>
  
 
<p>We are all God’s chosen children. God has perfect faith in us. Let us try to have an iota of divine confidence in ourselves.</p>
<p>If we want to have confidence, we have to be true to ourselves. If we want to hear from God that we are good, great and divine, then we must always be true to ourselves.</p>
<p>Temptation, depression, frustration and destruction go together. Man’s confidence and God’s acceptance go together. Man’s confidence is man’s joy and God’s divine Pride.</p>
<p>Confidence is growth. It is the flowering of our human aspiration and divine liberation. Aspiration is what man has and offers to God. Liberation is what God eternally is, and He offers Himself to mankind. He scatters liberation all around us.</p>
<p>Confidence is the illumining conscience deep within us and our fulfilling inheritance.</p>
<p>God says to man, “My son, I have all confidence in you because you are of Me.” Man says to God, “Father, I have full confidence in myself because You are for me.”</p>
<p>God says to man, “My son, I have all confidence in you because you want the Truth and the Truth alone.” Man says to God, “Father, I have full confidence in myself because I know that You are not only <em>the</em> Truth but You are also <em>my</em> Truth.”</p>
<p>God says to man, “My son, I have all confidence in you because of our present divine conversation.” Man says to God, “Father, Father, Father, I have full confidence in myself because of Your present and eternal Compassion for me.</p>
