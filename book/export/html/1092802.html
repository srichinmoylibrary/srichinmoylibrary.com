<p>Deeply hurt by Gandhi-ji's personal opposition to him, Subhas said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It will be a tragic thing for me if I succeed in winning the confidence of other people but fail to win the confidence of India's greatest man."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even Nehru wrote to Gandhi-ji begging him to mend the rift with Subhas, but to no avail. Subhas was left with no other alternative than to resign the post of Congress President. This he did on 29 April 1939.</p>  </div>
