<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In awareness, you can see around you; you are aware of another person, of the room, of how you are standing, of how you are sitting or of how you are talking. But consciousness is far deeper and broader. When there is consciousness, there need not be a subject and object. Consciousness merely exists. In it the individual merges and becomes one with the universal Reality. There is no separation of individuality, for the One is infused with all that exists. Consciousness is not a personal quality, but an all-embracing cosmic identity.</p>  </div>
