<h2>Question: What shape is our manifestation taking politically?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Politically we are not in the forefront, but our aspiration is entering into politics for the illumination of political minds. Outwardly, politicians do not want to receive light, so we are trying to give it silently. We feel that politics as such is far from perfect and needs illumination; therefore, inwardly and silently we are trying to do the needful according to our capacity.</p>  </div>
