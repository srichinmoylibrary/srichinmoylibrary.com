<p>After running our four-mile race, I ran the ten-kilometre or 6.2-mile Foliage Run in New Jersey. The course had good mile markers and it was very beautiful. The trees on both sides of the road gave shade and created a soothing atmosphere. These kinds of races are really good. Sometimes in the races with thousands of people you get lost.</p>
<p>The only problem was that at times the course was dangerous because of the cars. Even near the finish line two cars were driving in front of me and not allowing me to go by them. At another place there was a parked car and the runners couldn't make a turn properly. Of course, this is because of the speed we were maintaining. The race officials were very careful that the front runners were unobstructed.</p>
<p>Also, there were many hills on the course — practically mountains. At one point, I walked about fifty metres up a very steep hill. I didn't dare run up it. Everybody else was also walking.</p>
