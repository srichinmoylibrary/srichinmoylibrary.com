<p>God is proud of His Divinity in Sri Krishna. Man is proud of his humanity in Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna is the beloved Boatman who untiringly plies his Boat of consciousness between India's unparalleled history and her unrivalled spirituality.</p>
<p>Man's growing divinity cries for the human perfection in Sri Krishna the man. In Sri Krishna's humanity lies man's promise of becoming Divine.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna stole the hearts of the Gopis unconditionally. The Gopis stole his Ecstasy unreservedly.</p>
<p>Sweetness and grace inexpressible, bond unbreakable, sacrifice unfathomable — this indeed is Radha, the Mother-Heart of Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>Radha carries the human soul into Sri Krishna's Heart. Sri Krishna transforms the human soul into the Divine Soul and commands it to play its role in the Divine Play. The influence of the Mahabharata is a flowering of centuries. The influence of Sri Krishna is the Blessing for Eternity.</p>
<p>The Pandavas had love for Sri Krishna. Sri Krishna had not only love but also unstinting concern for the Pandavas.</p>
<p>Arjuna ultimately became the spiritual child of Sri Krishna. Sri Krishna ultimately became the loving slave of Arjuna's surrender.</p>
<p>The Gita is Sri Krishna's Heart, his Vision-in-Fulfilment. The Gita is humanity's Breath, its Journey towards Immortality.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna's Flute stirs the Universal Consciousness. Sri Krishna's Gita enchants the Transcendental Consciousness.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna plays on His flute. We hear. We do something more. We barter our body's dust with His Soul's plenitude. If the Avatar Sri Krishna is the most complicated Door, then the Gita, His Song, is the most effective Key.</p>
<p>For an earth-bound soul, the Gita can fruitfully reconcile the dark problems of human life. For a Heaven-seeking soul, the Gita can awaken a new consciousness of ever-increasing Bliss.</p>
<p>I do. I refuse to accept the invitation of Desire. Sri Krishna does. He comes in to illuminate my consciousness.</p>
<p>My Ideal is to mount higher and higher up the ladder of divine evolution. Sri Krishna's Ideal is to make of Himself the divine Sacrifice to strengthen the rungs of the ladder. Sri Krishna is sweet when I realise Him in the perfection of my "I". Sri Krishna is sweeter when I realise Him as the Doer. Sri Krishna is sweetest when I realise Him as the Pilot of all my actions and myself as His dedicated instrument.</p>
<p>An aspirant's is the cry that compels Sri Krishna to seize him with the very madness of love.</p>
<p>A Vaishnava's life is love-intoxicated. He is a portion of Sri Krishna's individuality, perpetuating all the divine qualities of an everlasting Life.</p>
<p>When I live in Sri Krishna's Soul, I see the Truth from above. When I live in Sri Krishna's Heart, I see the Truth from within. When I live in Sri Krishna's Body, I see the Truth from without.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna is the shoreless ocean of Bliss. But as soon as I sincerely dedicate myself to Him, He presents me with His own Boat and takes me to the boundless Shore, the Golden All.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna walked the soil to annihilate the philosophies of world-shunning spirituality and of world-grasping materialism. He established on earth the "Dharmarajya," the Kingdom of the Inner Law. He restored the true spirit of Kshatriya heroism, motivated not by human ego, but by Divine Will, making man a devoted and active instrument of the Supreme. He brought down to the earth-consciousness the supreme Truth that earth and earthly life, being inherently divine, must be made outwardly divine, fully and totally, in every sphere, in every aspect.</p>
