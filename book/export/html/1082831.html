<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul goes back to where it came from, to its original home, to take rest for some time. As earth is our body's world, so also there is a world which we call the soul's world. You have a home. You go to play in the playground and after you have played for a few hours you come back to your home. Then, after taking rest, tomorrow you go again to play. Similarly, the soul comes here on earth to play for a few years and then the soul goes back to its own region. Then it returns to earth in another body.</p>
<p>The soul's original abode is <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda.</em> It means Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. There is a Bengali song, " <em>Phire Chalo."</em> It means, "Let us go home." This home is the home of the soul. The soul, the aspiring soul, is returning home, where it is all Light and Delight. In this home there is no death, no suffering, no sorrow, no decay; It is all Joy, Light and Delight.</p>  </div>
