<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do accept that all faiths are valid. They are all equally important.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Do you have some standard for what is a valid faith?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. All the religions embody divinity in infinite measure. I take them all as one. But in my case, I say there is only one faith, one religion, and that is love of God. I love God according to my capacity. You love God according to your capacity. Someone else loves God according to his capacity. All religions, all faiths, are equally true and equally divine. Again, the universal truth is that there is only one religion, and that religion is our love of God.</p>  </div>
