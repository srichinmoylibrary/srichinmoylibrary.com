<p>Mankind is now, as never before, faced by the<br /> threat of self-extinction, from which there is no<br /> retreat and no escape. There is only one way out,<br /> that leading up to the brotherhood of man.<br /> Humanity will have to follow it or perish.<br /> [Words of Ambassador Zenon Rossides of Cyprus]</p>
