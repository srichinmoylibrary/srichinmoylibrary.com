<h2>On 22 January 1974 Sri Chinmoy was interviewed on WRVR’s “Connections” in Connecticut. A transcript of that interview follows.</h2>

<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Sri Chinmoy, were you the only one in your family to follow the spiritual life?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, in my family everyone — my parents, my sisters, my brothers — all were oriented to the spiritual life. That is why it was very easy for me to enter into the spiritual life.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> How did your family fit into the Indian social scene?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They perfectly fit with the social life because our spirituality does not exclude life; it accepts life. But we feel that life as such is full of suffering, full of darkness and ignorance. So we pray and meditate and try to bring light into our system from above so that we can transform our suffering into joy and our darkness into light. We do not reject the world. If we reject the world, then how are we going to transform it? If I see that something in front of me is dirty or filthy, if I have love for that thing, then I will not cast it aside. I will transform it. So, spirituality means the acceptance of life with all its suffering, darkness and ignorance and the transformation of these things.</p>  </div>
