<p>Today, on Thanksgiving Day, my humble service I placed at the Feet of God. I went back to MacArthur Airport to lift a much bigger jet plane. I lifted it twice. The second time there were twenty-one passengers inside, including the owner. The weight was 31,000 and the owner told me that he felt the plane shake. He said, “I am not even going to try to understand this.”</p>
<p>The plane started making such a noise when I was lifting. Last time I said, “Enough in this incarnation.” But this time, enough is really enough. I do not want to go higher than 31,000 pounds.</p>
<p>When I breathe in three times before I lift, at that time I try to make my mind feel that the plane is light. I try to convince the mind that it is very light. Otherwise, immediately the weight of the entire plane comes to mind and fear can destroy everything.</p>
<p>When you look at a huge person, you may only be seeing his eyes or his nose, but as soon as you see any portion of his being you get frightened. The enormity registers in your brain.</p>
<p>Similarly, even if you look at the trunk of an elephant, you get frightened because the elephant’s trunk has become part and parcel of the entire body.</p>
<p>In the same way, when you look at the nose or the very back of the plane, the weight of the entire plane comes into your mind to destroy your confidence.</p>
<p>I am so happy that the rain could not prevent us from lifting. The authorities were kind enough to allow us to lift inside the hangar.</p>
<p>When I returned home, I immediately called my sister. She was in a very good mood, so I told her all about my lift. Then I also told her that Nepal has become a Peace-Blossom-Nation.</p>
