<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Consciousness is a tiny seed. Oneness is a tree. In due course the seed germinates and gradually becomes a huge banyan tree. Consciousness can be personal and individual. Consciousness can be egocentric. But once oneness is established in our aspiring consciousness on any plane of existence, then the seeker starts tasting the delight of freedom from his earth-bound life.</p>  </div>
