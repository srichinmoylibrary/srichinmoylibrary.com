<p>I have been to the main town of Yogyakarta three times. The first time I went, the man driving my horse and carriage was blind in one eye. The disciple who got the carriage for me chose him out of compassion.</p>
<p>Once or twice we almost met with an accident because the man could barely see. At one point he went against a red light. It was an experience!</p>
