<p>Kangsa was the hostile force incarnate. He was wicked to the backbone. He tortured each and every person in his kingdom. His worst enemy was Lord Krishna. He wanted to destroy Lord Krishna right from the very beginning, even before Krishna was mature enough to fight against him. He wanted to destroy Krishna even when Krishna was only an infant.</p>
<p>Kangsa had a friend who was a great admirer. He was also wicked to the backbone. One day, this friend came to Kangsa and said, "Your worst enemy is Krishna. I want to destroy him and make you happy."</p>
<p>"If you do this, you will make me the world's happiest person," Kangsa said.</p>
<p>"Yes, I will do it."</p>
<p>One day Kangsa's friend went to Brindavan where Krishna was playing games with the gopis. The gopis were extremely happy, for they were playing with their Beloved Krishna. When this particular hostile force entered Brindavan, the gopis were frightened to death, because his face was so frightening. Krishna remained silent for some time.</p>
<p>The undivine being said to Krishna, "You remain silent because you are doing something wrong. It is undivine and immoral to play with these people. Everybody thinks that you are very spiritual and divine, but you do nothing but play with these gopis."</p>
<p>Krishna still remained silent.</p>
<p>"Yes, you remain silent because you are not doing the right thing. Had you been doing the right thing, you would have spoken."</p>
<p>Krishna said, "The right thing is always compassion and forgiveness. I have always been doing the right thing by consoling and listening to you people. But this time I have to withdraw my Compassion aspect. My Justice Light, my destruction aspect, I have to adopt."</p>
<p>In a twinkling, in front of all the gopis, Krishna destroyed this evil force. Then he said to the gopis, "My love for you people, the world will not understand. I don't care if the world understands. Your devoted hearts will always be appreciated by me. Remain devoted to me and I shall always take care of you. Here on earth and there in Heaven, I shall always take care of you, my devoted friends.</p>
<p>"Animal love, human love, divine love and supreme love. Animal love does not know what human love is. Human love does not know what divine love is. Divine love does not know what supreme love is. Animal love is ultimate destruction. Human love is ultimate frustration. Divine love is ultimate illumination. Supreme love is ultimate illumination, ultimate perfection and ultimate satisfaction.</p>
<p>"This supreme love I am offering to you, my earthly friends. If you accept my supreme love in my own supreme way, you will all be nearest and closest to me."</p>
<p>The gopis offered their gratitude-hearts through their soulful smiles.</p>
