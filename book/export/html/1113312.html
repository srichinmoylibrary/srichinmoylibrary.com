<p>I was working in his bedroom when Nolini-da, having finished his French class, came and sat on his bed in a relaxed way. "Look at the great achievement of your Chittagong," he said, showing me a brochure. They had a special celebration in honour of the Mother's birthday, 21 February. "This is all Mohini's doing (Mohini Naha). I am glad that she has not forgotten the Mother totally."</p>
<p>In the afternoon Nirmala-di said to me: "Nolini-da has received a letter from Roma. In the letter she mentions that she very much enjoyed your play on Sri Aurobindo: <em>The descent of the Blue.</em>"</p>
<p>Nolini-da added: "In the last issue of the <em>Mother India</em> it was not Chinmoy's play on Sri Aurobindo, but Chinmoy's play on me!"</p>  </div>
