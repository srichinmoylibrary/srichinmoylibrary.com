<h2><em>Question:</em> Suppose you are so tired that you can't meditate, but if you slept longer and meditated an hour later, you could meditate. Which is better?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The thing is that you have to know how often you do it. If you say that every week you are doing it, this is not good. But once in a blue moon it is all right. It is like in school; you study for months, and then you get a holiday. All right. But if every day you want to take a holiday, then how will you make progress? If you say that for months you have meditated at a particular hour and one morning you are tired, all right. But if every day you go to school at a different hour, then how can the teacher be pleased?</p>
<p>In your case also, I wish to say that regularity is necessary and punctuality is even more necessary. Always try to be punctual.</p>
<p>That gives inner assurance to your life. But every day if you change the hour, then you do not have enough inner strength.</p>  </div>
