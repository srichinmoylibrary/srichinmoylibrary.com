<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em>: God doesn't wear glasses. Why? You know glasses are made by human hands. He finds human achievements are quite inefficient. Since he already has one eye which is always at His disposal to see the past, present and future at His sweet Will, He doesn't need any earthly implement to add to His infinite capacity. His third eye is more than enough, so he doesn't have to wear glasses</p>  </div>
