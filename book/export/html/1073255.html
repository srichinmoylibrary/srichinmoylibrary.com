<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, it is not necessary for them to meet together. The main thing is to follow the incoming breath. With this breath you can energise your body, vital, mind, heart and soul. And with the outgoing breath you can purify your body, vital, mind and heart.</p>
<p>But if you want to unite the incoming breath and outgoing breath, you have to take your aspiration beyond the body, above the body. If you can take the last breath to the <em>Sahasrara</em> centre, at the top of the head, then the outgoing breath will flow through it, and the incoming breath which comes from God, from the Supreme, can meet it at this point.</p>  </div>
