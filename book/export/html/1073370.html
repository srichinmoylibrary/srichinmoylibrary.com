<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The life of the lower vital has to be purified and illumined. But if we try to curb the demands of the lower vital all at once, this effort will be detrimental to our physical health. We have to transcend them slowly, steadily and unerringly. The higher spiritual life transcends the lower vital life. From the lower vital life, what we get is pleasure, whereas from the spiritual life, what we get is joy and delight. Pleasure and delight are two different things. Once we start getting divine ecstasy from our meditation, we will not feel the need for vital enjoyment. Slowly and steadily the seeker goes high, higher, highest. He transcends the needs of the physical when he feels that the life of the soul is fulfilling, illumining and immortalising.</p>  </div>
