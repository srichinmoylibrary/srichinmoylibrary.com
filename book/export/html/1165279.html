<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If someone is a sincere devotee of Brahma, when he dies, he goes to Brahma’s world. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva all have their own worlds that are in Heaven. They are like different states. Some of the spiritual Masters also have their own worlds. Your Guru has one. Right now, his world is very vast, but very few people are there. But one day, if you people behave well, you will come to my world. In Brahma’s world, the power aspect is paramount. In Vishnu’s world, the compassion aspect is paramount. And in Shiva’s world, the trance-consciousness, the self-amorous trance-consciousness is paramount. Again, there is Krishna’s world. Krishna is a direct descendant of Vishnu. Krishna has a separate world, a private world, which is not Vishnu’s world. It is very beautiful and soulful, and very big.</p>  </div>
