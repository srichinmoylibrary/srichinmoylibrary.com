<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God gets tremendous relaxation when he hears one individual sincerely speaking highly of another individual. Very often we speak highly of others to God with the hope that God will tell us, "No, no. Your qualities are far better; they are much more significant." We try to make God feel that we are insignificant so that we can get consolation, appreciation and compassion from God.</p>
<p>God already knows everything, but if He hears that we are sincerely appreciating, admiring and adoring someone else who has really done something great and good for God, then God is extremely happy. If we can offer this piece of good news to God without thinking in a very clever way about getting some appreciation from God, then that is God's relaxation.</p>  </div>
