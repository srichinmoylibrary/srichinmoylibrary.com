<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you can think that others are your own arms, your own legs and part and parcel of your own reality, then you will not have any problems. If the right hand offers the left hand a gift, the left hand gladly takes the gift. It does not feel that to receive the gift is beneath its dignity, because the right hand and the left hand are one. When you can see others as part of your own existence, this will be easy for you.</p>  </div>
