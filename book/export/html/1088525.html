<p>Sarat Chandra, I offer you<br /> My soulful obeisance,<br /> My flower-heart-obeisance.<br /> At each hush-gap your heart pined<br /> For your brother's progress-light.<br /> You were your affection-ocean.<br /> You were your vastness-heart unbounded.<br /> You were your hope-fountain.<br /> You were your Motherland-lover,<br /> Dauntless and deathless.<br /> Sarat Chandra, O self-giver,<br /> You came into the world<br /> From the realm transcendental.<br /> Your aspiration-heart desired<br /> The victory-manifestation<br /> Of the breathless fragrance: Subhas â€”<br /> Dearer than your life itself.<br /> Triumphant you were!</p>
