<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Chanting is not, strictly speaking, a form of meditation. It is an invocation. You invoke God to enter into you, into your inmost self, into your inner existence. Meditation is different. While in chanting you usually invoke God to permeate your whole existence, in meditation you try, in a broader way, to enter into Godâ€™s Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.</p>  </div>
