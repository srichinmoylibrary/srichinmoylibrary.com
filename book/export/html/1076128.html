<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Chaitanya went to a particular village and said, “Yes, I will be coming back.” Still in that village they are waiting, waiting. Every day they use a new candle and a new flower and burn incense, because the Lord will come one day. Like this, it has been going on and on for hundreds of years.</p>  </div>
