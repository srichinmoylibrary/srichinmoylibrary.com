<p>I often go to a bookstore across from the Jamaica Savings Bank. The owner has known me for a long time, but to him I was just a customer. He had never been particularly interested in me.</p>
<p>Today when I went there, right on the front of his desk I saw <em>Beyond Within</em> and <em>Eastern Light for the Western Mind</em>.</p>
<p>I said, "These are my books."</p>
<p>He said, "Heh!"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He asked, "You are the author?"</p>
<p>I was wearing shorts and he was looking at me as though he didn't believe me.Then he started asking me questions, and we talked for ten minutes.</p>
<p>I told him I wanted a daily prayer book. He found one and gave it to me. He said, "I will give you a little discount. I will sell it to you for eleven dollars."</p>
<p>So I took out a ten-dollar bill and a single, but he gave me the one back and said, "Please come back again and again. I like to talk to you!."I have been there so many times, but this is the first time that this has happened.</p>
