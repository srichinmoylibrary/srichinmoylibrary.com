  <h1 class="book-heading">I can have peace</h1>
  
 
<p>I must simplify my complicated life so that I can have soulful peace. I must purify my doubting mind so that I can have powerful peace. I must intensify my aspiring heart so that I can have fruitful peace.</p>
<p>In the small hours of the morning, I meditate on peace. During the day, I try to transform my peace-dream-light into my peace-reality-delight.</p>
<p>I can have immediate peace the moment I sincerely feel that I am not indispensable either in the inner world of aspiration or in the outer world of dedication. I can have immediate peace when I can put an end to my self-aggrandisement. I can have immediate peace when I can devotedly feel that each human being, either consciously or unconsciously, is heading towards perfection and that, at God’s choice Hour, each human being will reach the acme of perfection.</p>
<p>I can have divine peace only when I can feel in the inmost recesses of my heart that I am of God’s Compassion-Heart and that I am consciously, constantly, devotedly and unconditionally for God’s Satisfaction-Life. I can have supreme peace when I can feel unmistakably that my existence-light is only for God’s Satisfaction-Life.</p>
<p>May the seeker in each human heart pray to the hidden Lord Transcendental to appear, so that when He appears, He will appear with His revealed universal Peace. </p>
