<p>Bankim Chandra was always for justice and self-respect. He said, “If there is no justice, the world will collapse; and if there is no self-respect, no one will make any progress.”</p>
<p>The wild arrogance of the British could never frighten Bankim Chandra. When he served as a deputy-magistrate, his superior was an Englishman named Monroe. Monroe always demanded a disproportionate amount of respect, not only in the office but also elsewhere, even in the street. But Bankim used to tell him that he might be superior in the office, but he was not superior elsewhere.</p>
<p>“While in the office, I will show you respect and call you my superior. But if I see you elsewhere, then you are simply another human being like me. I cannot show you great respect, for I know who you are and what I am. Moreover, I know what I value. I appreciate inner strength and inner values. And in those things I far surpass you.”</p>
<p>But the arrogant Commissioner would not listen to this. One day, Bankim Chandra happened to meet Monroe in the Eden Garden in Calcutta. He neither said hello to him nor showed him any respect. The following day, Monroe came to the office and began shouting at Bankim Chandra and berating him like anything.</p>
<p>In response, Bankim Chandra said, “I told you before. Here in the office, I will show you respect. Here you are my superior. But in the street, in the garden, I will have nothing to do with you English.”</p>
<p>At this, Monroe grew really furious: “All right, I am transferring you,” he shouted.</p>
<p>Bankim replied calmly, “So much the better. You don’t like me and I don’t like you. You don’t need me and I don’t need you. You shall be satisfied by transferring me and I shall be satisfied by remaining away from you.”</p>
<p>The British Commissioner remained silent, but he transferred Bankim Chandra nonetheless.</p>
