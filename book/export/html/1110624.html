<p><em>No mind, no form, I only exist . . .</em></p>
<p><em>The final end of Nature's dance,</em></p>
<p><em>I am it whom I have sought . . .</em></p>
<p><em>I barter nothing with time and deeds;</em></p>
<p><em>My cosmic play is done.</em></p>
<p>[From "The Absolute"]</p>

<p>When one's cosmic play is done, one enters into Nirvana, the Nirvanic state. If one is a tired soul and wants to go beyond the conflict, beyond the capacities of the cosmic forces, then Nirvana is to be welcomed. Nirvana is the cessation of all earthly activities. This world is the playground of the dance of the cosmic forces, but when one enters into Nirvana, the cosmic forces yield to the ultimate highest Truth and there the Knower, the Known and the Knowledge or Wisdom are like three angels blended into one. At that time one becomes both the Knower and the Known.</p>
<p>If one does not have the experience of Nirvana, one usually cannot know what illusion is. According to some spiritual teachers, the world is Maya, an illusion. Then one enters into Nirvana one realises what illusion is. Nirvana is the static oneness with God. There, everything comes to an end in the static Bliss. This Bliss is unimaginable, unfathomable, indescribable. Beyond Nirvana is the state of Absolute Oneness. This oneness is the dynamic oneness with God.</p>
<p>Nirvana is a very, very, very, very high state. However it is not the highest state for the divine worker. If one wants to serve God here on earth, then he has to come back into the world again and again to serve the Supreme in humanity. If one wants to manifest the Supreme in the field of creation, then one has to work in the absolute dynamism of the Supreme and not rest in Nirvana. This does not mean that the divine worker cannot have the experience of Nirvana. The experience of Nirvana is at the command of all God-realised souls. But Nirvana is for those who want to be satisfied with the static aspect of the Brahman Supreme. If one wants to embody both the static and dynamic aspects of the Supreme, then I wish to say that one should go beyond Nirvana and enter into the field of manifestation.</p>  </div>
