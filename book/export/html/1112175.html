<p>Sometimes dogs can frighten me. When I was out walking the other day, a huge dog started walking alongside me.</p>
<p>The owner was about ten metres behind. The owner said, "Do not be afraid; he is very gentle."</p>
<p>He was speaking to me in such a compassionate way, but I was praying for him to come and take the dog. Then the owner went ahead of me and the dog went with him.</p>
