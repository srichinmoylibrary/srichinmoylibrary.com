<p>In the morning<br /> My Lord Supreme spoke to me<br /> With His Compassion-Heart.<br /> I did not care;</p>
<p>Therefore<br /> In the afternoon<br /> My Lord Supreme spoke to me<br /> With His Attention-Eye.<br /> I did not care;</p>
<p>Therefore<br /> In the evening<br /> My Lord Supreme spoke to me<br /> With His Justice-Hands.</p>
