This is very important. Previously it was forbidden, but now the child can be with his mother and father and grandparents.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Affection is as important as medicine. Inside medicine there may not be affection, but inside affection there is always medicine. The affection that the mother, father, sister and brother give is a great help; it helps the sick child considerably.</p>  </div>
