<p>"My Lord, You are my Lord, You are everybody's Lord, You are the Lord of the Universe. Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me, for this time I shall ask You a most unpardonable question."</p>
<p>"I forgive you, I forgive you, I forgive you, My child. Ask Me."</p>
<p>"My Lord, did You ever take anybody as Your Lord, just for a day, or even for a fleeting second?"</p>
<p>"Did I? Just for a day? Even for a fleeting second? My Lord is constant, permanent, eternal. The surrendered love of My dearest lovers is My constant, permanent, eternal Lord. I have always been a perfect Slave of My lovers' surrendered love. Verily, you are also one of My Lords, My child."</p>
