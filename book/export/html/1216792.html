<p>When I finished eating, I got up to go to the back of the plane to use the bathroom. Since we were only in the ambassador class, we were not allowed to go forward to the first-class bathrooms.</p>
<p>The stewardesses were still serving, and they had their trolleys in the aisles. Ahead of me there were two ladies who also wanted to go to the bathroom, but they couldn't move because the trolleys were blocking their way. One of the stewardesses said to me, "You are thin. You can pass by. But they can't." She put her hand on my back and said, "You can try, but those two can't even try."</p>
<p>Then she turned the trolley in such a way that there was a tiny space. I went through, and immediately she turned the trolley straight. As I was coming back, I saw that those two women were still waiting to get through.</p>
