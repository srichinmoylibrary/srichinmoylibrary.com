<p>A few months later, Salim rebelled again and Akbar decided to march against him. Akbar's mother, Hamida Begum, who was now almost eighty, came to Akbar and said, "My son, I beg of you, do not attack my grandson. You are such a great warrior. You have conquered the whole world. I can clearly see that my grandson has no chance of defeating you. My other grandsons, Murad and Daniyal, have both died. Do spare the life of this one. He is your only remaining son and I love him dearly. Do forgive him once more. If not, I shall not be able to go on living."</p>
<p>But Akbar would not listen to his mother. He set out for Allahabad with his army. On the way, he heard that his mother had become seriously ill. He turned back to Agra, but she died a few days after he arrived. Grief-stricken, Akbar negotiated peace with his son.</p>  </div>
