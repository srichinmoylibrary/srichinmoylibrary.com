<p>“God, my mother has told me not to make any complaints against anybody. But I am sorry, I have to. You know God, my mother scolds me very often and my sister strikes me almost every day. I am sure they are not doing the right things. What do You say, God?”</p>
<p>“Tell your sister and mother to speak to Me before they strike or scold you.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, I shall do that. That means my sister will never be able to strike me. Neither will my mother be able to scold me.”</p>
<p>“My child, it is not exactly so. Let Me tell you My secrets. When they ask Me for My permission to strike or scold you, I shall see first whether you deserve it or not. If you don’t deserve it, I shall strike and scold them badly. But if you deserve their scoldings and strikings, I shall give you enough strength and cheerfulness to eat the fruits of your wrong actions. I want you to be nice, good, perfect and divine.”</p>
<p>“God, I shall be. Thanks and thanks, God.”</p>  </div>
