<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to cultivate this feeling is to mix with others who have a childlike heart. Birds of a feather flock together. A thief will make friends with other thieves and a saint will make friends with spiritual people. If you want to mix with children, but they see that you are all impurity or insincerity, then why will they mix with you? You have to dive deep within and get in touch with the inner garden; then you become another child. If you have become a child, other children will have no objection to mixing with you. They will feel that there is no yawning gulf between your existence and God's Existence.</p>  </div>
