<p>Today we shall be observing the twenty-fourth anniversary of our Aspiration-Ground. I shall be playing twenty-four songs to celebrate this most soulful occasion. After I complete a song, I would like the singers to sing the same song.</p>
<p>Today’s prasad items are offered by me. There are twenty-four items. My affection, my love and my gratitude are inside each and every item. My blessingful and grateful prasad today I am offering to you.</p>
<p>Today is the twenty-fourth anniversary of Aspiration-Ground, and for that I am offering my heart’s infinite, infinite, infinite gratitude to my R. This beautiful, soulful, prayerful garden is her selfless and untiring service to the Aspiration-Temple-Ground. She has created this garden with the help of some disciples who have been very, very dedicated. They have served this Aspiration-Ground over the years so lovingly and self-givingly.</p>
<p>Those who have worked here over the years in various capacities, today is your day. This is the place that you have made so beautiful, so soulful. In our way we have created the Garden of Eden. We do not know what the Garden of Eden looks like; we only hear about it. Only when we leave the body, when we are in the soul’s world, can we appreciate the Garden of Eden. For us, this Aspiration-Ground is all peace, all joy, all love, all oneness, oneness, oneness, oneness. To have this place to pray and meditate and get joy is indeed a supreme achievement. For that I am so grateful to you all.</p>
<p>Now I wish the boys to sing the “Aspiration-Comrade-Souls” song and the girls to sing “My Aspiration-Temple.”</p>
<p>All those who have worked over the years deserve my very, very special gratitude, gratitude and gratitude.</p>
