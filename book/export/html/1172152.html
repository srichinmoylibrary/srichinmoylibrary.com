<p>I went to see my sister, and we chatted for about an hour. Then a nurse came and said, "Now we have to bathe her, so you go out for some time."</p>
<p>I said, "I am going to stay outside. Will you kindly inform me when I can come back in?"</p>
<p>The nurse said, "Definitely."</p>
<p>My sister was not the only patient in that room. There were three more patients. The lady right by her on the left side was constantly screaming so loudly: "Yeeah, yeeah."</p>
<p>I asked my sister, "What is wrong with her?"</p>
<p>My sister said, "Somehow she was responsible for her husband's death. She poisoned her husband or she did something, so now she is getting the karma back."</p>
<p>I asked, "How do you know?"</p>
<p>My sister told me, "We hear from people that she was responsible."</p>
<p>While the lady was sleeping, she was quiet. Otherwise, when she was awake at every moment she was screeching very loudly: "Yeeah, yeeah."</p>
<p>Another patient does not sleep at all. The doctor confided to me that this lady is mentally unbalanced. Unfortunately, I had to pass by her to see my sister. On one occasion, the lady said to me, "Is she your sister?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, she is my sister."</p>
<p>Then she said, "How is she? Is she still alive? Then no problem, my mother is in Heaven. My mother will take care of her." Her mother will take care of my sister, and my sister is still alive? All kinds of rubbish things she was telling me. I had to pass by her to see my sister, and she would always say something crazy. This was my experience at the nursing home.</p>  </div>
