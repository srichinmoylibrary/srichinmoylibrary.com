<p>In one store in Florida I was looking at handkerchiefs. I liked them so much. I started buying dozen after dozen. The lady was looking at me. It came to over a hundred dollars.</p>
<p>She said, "Oh, gentleman, please come back again."</p>
<p>The last time I was in Florida, in the same shop, a young salesman asked me if I could afford the thing I was looking at, which cost nineteen dollars. This time I spent a hundred thirty dollars or even more. I will sign the handkerchiefs and give them to the disciples.</p>
