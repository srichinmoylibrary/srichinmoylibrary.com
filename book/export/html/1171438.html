<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything has to depend on prayer and meditation. Again, outer therapy is also of supreme need. Then, if you can take minor stretching exercises to strengthen the calf, it may help. But if the exercises create more pain for you, then I advise you to go to a therapist. Of course, the most important thing is the inner prayer. But it is like a boxer using two hands. With one hand you cannot do everything. God created medical science. You should take as much help from medical science as possible, and at the same time you have to think of our spiritual science, which is prayer and meditation. They have to go side by side. First, of course, since we are spiritual people, we have to give preference to the aspiration-aspect of life, and at the same time we have to give considerable importance to medical science. God is also operating in and through medical science.</p>  </div>
