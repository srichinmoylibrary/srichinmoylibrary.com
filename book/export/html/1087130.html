<p>Yesterday I went to a stationery store. I saw a cute duck and I thought I would buy it for Chandika. I asked the man, "Is it a pin?"</p>
<p>The man said, "No, it is a magnet." Then he said, "This one is $2.45 and the other one is $4.47."</p>
<p>I looked at him. He was a joker. I said, "Which one do you want me to buy?"</p>
<p>He said, "It depends on how much you care for the person. Do you care a lot?"</p>
<p>I said, "I care a lot."</p>
<p>He said, "Then buy the one for $4.47!" and he put it in my bag.Both were cute. The bigger one was just a little bigger, but it was $2 more. To me it looked like a pin, but it was a magnet.</p>
