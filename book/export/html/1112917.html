<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When it is more than one who does something, it is definitely not the blame of one. It becomes collective. And even where it is one individual, there are many collective forces acting inside him. Actually, it is a combination of the collective forces operating in an individual that kills. But we don't speak of the inner forces, the collective forces; we say that it is an individual who does something.</p>  </div>
