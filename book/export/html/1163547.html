<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is your own divinity that is coming to the fore. Of course, my oneness, my inseparable oneness is there with your divinity. I bring down grace from above, but your personal effort expedites the matter. So I want to give fifty percent of the full credit to the sincere seeker inside you.</p>  </div>
