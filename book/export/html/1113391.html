<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can meditate with soulful intensity without pulling the divine forces provided you can make your meditation spontaneous. The runner runs the fastest not when he is intense but when his whole body is coordinated and he is relaxed. Intensity here means tension. When it is a matter of pulling and pushing, he cannot run fast.</p>
<p>When intensity is used to push or pull the divine force, then it creates tremendous problems and progress comes to a halt. But while you are meditating, if your meditation becomes intense, that is a good thing. While meditating, if you can have a spontaneous feeling of self-giving to the Inner Pilot, the Supreme Pilot, then your meditation will automatically become intense. And this intensity is not harmful; on the contrary, it is the beginning and blossoming of a new inner dawn in your spiritual life.</p>  </div>
