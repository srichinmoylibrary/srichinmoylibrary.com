<p>I would like to show you a video of my recent running performances. This is specially for those who belong to my Inspiration Club and who encourage me every week to continue. This is my progress report. I may not run fast, but I am very devotedly and diligently practising. I practise whenever my legs permit me. I have done 400 metres in 1:34.53. When I come back from the Christmas holiday, I hope I can make some progress.</p>
