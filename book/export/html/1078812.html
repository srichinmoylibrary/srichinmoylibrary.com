<p>God's Compassion tells me that I can do nothing without Him. God's Justice tells me that He has given me the necessary capacity to become what I sincerely, soulfully want to become. Not only will God's Justice give me what I divinely want to have, but also it will give me the capacity to become as perfect as God Himself.</p>
<p>The hero in us cries for God's Justice. The beggar in us cries for God's Compassion. The hero in us knows perfectly well that when God exercises His Justice, the hero will be able to run faster than the fastest and will eventually become wiser than the wisest. On him God will shower His better-than-the-best Concern-Height and Love-Delight. Again, in order to make us great, good and divine, God the Compassion is constantly showering His Compassion on us.</p>
<p>The beggar in us is also laziness incarnate. He begs, but only for a short while; then he gives up totally. He does not have the necessary capacity to stick to his principles and be ready to pay the price. The beggar in us only wants Compassion unconditionally from God. God can give His unconditional Concern and Love to the beggar in us, but once we get it, then there is every possibility that the beggar in us will not appreciate it because it was given unconditionally. When God does something unconditionally and man does not do anything to deserve it, then man does not value it. Therefore, God always expects us to do something — to try, to cry — in order to value His Gifts. God can give us whatever we want, whatever we need, but it is we who will not be satisfied. It is we who will not be pleased with ourselves unless we have offered our mite to God's Cosmic Plan.</p>
<p>God fervently wishes that the beggar in us will one day give up begging and start choosing like a divine hero, a supreme hero, who knows what he wants and, in order to get it, offers up his body, vital, mind, heart and soul as a flaming sacrifice. We must not remain always veritable beggars. It is high time for us, it is our bounden duty, to grow into divine heroes and live the life of supreme heroism. What is the supreme heroism? The supreme heroism is to give ourselves ceaselessly and unconditionally so that God can fulfil Himself in and through us in His own way. When He fulfils Himself in His own way, it means that He is liberating, fulfilling and immortalising His expanded and extended Cosmic Reality.</p>
