<p>Luminosity is one of the divine qualities of the soul. But each soul need not and does not express itself through luminosity. It can use other divine qualities such as Peace, Bliss and Power. One does not have to cry for luminosity. Luminosity is bound to come if one is absolutely pure in the physical, genuinely sincere in the mind and soulfully aspiring in the heart.</p>  </div>
