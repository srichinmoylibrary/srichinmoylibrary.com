<p>When he is in his body<br /> He is a born sleeper.</p>
<p>When he is in his vital<br /> He is a born fighter.</p>
<p>When he is in his mind<br /> He is a born doubter.</p>
<p>When he is in his heart<br /> He is a born sacrificer.</p>
<p>When he is in his soul<br /> He is a born forgiver.</p>
<p>When he is in his God<br /> He is a born dreamer.</p>
