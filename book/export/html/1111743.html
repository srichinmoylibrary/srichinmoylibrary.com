<p>On the day of the Westchester Half-Marathon, I secretly ran eight and a half miles early in the morning before the race. When I came near the subway station on Queens Boulevard, I saw hundreds of people coming out of a large building. The building had pictures of movie stars on it. I was thinking to myself, "How can they show a movie at five-thirty in the morning?" But you can't drink in a movie theatre and all these people were absolutely drunk. Disciples told me later that it was probably a disco.</p>
