<p>Around 4:30 in the morning, after running three and a half miles, I passed a very old man who was in his seventies. He was carrying a bag which had some food inside it. This happened between Queens Boulevard and Main Street.</p>
<p>He asked me, "Excuse me, which way is the subway?"</p>
<p>I said, "I'm very sorry. I don't know."</p>
<p>The old man said, "Never mind, you are a nice guy."</p>
<p>After I went on about 200 metres, I remembered: "Oh, he is walking towards the highway. How is he going to get the subway there?"</p>
<p>So I ran back to get him. O God, he was coming back; somebody else had already told him to head towards Queens Boulevard.</p>
<p>But when he saw I came back to help him, he said, "I knew you were a nice guy."</p>
