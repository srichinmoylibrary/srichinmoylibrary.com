<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What is purity? Purity is something that makes us feel that God can never be separated from our true existence. If one has purity, then one can feel God as his very own. And if one does not have purity, then one can never feel God as his own; he is only fooling himself. A man of impurity can never, never claim God, with utmost sincerity, as his very own.</p>
<p>So, if somebody has purity in abundant measure, then only will he be able to claim God as his very own and at the same time be convinced of his inner commitment.</p>  </div>
