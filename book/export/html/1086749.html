<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the path to God what is purity and what is realisation? On the path to God, purity is the fragrance of a flower and realisation is the flower. Both are equally important. If you don't have fragrance, then the flower is useless. If you do not have a flower, how can you have fragrance? So both flower and fragrance are of equal need and importance. If you feel the presence of a flower inside your heart, then if you smell the fragrance, you are perfectly safe and you will be able to reach your destined Goal without fail.</p>  </div>
