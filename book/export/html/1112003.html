<p>I went to a 3.1-mile race tonight on Long Island. We were 20 minutes late, and the first-class runners were all finished. Then Trishul got a map of the course and Pahar followed it exactly — with no mistakes.</p>
<p>The course was excellent — 100 per cent flat. On either side of the road there were trees and so forth. It was very beautiful — a good panoramic view.</p>
<p>When we finished, they had already started distributing the prizes. There were about 300 people there — very good!</p>
