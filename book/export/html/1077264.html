<p>Incredible, but true. The amazing Czech held the world record for every distance between 5,000 and 30,000 metres at various times in his unprecedented career. He was not only a striking but also a winning running-machine. All over Europe he was winning the distance races. In all, he set eighteen world records.</p>  </div>
