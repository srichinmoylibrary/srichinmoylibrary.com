<p><em>(Gautami is going from door to door.)</em></p>
<p>GAUTAMI: O Mother, please give me some mustard seeds. My only child has died and the Buddha has told me that if I bring him some mustard seeds he will bring life back to my child.</p>
<p>LADY: Don't worry. I will bring them to you.</p>
<p>GAUTAMI: O venerable lady, please wait. First tell me, has anybody died in your family?</p>
<p>LADY: When?</p>
<p>GAUTAMI: Any time.</p>
<p>LADY: Just last year I lost my husband.</p>
<p><em>(She begins to weep.)</em></p>
<p>GAUTAMI: Then I cannot take your mustard seeds.</p>
<p><em>(Gautami sheds bitter tears and goes to another house. A man opens the door.)</em></p>
<p>GAUTAMI: My Lord, please give me a few mustard seeds. I need them badly.</p>
<p>MAN: Certainly, I will give you mustard seeds. I shall get them for you.</p>
<p>GAUTAMI: First, please tell me, has anybody died in your family?</p>
<p>MAN: Ah, just last week I lost my wife, my dearest on earth.</p>
<p>GAUTAMI: Ah, then I cannot take the mustard seeds from you.</p>
<p><em>(Gautami again sheds bitter tears and goes to another house. A young girl opens the door.)</em></p>
<p>GAUTAMI: My child, you are so beautiful. Please bring me a few mustard seeds. Please go and ask your mother to give me some mustard seeds.</p>
<p>LITTLE GIRL: I know where my mother keeps mustard seeds. I will bring them for you.</p>
<p>GAUTAMI: Please tell me what your father does?</p>
<p>LITTLE GIRL: My father? <em>(Starts crying.)</em> My father is in Heaven. Just two months ago my father died all of a sudden.</p>
<p>GAUTAMI: My child, I cannot take your mustard seeds.</p>
<p><em>(Weeping, Gautami goes to another door.</em> )</p>  </div>
