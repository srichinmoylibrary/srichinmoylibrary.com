<p>When they took me into my sister's room, my sister was eagerly waiting for me. As soon as she saw me, she started screaming with joy. There were tears in her eyes. She became hysterical. I placed my hand on her head and started blessing her. She immediately grabbed my hand, pulled it down and placed it on her heart. She pressed my hand against her chest. Both of us were swimming in a sea of tears. She told me that she did not want to live on earth any longer. Now that she had seen me once more, she wanted to go to the other world.</p>
<p>I said, "No, you have to stay on earth. Your soul wants you to stay."</p>
<p>We were together for perhaps three or four minutes. We created a scene! Then they sent a servant to knock at the door to remind me that it was closing time. He was knocking at the door very hard. I opened it and said to him, "There are four patients in this room. All of them are sick. What are you doing?"</p>
<p>He said, "But two minutes are up."</p>
<p>I said, "You could not have come here and whispered?"</p>
<p>When I was leaving, my sister was so happy and, at the same time, she was so miserable that I had to leave her.</p>
<p>The nurses told me again, "Tomorrow morning at eight o'clock you can return."</p>  </div>
