<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can help only by becoming more soulful and fruitful in our own life. If we consciously become more soulful and fruitful in our thought-world, in our speech-world and in our self-giving-world during our day-to-day existence, then we can easily help people in a physical way.</p>  </div>
