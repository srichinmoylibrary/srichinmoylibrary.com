<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, we do. I have my permanent headquarters in New York, but these are all permanent Centres with a resident president in each place. They function here all the time without me, although I offer them spiritual guidance inwardly and by mail and telephone. I spend eight or nine months a year in New York and the rest of the time I spend in Puerto Rico, Miami, Jamaica, West Indies and other places. Then I go out on occasion when people invite me to speak on Yoga, philosophy, etc. I give a great many public talks in churches, synagogues, schools, Hatha Yoga groups, etc.</p>  </div>
