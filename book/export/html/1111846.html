<p>While I was running, several times some black children patted me on the shoulder or tried to shake my hand. One said, "Buddy, go on."</p>
<p>They were very nice. They were giving the runners water and juice. Unfortunately, their fingers were inside the water. Twice after taking water from them and thanking them, I started running without drinking because the water was so filthy. Each mile I drank water from the water stations, but not the water that children were giving out.</p>
