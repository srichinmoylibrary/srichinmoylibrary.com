<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme,<br /> Today I have a volley of questions.<br /> “My child, I am all ready.”<br /> My Lord,<br /> Where does my obedience stand<br /> In my spiritual life?<br /> “My child, your obedience<br /> Is your pre-school course.”<br /> My Lord,<br /> Where does my love stand<br /> In my spiritual life?<br /> “My child, your love<br /> Is the kindergarten course.”<br /> My Lord,<br /> Where does my devotion stand<br /> In my spiritual life?<br /> “My child, your devotion<br /> Is the primary school course.”<br /> My Lord,<br /> Where does my surrender stand?<br /> “My child, your surrender<br /> Is your high school course.”<br /> My Lord,<br /> My unreserved surrender,<br /> Where does it stand?<br /> “My child,<br /> Your unreserved surrender<br /> Is your college course.”<br /> My Lord,<br /> My unconditional surrender,<br /> Where does it stand?<br /> “My child,<br /> Your unconditional surrender<br /> Is your university course.”<br /> My Lord,<br /> Where does my sleepless, breathless<br /> And unconditional surrender stand?<br /> “My child,<br /> That is your Ph.D. course.”</p>

<p>My Lord,<br /> When I exploit Your indulgence,<br /> What happens to me?<br /> “My child,<br /> You are the one to feel and know<br /> What happens when you exploit<br /> My indulgence.”<br /> My Lord,<br /> We all talk about self-indulgence.<br /> What actually is self-indulgence?<br /> “My child,<br /> Self-indulgence drastically reduces<br /> The God-oneness-dream-capacity.”</p>
