<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am extremely grateful to the Vietnamese. They have been extremely kind and compassionate to me. As you know, the Viet Nam War between the Americans and the Vietnamese took place in the 1960s. One of the places where the worse fighting took place, the Mekong Delta, will be known as a Sri Chinmoy Peace Delta. This is a blessingful gift from the heart and soul of Viet Nam, and I am extremely grateful to Viet Nam for that.</p>  </div>
