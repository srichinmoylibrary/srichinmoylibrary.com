<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only see how many years you have wasted. Remember the days when you were energetic and how much joy you got at that time. Each year you participate in the canoe trip for two weeks. How energetic and dynamic you are at that time! So remember the golden days and how much happiness you got. The best way for you to conquer lethargy is to remember the experiences when you worked very hard for the canoe trip. When you bring to the fore the memory of that energetic life, you will get such joy. That joy is progress, and it will help you to do other things with the same kind of enthusiasm and eagerness.</p>  </div>
