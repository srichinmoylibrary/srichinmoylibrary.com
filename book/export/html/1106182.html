  <h1 class="book-heading">Hanuman’s tail</h1>
  
 
<p>This morning, as I was about to lift 370 pounds for the third time, whom did I see? My departed disciples Agni and Ananta standing side by side. Ananta was holding the flag, as usual, and Agni was clapping.</p>
<p>Now, do I ever see Hanuman? On my fourth lift, all of a sudden, he came. Poor Agni and Ananta! As soon as they saw Hanuman’s tail, they were so frightened that they disappeared. When Hanuman comes, his tail resembles a lion and that is why they were so frightened.</p>
<p>Here I was lifting 370 pounds, but inside I was in a laughing consciousness because Agni and Ananta ran away.</p>
