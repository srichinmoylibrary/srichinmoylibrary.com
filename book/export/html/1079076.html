<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You do live in the heart. But everybody who is aspiring at times finds it difficult to remain in the heart all the time. If everybody were all the time in the heart, then everything would become perfect. Now, why is it that you do not always live in the heart? Sometimes you are mixing with people who are of the mental type. When you are dealing with customers, colleagues, acquaintances, they may not be at all spiritual. At that time you are assailed by their thoughts, their ideas. They live on the mental plane, so naturally they come and attack you on the mental plane and there you are engaged. You are not able to remain inside your heart. Actually, you are remaining in the heart, but you are not always conscious of your presence inside the heart. So the more you can become conscious of your presence inside the heart, the more you can be conscious of your heart-consciousness, the sooner the mind will surrender to your heart. If you are conscious of your consciousness that is inside the heart, then your mind will have to surrender to your heart.</p>  </div>
