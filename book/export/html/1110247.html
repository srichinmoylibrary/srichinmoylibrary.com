<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Regularity is needed. We eat food regularly in order to strengthen our bodies. We may eat almost the same food each day, but we have to eat regularly. Meditation is our spiritual food. In the spiritual life one has to meditate regularly every day, and if he belongs to a spiritual centre, he has to participate in its activities regularly. This will strengthen his inner being and ensure his continual progress.</p>  </div>
