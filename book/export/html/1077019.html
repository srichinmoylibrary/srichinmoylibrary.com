<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you don’t have dreams, that means you don’t need them. If you have dreams but forget them and then feel that you have lost something important in life, then you have to try to gain them back. In order to do that, you have to feel that your life is not a reality devoid of dreams. Also you have to know that each dream is the clear indication of an imminent reality; therefore, you will value the dream as you would value the reality. If you value dreams in this way, then an inner being of yours will help you remember your dreams.</p>  </div>
