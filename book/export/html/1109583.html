<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, Hatha Yoga is not part of my path. But I do advise my students to take exercise. Physical fitness considerably helps us in our spiritual journey, so I ask them to run. Recently about one hundred of my disciples ran in the marathon in New York City. I do advise them to run.</p>  </div>
