<p>When I finished the marathon, the person who took off my number said to me, "Super!" He was saying that because we were so brave to finish.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we drove three miles back along the course to see the people who were still running. We saw at least twenty people still running! I had walked quite a lot, so what kind of speed could they have had?</p>
<p>At the end some people collapsed from the heat. Bill Rodgers saw one person at the finish and said, "Major dehydration!"</p>
