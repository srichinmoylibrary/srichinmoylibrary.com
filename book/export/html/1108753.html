<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Tomorrow I will be meeting with Cardinal Sin. I will go there only to receive blessings from him. He is a spiritual person, and I am a spiritual seeker. So it is only to have blessings from Cardinal Sin that I will be going to visit him. Two years ago I met with Cardinal Hume in England. I went to him with the same purpose â€” to be blessed by him.</p>  </div>
