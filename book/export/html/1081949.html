<h2>Question: When I want to think of the Supreme as my friend, what is the most effective way of doing it?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you are resting, sometimes you inwardly talk to yourself or you talk to a friend. Your friend may be hundreds of miles away from you. Physically you can't see him, but you can feel him. His vibration you can feel. No matter where he is, immediately you can feel his vibration. In the same way, try to imagine that there is a constant Friend, an eternal Friend inside you, and that is the Supreme.</p>
<p>When you are speaking to your friend mentally, he may not be there. God knows where he is, but still you are talking to him. He is not listening to you, but you are going on, going on. But when you talk to the Supreme, you have to know that definitely He <em>is</em> listening to you. When you can make yourself feel that there is Somebody to listen to you, when you can feel His Presence, then automatically your way of talking to the Supreme is complete.</p>
<p>You have come to the church and knocked at the door and you are sure that I am here inside the church. So you are talking to me, even though you don't see me with your physical eyes. Similarly, when you knock at your heart's door, feel that the Supreme is there inside your heart. If you feel that He is there, if you can feel His Presence, then that is enough. Then your conversation will be perfect.</p>  </div>
