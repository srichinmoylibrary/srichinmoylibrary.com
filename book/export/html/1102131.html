<p>"My Lord,<br /> I have a friend.<br /> He says that he will never need You."</p>
<p>"No harm, My child.<br /> Since you are his friend,<br /> That means he needs you.<br /> As long as he needs you,<br /> I shall fulfil his present desires<br /> And future aspirations<br /> In and through you."</p>
