<p>BEACHCROFT: I accept your verdict and acquit Arabindo of the charges brought against him. <em>(Turning towards C.R. Das)</em> Mr. Das, I congratulate you on your laborious study, patience, endurance and your able conduct of the case concerning your client Arabindo.</p>
<p>C.R. DAS: I thank Your Honour for your kind appreciation of my personal efforts. I thank also the members of the jury for their unflagging patience and energy in following the case in detail from day to day and for giving their well-considered verdict.</p>
<p>NORTON: <em>(Coming forward and shaking C.R. Das by the hand)</em> You have the reward of your labour. I congratulate you.</p>
