<p>The day before yesterday, around three-thirty in the morning, I was running by my one-mile mark, near the place where you make a turn on Main Street to go to Flushing Meadow Park. A black man was driving by in a taxi — at that hour! He stopped the taxi and said, "Excuse me, can you give me a can of beer?" I said, "Thank you." Then I just kept running. That was the only man I saw there. I ran two or three more miles, but I saw only one more car.</p>
