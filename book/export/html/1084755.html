<p>AT THE APPOINTED HOUR</p>
<p>At the appointed hour<br /> Humanity said to me:<br /> "Give me, give me.<br /> This is the only way<br /> For you to become great."<br /> At the appointed hour<br /> God said to me:<br /> "Accept Me, receive Me.<br /> This is the only way<br /> For you to become good."</p>
