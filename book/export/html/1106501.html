<p>Today, for the first time, I can feel that my 1,300 pounds are going straight up. While they are coming down, you can see that the dumbbells are rolling, but while going up, they are going straight, not slanting. If I can lift just a little higher, a quarter of an inch or a half an inch, then the television people will see it clearly.</p>
<p>One of these days, confidence will come and I will create a new sensation.</p>
