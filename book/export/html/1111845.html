<p>My road crew is always responsible for supplying me with drinks. This time when I was thirsty, sometimes I couldn't drink because I was in the middle of the road and could not get near the water station. If the road crew had been there, they would have given me ERG and water. Three times at the water stations I said "ERG" but they gave me water.</p>
