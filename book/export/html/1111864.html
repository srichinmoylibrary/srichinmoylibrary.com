<p>When I was coming back, I saw Karabi the Great running. What did I do? I immediately looked at my wristwatch to see what time it was. I wanted to see if Karabi could have run that far if she had started after her six o'clock morning meditation. I wanted to catch her to see if she had missed meditation to go running.</p>
