<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are making a mistake by bringing intuition into the picture. You have to love God more and more and more. If sincerity is involved in your love, then that love will protect you. There is no need of intuition or any other quality. If you love God with utmost sincerity, your love of God will save you. If you love God, immediately you will feel that if you do something wrong, God will shed bitter tears, ceaseless tears. So love of God will prevent you from doing many wrong things. Love of God is the answer.</p>  </div>
