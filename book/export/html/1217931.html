<p>I sought God's guidance. He caught my fear.</p>
<p>I sought God's Wisdom-Light. He caught my Ignorance-night.<br />I sought God's all-illuming Truth. He caught my all-spreading Falsehood.</p>
<p>I sought God to own Him. He caught me to give Himself.<br />I sought God because without Him I can do nothing.<br />He caught me because without me He wants to do nothing.</p>
<p>I sought God I am now fulfilled.<br />God caught me. He is now revealed.</p>  </div>
