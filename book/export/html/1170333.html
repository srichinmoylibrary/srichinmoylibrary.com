<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The more you read, the more you listen to my music and my soulful utterances, the greater will be your aspiration, and the more intense will be your meditation. From the disciples I expect everything. Since you have given me the responsibility for your spiritual life, I wish to tell you that there is a way to run the fastest, and that way is to be totally and wholeheartedly in my boat.</p>  </div>
