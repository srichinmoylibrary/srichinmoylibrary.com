<p>This morning I was reading Tagore’s <em>Gitanjali</em> in English. According to me, there is no comparison between the original Bengali and the English translation. The Bengali words are sweeter than the sweetest. Their sweetness, softness and tenderness melt my heart. The English translation is also very beautiful, but as a Bengali, I am not fully satisfied. I do not get the same softness and sweetness.</p>
<p>And again, I myself translated hundreds of pages of Nolini Kanta Gupta’s Bengali essays into English, so the same could be said for my translations.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
