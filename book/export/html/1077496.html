<p>What is India’s spiritual message to the world at large? Spirituality. What is spirituality? It is the natural way of truth that successfully communes with the Beyond here on earth.</p>
<p>What is India’s absolutely distinctive possession? Her soul. She lives in the soul, she lives from the soul and lives for the soul.</p>
<p>Where can the world find the real nature of India? In the ever-wakeful domain of the Spirit.</p>
<p>What has made the history of India unique? The most surprisingly unusual continuity of the line of her spiritual seekers and Masters.</p>
<p>What does Indian spirituality teach? It teaches the world to conquer the evil of the lower nature and also to go beyond the good of the higher nature.</p>
<p>Has Mother India any desire? If so, what is it? It is to transcend the human way once and for all, in the ever dynamic way of God, in the way of radical self-transmutation. Religion, however mighty it may be, is not and cannot be the message of India. Her message is self-realisation.</p>
<p>The perfect truth of India’s religion is in her outer and inner realisation of the One that is, of the One that is in the process of becoming.</p>
<p>O world, on your march towards the deepest recesses of your heart! To your amazement, you will find Mother India to be anything but God-fearing. What then is she? She is God-loving! The God-loving soul in God’s all-dreaming and all-manifesting Truth.</p>
<p>The soul of India feels that to be satisfied with intellectual speculation is to remain satisfied with half of the food that is actually needed for health. It is Realisation that gives one a full meal. And to have the Realisation, meditation and concentration are of paramount importance.</p>
<p>Indian philosophy, in its sublimest sense, is nothing short of the practical realisation of the Truth.</p>
<p>There is just a hyphen between the Vision of the Vedic seers and the soul of India. Also between India’s spirituality and the final spiritual liberation of the world.</p>  </div>
