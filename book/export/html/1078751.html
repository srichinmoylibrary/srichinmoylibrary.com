<p>"My sweet Lord Supreme, I am truly tired of this long road. The road that divides us is very long. Please, please grant me a shortcut. I shall be eternally grateful to You if You grant me a shortcut to reach You."</p>
<p>"My son, I am surprised to hear that you want to have a shortcut, for I thought that someday you would ask Me for the shortest cut. You are ready to be satisfied with only a shortcut, but I shall give you a shortcut, and I shall also tell you the shorter cut and the shortest cut, in case you need them in the near future.</p>
<p>"The shortcut is belief; you must believe in Me. You must believe in Me constantly. Just repeat to yourself: 'I believe in God, I believe in God.' This is undoubtedly an excellent shortcut.</p>
<p>"The shorter cut is to repeat to yourself: 'My Lord Supreme loves me infinitely more than I love myself. My Lord Supreme loves me infinitely more than I love myself.' How can it be possible? It is possible because when you see your shortcomings in teeming measure, you get frustrated and you want to destroy yourself. But I see you as a projection of My own Reality; therefore, I do not get frustrated. I am ready to go on with infinite Patience, and this Patience is undoubtedly your salvation. So you can see that I do love you infinitely more than you love yourself.</p>
<p>"The shortest cut is this: You have to tell yourself that you need Me breathlessly. In My case, I will tell you that I need you unmistakably. You need Me breathlessly and I need you unmistakably. This has to be your constant, sincere prayer.</p>
<p>"If you can repeat to yourself that you believe in Me, this is the shortcut. It you can say that I love you infinitely more than you love yourself, this is the shorter cut. And the shortest cut is to feel that you need Me breathlessly and I need you unmistakably. If you can do all these, then the short, shorter and shortest cuts will be open to you.</p>
<p>"For Me also there is a shortcut, a shorter cut and a shortest cut to reach you. The shortcut is when I tell Myself that in you I shall discover the most perfect instrument of Mine. The shorter cut is when I tell Myself that I always love you unconditionally, no matter what you do, no matter what you think of Me, no matter what you tell Me, no matter what happens to you, no matter what you want to do with your life's vision and your life's reality. And the shortest cut is when I see in you My Eternity's Soul and keep for you My Infinity's Goal."</p>
