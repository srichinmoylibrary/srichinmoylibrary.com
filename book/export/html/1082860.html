<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He is one but He is at the same time many. A tree is one but it has so many branches. When you look at a branch you feel it is the tree. When you look at the leaf you feel it is the tree. Similarly you may see God differently from different angles. But He is the same God.</p>  </div>
