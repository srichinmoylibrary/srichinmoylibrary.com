<p>We also saw the Mayor of Cologne, who gave us a proclamation and very nice gifts. He was so nice. Three or four times he talked about me, all from his heart â€” what he was feeling about me. Then there was an immediate translation by a lady who had been in New York for only three years. But her English was excellent. When I spoke, she translated for me.</p>
<p>Of all the twenty or thirty mayors that I have seen, this German Mayor was the one who touched most deeply the very depth of my gratitude-heart.</p>  </div>
