<p>You denied yourself even the bare necessities;<br />        Therefore<br /> You think you are great.<br /> You may be right.<br />   Who knows?</p>
<p>He denies nothing that comes his way.<br />        I tell you<br /> That he is right.<br /> God is well-pleased with him.</p>
<p>I deny the things that God wants me to deny.<br /> I accept the things that God wants me to accept.<br />        Why?<br /> Because my acceptance-light<br /> And my denial-might<br /> Contribute to my God's constant self-transcendence<br />   in me.</p>
