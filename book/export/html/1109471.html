<p>Inside each human being there is a poet. I fully concur with Joubert:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You will find poetry nowhere, unless you bring some with you."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must have a subtle poetic touch of our own to appreciate and admire poetry.</p>
<p>Poetry and truth are inextricably linked. The Sanskrit word for poet is <em>kavi</em>. <em>Kavi</em> means "he who envisions." What does he envision? He envisions the truth in its seed-form. Once more I wish to invoke Joubert. His sublime realisation is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You arrive at the truth through poetry; I arrive at poetry through truth."</p>
