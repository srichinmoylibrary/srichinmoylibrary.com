<p>An ordinary teacher gives to his students what he has: knowledge. A spiritual Teacher gives to his disciples not only what he has but also what God has and what God is. What the Teacher has for his disciples is concern. What God has for his disciples is Compassion-Light. What God is for his disciples is Perfection-Delight.</p>
