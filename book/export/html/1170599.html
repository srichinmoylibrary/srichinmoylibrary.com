<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is the heart's magnetic pull. Your heart's own inner cry is the magnetic pull. Your heart is pulling me towards you and my heart is pulling you towards me. It is our hearts' oneness-song.</p>
<p><em>Russell Wilson:</em> You just read my mind, Guruji. You know how sincere I am. Can I ask you to bless my wedding ring, which I always wear. <em>[Sri Chinmoy holds the ring in his hand and blesses it.]</em></p>  </div>
