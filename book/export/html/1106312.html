<p>Today, for the first time, I succeeded in lifting up two 120-pound dumbbells with both arms simultaneously. I felt so much pressure everywhere, right from the shoulder and the spine. Now 100 pounds I have done and 120 pounds I have done. Soon I shall try for 130 pounds. My goal is 150 pounds, my bodyweight, in each arm. Luckily today my weight was under 150—it was 149. If I can come down to 147, then on that day I will be safe.</p>
<p>Poor me, I run once in a blue moon. This morning I ran two miles—to Queens Boulevard. After running two miles, do I have any energy?</p>
