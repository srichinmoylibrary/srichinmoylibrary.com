<p>The other day was Yury's birthday. He had completed 23 years, so he walked and ran 23 miles at the 1,000-mile race. Now I think he has become an invalid.</p>
<p>His mother came yesterday to Annam Brahma. She got an orange as prasad and asked her son if she had to preserve the seeds because the orange was sacred.</p>
