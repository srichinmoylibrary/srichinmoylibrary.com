<p>I was all ready for the competition. I was feeling better by the next day, which was practise for the opening march-past. I took my place in line and practised with the others. Everything was excellent.</p>
<p>But the hostile forces are always ready to show me their capacities. After the march-past was over, the officials had to give instructions. Suddenly it started raining cats and dogs. I wasn't wearing a hat, but people would have thought it was bad manners if I had left. So I had to stand in the rain with my bald head.</p>
<p>If I get even two or three drops of rain on my head, I start to sneeze, and there I had to stand in a downpour. By the following day I had such a high fever that I was practically blind, so I didn't go for the competition.</p>
