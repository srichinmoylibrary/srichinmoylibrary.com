<p>Look at the folly of his heart!<br /> His heart feels that all men are<br /> Helpless.<br /> Look at the folly of his mind!<br /> His mind thinks that all men are<br /> Senseless.<br /> Look at the folly of his vital!<br /> His vital declares that all men are<br /> Useless.<br /> Look at the folly of his body!<br /> His body knows that all men are<br /> Homeless.</p>
