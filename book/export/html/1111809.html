<p>After going six and a half miles I saw a gentleman riding a bicycle. At that time I was absolutely dying because I was trying to walk the fastest for that mile.</p>
<p>When he saw me, he started shouting, "Sri Chinmoy, Sri Chinmoy!" Can you imagine? Even in the dark, people recognise me. Now so many people know us when we run.</p>
<p>Later in the day he came into Annam Brahma and spoke to Dhanu. He said to him, "It was still quite dark. What was Sri Chinmoy doing out there so early?"</p>
<p>â€” 14 September 1982</p>  </div>
