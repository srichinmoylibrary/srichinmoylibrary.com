<p>Last night I told Pratyaya I would go out running at six-thirty this morning. But then I got inspired to go out at five o'clock, and it was not yet six-thirty when I came back.</p>
<p>I said, "Oh my God, if I do not inform Pratyaya, then she will go out looking for me on the street because she likes to see me run. She will be going on a wild goose chase."</p>
<p>So I phoned her and told her I was already back. She was all ready to go out looking for me, but I stopped her in time.</p>
