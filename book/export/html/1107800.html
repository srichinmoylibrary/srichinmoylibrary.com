<h2>5.</h2>

<p>I was extremely delighted to learn that when some of you were meditating in front of my picture the other day you saw green light around the picture. At that time you did not know that we were going to call your group the Green Centre. Your minds did not know, but your souls definitely knew. That is why you saw the green light.</p>
<p>Now I wish to say a few words about the colour green. Green, from the spiritual point of view, signifies newness. It is newness in life, in action, in speech. It is newness in everything that we do or anything that we grow into that eventually will lead us to inseparable oneness with the Absolute Supreme.Newness invites, welcomes and challenges the seeker in us and, at the same time, promises us that at every moment we can make considerable progress. Progress means a forward, upward and inward movement. Ours is the philosophy of constant, continuous and soulful progress. Progress is our satisfaction, and inside satisfaction will be the perfection of our nature, the perfection of our lives, the perfection of our realisation.</p>
<p>We are all God's divine and chosen children. From God's universal and transcendental Vision we have all come into existence. What is a child? A child is he who remains in the heart and who acts in and through the heart. His is always the philosophy of newness. It is the child in us who grows, progresses, achieves and fulfils. So green signifies a childlike heart that is all the time embracing newness and continuously making progress. If we want to make continuous progress, then newness at every moment must dawn upon our devoted heads and in our aspiring hearts. Only then, on the strength of our childlike heart and our conscious oneness with newness, can we grow into the ever-transcending Perfection and Satisfaction and reach the Golden Shore of the ever-transcending Beyond. So from now on, when you ask yourself what you are, immediately try to feel that you are newness. Tomorrow's golden dawn is your name. Your soul-reality, your very existence, is the newness of the golden dawn.The past has not given us what we actually want, what we are longing for-that is to say, God-realisation, which is conscious and inseparable oneness with our Beloved Supreme. We can expect to get God-realisation not from yesterday but from today or from the tomorrow that is growing in the immediacy of today. This does not mean that we must discard the past, if it was good; the quintessence of the past we shall keep. If we have done something divine, soulful, loving or self-giving, then the quintessence of that past experience we shall try to embody. But the millions of mistakes that we have made, the many undivine things that we have done-these we have to totally obliterate from our minds. The past is dust. It is the golden future which is growing and glowing in the heart of today, and it is this golden future that we shall welcome.</p>
<p>All of you will kindly come to the meetings every week. Your regularity and punctuality are of paramount importance. Most of you are students. You know the difference between good students and bad students. If you are good students, which I am sure that you are, then you become all joy to your teacher. I happen to be your spiritual teacher, but I am not like an ordinary teacher. I am like a private tutor. A teacher examines you and if you do well, you pass if you do not do well, then you fail. But a private tutor gives you special help so that definitely you will pass the examination. I am your private tutor who will help you and teach you so that you can transform your ignorance-sea into the sea of wisdom-light. Our mutual co-operation and trust will bring about your fastest progress, and it will definitely give infinite joy to the Real in you, our Beloved Supreme, who is my Guru and also your Guru. The Supreme is the eternal Teacher.</p>
<p>With a soulful hope I am inaugurating our Green Centre today. It is my fervent wish and prayer to the Absolute Supreme that our sincere self-giving efforts, our inner cry and our soulful life on earth will be crowned with divine success and supreme progress. This divine success and supreme progress we shall place soulfully, unreservedly and unconditionally at the Feet of our Beloved Supreme.</p>  </div>
