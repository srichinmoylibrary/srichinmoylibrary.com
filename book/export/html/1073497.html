<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> I started off good. Then for a number of years I was not very good. I have experienced winning and also very severe losing. Very! But I think it was important in my life to have seen both sides. I have seen people run faster and slower than me, and that was important. It taught me how to deal with people better, and how to deal with the sport.</p>  </div>
