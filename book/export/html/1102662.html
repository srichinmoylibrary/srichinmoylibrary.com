<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is both male and female. Both men and women are of equal importance in God's Eye. Both men and women should march together towards their common Destination. Women need not lag behind; they can run soulfully, devotedly and speedily. Also, women should not remain always under the control of men; they should stand on their own feet. But although man and woman are of equal importance, they need not play the same role. If we take man as God's Face, we have to take woman as His Smile. If we see a face without a smile, we do not appreciate the face. The smile immediately conquers our heart. But if there is no face, how can there be a smile?</p>
