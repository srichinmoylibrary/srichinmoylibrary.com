  <h1 class="book-heading">Interviewer: What were your particular interests in the sporting life there?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that time, I was very fond of athletics: running, jumping and throwing. Also, I was a good football player. But now I am so hesitant. Scotland is excellent, excellent in sports, especially in football. Scottish people play football extremely well.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Oh, that's very kind of you to say so. Now that you've mentioned Scotland, perhaps we'll come to a Scottish lady who is sitting beside us. S, in fact you run and organise the Centre in Glasgow?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> Yes. We call it the Sri Chinmoy Centre and we practise meditation under Sri Chinmoy's guidance. There are ten or twelve of us at the moment and we meet twice a week to meditate. We also make crafts and hope to have a store where we'll sell the things we make.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> So there is some kind of practical outlet for this awareness and consciousness of what you are doing?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> Oh, yes. We are very close. We don't live together, but we do meet very often. We have a theatre group that puts on plays that Sri Chinmoy has written. We also have a choir.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Sri Chinmoy, thank you very much for talking to <em>Radio Clyde</em> and I hope your stay in Scotland will be a happy one.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Thank you so much for your most interesting and significant questions. I am so grateful to you. This is the only way I and my students can be of service to mankind. If we had not accepted the world, we would not have met together today. I would have remained in the Himalayan caves and you would have remained in Scotland.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Thank you very much.</p>  </div>
