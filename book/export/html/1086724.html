<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly you are going to God. You came from God, you are going back to God. You came from God to earth with a special message, and that message is that you will tell each and everyone in the world how nice, kind, good and beautiful God is. And once you have told what you have to say about God, you will go back to God in Heaven.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>I am telling you a great secret: you are a fantastic Dream of God</em>, Agni Press, 1974<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/gsdg-14</p></small>    </div>  </body>
