<p>In Australia, Kishore and Prashanta were running here and there looking for my favourite fruit-jackfruit. Finally Prashanta came and told me that they had found some. So I said, "Let me go and see."</p>
<p>When I saw the jackfruit, I wanted to buy some, but the store manager didn't want to sell any. Instead, he gave us three times as much as we wanted-free!While we were eating the fruit, the manager came with three pieces of another kind of fruit, which he said was even more delicious than jackfruit. That also the manager wanted to give us free.</p>
<p>Then Kishore told him who I was, but the man said he already knew.</p>
