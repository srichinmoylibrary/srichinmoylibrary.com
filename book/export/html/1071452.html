  <h1 class="book-heading">Abraham Lincoln</h1>
  
 

<p>Born under no lucky star,<br /> But dynamic in his dreams,<br /> He fought his way to Luck:<br /> “From log cabin to White House.”</p>
<p>No soul on earth supreme over another —<br /> Equality every man’s birthright<br />      and treasure —<br /> Black and white, brown and red<br /> Make no difference —<br />      This nation cannot exist half-slave, half-free:<br /> From his voice these bold truths rang out.</p>
<p>He had the gift to dream of union,<br /> The courage and capacity to fight,<br /> The confidence to win,<br /> The patience that knew no flagging.<br /> Faith in God’s Justice was his stamina,<br /> Faith in God was his might.</p>
<p>Natural the affinity of<br />     vision-luminous souls,<br /> So Emerson could say of Lincoln:<br /> “His heart was as great as the world,<br /> But there was no room in it<br />     to hold a wrong.”</p>
<p>“Force is all-conquering,<br /> But its victories are short-lived.”<br /> Love is all-conquering,<br /> And its victories live on forever.</p>
<p>What is really important?<br /> Are we God’s or is God ours?<br /> The idealist in Lincoln reveals:<br /> “We trust, Sir, that God is on our side.<br /> It is more important to know<br /> That we are on God’s side.”</p>
