<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I invoke Peace, Light and Bliss, I keep my eyes half-closed, not fully closed. I find it extremely easy to invoke Peace, Light and Bliss from above and offer it to those who are around me when my eyes are half-closed. If we keep our eyes totally closed, we may fall asleep. And if we keep our eyes wide open, we may strain our eyes. The forces of this world are seeking to distract us and compel us to pay attention to who is sitting on what chair, what kind of clothing someone is wearing, and so on.</p>  </div>
