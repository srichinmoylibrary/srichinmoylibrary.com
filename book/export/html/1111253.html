<p>Yesterday, while I was running, a young girl came up to me on a bicycle. She said, "Hi! Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday!" Her friends were all looking at me and smiling and cheering me. Then, many of them joined her and sang "Happy Birthday," for about three or four minutes, until I had run so far that I could no longer hear them.</p>
<p>My birthday, however, wasn't until nine days later.</p>
