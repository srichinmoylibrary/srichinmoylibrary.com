<p>“I am so sorry that you have lost your father. He was a very good friend of mine. I feel really sad and miserable that I will not see him anymore on earth. But please tell me, what was his last advice to you?”</p>
<p>“My father’s last advice was the same as his first advice.”</p>
<p>“What was his first advice?”</p>
<p>“As I said, his first and last advice were the same: ‘Don’t listen to your Mother under any circumstances.’”</p>  </div>
