<p>God, I know why You do not care for me.</p>
<p>You do not care for me because I am a man.</p>
<p>I think it is unfair. I think it is disgusting.</p>
<p>God, I know why You do not care for me.</p>
<p>You do not care for me because I am a woman.</p>
<p>I must tell You that I really do not know how You dare to ignore me.</p>
<p>There is always a veil between God's Intention and man's realisation.</p>
<p>There is always a bridge between man's love for God and God's surrender to man.</p>  </div>
