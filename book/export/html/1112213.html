<p>Once Savitri, the leader of our Vancouver Centre, fell down on one of my running courses and her soul went up into a particular tree. Then I put the soul back into the body. This happened on my old course at two miles and 1,300 metres. The mark is in Flushing Meadow Park near the highway, not near the lake. At that point, there are a few trees. Now, whenever I pass by that place, immediately I feel the vibration and Savitri's soul comes to me. Not even a single time do I pass the tree and the tree does not respond, because the soul left the body and it was in the tree. Sometimes, when souls leave the body, they do not want to come back. But when there is pressure, the soul does come back. Had Savitri's soul left the body at that time, it would have been an untimely death. That is why I compelled the soul to come back. Then Savitri stayed on earth for at least ten or twelve years more. Her soul got the opportunity to love God more and manifest Him more. So that tree is always so grateful to me.</p>
