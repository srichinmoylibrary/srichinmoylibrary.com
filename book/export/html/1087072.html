<p>I went to a bookstore today on Sutphin Boulevard, near Jamaica Avenue. Next to the bookstore is my most favourite Italian restaurant. For years I used to walk down there and bring pizza back to my house for any disciples who were working there. The owner's name is Mark. Always the people in that restaurant are so nice to me!</p>
<p>When I went into the bookstore today, a black man was reading Muhammad Ali's book, I Am King. In this book Ali did not say he was "the greatest." He said, "I am the King."</p>
<p>The man was very nice. He was showing such interest in the book. He said, "Would you like to buy this book?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am, like you, a great admirer of Muhammad Ali."</p>
<p>He said, "You are a great admirer of his?"</p>
<p>I said, "I have had quite a few interviews with him."</p>
<p>He couldn't believe his ears. He said, "Oh, you have met the King? You talked to him?"</p>
<p>I said, "I have talked with him for hours."</p>
<p>I took the man's name and address and said that I would send him the brochures with our interviews.</p>
<p>The man had with him a cage with a rabbit inside. The shopkeeper wouldn't let him bring it inside the bookstore.</p>
