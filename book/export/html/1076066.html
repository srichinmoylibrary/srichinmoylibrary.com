<p>From 1 November to 5 November, 1976, Sri Chinmoy was in San Francisco for the opening of an exhibition of his Jharna-Kala paintings. He also gave an esraj concert and conducted a public meditation. During his stay, the Master honoured the recent third anniversary of Dipti Nivas restaurant by inviting its employees, who are all disciples, to submit a spiritual question to him. This booklet contains their questions and Sri Chinmoyâ€™s answers.</p>  </div>
