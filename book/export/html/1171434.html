<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What gave me the most joy? Mahasamrat's smile. I mean it! Nobody smiles like Mahasamrat. Mahasamrat's smile gave me the utmost joy and strength. When I lifted 600 pounds, 300 with both arms, and he said, "Guru, you have done it!" he gave me the strength, joy and satisfaction of ten elephants. When I lifted the dumbbells, I looked at Mahasamrat, and his smile gave me the utmost satisfaction â€” that smile of infinite affection, love and confidence.</p>  </div>
