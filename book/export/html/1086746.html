<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God loves the child who loves Him most. Who can love Him most? He who has boundless love for God, boundless devotion for God and boundless surrender for God. What is love? What is devotion? What is surrender? Love is to cry for God, devotion is to smile when you see God and surrender is to dance with joy when God is in your presence.</p>  </div>
