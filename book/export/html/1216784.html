<p>At the Guinness Museum we saw a 455-pound man. Previously, he and his brother had both weighed the same, but recently his brother died.</p>
<p>His wife weighs only 95 pounds. He said that his wife is thin but his brother's wife is fat. Everybody was curious to know his brother's wife's weight. It is 125 pounds!</p>
<p>When I saw his thigh, I couldn't believe it. Of course, he has custom-made trousers. Then we saw the tallest woman and the tallest man — he is eight feet something.</p>
