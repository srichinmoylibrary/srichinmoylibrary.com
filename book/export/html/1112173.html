<p>I buy such simple things at the gift shop, but they are so expensive. On that day, the magazine, newspaper and two pieces of candy came to $10.59. When the man said, "$10.59," I said, "Stop, stop! I do not have that much. I have only $10."</p>
<p>The Pakistani man said, "Do not worry. Every day you come."</p>
<p>On another day I was going to buy three ties for Gorbachev. The three ties, plus candy and newspapers had come to a little over $40. I only had $40 with me, so I decided to buy only one tie and the other things. Then it came to only $20.</p>
<p>I said to the Pakistani man, "The other day when I did not have enough money, you did not give me a discount. So I had to return something."</p>
<p>He said, "What could I do? That fat lady Louise, was here." He himself is very fat. I said, "That lady is so thin!"</p>
<p>He told me, "She calls me fat, so I also call her fat."</p>
<p>Then he said, "You come from India and I come from Pakistan, and we are friends. But if you had been living in India and I had been living in Pakistan, no good!"</p>
<p>I said, "So many times we have had wonderful conversations. Here there is no India or Pakistan. Here in America we are one."</p>
<p>Then I told him, "Tomorrow I am not going to come. I will be in Canada."</p>
<p>He said, "Do not worry about the 59 cents!"</p>
