<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no such thing. This hour is most important. You have to know that this is not just like a dentist appointment. It is your meeting with your Eternal Father, your Beloved. If someone wants to arrange to meet you but you are not available, you will say, "Come back again next week." You will make it a point to see somebody at ten o'clock or five o'clock and that will be the hour. If the Supreme comes at the appointed hour and you say, "Come back next week," He will tell you that He can only come at the hour He is supposed to come and this is the only time He can see you.</p>
<p>If you are sick or suffering from something, it is unavoidable. If you have a fever, what are you going to do? This is the only excuse I will accept; otherwise, you will have to tell yourself to get up early.</p>  </div>
