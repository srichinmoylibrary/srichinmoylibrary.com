<p>Through the Free India Centre which Netaji established in Germany, Rabindranath Tagore's song <em>Jana Gana</em> Mana was played and sung for the first time in Hamburg on 29 May 1942.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, India's tri-colour banner was hoisted, along with the German flag. The German national anthem was then played.</p>
<p>The Mayor of Hamburg gave Netaji the warmest welcome.</p>
<p>Eventually, Tagore's <em>Jana Gana</em> was adopted as the official national anthem of independent India. Once again, Gandhi-ji and Nehru followed Netaji's lead.</p>  </div>
