<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you get a higher experience, it is something that will nourish you, feed you, strengthen you and illumine your life. But if you are exhausted, your energy is drained, that means that you have pulled beyond your capacity. Otherwise, right after meditation, if it is proper meditation, you gain the strength of a lion. Sometimes it happens that you feel that you have gone high, very high, and then you have distributed everything that you have received. But that has not happened in your case.</p>  </div>
