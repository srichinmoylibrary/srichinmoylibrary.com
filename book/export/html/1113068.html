  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Is there any difference between God and the soul?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there is a difference in the sense that God is the Source and the soul is the flow. The soul is the direct representative of God and God manifests Himself in and through the soul. God is here, God is there, God is everywhere. He is omnipresent. But, at the same time, He is one. Unity wants to satisfy itself through multiplicity. The One wants to go and play the role of the many. When the One wants to play the role of the many, the One creates the soul. So we can safely say that the soul is the direct representative of God which assumes a human form for God-manifestation and world-perfection.</p>
<p>The soul is the tiny drop and God is the vast, infinite ocean. It is countless tiny drops that form the ocean. If we want to separate a drop from the ocean, we can. But again, when the drop enters into the ocean and loses its individuality, it becomes the ocean itself. So the individual soul eventually enters into the Universal Soul and becomes the omniscient, omnipresent and all-loving and all-fulfilling God.</p>  </div>
