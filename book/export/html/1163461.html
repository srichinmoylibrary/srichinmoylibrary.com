  <h1 class="book-heading">Shivaji conquers his pride</h1>
  
 
<p>Once pride entered into Shivaji. He was building a fort and he became very proud that this huge project was supporting 5,000 families. When Shivaji paid a visit to Ramdas, he spoke about the fort with his beloved Guru.</p>
<p>Ramdas saw and felt the pride in his disciple, so he showed Shivaji a particular rock. The rock had an opening in it and inside there was a small pool of water. Out of the water jumped a frog.</p>
<p>"Who is supporting and protecting this little frog?" asked Ramdas.Shivaji's pride vanished. He realised that it is only God who protects and preserves His creation.</p>  </div>
