<p><em>Beth Day Romulo:</em> Does that give you energy to accomplish things?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we know how to pray and meditate, we can easily bring down life-energy from Above. It flows down like a stream and permeates our entire existence. When we pray and meditate, God gives us love, joy, peace, harmony and all the other divine qualities. These are all divine attributes of God's. All the good things that are given to us by God can only increase and multiply. Again, God will slowly and steadily take away from us all our undivine and unaspiring qualities. So whatever is unaspiring in us will be gradually replaced by divine things that are aspiring in and through us.</p>
<p><em>Beth Day Romulo:</em> How are you able to be so prolific?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is all God's Grace. Everything that I have done or am going to do is entirely due to God's Grace. Each and every moment I most sincerely try to depend on God's Grace. As an individual, I do nothing and I know how to do nothing. But if His Grace descends, then He will do everything in and through me.</p>
<p>I have accomplished a few things, but I cannot take any credit myself, for I know that God can make me helpless and useless at any moment He wants to. Since I am always at His mercy, the best thing is to remain only at His Feet. If I am at His Feet, then I can't mislead any human being. But if I am somewhere else, I am bound to mislead and misguide not only a few people but the whole world. So I feel that God's Feet are the safest place for me to be if I really want to be of service to His creation, humanity.</p>  </div>
