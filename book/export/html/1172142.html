<p>Can you imagine? The story never ends, and the plane had not yet even started! I was sitting on the aisle, and the Gujrati lady was sitting on the other side near the window. My left foot was in the aisle. It was aching, so I was shaking it a little.</p>
<p>The lady saw me, and she said, "You are not allowed to do that. I am sick, and you are shaking the whole plane." She was on my right side, and my foot was nowhere near her.</p>
<p>O God, O God, we were still on the ground and I was shaking the whole plane! There were only sixteen seats in our section. I stood up to see if there were any empty seats, but there were none, so I surrendered to my fate. Then I was obedient. I did not shake my foot anymore.</p>  </div>
