<p>"My Lord, I would like to drink Your Nectar so that I can be immortal like You."</p>
<p>"My sweet child, certainly I shall give you My Nectar to drink, but there is another way for you to be immortal. If you offer Me your pure love, your true devotion and your total surrender, you become immediately immortal. Now tell Me what you want. Do you want to drink My Nectar, or do you want to offer Me your love, devotion and surrender?"</p>
<p>"My Lord, I want to do both. I want to drink Your Nectar, and also I want to offer You all my love, devotion and surrender. While drinking Your Nectar, I shall sit down at Your Feet with my life of gratitude. While offering You my love, devotion and surrender, I shall try to enter into Your Heart of infinite Compassion with my unreserved aspiration."</p>
<p>My Lord smiles.</p>
