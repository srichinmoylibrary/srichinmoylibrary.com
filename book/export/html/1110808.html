<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This path is the easiest, the safest and the swiftest. If you say that those who are isolated, those who enter into the Himalayan caves and neglect society will find less difficulty in realising God, granted. But if they do not accept humanity, what do they ultimately gain? If our plot of land is very tiny, only one acre, then our crop will also be tiny. But if we have much land and the capacity and materials to cultivate it then we are bound to get a bumper crop. We are bound to get a bumper crop of realisation in infinite measure because we have accepted humanity.</p>
<p>If I love my Father, and if I see that my brothers and sisters have not yet realised Him, then what will I do? I will give my light, my achievement, to my brothers and sisters. That the world has to be relinquished â€” this is an old Indian theory which is absolutely wrong. Today you will renounce the world, tomorrow you will renounce your family members and the day after tomorrow you will renounce yourself. Then what are you going to do?</p>
<p>Our path is undoubtedly the path of heroes, of divine warriors. We have to fight against doubt, worry, fear, obstruction, limitation, imperfection, bondage and death. But if we really love God, then nothing is difficult. Everything becomes very secure and safe. This is the easiest and most fulfilling path for the sincere, for the totally dedicated, for the brave souls who are ready to walk, march, run and fly along the path of Eternity.</p>  </div>
