<h2>Question: Is there any difference between one God-realised Master and another?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a difference between one God-realised Master and another. Once someone touches the foot of the realisation-tree, you can call him a God-realised Master. But while one Master has only touched the foot of the tree, another has climbed up to the topmost bough and then come down again for manifestation. Some Masters have only a little boat that will carry two or three aspirants across the sea of ignorance. But great Masters, avatars, can carry the whole of humanity.</p>  </div>
