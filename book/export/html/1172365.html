    <title>Question: If a Master is in &lt;em&gt;sahaja&lt;/em&gt; samadhi all the time, which is the highest form of samadhi, is it a sort of conscious descent when he goes into &lt;em&gt;nirvikalpa&lt;/em&gt; samadhi?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not like that. <em>Sahaja</em> samadhi encompasses the other samadhis — <em>savikalpa</em> and <em>nirvikalpa</em> — and it goes beyond, beyond. Samadhi is like a big building with many floors. When one is in <em>sahaja</em> samadhi, he is the owner of the whole building. He has the height of <em>nirvikalpa</em>, and the heights far above that, and at the same time he has achieved the perfection, wealth and capacity of all the other floors. On the one hand he has encompassed within himself all the floors, and on the other hand he is above them. <em>Nirvikalpa</em> is like one height, say the thirtieth floor; it is very high, but it has only its own limited capacity. It cannot bring any of its capacity to the basement. If one has <em>nirvikalpa</em>, he is afraid to go down into the basement, because he may not be able to go back up again. But <em>sahaja</em> consciousness is above the thirtieth floor and, at the same time, it can be in the basement also. <em>Sahaja</em> samadhi will not be satisfied with thirtieth floor; it will be satisfied only when it touches the basement, the first floor, the second floor, all the floors. The power of <em>sahaja</em> samadhi is such that it can take one to any floor.</p>
<p>Right now, for example, I am talking with you people. You can say that I am on the lowest floor. Not in terms of consciousness or achievement, but in terms of height, that is my actual location. But if I own the building, if my consciousness has captured the entire building, then I can be anywhere. When it is a matter of actual location, I may be in the basement; but when it is a matter of possession, I have earned, I have achieved and I constantly have all the floors as my own.</p>  </div>
