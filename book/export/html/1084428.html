<p>What is the matter with me?<br /> Why do I not love God?<br /> He does everything for me.</p>
<p>What is the matter with God?<br /> Why does He not ignore me?<br /> I deserve His indifference-blow.</p>
<p>What is the matter with earth?<br /> Why has it lost all its hope?<br /> Hope is the harbinger of achievement.</p>
<p>What is the matter with Heaven?<br /> Why does it promise all the time?<br /> Promise unfulfilled is insincerity's betrayal.</p>
