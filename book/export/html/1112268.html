<p>Finally, I reached 150th Street. There I saw Carolina on the other side. This is the third day that I have seen her this week.</p>
<p>At my 200-metre mark I saw Chetana standing on the other side in a yellow jacket. She was standing there for her birthday, so I looked at her. I was in a very, very, very high consciousness, so I was not able to say hello to her. Inwardly I blessed her profusely.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw Nilima on 150th Street also. She has her own peculiar style.</p>
