<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> But you have come to that level, and you will be able to get it. Now, I would like you to advise one of my students about his training. His best marathon time is 2:56, but I would like him to run 2:30. Please advise him how he can improve.</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> How many miles do you run a week?</p>
<p><em>Pahar:</em> Fifty or sixty.</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> You have to double it.</p>  </div>
