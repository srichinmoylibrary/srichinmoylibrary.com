<p>At our marathon in Puerto Rico the runners had to run three times around the stadium at the start of the course. Our singers had taped running songs that were played over the loudspeaker, and they inspired the runners considerably.</p>
<p>Because of the heat, many people suffered after completing the race. For many it was a very painful experience.</p>
<p>The man who won had a time of around 2:30, and his wife stood first among the women. So husband and wife stood first together, with one hour difference.</p>
<p>The former champion finished in 2:51. I had a long talk with him, and many pictures were taken. He said this was his worst time in ten years. He blamed the heat. Also, the day before he had eaten Kentucky Fried Chicken, and he said thatruined everything. So remember, don't eat chicken before a marathon!</p>
