    <title>Question: I was talking with a scientifically minded friend of mine regarding creation versus evolution, and he was on the side of creation rather than evolution. He was saying that there are not any links between species. Each species is intact. Is this true?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Creation is continuous. There is evolution, but it is in the soul; it is the evolution of the soul in matter. The soul starts its journey in the Silence-world. While it is evolving, in each incarnation the soul receives light. As long as there is continuous creation in a human incarnation, the body can stay on earth. When creation stops, after seventy or eighty years, then the body dies. What remains is the eternal soul. The soul is evolving through mineral, plant, animal and human life.</p>  </div>
