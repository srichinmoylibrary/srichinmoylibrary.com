<p>Whenever Girish went to visit Sarada Devi, he would first bathe himself in the Ganges. According to our Indian tradition, the Ganges will wash away all your sins. Girish knew that he had led a most undivine life and he wanted to be purified before going into the presence of Sri Ramakrishna's consort.</p>  </div>
