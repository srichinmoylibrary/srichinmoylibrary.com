<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the father of the family has a car, the child has every right to say, “It is our car,” or even, “It is my car,” because he has established his oneness with his father. When he says this, his father will not contradict him. The father will not say, “What do you mean? It is <em>my</em> car. I bought it with <em>my</em> money.” The father will be very happy that the child feels real oneness with him and claims all that he has as his own.</p>
<p>At times the Christ felt that God was his divine Father and at times he identified himself completely with that Father. When he was in the consciousness of absolute Oneness with God, he had every reason to say, “I and my Father are one.” When the river flows into the sea, it becomes the sea itself. The Christ was both the Father and the son. That he was the son of God, we can never deny. Again, when he became one, absolutely one with God, he became nothing other than God Himself.</p>
<p>Not only the Christ, but each and every one of us will one day be able to proclaim, “I and my Father are one.” Man is God yet to be realised totally and God is man yet to be manifested fully. We are all God, but we have yet to realise our highest Divinity.</p>  </div>
