<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can develop constant, confident inner poise if one cares only to listen to the soulful voice inside the heart. In order to listen to the soulful voice inside the heart, one must constantly feel that both the seeker-passenger and the Saviour-Pilot need each other for their realisation and manifestation. The seeker needs realisation, the Master needs manifestation. Again, the seeker has to realise that if the Master wants to change his instruments, he can easily get new instruments, illumining instruments and fulfilling instruments. But if the seeker wants to change Masters, he may not be blessed with a new Master all at once, for there are very few Masters in comparison to the number of seekers.</p>  </div>
