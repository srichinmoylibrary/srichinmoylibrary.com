<p>When I was four years old, I had the worst possible case of smallpox. The smallpox attacked my eyes, ears and nose — everything. The doctor said it was a matter of weeks: I would die or I would go blind or become deaf. The case was so serious.</p>
<p>My mother said, “With God’s Blessings and my prayers, I will not allow my youngest son to die or to become blind or deaf.”</p>
<p>The doctors said, “We don’t want your son to die, but he is going to die. Our medicine won’t work.”</p>
<p>My mother accepted the challenge. She used to wash my face with coconut water. Her prayer and coconut water saved me. I am not dead, I am not blind or deaf. I may have the marks on my face, but my case would have been infinitely worse if the smallpox had not left me. I was cured only because of my mother’s prayer to God and her concern and affection for me. She saved my life.</p>  </div>
