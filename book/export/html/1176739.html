<p>You feel happy that you have succeeded.<br /> Dive deep within.<br /> You are bound to see<br /> That there is Someone who did everything<br /> For your tremendous success.<br /> Just feel that you are not alone<br /> In thinking of yourself.<br /> There is Somebody else<br /> Who thinks of you infinitely more<br /> Than you can ever think of yourself.</p>
