<p>After lifting Mahasamratâ€™s bodyweight, I did not have any feeling in my arm. Then I had to go and play tennis with Mahiyan! How stupid I am! I became totally exhausted. But at 5:30 this evening, in spite of having no sensation in my arm, I did four more sets of lifting, each one with ten pounds more. That was the time I had to add more weight!</p>
