<p>Let me tell you an amusing story with regard to my age. Perhaps most of you know that I go to a gym to take exercise, specially for my running, my sprinting. This gym has a smaller than the smallest running track. If you complete four corners, then it becomes one hundred metres.</p>
<p>Anyway, I run that course thirty-two times, so it makes practically two miles. The track is on the third floor and on the second floor there are all kinds of machines, heavy-duty machines, where people can take exercise.</p>
<p>This morning I did my running to my satisfaction and then I came down to the second floor. A middle-aged woman came up to me and said, “Sir, Sir, is it true that you are eighty-one years old?” I think from the second floor she had seen me running.</p>
<p>I said, “I am only fifty-eight.”</p>
<p>“But these people are saying that you are eighty-one,” she replied. “Even then, you look so smart, so trim. You look very strong. Please tell me what you eat.”</p>
<p>I said, “I am a vegetarian, a strict vegetarian.” “But what do you eat?”</p>
<p>“I take tomato, potato and so on,” I explained.</p>
<p>“That is what you eat?” she said. She simply could not believe it.</p>
<p>Databir had taken me to the gym and I was trying to draw his attention, but he was in trance. He has two eyes and one pair of glasses, so four eyes plus his third eye makes five and still he could not see me.</p>
<p>Finally, he came up to me to tell me that he was going to the car to get a press release to show one man who was taking exercise. He said, “I am going to get material for him. I spoke with him a few days ago. He is so nice. He had the same tennis coach as you did.”</p>
<p>This world is so small! This man’s tennis coach was Ronnie, the same one who was my tennis coach. Two weeks ago, the man saw me running and he could not believe that I had so much speed and energy.</p>
<p>When Databir came back, I said to him, “Before you show it to that man, I want you to show it to this lady.” So Databir showed the lady the press release and also my picture. She was very pleased. She said to Databir, “I see an aura on his skin.” She has started meditating, so one day perhaps she will come to meditate with us.</p>
