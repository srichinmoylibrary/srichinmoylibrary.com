<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The most effective way to inspire others is to become aspiration itself. If you become the embodiment of aspiration, then automatically others will become inspired. You may not be all the time flooded with aspiration, but you do have a certain amount of aspiration, because you are practising the spiritual life and because you are trying soulfully to receive Peace, Light and Bliss in abundant measure.</p>
<p>You cannot go in the street and tell everyone, "I have Peace, Light and Bliss. Just come and take it from me." If you say that you have anything to give, others will just laugh at you. So you have to look around at who is there and then dive deep within and feel from within whom you should approach. When you feel from within that so-and-so would be inclined to at least listen to what you have to say, then only you can offer your inspiration.</p>
<p>So first try to discover from within whether or not your message, your love, your truth, your concern, will be accepted. Then only you will get the right person. Otherwise, you will go out in the street and shout that you have something to offer, but nobody will come. But if you make an inner choice, then afterwards there is every possibility that you will succeed in inspiring others.</p>  </div>
