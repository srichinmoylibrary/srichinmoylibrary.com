<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is everywhere, but He spends most of the time inside your heart. In your house or apartment there are many rooms, but you spend most of your time either in the living room or in the meditation room or somewhere else. Similarly, God can be found everywhere, but His favourite place, where He spends most of His time, is inside your heart.</p>
<p>How can you see Him? Just look into a mirror and try to feel that the person you are seeing is God and nobody else. The person you are seeing in the mirror is definitely God!</p>  </div>
