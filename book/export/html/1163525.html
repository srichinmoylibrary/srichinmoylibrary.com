<h2>Question: What is the spiritual significance of a smile?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When a human mother smiles, it is from her heart. When the Divine Mother smiles, it is her promise to her spiritual child that the Goal of the Beyond is destined, that the Reality Transcendental is bound to dawn for the seeker. When the human father smiles at his son, he offers his earthly knowledge, wisdom and concern. When the spiritual Father smiles at his spiritual child, he offers him the assurance that at every second he is eternally of him and for him. In the seeker's aspiration and the Master's realisation, seeker and Master are one. When the Master brings the golden boat which will carry the seeker to the Golden Shore, he invites the seeker with the broadest smile, with his heart's smile. Then, when he carries the seeker from earth to the Golden Shore, he again offers the seeker his heart's most revealing and fulfilling smile.</p>  </div>
