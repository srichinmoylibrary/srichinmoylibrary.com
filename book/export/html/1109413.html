<p>Mr. Heinrich BÃ¶ll, West Germany's 1972 Nobel Laureate in literature, declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Being American means the chance to be what you want."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked my God two small questions:<br /> What is the meaning of chance?<br /> What do Americans want to be?</p>
<p>"My son, you are a God-lover.<br /> For a God-lover there is no such thing as chance.<br /> My dictionary does not house that particular word.<br /> What you and I call Grace, others call chance.</p>
<p>"My son, here is My answer to your second question:<br /> Americans want to be perfect slaves<br /> To their freedom."</p>
<p>Father, what do You mean?<br /> I do not understand Your answer.<br /> Please be a little more explicit.</p>
<p>"What I mean is this:<br /> Americans are not profitably,<br /> Consciously and unreservedly<br /> Using their freedom-soul<br /> To reach the acme of their Freedom-Goal."</p>
