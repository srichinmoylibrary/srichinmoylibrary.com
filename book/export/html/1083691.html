<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We get God's Compassion-power instead of His Justice-power because He knows that His Compassion-power is an infinitely more powerful weapon to perfect and transform humanity. Compassion is like a magnet, whereas Justice is like an iron rod. We like a magnet to pull us up and not an iron rod to break our heads, no matter how bad we are.</p>  </div>
