<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you came from Europe to New York, your pocket was full. You had a wallet with money inside. You covered thousands of miles and used your money. Now you are going back again and you will earn money so that you can come here next time. Material wealth you have brought here to spend. Similarly, you have brought spiritual wealth to your spiritual life. You have aspired most intensely, so naturally you have got Peace, Light and Bliss. Again, you have come here to get more inspiration and to increase your divine qualities. So please feel that you have another wallet inside your heart. There you have stored Peace, Light and Bliss. Whatever divine qualities you have got here in New York you can keep inside your heart the way you keep a bill inside your wallet. Now you can go back to Europe and try to utilise your spiritual wealth in a wise manner.</p>
<p>But there is a difference between spiritual wealth and material wealth. When you use money properly, you can enjoy it for some time, but gradually it disappears. But if you use spiritual wealth, which is Peace, Light and Bliss, properly; if you give it to the right person, then automatically the Supreme fills your receptacle, the vessel inside your heart. If you start with an iota of Peace and you use it in a divine way, then the Supreme is bound to give you abundant peace. But again, you have to use it properly. The Supreme observes whether you have done something properly. It is like a child who has got a penny from the mother. When he uses it properly, the mother gives him a nickel. Then, when he uses the nickel properly, she gives him a dime. Similarly, from here you are now receiving some Peace, Light and Bliss. If you start using these qualities properly, then when you are disturbed or agitated by the wrong forces of the outer world, I assure you that the Source will supply you with more Peace, Light, Bliss and all other divine qualities. So please feel that you are carrying all the things that you have received here inside your heart when you go back to Sweden.</p>  </div>
