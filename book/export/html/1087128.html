<p>The man said, "Yes, we have one." I could tell that he came from South India.</p>
<p>I asked, 'What is the name?"</p>
<p>He said, "Pohari."</p>
<p>I said, "There is no such word in Bengali."</p>
<p>He said, "Yes!"</p>
<p>I said, "I am Bengali."</p>
<p>He insisted, "There is that word."</p>
<p>So Baoul and I looked for Pohari. Finally Baoul found one called Prahari. 'Prahari' means 'guard.'</p>
<p>I said to the man, "This is not your mother tongue, so it is easy to make a mistake."</p>
<p>He said, "I asked a Bengali about it."</p>
<p>I said, "I am sure he said 'Prahari,' but perhaps he did not pronounce it carefully."</p>
<p>Then he was counting things in Tamil. I was amused, and I also started counting in that language. He looked at me, surprised. Then I told him that I had stayed in South India for 20 years.</p>
