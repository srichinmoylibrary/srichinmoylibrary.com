<blockquote>
<p>“Thy gifts to us mortals fulfil all our needs and yet run back to Thee undiminished.</p>
<p>The river has its everyday work to do and hastens through fields and hamlets; yet its incessant stream winds towards the washing of Thy feet.</p>
<p>The flower sweetens the air with its perfume; yet its last service is to offer itself to Thee.</p>
<p>Thy worship does not impoverish the world.”</p>
<p>— Tagore</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the words of the Poet, no doubt, men take whatever meaning pleases them; yet their last meanings point to Thee, O Lord!</p>  </div>
