<p>I was told that Tagore’s voice was very sweet and melodious, but a little bit high-pitched. Ravi Shankar also mentioned the same thing in his book. Tagore’s voice was normal, but a little high. Then some of the professors at Santiniketan tried to imitate him. Their normal voices went a little higher. My mentor, Sisirkumar Ghose, was one of those who tried to imitate Tagore’s voice.</p>
<p>When Tagore was young and had only a few songs to his credit, he had an excellent, excellent voice. Then, when he had completed hundreds and hundreds of songs, his singing voice deserted him. Age descended upon him and he lost his singing voice.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
