<p>I went to a bookstore yesterday. First I was reading religious books and then I got inspired to read some jokes. So I went to another shelf that had joke books. I was the only customer, so the owner was watching me. He said, "What are you doing? This moment you are reading religious books, and the next moment jokes!"</p>
<p>I told him, "When I want to get joy in this world I read joke books, and when I want to get joy in the inner world I read spiritual books."</p>
<p>So he said, "Are you a philosopher?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>Then I continued reading the joke books.</p>
