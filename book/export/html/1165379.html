<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A selfish demand is made by the vital. If the vital demands something, you want to get it by hook or by crook. If someone does not give you what you want, you will strike that person. But if it is the inner cry, you will try only to do the right thing and please your Inner Pilot in His own way. But vital demand says, "I need something, and if you don't give it to me, then I will break your head."</p>  </div>
