<p>Where is God?</p>
<p>Where is the limit of beauty?</p>
<p>O All-Beauty, where art Thou?</p>
<p>If Thou art all-where why then do my eyes fail to see Thee?</p>
<p>Why is my core not flooded and thrilled with Thy sweet and celestial Smile?</p>
<p>Where art Thou, my Lord, where?</p>
<p>I take great pains and leave no stone unturned to find out even the most trivial thing when it is lost. But, alas, for milleniums Thou hast been away from me. To my wide surprise, I feel no pang within me to vision Thee.</p>
<p>Why is it so?</p>
<p>Boundless is my sorrow, not because our union is severed, but because I have not cried for Thee with a snow-white heart even for a brief second.</p>
<p>My Lord, the face of Truth is at last revealed.</p>
<p>Thou art everywhere when I say</p>
<p>'Yes',</p>
<p>Thou art noWhere when I say</p>
<p>'No'.</p>  </div>
