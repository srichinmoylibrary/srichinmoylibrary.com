<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am so grateful. Nothing gives me greater joy than to be of dedicated service to you. Both of you have extremely beautiful souls, devoted, spiritual souls. You are serving God the Supreme, and I am also serving the Supreme. Here I have been doing something and you have been doing something. We are members of the same family. If I kept my capacity only for myself and if you kept your capacity only for yourselves, then we couldn't become one. When we unite our capacities, then only is God pleased with us.</p>
<p><em>Journalist:</em> Thank you very much.</p>  </div>
