<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God-realisation means the realisation of one's own Self. When you realise your highest Self, you will know that you are nothing other than God. According to our Indian philosophy, "As many men, so many gods." What does this mean? You may think that it means there are innumerable gods who take care of human beings, and that the gods are infinitely superior to human beings and have to look after them. But it does not mean that. The ancient Hindus, when they said, "As many men, so many gods," meant that each person is God. But each person is not consciously aware of this. When he becomes divinely aware of what he is and what he stands for, he knows automatically and spontaneously that he is nothing other than God. God and he are absolutely one both in the inner life and in the outer life.</p>  </div>
