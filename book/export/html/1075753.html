<p><em>(Baroda. Sri Aurobindo's residence. Morning. Sri Aurobindo still in bed. Enter Barin in soiled and ragged clothes.)</em></p>
<p>AURO: Who is there?</p>
<p>BARIN: Sejda, it is I, Barin.</p>
<p>AURO: O my goodness, how is it that you are in this state? Go into the bathroom and wash up.</p>
<p>BARIN: Sejda, I have come ...</p>
<p>AURO: Ah, you are so impossible. Go straight into the bathroom. I'll listen to you afterwards.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Barin.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Sri Aurobindo sits up on the cot. Enter Sarojini, his sister.)</em></p>
<p>SARO: Sejda, Bari is come. Has he met you? Where is he gone?</p>
<p>AURO: He is in the bathroom.</p>
<p>SARO: Bari is very spirited. I am sure he will do much for the country. But, Sejda, he is not at all sweet towards me in his conduct.</p>
<p>AURO: But I am sweet to you. Am I not?</p>
<p>SARO: I know, it is useless to tell you anything against anybody. You simply take it very lightly. And you never realise your indifference cuts me to the quick.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Barin, clean and tidy.)</em></p>
<p>AURO: Bari, Saro has a severe complaint against you.</p>
<p>BARIN: Didi's complaint! Has she anyone on earth whom she loves more than me?</p>
<p>SARO: Very clever you are. Truth to tell, I hate you for your rude behaviour.</p>
<p>BARIN: Didi, you may hate Sj. Barindra Kumar Ghosh. But to hate your youngest brother Bari is beyond you. Sejda, do you believe that she looks down upon me?</p>
<p>AURO: I can't think so. Saro, I am sorry that you have lost to Bari. And, I believe your surrender will be complete if you give him a cup of tea and a hot cake.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Mrinalini Devi with tea and sweets)</em></p>
<p>SARO: <em>(In excitement)</em> Ah, Baudi, you have come to my rescue. These two brothers are simply torturing me.</p>
<p><em>(Mrinalini Devi gives a smile.)</em></p>
<p>BARIN: Now, Didi, allow me to have a serious talk with Sejda.</p>
<p>SARO: Who forbids you? But, mind you, neither Baudi nor I am going to leave the room.</p>
<p>BARIN: No harm. Sejda, it is you who have infused into me the revolutionary spirit. Now you must tell me how to begin the revolutionary work. I can brook no delay.</p>
<p>AURO: You need not. That auspicious moment is well-nigh come.</p>  </div>
