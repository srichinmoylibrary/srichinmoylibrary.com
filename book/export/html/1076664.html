<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the cow sees something within its own boundary, it simply destroys it. I have seen it many times. If you leave some toy or something nice near it, the cow just destroys it. I was just giving an analogy to show the sort of things we do with our limited freedom. So, here the cow is destructive. I am not saying that we are cows, but I am saying that we are acting like cows. God has given us freedom to go high, very high, but we are not using our freedom in a divine way. As I was saying about the knife, He has given us freedom to do whatever we want to do with the knife. But we are stabbing each other instead of doing something good with the knife. The knife is the instrument that is freedom. That He has given. But how are we using it?</p>
<p>Again, if we do the right thing, immediately the Divine within us, the Liberator within us, liberates us. It is like filling a jar. Drop by drop we can fill it. We say, "Oh, it will not do it. It is only a tiny insignificant drop." But, drop by drop, we can fill the whole jar. Similarly, we started our journey many, many hundreds of years ago and from the very beginning, unfortunately, we started walking in a wrong direction. That is why it has become so difficult. But if we, again, slowly and steadily run towards the Goal, then the Goal cannot deny us. We have to reach our Goal which is light, through light itself.</p>  </div>
