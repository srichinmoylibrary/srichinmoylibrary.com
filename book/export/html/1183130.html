<p>Why don't You scold me, my Lord?<br /> Is it because I am perfect?<br /> "Either you are perfect or<br /> You are going to be perfect."</p>
<p>Why do You love me most, my Lord?<br /> Is it because I am perfect?<br /> "Either you are perfect or<br /> You are going to be perfect."</p>
<p>Why do I think of You all the time,<br /> my Lord,<br /> Is it because I am perfect?<br /> "You think of Me all the time<br /> Not because you are perfect,<br /> Not because you are one day<br /> going to be perfect,<br /> But because I think of you all the time."</p>
