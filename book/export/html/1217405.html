  <h1 class="book-heading">Part II — Aphorisms</h1>
  
 <p></p>
<h2>1</h2>

<p>A prophet says to humanity, "Wake up!"</p>
<p>Humanity immediately says to the prophet, "Shut up!"</p>
<p>The prophet says, "O humanity, I am asking you to wake up for your own good."</p>
<p>Humanity says, "O prophet, I am asking you to shut up for your own good. If you shut up, you can take rest. If you take rest, you will get better thoughts, better ideas and better ideals. So, for your sake, for your own good, I am asking you to shut up."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217447" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2</h1>
  
 
<p>Love divine is the Truth supreme practised in the life of aspiration.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217448" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3</h1>
  
 
<p>The life of desire is the temporary defeat of the soul on the unreality-shore of the Life-River.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217449" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4</h1>
  
 
<p>When attachment is taken away from the mind, what remains is the mind's glowing purification.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217450" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5</h1>
  
 
<p>I had a bitter quarrel with God. Many a time He has come to make up, but my ire has not allowed me to be on good terms with Him. To Him I have said, "God, you have made me the man in the moon, but I wish to be a man of the earth." No answer have I heard from Him.</p>
<p>At last I now comprehend the meaning of His Silence. When evil things torture me, I must in no time become the man in the moon. And when ignorance rises to dominate me, forthwith I must be a man of the earth.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217451" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6</h1>
  
 
<p>What is penury? Penury is the fulfilment of desires. The more we slake the thirst of desires, the bigger becomes our insatiable hunger.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217452" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7</h1>
  
 
<p>My heart is credulous. My mind is a typical doubting Thomas. I am moved to tears at the pitiable condition of these two partners. I wish to be nothing else save an unerring judge.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217453" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8</h1>
  
 
<p>Our heart is ingenuous. Our mind is ingenious. Our body is ignorant. Our eyes are infants. Our vital is a roaring tiger. Our soul is an orphan. With its birth, its parents have thrown it down to earth from the pinnacled sphere to found the Life Divine upon the clay with the assistance of the heart, mind, vital, body and senses.</p>
<p>Alas, except for the heart, all the members of our family look down upon the soul and say, "O fool and beggar, away you go to your own clime! No need have we of you. We are quite content with this sweet earth of ours." Alas, the true ruler is ruled by its eyeless pigmy subjects.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217454" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9</h1>
  
 
<p>Tears flow down our cheeks when our dear ones are gathered to our fathers. But we forget the truth that our fathers, too, had to suffer much when their dear ones were in the land of the living.</p>
<p>What is death after all? It is but one shore of the sea of Consciousness. The other shore is life. The sole work of life is to sow and the sole work of death is to reap. Both are interdependent.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217455" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10</h1>
  
 
<p>Do what you can. Don't try to do what you can't. But if you don't do what you can, your present poverty will never dive into the sea of future affluence.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217456" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11</h1>
  
 
<p>How to serve a man most effectively? With money? Not sufficient. With joy? Not sufficient. With any other belonging of the earth? Not sufficient.</p>
<p>Then what is it that can help a man truly and effectively? It is inner concern. Inner concern is the only offering that has no equal. If you can serve a man with inner concern, matchless will be your assistance.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217457" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12</h1>
  
 
<p>What is the difference between desire and surrender? Desire is a beggar; surrender is a king.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217458" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13</h1>
  
 
<p>There are two fruits: one silence, the other din. The wise pine for the former; the ignorant long for the latter. Those who dwell in silence say that the world is not a dream; it is a self-assertive reality. Those who are devoured by din say that the world is more transitory than a rope of sand. Both parties are adamant in their assertions.</p>
<p>A terrible dispute arose between my heart and my mind over who was right. According to my heart, silence is far superior to din. According to my mind, silence is no match for din. They made me the judge. As I was ignorant of the truth, I went to my soul with a tremulous tongue.</p>
<p>My soul consoled me and said, "Your heart is the pinnacle of wisdom and your mind is the abyss of ignorance. I give you two seeds. One is Immortality, the other is transformation. Sow the first seed in your heart and the second in your mind. In no time, you will find that their terrible fight will end in a fond embrace."</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217459" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14</h1>
  
 
<p>Desires are synonymous with clouds. The clouds can hide the sun but can never destroy it. As the outer sun bursts forth from the clouds at a selected moment, so also the inner sun emerges from the clouds of desire at God's choice Hour.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217460" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15</h1>
  
 
<p>I will tell you whom to hate. Hate him only who thinks ill of himself. Sorry, don't hate him, but hate his folly.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217461" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16</h1>
  
 
<p>God's child is sincerity. Doom's issue is insincerity. Sincerity and insincerity are ever at daggers drawn. Apparently both are equally formidable.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217462" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17</h1>
  
 
<p>Alas! My soul has been stolen away. Desire, the thief, is in collusion with my mind. In vain I thrashed them soundly, but the more I beat them the louder became their laughter.</p>
<p>O Lord and God, my power is ignorance; Yours is Knowledge. I have fought with You many a time and every time I have come off second best. This time I am sure that I shall bear away the palm of victory. My immaculate gratitude will compel Your Grace to fight with Your iron Law. I know the stronger of the two is Your Grace. All problems will be solved when I have Your Grace as my Guide.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217463" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18</h1>
  
 
<p>What irony of fate! Our soul, part of the Divine, is now subject to non-divine powers. Its indomitable spirit is now suppressed by the feeblest mortal.</p>  </div>

<p>We are between Scylla and Charybdis. The murky vital belabours us when we care for God. And when we care for the lurid vital, the Grace of God eludes us.</p>  </div>

  <h1 class="book-heading">22</h1>
  
 
<p>My Lord, I believe in You, but I turn a deaf ear to Your Commands. I have no belief in Death, but I am ever aware of Death's commands. And what is worse, I blindly carry out his behests. O Author of all Good, truly this is for me an insoluble mystery.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217468" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23</h1>
  
 
<p>The best friend of prosperity is veracity. The worse foe of prosperity is mendacity.</p>
<p>Veracity is the fondest child of conscience. Mendacity is the spoiled child of nescience.</p>
<p>The journey of the first child will end only when it sees the face of perpetual creation. The journey of the second will cease only when it sees the face of utter destruction.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217469" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24</h1>
  
 
<p>Look at our stupidity! When the gods descend from the high heavens onto this earth full of evils, they do not become objects of contempt. But when we go down a little, the respect others have for us in no time dies.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217470" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25</h1>
  
 
<p>My soul was fired with boundless zeal when my heart, mind and vital agreed to help it establish the Life Divine upon earth. Alas, heart, mind and vital lost their resolve when they failed in their first attempt. Now the poor soul alone endeavours to fulfil its mission. When it is victorious, I am sure, the treacherous and unabashed heart, mind and vital will rush to exult in the victory.</p>  </div>
<div id="node-1217471" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">26</h1>
  
 
<p>Death there is and needs must be when I am a synonym for my body. Death nowhere; no need have I of it, when I am synonymous with my inner Bird.</p>  </div>
