<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> Please tell me why You have<br /> An unlisted number.<br /> "My child,<br /> It is a top secret,<br /> But anyhow I am telling you.<br /> Both Heaven and earth bother me<br /> Like anything.<br /> I am totally sick of them.<br /> Every day Heaven has to invite me<br /> To participate in its birth anniversaries,<br /> And every day earth has to invite me<br /> To participate in its death anniversaries.<br /> I am totally sick of them,<br /> And therefore I don't allow them<br /> To call me whenever they want to.<br /> Whenever I want to call them<br /> And bless them and illumine them,<br /> I do call.<br /> This is the only reason<br /> Why I have an unlisted number."</p>
