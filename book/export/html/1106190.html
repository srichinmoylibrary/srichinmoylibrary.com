<p>About a month ago, I tried so hard to move the 400-pound weight, even on the same level. I could not move it at all.</p>
<p>I was telling the Supreme, “You always cut jokes with me. Now I am cutting jokes with You.”</p>
<p>Now I have made such fast progress from 300 to 400. It is all due to confidence and also the fact that my muscle power has increased — which means my receptivity to God’s Compassion and God’s Grace has increased.</p>
<p>Exactly one month ago, on Agraha’s birthday, I lifted double my body weight, 320. Today I have done 80 pounds more — 400. But I don’t think I have gained 80 pounds!</p>
