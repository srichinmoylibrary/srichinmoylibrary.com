<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They may come to one person in a dream and try to attack him while in the case of another person they may attack in his waking hours when he is walking or driving a car. In the case of a third person they may attack during the time of meditation. Hostile forces are very clever. They attack when our own weaknesses are coming to the fore.</p>  </div>
