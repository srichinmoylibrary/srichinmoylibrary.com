<p>My Lord,<br /> I am seriously angry with You.<br /> I do not need Your Power.<br /> “What else, My child?”<br /> I do not need Your Love.<br /> “What else, My child?”<br /> I do not need Your Compassion.</p>
<p>“What else, My child?”<br /> I do not need Your Attention.<br /> “What else, My child?”<br /> My Lord,<br /> Truth to tell,<br /> I do not need anything from You.</p>
<p>“My child,<br /> Is your exceptionally powerful sermon over?” Yes, my Lord.<br /> “My child,<br /> My pithy Sermon begins.<br /> Just because you do not need anything<br /> From Me,<br /> That does not mean<br /> That I am not entitled<br /> To have anything from you.</p>
<p>In no way you can prevent Me<br /> From desiring things from you.<br /> I need your affection.<br /> I need your sweetness.<br /> I need your fondness.”<br /> My Lord,<br /> As I do not need anything from You,<br /> Even so, You have to be fully prepared<br /> To live<br /> All by Yourself.</p>
<p>“My child,<br /> You are My Eternity’s Heart.<br /> You are My Immortality’s Breath.<br /> You want to play the role<br /> Of your volcano-anger.<br /> I want to play the role<br /> Of My Forgiveness-Fountain.”</p>
