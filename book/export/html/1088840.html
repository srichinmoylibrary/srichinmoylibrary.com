<p>Food has God. God is food.</p>
<p>Food has life. God is life.</p>
<p>Food has reality. God is reality.</p>
<p>Food has sound-success.</p>
<p>God is sound-success.</p>
<p>Food has silence-progress.</p>
<p>God is silence-progress.</p>
<p>I eat. I eat to survive. From my very birth I have been seeking nourishment. Food saves my life from starvation. Food saves my life from extinction.</p>
<p>Mine is the hunger that does not permit me to think soulfully.</p>
<p>Mine is the hunger that does not permit me to act selflessly.</p>
<p>Mine is the hunger that does not permit me to pray to God constantly.</p>
<p>Mine is the hunger that does not permit me to meditate spontaneously.</p>
<p>Mine is the hunger that does not permit me to love God unconditionally.</p>
<p>I know my food-hunger is reasonable and inevitable. But my power-hunger is unreasonable and unpardonable. Finally, my God-hunger is incomparable and insurmountable.</p>
<p>To my great sorrow, poverty attacks plenty. To my widest astonishment, plenty invades poverty. One of the lofty principles of the United Nations is: "Poverty anywhere in the world is a threat to prosperity everywhere." Indeed, this is a heart-unifying and life-fulfilling message. The United Nations was founded upon the vision-hunger for world peace. I am sure there shall come a time when that vision will be transformed into reality in spite of today's teeming, threatening and frightening clouds over the firmament of the United Nations.</p>
<p>O body, I tell you a supreme secret: "Shortage is poverty."</p>
<p>O vital, I tell you a supreme secret: "Rivalry is poverty."</p>
<p>O mind, I tell you a supreme secret: "Doubt is poverty."</p>
<p>O heart, I tell you a supreme secret: "Insecurity is poverty."</p>
<p>O life, I tell you a supreme secret: "Impurity is poverty."</p>
<p>O truth-seeker, I tell you a supreme secret: "Disobedience is poverty."</p>
<p>O God-lover, I tell you a supreme secret: "Ingratitude is poverty."</p>
<p>I eat to live. Indeed, this is my wisdom-light. I live to eat. Indeed, this is my ignorance-night.</p>
<p>God says to my desire-life: "Love to live." God says to my aspiration-life: "Live to love." God says to my realisation-life: "Love to become a oneness-heart. Live to be a perfection-life."</p>
