<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on you. If you are able to meditate for more than fifteen minutes, then please do so. But it has to be absolutely sincere and soulful. To sit for an hour just to show that you can meditate for an hour will be a mistake. The soul will not be there. You may meditate for five hours, but the meditation will not give you any joy. It will not be fruitful at all. If a person can meditate for fifteen minutes most soulfully, and after that, if he feels that he has the capacity to continue, then he can continue. But if he doesnâ€™t have the capacity and just wants to make himself feel that he can meditate for an hour, it will be a waste of time. In your case, I know your capacity. You can easily meditate for more than fifteen minutes. Without any difficulty you can meditate for half an hour. After that you can stop. Certainly you can meditate for more than fifteen minutes.</p>  </div>
