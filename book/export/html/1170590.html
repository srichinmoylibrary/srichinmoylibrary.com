<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we enter into the spiritual life, sometimes it happens that the hostile forces attack us more vehemently. We enter into the spiritual life to become one with God's Will. Then the forces attack us and say, "We will not allow you." God tells us, "You now want to become consciously one with Me. Then prove that you need My Love only." So we pray and meditate and God inundates us with His Compassion and His Grace to fight against these hostile forces.</p>
<p>The last time when you told us that you could not come to the meeting that we had scheduled, I had such a feeling for your soul. I saw in the inner world that your soul wanted to come. I said, "How is it that the mind is not listening to the heart and soul?"</p>
<p><em>Dr. Davis:</em> You reached out at the time when I really needed to come. But it was like an avalanche of crises that I had to deal with. So today when my assistant came in and said, "Sri Chinmoy is inviting you, but I know you cannot go," I said, "No, I will be there." When he mentioned your name, I said that I would cancel everything.</p>
<p>When I started practising meditation, I used to go to religious book stores and pick up the books you had written. I knew your name when I was in Georgia and Minnesota. Without knowing you, I was reading your books. When I learnt that you live in New York, I was just amazed. I said, "Sri Chinmoy is in Jamaica, New York! I do not believe this!" I was thinking one would have to go to the Himalayas to see you.</p>
<p>This meeting tonight is spiritual food for me. Whenever we begin trying to do something with the spirit, we let the mind take over and we say, "Am I doing the right thing? Should I give up and go on?" A meeting like this says, "You are doing the right thing." Now I have confirmation.</p>  </div>
