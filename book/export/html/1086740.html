<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one earth, but what we call outer space is not the entire boundary of God. God is infinite and His Infinity has far surpassed this outer space.</p>
<p>Has God been there forever? Certainly God has been there forever, and He will Always be there. He will be everywhere forever.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>I am telling you a great secret: you are a fantastic Dream of God</em>, Agni Press, 1974<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/gsdg-30</p></small>    </div>  </body>
