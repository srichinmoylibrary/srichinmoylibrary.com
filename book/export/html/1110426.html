<p>One’s puny ego is the worst possible foe of love. Therefore, the poet in Tagore in lamentation cries out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I came out alone on my way to my tryst. But who is this that follows me in the silent dark? . . .</p>
<p>He is my own little self, my Lord, he knows no shame; but I am ashamed to come to thy door in his company.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again in one of his letters he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Egoism is the price paid for the fact of existence.”</p>
</blockquote>  </div>
