<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fear can come into existence for various reasons. But the main reason, absolutely the main reason, is a sense of separativity. If I feel you as my own, my very own, then I will not be afraid of you, no matter how strong or powerful you are. A child is not afraid of her father’s strength. No matter how strong he is, the child is not afraid of her father because she has established an inner oneness with her father. She claims her father’s strength as her own. Even if she does not obey him, she knows that her father is not going to strike her. When we have a sense of separativity, then we may have fear. This is the real cause of fear.</p>  </div>
