<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They are not larger than human beings. Some are tall, some are short. But in the subtle world, angels can be six feet or ten feet tall. Usually, baby angels are three feet tall. Baby angels are very cute. They grow usually. By nature, angels are not fat. Angels are always beautiful. The Archangels, in terms of spirituality, are more important because some of them enter into the field of creation and manifestation.</p>  </div>
