<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They do not have to go together at all. The one has nothing to do with the other. Inner devotion does not have to be displayed in outer gestures. Devotion is something pure and deep inside your heart. At the same time, if you have pure devotion, then in most cases outwardly you will also behave well. There will be a balanced life. If one has genuine devotion, then outwardly one will be very humble. And if we can see goodness in others, that will also help us to improve our devotion.</p>  </div>
