<p><em>Yogi:</em> Your dear deer cannot bear the odour of your self-deception and self-annihilation. Therefore I have kept your deer safe inside God's heart. When you are totally free from self-deception and self-annihilation, I shall give you back your deer so that you can smell the perfume of your inner musk devotedly and unreservedly.</p>  </div>
