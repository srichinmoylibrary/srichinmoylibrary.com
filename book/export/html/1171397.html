<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are desperately trying to feel God's Presence in your life, you have to feel how much sincerity is involved, how much purity of mind is involved. If purity of mind is involved when you are desperately trying to achieve something or stop doing something, then the patience-seed will automatically be planted inside you.</p>
<p>Your heart's sincerity and your mind's purity will give you the amount of patience that you need. When you desperately need something, and if patience is needed, automatically your sincerity and purity will tell you whether it will take ten days or twenty days or two months. At that time, you do not have to use the word 'patience'. If sincerity is involved, if purity is involved, then you do not have to worry, even if it takes two years to conquer your problem.</p>  </div>
