<p>There was a great sage named Badanya. Ashtabakra, a great scholar and authority on the Vedas, wanted to marry Badanya's daughter, Suprabha, who was extremely beautiful. Ashtabakra was enamoured of her beauty. But Badanya would not agree to this marriage.</p>
<p>Finally he said to Ashtabakra, "You go to the Himalayas. There you will see an elderly woman praying and meditating. If she is satisfied with you, then I will allow you to marry my daughter."</p>
<p>Ashtabakra went to the Himalayas and saw the elderly lady praying and meditating there. He became her guest. She watched his life to see whether he was good, kind, spiritual and so forth. She also wanted to see if he could be assailed by temptation, or if he had self-control. Although she was quite advanced in years, with her spiritual powers she had the ability to take the form of a very young and most attractive woman. Even when the elderly lady became young and very beautiful, he was not interested in her. He prayed and meditated beside her, all the time thinking of Suprabha, his future wife. Ashtabakra and the elderly lady were very good to each other.</p>
<p>One day she said, "Now you go back to Suprabha's father, Badanya. I will tell him that you are faithful only to Suprabha. Your sincerity has moved me. Therefore, you deserve her. You go."</p>
<p>He went to Badanya. Badanya said, "I am very pleased with your love for my daughter and your true sincere concern for her. Your interest and faithfulness have pleased me. I give Suprabha to you."</p>
<p>Ashtabakra and Suprabha went back to Ashtabakra's home. All were flooded with tremendous joy.</p>
