<p>The young Naren loved and admired God-lovers and wanted to become one himself. To many God-lovers and even God-preachers he went with one solitary question: “Have you seen God?” Alas, the answer was always in the negative, which broke Vivekananda’s God-hungry heart. However, sincerity and precious advice he did receive from Maharshi Devendranath, Tagore’s father. When the same question was asked of him, Devendranath said to young Naren: “I have not seen God. Pray and meditate soulfully. God you will definitely realise in this lifetime. My boy, you already possess the eyes of a yogi.”</p>  </div>
