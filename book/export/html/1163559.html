<p>Death, I do not deny<br /> That I have badly disappointed you.<br /> I have been delaying and delaying my arrival.<br /> But you can easily forgive me<br /> Because my mother,<br /> My father, my brother,<br /> My sister and many<br /> Bosom friends of mine<br /> Have committed suicide.<br /> They came to you;<br /> They entered into your Hall<br /> Long before they were due.<br /> I am sure their early arrival<br /> Can stand against my late arrival.</p>
<p>"You fool, they came in<br /> Before I had invited them.<br /> They were unpardonable intruders.<br /> Never do I forgive such intruders,<br /> Nor does God forgive these life-takers.<br /> I have thrown<br /> The members of your family<br /> And your friends<br /> Into the lowest hell,<br /> Far below your imagination's flight.<br /> Ceaseless torture<br /> Has embraced them.</p>
<p>"I give you my first and last<br /> Piece of advice:<br /> Never take your life away,<br />        Never!</p>
<p>"Although in your case the time has<br />  already expired,<br /> And in spite of my immediate need<br /> And demand for your presence,<br /> I am ready to wait for you<br />        Indefinitely!"</p>
