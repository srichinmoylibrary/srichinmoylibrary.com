<p>On the plane from Bangkok to India, I was being blessed by children, as usual!</p>
<p>Just in front and to my right there was a woman with a little child. At first the child was fast asleep on her shoulder. But the mother wanted to show her fondness, so she was lifting up the child and massaging his shoulders very hard. Then, of course, the child woke up and started crying.</p>
<p>Then another child began crying right near me. He was with his mother two seats away. I was on the aisle and next to me was a middle-aged man. The child and his mother were next to the man.</p>
