<p>Two days ago I went to buy some birds at a pet store in Queens. A few years ago I used to go to that store very often, but I have not been there recently.</p>
<p>While I was looking at two birds, Databir told the owner about my 7,000-pound one-arm lift and gave the man a poster.</p>
<p>Finally, I bought the two birds. When I came up to the man to pay, he said, "You look 20 years younger than when I last saw you. Now you are so strong!"</p>
