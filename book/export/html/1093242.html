<h2>My brother's birth</h2>

<p>My brother Chitta was born on August 16th, 1914. Actually, he was born just after midnight of the fifteenth. In India, when somebody is born before the morning of the following day, we may give that person's birth date as the day before. To us, it is still part of the same day. But in Chitta's case, because August 15th is Sri Aurobindo's birthday, his birthday came to be celebrated on the 16th.</p>
<p>My brother was not an ordinary human being. He was a really great soul. In his previous incarnation, he had been Sri Ramakrishna's direct disciple. Then he came into our family and he became my strongest admirer. Only a great soul can recognise another great soul.</p>  </div>
