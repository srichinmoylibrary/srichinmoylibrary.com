<p>I have fooled away too much<br /> Of God's time.<br /> But He does not mind.<br /> I have fooled away too much<br /> Of God's Love and Concern.<br /> But He does not mind.<br /> Needless to say, I mind.<br /> Why?<br /> I could have become another God<br /> By this time<br /> If I had not fooled away<br /> His time, Love and Concern.<br /> I could have given Him a short vacation.<br /> Poor God! He never gets any vacation.</p>
