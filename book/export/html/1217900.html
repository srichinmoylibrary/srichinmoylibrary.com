 <p>
AUM 259-264. These questions were put to Sri Chinmoy by Indrani (Mrs. Barbara Callen).</p>
<h2>Question: When one sees through the light of the soul, does he see through hundreds of lifetimes?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When one sees through the light of the soul, one can see the future possibilities of one's present incarnation and at the most, one or two future incarnations, not hundreds of lifetimes. This statement applies to past incarnations as well. These glimpses need not be in any chronological order. However, in the cases of great spiritual masters like Krishna and Buddha, this principle is not applicable, for the remotest past and the farthest future, in exact chronological order, is at their command.</p>  </div>
