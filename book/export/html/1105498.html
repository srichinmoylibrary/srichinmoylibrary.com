<p>Raining cats and dogs!<br /> I entered into a drug store,<br /> enquired if umbrellas were sold.<br /> An old lady, the owner-I am sure<br /> she has already seen eighty summers-<br /> with a smile, said: "Sorry, no!<br /> No umbrella. My umbrella you take.<br /> I go home, no rain."</p>
<p>I declined her kindest offer.<br /> She insisted.<br /> She made at least ten sincere requests.<br /> Finally I surrendered.<br /> She gave me her own rain protection.<br /> I gave her 100 yen. She refused adamantly.<br /> "No money. Gift, my gift.<br /> Go home!"</p>
<p>Perhaps the flow of my doleful gratitude<br /> pierced her heart. She changed her mind.<br /> Smiling, she took the money from me and<br /> gave me three beautiful handkerchiefs in<br /> return.</p>
<p>On the morrow the rain ceased.<br /> I entered into a shop to buy a suitcase.<br /> I saw the shop selling umbrellas, too.<br /> Soon I came to discover<br /> the price of umbrellas.<br /> The one the old lady with the gold heart had<br /> given me was worth 460 yen.<br /> This time I prayed to God<br /> to thank her on my behalf.<br /> God did listen to my prayer.</p>
