<p>My ascetic-fanatic friend says:<br /> The first thing I do,<br /> Let me kill all the singers.<br /> They have no right<br /> To destroy my Lord's Ears.</p>
<p>The second thing I do,<br /> Let me kill all the dancers.<br /> They have no right<br /> To destroy my Lord's Eyes.</p>
<p>The third thing I do,<br /> Let me kill all the loud God-worshippers.<br /> They have no right<br /> To destroy my Lord's Silence-Peace.</p>
