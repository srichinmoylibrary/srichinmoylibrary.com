<p>Before I was born, my brother Chitta had a number of dreams that my mother would give birth to a great soul. He was only sixteen years old at the time. When he told my mother, she said, "Perhaps Lord Krishna has sent his dearest devotee into our simple, humble and prayerful family."</p>
<p>But Chitta felt that the child she was carrying would be not just a devotee of Lord Krishna but a spiritual soul of the highest magnitude. That was my brother's prediction.</p>  </div>
