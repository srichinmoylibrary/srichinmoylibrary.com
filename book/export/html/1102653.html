<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you say that those who enter into the Himalayan caves and neglect society will find less difficulty in realising God, I may agree with you. But if they do not accept humanity, what do they ultimately gain? If I love God, my Father, and if I see that my brothers and sisters cannot yet approach Him, if I am a good person, what will I do? I will offer my light and my achievement to my brothers and sisters.</p>
