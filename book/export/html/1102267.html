    <title>&lt;em&gt;Dr. Robert Muller:&lt;/em&gt; Anthropologists have found a gradation of religious beliefs over the history of mankind: ritualism, animism, ancestor worship, polytheism, monotheism. All these forms were associated with changes in the social structure. Recently, the &amp;quot;age of reason&amp;quot; and the scientific and industrial revolution have rendered religion and spirituality obsolete, even harmful, in the eyes of many. What, in your view, is likely to be the religion or spirituality of humanity tomorrow as a satisfactory answer to man&#039;s queries about his relationships with the universe, his fellow men and the mysteries of life? And will this be reflected in the United Nations as a forum where humanity is seeking new ways for its destiny and fulfilment?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spirituality of tomorrow will not be the merciless rejection of life. The spirituality of tomorrow will be the devoted acceptance of life and the pure dissemination of the seeker's self-giving breath in order that he may become a God-blossoming beauty within and without.</p>
<p>Here I am tempted to share with the rest of the world your most illumining ideas and most nourishing thoughts: "Indeed, how can we reach full consciousness and enlightenment if we do not let the entire world and humanity enter ourselves? Humility and the lowering of one's ego lead in the end to righteousness, happiness and the full mastery over oneself, enriched by the thoughts, dreams and feelings of others. Together with meditation, it is perhaps the clue to serenity in our bewildered, complex world. U Thant was a living proof of it."</p>
<p>The spirituality of tomorrow's dawn will beckon the aspiration-world to show humanity that real satisfaction looms large only in the heart's inner cry. The real spirituality of tomorrow's dawn will beckon the realisation-world to show humanity that real satisfaction lies only in the seeker's unconditionally surrendered oneness with his Source, his Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>The blind world can be sceptical of the reality or it can deny the reality when the reality is just a tiny flame. But when the reality grows into the all-illumining sun, even the stone blind must feel and accept it because of its scorching heat and loving warmth. Today's United Nations-divinity-flame can be denied or challenged, but tomorrow's United Nations-divinity-sun shall give sight to the blind, legs to the lame and voice to the voiceless. It shall mark the slow, steady and unerring beginning of man's quenchless satisfaction in God and God's breathless Satisfaction in man.</p>  </div>
