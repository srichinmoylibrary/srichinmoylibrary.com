<p>Nolini-da said to me: "Go and call Bishwabani."</p>
<p>I called Bishwabani, who was working at the Samadhi. Nolini-da very compassionately asked her to sit on the chair which was usually used by Ranju-da. Then he gave her a letter to read and went upstairs. Bishwabani read the letter and started crying most pitifully. I went to Amrita-da immediately and asked him what to do. "Shall I call a few girls her own age to console her?"</p>
<p>Amrita-da said: "That will not help much. Let us invoke the Mother's love for Bishwabani. It is Her love alone that will console her. Human consolation is useless. It is getting late. Go to the bank with the bankbooks."</p>  </div>
