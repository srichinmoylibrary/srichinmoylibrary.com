<h2>I.</h2>

<p>Two month ago, I visited two Avatar-Friends of mine in heaven. Both of them were exceedingly delighted to see me, because for a long time I had not been in touch with them, owing to my heavy pressure of work on earth.</p>
<p>They said to me, "What have you brought for us from earth?"</p>
<p>I said to them, "What do you want from earth? I shall give you anything you want of earth."</p>
<p>They said, "Give us earth's gratitude. Give as, at least, earth's aspiration."</p>
<p>I said, "Give me your heaven's forgiveness, I shall give you my earth's gratitude. Give me your heaven's concern, I shall give you my earth's aspiration."</p>
<p>They said, "Earth does not deserve heaven's forgiveness and concern."</p>
<p>I said, "In that case, heaven does not deserve earth's gratitude and aspiration."</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the Supreme came in. He said, "Here is My assessment of earth and heaven:</p>
<p>Earth is good.<br />Heaven is great.<br />I need earth.<br />But heaven needs Me."</p>
<p>I said to the Supreme, "Father and Mother of mine, why do You always take my side? What do others think of You? Do they not think that You are partial to me?"</p>
<p>"The more they think that I am partial to you, My Son, the more I get the opportunity to enjoy your unconditionally surrendered breath."</p>
<p>"Father, it is not I who have surrendered to Your Transcendental Light, but it is Your Light that has surrendered to my ignorance-sea."</p>
<p>"It is all the same. I have you and you have Me. What more do We need?"</p>
<p>"Father, my life is Your Consolation. My life is Your Compassion."</p>
<p>"No, My Son, your life is My Concern. Your life is My Manifestation."</p>  </div>
