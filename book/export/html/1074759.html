<p>There was a time<br />   When I<br /> Was a dreamer of dreams.<br /> But now I am a lover of realities.</p>
<p>There was a time<br />   When I<br /> Killed God with my venom-doubts.<br /> But now I kill God<br /> With my love-fire.</p>
<p>There was a time<br />   When I<br /> Was ignorant of the life of nectar-sea.<br /> But now I have become<br /> Within and without<br /> Infinity's Nectar-Sea.</p>
