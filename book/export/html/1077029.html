<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on the seeker’s necessity. If the seeker needs a dream in order to inspire him to go deep within or to go far beyond the mind, then dreams are of paramount importance. Divine dreams, spiritual dreams, do play a considerable role in one’s spiritual life. Also, we have to know that everything is a dream before it is manifested in the world of reality. If we value a reality, then we have to value the dream as well. But this does not mean that we have to have thousands and millions of dreams in order to have God-realisation. No! If we have a few significant dreams, that is more than enough. Even if we do not have any dreams, that will not stand in our way.</p>
<p>But there is not a single human being on earth who has not had any dreams.</p>  </div>
