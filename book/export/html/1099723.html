<p>The day my father died, he told my brother, "Give me anything you want me to eat." For quite a few days he had not eaten, and everybody was very concerned about him. But on the day he left the body, he told them to give him whatever they wanted him to eat.</p>
<p>One of my father's very close friends was Govinda Das. On the day he died, my father said, "I am leaving. He is going to follow me very soon." His prophecy proved correct. A few days later Govinda Das also left the body.</p>  </div>
