<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Human beings who cherish darkness are responsible. Very often we cherish darkness. Someone tells us, "That movie is very bad." Then the next day we go and see it. We claim that we want to improve the world, yet we contribute to its undivine qualities.</p>
<p>Until perfect Perfection dawns on earth, God's Vision will not be completely manifested. God's Vision can be transformed into His Reality only when the earth-consciousness is totally transformed. In order to transform the earth-consciousness, man has to aspire physically, vitally, mentally, psychically and spiritually.</p>  </div>
