<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are making a serious mistake. Your problem is not manifestation. Manifestation is not creating any problem for you. Manifestation is creating a problem for another disciple. He has some misunderstanding about our manifestation. In your case, you are dying to manifest the Supreme in me, only you are not getting the opportunity to manifest, to meet people. Your problem is totally different. His problem is that he is unable to accept our manifestation. You have fully accepted it, only you don't have ample opportunity. You are crying to manifest; you are dying to have a good Centre, but nobody is helping you. You do appreciate, admire, adore and need manifestation, only you are not getting the right people. That is why you are suffering. You are not getting the right people to open up a good Centre.</p>
<p>So in your case, I sympathise with you. We are in the same boat. You don't have the right instruments and I also don't have the right instruments. Your case is different from his. Manifestation is not confusing you, only you are not getting the right people to help you out.</p>  </div>
