<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have a human ego and a divine ego. The divine ego is called our inseparable oneness with the universal consciousness. In the divine ego our 'i' becomes universal; we become larger than the individual self and establish a feeling of oneness with everyone. When you meditate, if the ego comes forward, then feel that you are the universal 'I' instead of the little 'i'.</p>  </div>
