<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I give money to someone, it is material power. It has to be used properly. Some Masters are very reluctant to receive money or give money, because they feel that money is nothing but a hostile force. I say that money is not a hostile force. Money is like a knife. As an instrument, money can either be a divine or an undivine instrument. It entirely depends on the purpose the individual uses it for. With a knife I can stab someone, or I can cut some fruit and share it with others. Money as such is not a hostile force, but when it is not properly used it becomes a problem.</p>
<p>When I give money to someone, I feel that that person definitely needs it, and I expect him to use it properly, in a divine way. When I give money, it is a form of blessing, and I expect these blessings to be utilised properly.</p>  </div>
