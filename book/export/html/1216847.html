<p>While I was on the plane to Puerto Rico, one man said to the stewardess, "Today is my friend's birthday."</p>
<p>The stewardess said, "Really?"</p>
<p>The man said, "Yes!"</p>
<p>Then four or five of the airline crew brought out a cake, although the man's name was not on the cake.</p>
<p>I didn't know they observed birthdays on airplanes.</p>
<p>â€” 15 February 1984</p>  </div>
