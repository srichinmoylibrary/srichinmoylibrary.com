<p>This particular lady wanted to have a special interview with the Master. In those days the Master had very few disciples, and he was more than willing to grant interviews. Now, however, the story is totally different. But the day this lady wanted to have an interview with the Master, God knows why the Master did not want to see her. During that evening’s meditation, a sister of the Master who was in Heaven came down to the Master and pleaded with him to grant an interview to this particular seeker. But the Master did not want to grant the interview because he knew that he had quite a few important things to do in the next few days.</p>
<p>The Master’s sister scolded the Master and said, “You have to do it. This is my request and command. You have to give the interview.” She said that this particular woman had a special connection with her and when the time came for this seeker to become the Master’s disciple, she should be given the same name as hers. Sister’s demand and sister’s command the Master had to follow.</p>
<p>The Master gave quite a few significant interviews, plus inner experiences of a very high order, to this particular lady, but her photographer-husband was totally against her spiritual life. Eventually the photographer-husband won and the Master lost the disciple.</p>
<p>After the lady left the Master’s path, the Master said to his sister, who was in Heaven, “Look why I didn’t feel like giving interviews to that particular disciple.” But the sister only gave her brother a broad smile and said that there was nothing wrong in trying to illumine someone’s agelong darkness.</p>  </div>
