<p>   He needed<br /> Only three persons<br />   In this vast world:<br /> A constant praiser,<br /> A grateful learner,<br /> An unconditional lover.<br /> Alas, he found not even one.<br />        Since<br /> All mortals with no exception failed him,<br /> He appointed God.</p>
<p>God touched his feet<br /> And emphatically praised his ignorance.</p>
<p>God touched his feet<br /> And unmistakably learned from him<br /> How to drink ignorance.</p>
<p>God touched his feet<br /> And unconditionally became<br /> His eternal lover.</p>
