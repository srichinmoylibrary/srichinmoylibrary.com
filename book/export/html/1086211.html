<p>Today I was supposed to be at the Taj Mahal. My students got permission for me to play there on my most favourite instrument, the esraj, but circumstances prevented me from going. The authorities said that whenever I am able to go, I will be welcome to play.</p>
<p>Two students of mine from Goa went to the Taj Mahal. It was quite easy for them to get permission for me to play, because about six years ago the Taj Mahal became one of our Peace-Blossoms. The authorities of the Taj Mahal became part and parcel of our Peace-Blossoms movement.</p>
