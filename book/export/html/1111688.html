<p>People who encourage the runners in the Boston Marathon are much more divine than people who encourage runners in many other races. How they cheered us on!</p>
<p>Even before I covered the first mile, I was totally exhausted. You can call it tiredness or hunger or thirst — God knows. After seven miles a little boy stood right in front of me and gave me a glass of water, literally forcing me to drink it.</p>
<p>I said, "How old are you?"</p>
<p>He said, "Four."</p>
<p>So many runners patted me on the back, saying, "Come along, friend, you can make it. Don't give up. Go on, go on, go on!" They were going ahead of me and encouraging me as they passed by. They were very nice people.</p>
