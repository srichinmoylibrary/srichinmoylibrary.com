<p>Towards the end of the race people were telling us, "After the turn it is only a quarter of a mile." But that quarter of a mile never ended.</p>
<p>After I finished the race, I took a few steps and somebody said to me, "Are you the last guy?"</p>
<p>I said, "Oh no, no! There are people behind me."</p>
