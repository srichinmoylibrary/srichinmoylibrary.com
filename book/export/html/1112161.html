<p>Yesterday as I was walking near my 1 1/2-mile mark, I saw a man who had just bought a New York Times from a street booth. He was about my age.</p>
<p>When he saw me, he said, "Hey, young man! Inside the park a car has been totally smashed. Can you go and see what is wrong?"</p>
<p>I smiled at him. Then he said, "Young man, you cannot go? Then take care, and have a nice day!"</p>
