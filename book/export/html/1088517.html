<p>Mahatma Gandhi, O luminosity-soul, O purity-heart, O sincerity-mind, O simplicity-life, to you I bow and bow.</p>
<p><em>Ahimsa</em>, the non-violence-world-transformation-light, you had. <em>Satyagraha</em>, the truth-eagerness-manifestation-delight, you were. You were the invaluable voice of India's soul. You were the indisputable choice of India's heart.</p>
<p>Mahatma, you were at once India's hope-beauty-flower and India's promise-fragrance-garden. Your colossal soul will perpetually shine in India's gratitude-heart on the path of life. The transcendental greatness-life of the sun your outer name was. The universal goodness-heart of the moon your inner name was.</p>
<p>Mahatma, in you India discovered India's heart-awakening bells. In India you discovered India's world-beckoning trumpets.</p>
<p>Mahatma, to you I bow and bow.</p>  </div>
