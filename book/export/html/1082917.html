<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Peace is the child of divine Love and at the same time Love is the child of Peace. If we pray to God or meditate on God in our vital life, then when divine Love descends from above, our emotional life is purified. When our emotional life is purified, at that time we become peaceful. Then Love gives birth to Peace; Love is the mother. But when we meditate in the physical world, that is to say in our gross physical body which can be restless, aggressive or lethargic, we try to bring down Peace from above. When peace descends, we get a kind of satisfaction or joy. And that joy we try to transfer to others in the form of Love. Love that is founded upon Peace is naturally the child of Peace.</p>
<p>If we have Peace, then only we can love. When a mother has peace of mind, then she loves her child. If she has no peace of mind, then she strikes the child right and left. Where is love at that time? She will tell the child, "It is for your good that I am doing this." But no, it is only her lack of wisdom, her own undivine nature that is compelling her to strike the child. If the mother has Peace in boundless measure, then naturally she will be a continuous and constant expression of Love for her children.</p>  </div>
