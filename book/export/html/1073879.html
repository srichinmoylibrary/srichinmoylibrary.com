  <h1 class="book-heading">Austerity</h1>
  
 
<p>Austerity does not mean physical torture, far from it. Mortification of the flesh only a devilish nature can enjoy. God the Merciful does not demand our physical torture. He wants us to have the soulful light of wisdom. Nothing more and nothing less.</p>
<p>Austerity means a dedicated body, a pure mind, a loving heart and an awakened soul.</p>
<p>The outer austerity grows on the fertile soil of simplicity, sincerity and purity. The inner austerity grows on the fecund soil of serenity, tranquility and equanimity.</p>
<p>Sattvic austerity wishes no reward. Gain, honour and fame, rajasic austerity expects and demands. Self-immolation or the destruction of others, tamasic austerity wants and cherishes.</p>
<p>A seeker of the transcendental Truth and sex-forces can never run abreast. The seeker walking along the path of self-discovery and God-discovery must know what true celibacy is.</p>
<p>To quote Krishnaprem: “A neurotic celibacy with the so-called unconscious mind full of thwarted sex, issuing in a welter of more or less disguised fantasy, is the very worst condition to be in for one who seeks the inner life. Such a condition may, like extreme bodily weakness, give rise to strange experiences and visions, but it will quite effectively prevent any real treading of the Path. Sex will be transcended; it cannot be suppressed [...] with impunity.”</p>
<p>The chapter ends most soulfully with the Brahman. Brahman is divinely designated by the three soul-stirring words: <em>AUM</em> <em>TAT</em> <em>SAT</em>.</p>
<p><em>AUM</em> is the mystical symbol supreme. <em>AUM</em> is the real name of God. In the cosmic manifestation is <em>AUM</em>. Beyond the manifestation, farthest beyond is <em>AUM</em>.</p>
<p><em>TAT</em> means “That,” the Nameless Eternal. Above all attributes, majestic “That” stands.</p>
<p><em>SAT</em> means Reality, the Truth Infinite.</p>
<p>We have to chant <em>AUM</em> and then begin to perform our life’s divine duties.</p>
<p>We have to chant <em>TAT</em> and then offer to humanity all our achievements, energising and fulfilling.</p>
<p>We have to chant <em>SAT</em> and then offer to God what we inwardly and outwardly are, our very existence.</p>  </div>
