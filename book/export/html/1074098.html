<p><em>The following questions were answered by Sri Chinmoy on 26 September 2004 at Aspiration-Ground in Jamaica, New York.</em></p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Guru, these past few years have been so difficult...</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This year has been very difficult.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> These past three or four years have been very difficult in our manifestation. Many of us have been unable, for whatever reason, to do what we would have liked to do in terms of serving the Supreme. What can we do for the time being until things clear up a little bit and we can go on and do our work in the world?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Outwardly, for certain reasons, we cannot do some things right now, but inwardly we can increase our aspiration. As we have outer aspiration, outer dedication and outer manifestation, even so, we have inner aspiration, inner dedication and inner manifestation. The other day when I said to Charles Osgood, "For the time being we are unable to do our peace work," he immediately said, "But your spirit is doing inwardly, your spirit."</p>
<p>So there are things we cannot do outwardly, owing to some reason. But inwardly we can intensify our inspiration and aspiration. And again, when the time comes, we will be able to do the things that we once did more vigorously, more powerfully and more satisfactorily than we did before.</p>  </div>
