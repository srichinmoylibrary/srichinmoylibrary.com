<p>You want to know what I think of God?<br /> I will tell you what little I know of Him<br /> From my own personal experience:<br /> He has kindness.<br /> He is good.<br /> At times<br /> He is cute, too.<br /> Now do you want to know something<br /> Of my personal connection and relation with Him?<br /> Ah, you want to know!<br /> Then just listen:<br /> He is my surrendered heart's perfect slave,<br /> My desiring vital's compassionate master.</p>
