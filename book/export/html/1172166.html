<p>One day when I was in a rickshaw going home, a lady said to me, "Chinmoy-da, stop, stop."</p>
<p>I could not recognise her. She asked, "How are you?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am fine."</p>
<p>She said, "No, you are not fine."</p>
<p>I asked, "Why?"</p>
<p>She told me, "Because I can see. Your eyes are red and something is wrong with you."</p>
<p>I said, "I have got a little fever, but there is nothing wrong."</p>
<p>She had a few flowers. She gave me one flower which was the most favourite flower of Lord Krishna when he used to meet with the gopis. She said, "Here, this is Krishna's most favourite flower. If you take it and put it on your head, then you will be all right."</p>
<p>I said, "Even now I cannot recognise you."</p>
<p>She said, "You cannot recognise me because you are so great. How will you remember? Do you remember Kanak?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>She said, "I was very young. You were so fond of my uncle. Do you remember my uncle?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes. I was so fond of Joganananda."</p>
<p>She told me, "I was one of his nieces. Now do you recognise me?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, where are Bokul and the others?"</p>
<p>She said, "They are all out of the Ashram. They are not here. They got married, this and that, but I am still here. I remember you. You take this flower and you will be all right." So I was very nice to her. In those days she was so thin, but now she has become extremely fat.</p>  </div>
