<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly it can. But you have to know when you say "I am" whether you are meditating on the universal "I" or the individual "I," which represents a limited human being. If it is a human individual that you are meditating upon, then that will never lead you to God-realisation. But if you are meditating or concentrating on the universal "I," which you represent and which you inwardly are, then it will definitely help you in your God-realisation.</p>
<p>You have to be conscious of what you are doing when you say "I am." When the Christ said, "I and my Father are one," at that time it was his universal oneness, his transcendental oneness with the Eternal Father, that he was expressing. Ordinary human beings will not be able to do that. An ordinary human being knows perfectly well how much ignorance he has and he is. This moment he may say, "God and I are one." The next moment, when his desires are not fulfilled, he will immediately say, "How can we be one if He does not satisfy me? What kind of friendship has He established with me or have I established with Him?" At that time, so-called oneness disappears.</p>  </div>
