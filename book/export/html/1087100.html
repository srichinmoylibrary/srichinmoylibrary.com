<p>Once I was browsing in front of a bookstore. A Muslim saw me and recognised that I was a Hindu. Because my back was hurting, I placed my hand on my back. By way of joke he said, "Krishna, Krishna, Krishna!"</p>
<p>Then I started chanting, "Allah, Allah!"</p>
<p>He was invoking Krishna to save me and I was invoking Allah. We Indians are all jokers. Even when we suffer, we have to joke!</p>
