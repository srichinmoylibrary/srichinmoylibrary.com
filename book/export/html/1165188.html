  <h1 class="book-heading">Joy</h1>
  
 
<p>Joy is the inner light that illumines my darkest night.</p>
<p>When I am in joy, God feeds me. And I feed God only when I share my joy with others.</p>
<p>When I have inner joy, I will always be blessed with an abundance of spontaneity and creativity.</p>
<p>When I look up with joy, I will have God as my employer.</p>
<p>When I look around with joy, I will have God as my supervisor.</p>
<p>When I look forward with joy, I will have God as my paymaster.</p>
<p>Joy is my dynamic oneness with the Supreme. Since my soul is integrally one with the Supreme, there is no challenge too great for me. Absolutely none.</p>
<p>My joy is my established faith in the Supreme. Unlike others who do not have faith in the Supreme, I do not think and feel that I am always wrong, meaningless and useless. To be sure, those who are wanting in faith are the victims of frustration. To them, life is a barren desert, God is a colossal daydream, death is a roaring lion right in front of them.</p>
<p>Before my heart's joy calls upon God, His omnipotent Grace will answer. It is a true truth.</p>
<p>To try to explain joy is to fail always, because it is dubious. To try to taste joy is to succeed always, because it is obvious.</p>
<p>Joy is the peace embodied. Joy is the power revealed. The embodied peace is the masculine aspect of the Divine. The revealed power is the feminine aspect of the Divine.</p>
<p>My heart's joy fathoms the deepest. My mind's joy reaches the farthest. My soul's joy achieves the highest.</p>  </div>
