<p>Why does God exist? Why do we exist? We exist and God exists on earth and everywhere for only one thing: Joy-to create Joy and to receive Joy. We sometimes use a deeper word, Delight, but right now let us use the term Joy. God is the Eternal Player. God creates something and, while He is creating, He gets Joy. When His creation is finished He also gets a kind of Joy. And then when He looks at His creation and sees the Joy that He has offered, He tries to receive this same Joy from the creation. He tries to get more Joy.</p>
<p>If a child is playing with a tennis ball, he will get joy first when he holds the ball, then when he throws the ball, next when the ball strikes against the wall and makes a sound and then when the ball bounces back to him. Similarly, when God creates something He offers His Joy outside Himself, beyond Himself. That which He spreads, He gets back, just as when a fisherman throws his net, it spreads out and he can draw it back toward himself again. So God exists because of His spontaneous inner Joy which he offers and which comes back to Him.</p>  </div>
