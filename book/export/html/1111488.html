<p>This morning I was running twelve miles down Main Street to Northern Boulevard. Hundreds of people were waiting for the bus on Main Street; I could hardly run. Then I saw two lame men who were walking with canes, one after the other. I said, "God, I can't blame You anymore. I can't make complaints to You about my running anymore." How could I make complaints to God when I was running so many miles and these two men were walking with canes?</p>
