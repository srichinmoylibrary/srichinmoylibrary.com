<p>Many reporters came to our press conference. Most of them were so nice. But the man from Jakarta was bad. Such nasty questions he asked!</p>
<p>First he asked why I was not going to Russia, China and North Korea. What kind of question is that!</p>
<p>I said that the time has not come for me to go to those places.</p>
<p>Then, when I was meditating before doing my lifts, he said, "Is there any special reason why you are looking towards the East?"</p>
<p>I said, "Here I don't know where East or West is."</p>
<p>Most of the reporters were so nice, but always there is someone to challenge and annoy us.</p>
