<p><em>Sri Chinmoy answered the following questions after his talk to UNDP staff members on November 19, 1975.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now I wish to answer a few questions. If you have any questions, I shall be extremely happy and grateful to answer them, for this is my dedicated service to all those who are seekers, who need another life, a higher life of understanding, a more illumining life of conscious and constant satisfaction.</p>  </div>
