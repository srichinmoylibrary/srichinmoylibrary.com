<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind doesn’t need to remember those things. It is like remembering what I ate today, what a disciple’s cooking was like. But if I know that that disciple was very kind to me, that she brought me food whenever I wanted it, that is enough. Not how many times she brought food and how many times I liked it: this I do not have to remember. Only her selfless service I shall remember. If the mind wants to know what kind of food she brought, the mind will not be able to know. But it will be able to remember her dedicated service.</p>  </div>
