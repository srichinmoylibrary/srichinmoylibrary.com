<h2>Question: What is the advantage of joining a specific path and meditating with others?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It becomes easier to meditate if you follow a specific path. From your spiritual family you will get additional strength. If you don't have a spiritual family, then you will feel that you are lost. In your family you have a father, mother, brother, sister and dear ones. When you fall sick, immediately somebody else in the family will take care of you. In this case, falling sick means to have doubt. That is the real sickness. If you have doubt, the medical hospital will not be able to help you. It is only the spiritual hospital and the spiritual doctors, who are your brother and sister disciples who will be able to help you.</p>  </div>
