<p><em>Bishop Kennedy:</em> When did you arrive here?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I arrived here just yesterday.</p>
<p><em>Bishop Kennedy:</em> Just yesterday, and you will be here for how long?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Until tomorrow morning. At 9:30 I shall leave for Perth and then I shall go back to America.</p>
<p><em>Bishop Kennedy:</em> You actually live in the United States?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have lived in the United States for the last twelve years.</p>
<p><em>Bishop Kennedy:</em> And your work in the United States has been mainly with members of the United Nations?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I also serve the Westerners, the Americans and the Canadians who come to me. It is a part of my dedicated service. Also, I hold special meditations and prayers twice a week at the United Nations and once a month I give a lecture at the Dag Hammarskjold Auditorium.</p>
<p><em>Bishop Kennedy:</em> Sister Patricia is doing work of...I was going to say, of the same nature. It might be interesting if you spoke about your work for a moment.</p>
<p><em>Sister Patricia:</em> My work comes from the same root. I would be interested to hear why you went to the States.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I just listened to an inner Dictate. I listened to an inner Voice. This Voice is for me the Voice of my Inner Pilot. My Inner Pilot commanded me to come to America and to be of service to the aspiring Americans. So I had no choice. Tomorrow if the same Voice tells me to spend the rest of my life in Australia, I shall be obliged to do so.</p>  </div>
