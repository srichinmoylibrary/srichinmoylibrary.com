  <h1 class="book-heading">Many kinds of manifestation</h1>
  
 
<p>Recently in New York I have been giving importance to one particular aphorism:</p>

<p>“I have come to learn<br /> Something very new:<br /> Manifestation-privileges<br /> God gives to very few.”<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>That message should be ingrained in your heart. I would like you to recite it quite a few times, so that you will value God-manifestation.</p>
<p>God-manifestation can take place even inside your own physical body. Let us say that your body is undisciplined, or you have a disease. If you can bring down light, peace, bliss or any other divine quality into the physical, that is a great manifestation.</p>
<p>Again, if you can be sincerely nice and kind to your brother and sister disciples, that is also an aspect of our manifestation.</p>
<p>The manifestation that disciples are doing here and there, you all know. But there are many, many other kinds of manifestation that you may not be consciously aware of.</p>
