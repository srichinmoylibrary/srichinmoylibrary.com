<p>"Chinmoy, can you go and bring my new sandals from Govinda Raj? I think they are ready."</p>
<p>I went to Govinda Raj's shop, but the sandals were not ready. However, it was not his fault; his workers had unnecessarily delayed. Of course, they didn't know they were Nolini-da's sandals; otherwise, they would have done them as soon as possible. When I brought his sandals, Nolini-da complimented Govinda Raj's work.</p>  </div>
