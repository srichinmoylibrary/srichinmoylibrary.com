<p>Death, when a spiritual Master visits you<br /> On his way to Heaven,<br /> Do you give him a special reception?</p>
<p>"Yes, I do.<br /> But I am so lucky<br /> That God has turned only very few human beings<br /> Into spiritual Masters<br /> Since the very birth of His creation.<br /> Only on very rare occasions<br /> Do I have to welcome a spiritual Master."</p>
<p>O Death, my poor ignorant friend,<br /> Those days are buried in oblivion!<br /> Nowadays thousands of spiritual Masters<br /> Are offering their loftiest Height,<br /> Purest Light<br /> And<br /> Deepest Delight<br /> To their younger brothers and sisters in spirit.<br /> To your wide surprise,<br /> There are some spiritual Masters<br /> Who have the capacity —<br /> Unlike Krishna, the Buddha<br /> And the Christ —<br /> To grant Illumination,<br /> Liberation and Salvation<br /> In the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>Again, there are some<br /> Who are simply unique.<br /> Do you know what they do?<br /> They initiate<br /> Over ten thousand people<br /> At a time!<br /> And their initiation has<br /> The thaumaturgic power<br /> To offer their disciples<br /> Illumination, Liberation and Salvation<br /> All at once!</p>
<p>"Is it so?<br /> I must immediately go to Heaven<br /> And inform my comrades Krishna, Buddha and Christ<br /> About the incredible<br /> And unprecedented capacities<br /> Of these spiritual Masters.<br /> I shall tell Krishna, Buddha and Christ<br /> That if they really want to be<br /> Worthy of their successors,<br /> Then they must<br /> Immediately come down<br /> And be their most humble disciples.<br /> I assure you, my divine friends<br /> Are extremely sincere seekers.<br /> They will immediately<br /> Come down<br /> And kiss the very dust<br /> Of the feet of these Masters<br /> Who are granting<br /> Instant Illumination, Liberation and Salvation<br /> Like the earth's instant coffee.<br /> I am so grateful to you<br /> For offering me<br /> This creation-illumining news."</p>
<p>Death, I am so happy that at last<br /> My most dedicated service<br /> Has been of some use to you.</p>
