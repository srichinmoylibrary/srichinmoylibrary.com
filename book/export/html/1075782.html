<p><em>(Aurobindo in his cell. Early morning.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: I wonder from where this fragrance is coming. There is no flower near by, nor even a gentle breeze. <em>(A voice breaks out in the silence.)</em></p>
<p>VOICE: I am Vivekananda. I want to speak to you about the workings of the consciousness above the mind.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Above the mind?</p>
<p>VOICE: Yes. I myself had no idea of such workings while I was in the body. Now I have it and I will help you with it. For this I shall visit you every day for about two weeks.</p>
<p>AUROBlNDO: I believe these workings would lead towards some Supreme Dynamic Knowledge.</p>
<p>VOICE: That is for you to discover. I can but show what I have found. The world's burden of progress rests upon your shoulders. It is a great happiness to find you ready to bear it. Godspeed.</p>
<p><em>(The spirit of Vivekananda disappears.)</em></p>  </div>
