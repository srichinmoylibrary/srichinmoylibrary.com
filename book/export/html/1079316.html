<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to follow a specific spiritual path, then you need inspiration to start with. This inspiration you can get from spiritual books, preferably those written by the real spiritual Masters. If you do not get adequate inspiration from books, or if books do not satisfy you, you should mix with the disciples of spiritual Masters. If you associate with seekers who have already found a path, you will get inspiration, encouragement and assurance. Then you have to go to a teacher.</p>
<p>The Master and the path are one. If you follow a specific path, naturally there will be a Master for that path. There are quite a few teachers and paths, but you have to make a choice. The teacher who gives you the greatest joy is meant for you.</p>  </div>
