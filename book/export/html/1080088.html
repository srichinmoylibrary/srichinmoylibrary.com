<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can consecrate our lives to the soul of the United Nations by constantly feeling that the goal which the United Nations has placed before us is something unprecedented. The United Nations is desperately trying to unify the weak and the strong, the small and the big, the unfortunate and the fortunate, the mind-power and the heart-power, the body-power and the vital-power. To unite and then elevate everything to a higher plane of consciousness is undoubtedly the unprecedented promise offered by the United Nations to the world at large.</p>  </div>
