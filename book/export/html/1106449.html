<p>At long last, after disappointment for a whole week, today I was successful in lifting up 600 pounds (300 pounds in each arm). I made two attempts and both were good. Yesterday Unmilan widened the space between the dumbbells by one inch and it has made so much difference. I never imagined that one inch could create such problems! After so many days, today I am overjoyed.</p>
