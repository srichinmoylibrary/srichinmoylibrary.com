<p>RADHA: Christopher, do you know what Savita told me this morning? Savita asked Dr. Garima Hoffman to alter her nose. Dr. Hoffman quoted her the normal fee. Savita was so shocked. She said the fee was much too high!</p>
<p>She said, "Doctor, Doctor, is there any way I can alter my nose at a cheaper price?"</p>
<p>Doctor Hoffman said, "Yes, just run into a telephone pole."</p>  </div>
