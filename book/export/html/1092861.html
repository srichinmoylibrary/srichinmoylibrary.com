<p>Although Subhas was elected as President of the National Congress for a second term in 1939-even against the explicit wishes of Gandhi-ji-a resolution was passed requiring Subhas to nominate the Working Committee in accordance with Gandhi-ji's wishes. Many of Subhas Chandra's own supporters voted for this resolution, which effectively tied the President's political arms and legs in a morass of weakness and indecision.</p>  </div>
