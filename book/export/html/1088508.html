<p>According to many people, including Sri Aurobindo, Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru and his dearest friend Subhas Bose, Dilip had the sweet, sweeter, sweetest voice. It was called a golden voice.</p>
<p>This year (1997) is his birth centenary. He was born on January 22nd and his dearest friend, Subhas Chandra Bose, was born on January 23rd, 1897.</p>
<p>Dilip was a singer of the Source. Subhas was a marcher on the Course. In terms of the affection, blessings, fondness and even pride that Dilip received from Sri Aurobindo, nobody can come near him. He was a great musician, a colossal soul and a supreme devotee of Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p>To my extreme joy, I was blessed by Dilip-da's physical presence many, many times during my adolescent years. He appreciated and encouraged me most lovingly and most affectionately.</p>  </div>
