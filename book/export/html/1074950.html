<p>Sri Ramakrishna said,<br /> Man, be careful of woman.</p>
<p>Mother Kali said,<br /> Son, your advice needs some explanation.</p>
<p>Mother, what I meant was this:<br /> Man, be careful of the human in woman.</p>
<p>Son, still it is not quite clear to me.</p>
<p>Mother, let me simplify it for you.<br /> What I meant was this:<br /> Man, do not use your human eyes to see and corrupt<br /> The divine in woman.</p>
<p>Son, now I understand your philosophy.<br />   It is simply fascinating,<br />   It is divinely illumining,<br />   It is supremely fulfilling.</p>
