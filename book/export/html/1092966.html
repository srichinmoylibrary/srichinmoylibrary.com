<p>Your life-boat plies between appreciation-shore and deprecation-shore.</p>
<p>One man states, "He is the truest artist I have ever met."</p>
<p>Robert Schumann concisely concludes, "Hats off, gentlemen, a genius!"</p>
<p>But then, Oscar Wilde remarks, "After playing Chopin, I feel as if I had been weeping over sins that I had never committed and mourning over tragedies that were not my own."</p>
<p>Another man comments, "Compared with Berlioz, Chopin was a morbidly sentimental flea by the side of a roaring lion."</p>
<p>My heart soulfully and readily agrees with Miss Gladkowska: "Remember! Never forget that we in Poland love you....In foreign lands they may appreciate and reward you better, but they cannot love you more."</p>  </div>
