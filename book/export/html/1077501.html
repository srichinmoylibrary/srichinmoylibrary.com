<p>What am I? I am a climbing cry. Who am I? God’s ever-expanding sky.</p>
<p>If you seek God in God’s own ways, you will meet God as fulfilment. If you seek God in other ways, you will meet God as frustration.</p>
<p>An ordinary man must think logically and act sensibly to prove himself worth living. A spiritual seeker must think intuitively and act divinely to prove himself worth living.</p>
<p>A bridge of steel spans a mighty river. And what is needed to build that bridge? A combination of a creative brain and a vast mathematical knowledge. A bridge of sacrifice spans Heaven and Earth. And what is needed to build that bridge? A combination of God’s Compassion and the seeker’s aspiration.</p>
<p>A sincere seeker of Truth has three inseparable friends: Peace, Faith and Receptivity. Peace says to him: “I shall show you that there is nothing but God.” Faith says: “I shall make you see God within you.” Receptivity says: “What else is God if not all your life?”</p>
<p>A spiritual seeker must know that austerity is an abnormality in as much as it is a disturbance of the natural balance of forces in the different parts of our consciousness. Austerity does not give self-mastery. In true detachment is the real self-mastery. Just as Earth has temptations for an ordinary man, so Heaven has temptations for an advanced seeker.</p>
<p>Experience is the open and conscious eye of a seeker. Realisation is the all-seeing eye of a Yogi. To have an experience of truth is to discover at long last an oasis in the desert of life.</p>
<p>“France has more need of me than I of France,” said Napoleon. Likewise the world has more need of a realised soul than he of the world.</p>  </div>
