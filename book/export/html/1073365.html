<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to attain a divine consciousness, we try to discipline our life. Our life needs constant discipline. Our life-energy must flow toward the Source. If we want to reach a divine consciousness, we must pray or meditate regularly; we must try to consecrate our life to our Inner Pilot. If we consciously consecrate our day-to-day life to God, then automatically we will arrive at the divine consciousness.</p>
<p>Right now the consciousness that we are utilising is the earth-bound consciousness: the consciousness of ‘I,’ ‘my’ and ‘mine’. This is how we start our journey. For a baby, his parents are the whole world. Then he grows up a little and learns about his neighbourhood and that becomes his whole world. Gradually he learns about his city, his country and so on. Eventually, if he becomes a man of learning and tries to acquire an international outlook, he feels that the whole world is his home. In the spiritual life also, we start with limited consciousness. When the limited consciousness expands, it gradually grows into divine consciousness.</p>
<p>If we want to arrive at the divine consciousness, or if we want to have access to the divine consciousness, which is constantly expanding, then we have to discipline our everyday life, and we have to dedicate our life to a higher cause: to the Divine within us. Then automatically we will discover the divine consciousness, which is already hidden within us.</p>  </div>
