<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each thing and each place has a soul. Like all other cities, the city of New York has its soul. The Supreme has graciously shown me the soul of New York City a number of times. The difference between the soul of things and the souls of humans is a difference in their degree of evolution, in the degree they manifest their divine potentialities. It is through the process of reincarnation that the soul gradually manifests its hidden powers within, that the soul eventually reaches its absolute Fulfilment.</p>  </div>
