<p>Before the bus left for the triathlon, around midnight, I went for a three-mile run. After 600 metres I crossed the street. There were five girls sitting on the curb. As soon as they saw me, they all stood up and started barking the way dogs bark.</p>
<p>When I came back, they were still there chatting. Again, as soon as they saw me, they got inspiration to stand up and bark.</p>
