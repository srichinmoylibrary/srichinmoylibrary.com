<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sri Aurobindo once said that the biography of a spiritual Master is all written inside. If you write the biography of an ordinary person, it can be thousands of pages long. But if you want to write about his inner life, you will not be able to fill even one page. But in the case of a spiritual Master, hundreds and hundreds of pages can be written about his inner life, but they are not written. A spiritual Master, who is dealing with the inner world, gives and receives hundreds of significant experiences every day. A Yogiâ€™s inner experiences are the predominant experiences of his life, whereas for an ordinary person inner experiences are a very rare occurrence.</p>  </div>
