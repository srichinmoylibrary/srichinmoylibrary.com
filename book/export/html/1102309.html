<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to establish an inner connection with the United Nations, we have to feel that each and everything has a soul. The soul is the representative of God's Truth and God's Light on earth. If we see the soul of the United Nations, then we will feel that everything the United Nations does or stands for is absolutely perfect. Again, our own aspiring soul is also perfect in its own way. One perfect soul is meeting with another perfect soul. If we can keep this mental vision at every moment, then only can we establish an inner connection with the United Nations.</p>  </div>
