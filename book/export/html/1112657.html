<p>When I was coming through American customs, the immigration officer was an Indian. He noticed that I was also an Indian and, when he saw my green card, he said, "What have you been doing here for such a long time?"</p>
<p>I said, "What have you been doing here for such a long time?"</p>
<p>He said, "I am here for the money."</p>
<p>I said, "I am also here for money."</p>
<p>If I had said, "I teach philosophy and yoga," then he would have given me his philosophy about how we are ruining the prestige of India. So I just said, "I am also here for money." This is how one can get through customs.</p>  </div>
