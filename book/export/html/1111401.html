<p>Yesterday Pahar and Lorne were running side by side, right in front of me. I was just two steps behind. A young boy rode his bike so fast right in between them. Pahar and Lorne were furious â€” there was very little space between them, and I was just behind them. This is how bad some young boys are!</p>
