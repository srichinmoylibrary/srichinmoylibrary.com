<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul is always receptive. The soul is always eager to receive more light, more joy, more blessings and every divine quality. The mind and the vital very rarely receive. The heart from time to time receives, though not always. But the soul always receives. If the Master wants to give peace, if he wants to give love, if he wants to give light, if he wants to give bliss or any divine quality, the soul just grabs it. The soul is always eager and hungry for these things because the soul values them. If someone is a doctor, then he appreciates the value of medicine. But if you are not a doctor and if you do not feel that you are sick, then you are not interested in the subject of medicine.</p>  </div>
