<p>A real member of the United Nations does not expect a complete cure of the world's maladies by a still-young United Nations. He knows that countless problems existed long before it was born and that slow and steady wins the race. He hopes for the best; he fervently hopes that the world of peace that the United Nations envisages will, without fail, be manifested on earth.</p>  </div>
