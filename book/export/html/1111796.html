<p>Today I was practising speed work on the street in front of my house. I would run a hundred metres, stop for a short time and then run another hundred metres. After finishing one 100-metre sprint, I turned around only to see a white dog in front of my house. I didn't see the owner at all.</p>
<p>All of a sudden a fat lady with white hair came from behind me and put her hand on my left shoulder. She said, "You look so beautiful today!" I smiled at her. What could I do? She was blessing me.</p>
<p>This lady also has a granddaughter. Both of them sometimes sweep their backyard. Her dog's name is Pauly. Some years ago she had a fight with another lady on my street, and I took her side. So she and I became friends.</p>
