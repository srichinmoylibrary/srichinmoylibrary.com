<blockquote>
<p>"After thirty years of research into the feminine soul, the great question which I have not been able to answer is: what does a woman want?"</p>
<p>â€” Freud</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On behalf of women all over the world, Maitreyi's soul tells us what a woman wants. She said to her husband, Yagnyavalkya, the peerless sage of the Upanishads, that nothing would satisfy her save Immortality.</p>
<p>When she said Immortality, she did not mean the prolongation of her physical existence for millions of years. She meant that she wanted to have the immortal consciousness, the consciousness of Immortality, within and without.</p>  </div>
