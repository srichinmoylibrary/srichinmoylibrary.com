<p>I am<br /> My life's<br /> God-hunger-heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086581" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2</h1>
  
 

<p>Only by bringing the positive qualities,<br /> And not even one negative quality,<br /> Of human beings to the fore<br /> Will this world be able to make<br /> Abiding progress.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086582" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3</h1>
  
 

<p>In the long run<br /> It is the haters of mankind,<br /> Not the lovers of mankind,<br /> Who will be the really miserable losers.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086583" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4</h1>
  
 

<p>When I sincerely pray<br /> And soulfully meditate,<br /> I feel that I am only<br /> A mere instrument.<br /> There is a higher Power<br /> That is coming to help me,<br /> And that higher Power<br /> Is God's Grace.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086584" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5</h1>
  
 

<p>When we pray and meditate,<br /> We are not taking away<br /> God's Strength;<br /> Only we are establishing<br /> A free access<br /> To everything God has and is.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086585" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6</h1>
  
 

<p>We have so many friends<br /> Within us and around us.<br /> It is we who have to accept the world,<br /> Not as our enemy<br /> But as our true, illumining<br /> And fulfilling friend.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086586" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7</h1>
  
 

<p>Look only at the bright side.<br /> The bright side means<br /> To have implicit faith in ourselves<br /> And in others<br /> And to feel oneness-light<br /> And fulness-delight.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086587" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8</h1>
  
 

<p>The answer to the problems<br /> Of this world<br /> Is for every one of us<br /> To go far beyond<br /> Our present capacity-boundary<br /> And become better citizens<br /> Of the world.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086588" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9</h1>
  
 

<p>Contemplation is something<br /> Far beyond the vastness<br /> Of meditation.<br /> Contemplation is God-oneness itself.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086589" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10</h1>
  
 

<p>In your absolutely best meditation,<br /> Your entire being offers itself<br /> To the Supreme —<br /> Your soul with its illumination,<br /> Your heart with its aspiration,<br /> Your mind with its clarity,<br /> Your vital with its determination,<br /> Your body with its alertness.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086590" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11</h1>
  
 

<p>Once we have peace,<br /> We feel that<br /> We have everything<br /> In the outer world<br /> And we have become everything<br /> In the inner world.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086591" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12</h1>
  
 

<p>We have to gratefully help<br /> The inner world —<br /> The world that wants to supply us<br /> With the light, joy, peace and oneness<br /> Of the Beyond —<br /> To come to the fore.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086592" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13</h1>
  
 

<p>In this world we are all<br /> Running after satisfaction.<br /> He gets satisfaction<br /> By doubting me.<br /> I get satisfaction<br /> Because God's Grace is acting<br /> In and through me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086593" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14</h1>
  
 

<p>If I become a better person,<br /> Mother-Earth will be so happy<br /> Since She will be blessed<br /> With one less undivine<br /> And unproductive soul.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086594" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15</h1>
  
 

<p>When we allow the doubting mind<br /> To come forward,<br /> Our imagination-bird's wings<br /> Are clipped<br /> And its flight is all over.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086595" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16</h1>
  
 

<p>At your journey's start,<br /> Have a pure mind,<br /> A receptive heart<br /> And a willing life<br /> To surrender to God's Will<br /> To expedite your journey.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086596" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17</h1>
  
 

<p>Every day we have to go<br /> To our heart-garden<br /> To see a beautiful inspiration-rose —<br /> Not yesterday's rose-beauty<br /> But today's rose-divinity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086597" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18</h1>
  
 

<p>Your heart and your life<br /> Must know<br /> What prayer and meditation are.<br /> Prayer and meditation<br /> Are the Life-Breath of God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086598" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19</h1>
  
 

<p>We have to believe in a higher Power.<br /> Only by believing in a higher Power<br /> Can we go beyond and beyond<br /> Our limited, human capacity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086599" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20</h1>
  
 

<p>In my case,<br /> It is not a matter of decision;<br /> It is a matter of obedience.<br /> I simply listen to the dictates<br /> Of my Inner Pilot.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086600" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">21</h1>
  
 

<p>Just a little<br /> Of the soul's illumination<br /> Washes away<br /> All the undivine things you have done<br /> Over an untold period of time.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086601" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">22</h1>
  
 

<p>In the spiritual life<br /> There is no rest.<br /> Either we have to go forward<br /> Or nature will force our unaspiring life<br /> To go backwards.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086602" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23</h1>
  
 

<p>Do not allow your mind<br /> To take your heart<br /> Out of the soul's faith-garden<br /> Into the mind's doubt-forest.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086603" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24</h1>
  
 

<p>Dive deep within.<br /> What more do you need to accomplish,<br /> As long as God is inside your heart<br /> And you are inside God's Heart?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086604" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25</h1>
  
 

<p>Your cheerful joy<br /> Is the expression<br /> Of your gratitude-heart<br /> To your Inner Pilot.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086605" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">26</h1>
  
 

<p>Gratitude is something very sweet<br /> That makes you feel<br /> Your whole existence has offered<br /> Something great and precious to God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086606" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">27</h1>
  
 

<p>Many will come and many will go.<br /> But why do you have to be<br /> One of those who leave God?<br /> Can you not be one with your heart<br /> For God-embodiment and God-fulfilment?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086607" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">28</h1>
  
 

<p>Cultivate your heart's oneness with God<br /> And you will see:<br /> Life is not a mere dream;<br /> Life is not a tragic error;<br /> Life is a touch of magic —<br /> Miracle after miracle.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086608" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">29</h1>
  
 

<p>Do not reject the doubting mind.<br /> Make your mind clear and pure;<br /> Teach it to think positively.<br /> Your mind will eventually become<br /> A real help to you.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086609" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">30</h1>
  
 

<p>Peace will take you<br /> Closer to God.<br /> Bliss will keep you<br /> In God.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086610" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">31</h1>
  
 

<p>Because of our wild human nature,<br /> We need God's Forgiveness<br /> At every moment.<br /> We cannot move an inch forward<br /> Without having<br /> God's Forgiveness-Heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086611" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">32</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1086612" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">33</h1>
  
 

<p>Outwardly<br /> He barks and barks<br /> At his spiritual children.<br /> But inwardly<br /> They see a fountain of peace<br /> And an ocean of love.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086613" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">34</h1>
  
 

<p>You are not valuing<br /> Your Heavenly Father's spiritual wealth.<br /> What are you valuing?<br /> Your lethargy-idleness-ignorance-tree.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086614" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">35</h1>
  
 

<p>Life is expectation,<br /> And expectation can be either<br /> Illumination or frustration.<br /> There is practically no difference<br /> In the eyes of a God-realised soul.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086615" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">36</h1>
  
 

<p>Feel at every moment<br /> That you have a few new names:<br /> Cheerfulness, soulfulness, devotedness,<br /> Closeness and oneness.<br /> These names will satisfy God<br /> Far beyond your imagination.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086616" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">37</h1>
  
 

<p>A new wave of opportunity,<br /> A new wave of determination,<br /> A new wave of satisfaction<br /> God wishes to see<br /> In each of His seeker-children.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086617" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">38</h1>
  
 

<p>While practising meditation soulfully,<br /> Remember that<br /> The heart of regularity-joy<br /> Makes us perfect.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086618" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">39</h1>

  </div>
<div id="node-1086619" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">40</h1>
  
 

<p>I will always prefer my inner school,<br /> For the Teacher is none other than<br /> My Lord Supreme.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086620" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">41</h1>
  
 

<p>Who says<br /> Meditation is a lack of activity?<br /> On the contrary,<br /> Meditation intensifies activity<br /> In a divine way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086621" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">42</h1>
  
 

<p>Meditation<br /> Increases life's intensity<br /> And shows us life's true purpose.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086622" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">43</h1>
  
 

<p>When we meditate before we act,<br /> We get satisfaction<br /> Because we know we are working<br /> Not for ourselves,<br /> But for our Inner Pilot.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086623" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">44</h1>
  
 

<p>Not to value God's Compassion-Light<br /> And God's Justice-Height<br /> Equally<br /> Is to make a serious blunder.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086624" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">45</h1>
  
 

<p>Every day try to sing<br /> At least one obedience-song<br /> To love and please God<br /> In His own Way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086625" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">46</h1>
  
 

<p>The life-breath<br /> Of spirituality-hunger<br /> Is obedience.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086626" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">47</h1>
  
 

<p>My Beloved Lord Supreme,<br /> So many of your choice instruments<br /> Have failed, failed badly.<br /> Why? Why?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> There is only one answer<br /> And that answer is disobedience,<br /> Inner and outer disobedience."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086627" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">48</h1>
  
 

<p>To transcend<br /> Our heart-capacities<br /> Means to transcend<br /> Our life-qualities.<br /> Capacity and quality must go together.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086628" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">49</h1>
  
 

<p>For many years, my Beloved Supreme,<br /> You have brought into my inner life<br /> Your boundless Compassion, Concern,<br /> Affection, Love and Blessings.<br /> Yet far beyond my own imagination,<br /> I continue to disappoint You.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1086629" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">50</h1>
  
 

<p>Call it obedience<br /> Or call it oneness,<br /> But try to feel the necessity<br /> Of listening to your own highest self.</p>
