<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The human mind has an instinctive urge to manifest the reality that it embodies as fast as possible, and it has discovered that technology is the fastest means for manifesting this reality. The human mind finds it very easy to manifest itself powerfully and dramatically through technology. At its present stage of development, technology is the best means to carry its messages or to carry the reality and truth that it has already achieved. But technological progress has nothing to do with spiritual progress. It is the mental, vital and physical consciousness that is responsible for technological and mechanical progress. Again, if you compare the soul's progress with the progress of technology, there is no comparison.</p>
<p>If technological improvements give us some material comfort, if they create good circumstances surrounding us, then they may help us in our inner quest. But sometimes when the circumstances around us are better, our aspiration is ruined. When all the world's comforts are there, then instead of meditating and praying, we sleep. If technology brings too much comfort and pleasure to our life, it can be destructive.</p>
<p>We need not lead an austere life; a moderate degree of technology can be of great help to us in our life of acceptance. We can take as much help as we need from technology. But when it is a matter of the soul's reality, the soul's achievement — when it is a matter of light, peace and all the spiritual things that we are crying for — then technology cannot do anything. No matter how fast or how far technology has evolved and developed, it will be of no avail in bringing forward the soul's light or gaining anything from above.</p>  </div>
