<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Beauty and Power go together. Beauty is Power; Power is Beauty. Both are Light that an individual sees in his own way. When Light is being manifested in the Divine Mother, you may call it Power and somebody else may call it Beauty. When somebody sees the Divine Mother's Light, if the soul feels that by seeing this Light as Beauty its progress will be faster, then it sees the Light as Beauty. If the soul feels that by seeing Power its progress will be faster, then it will see the Light in that way. Beauty and Power are both manifestations of Light, but each individual will see Light in the way that will best help his soul's progress.</p>  </div>
