<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When it is a matter of spiritual principles you and your husband should feel as one. When you don't feel oneness, if your husband's lack of aspiration tortures you, immediately feel that your dearest is God. In that way you are safe. This is only a temporary cure but you have to have patience. If the Supreme wants you and your husband to stay together, when suffering comes, when anger comes, when frustration comes, at that time be clever; have patience. Without patience we can't accomplish anything.</p>
<p>Patience is a river waiting for the time when aspiration will dawn. Whether the time will come tomorrow or two years from now, we don't know. Aspiration is bound to dawn eventually because it is something divine and necessary for the transformation of your husband's nature. The Supreme is bound to give it to him but at His choice Hour. Your time is this moment, but his time may be later. In the spiritual life you should meditate, but you should not expect anything. You should have patience. If you have patience, you will be able to deal with any situation as long as God wants you to.</p>  </div>
