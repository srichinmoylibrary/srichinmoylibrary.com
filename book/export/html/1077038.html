<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It helps you if you write down your dreams, but you should not analyse them. Only a spiritual Master can analyse your dreams. If you have inspiring dreams you can write them down, either on a piece of paper or on the tablet of your heart. Then when you are sad, depressed and doomed to disappointment, if you read your inspiring dreams, it immediately elevates your consciousness to the highest height. But if you analyse, you use your stupid mind and then all the significance, the subtle essence of the dream will vanish immediately. All its importance, meaning, glory and capacity — everything that is divine and essential in the dream — will be taken away. Don’t use the mind. Do not analyse and scrutinise; only keep the dream inside your heart. Cherish it and treasure it. Then, as soon as you become a victim to undivine forces, place the dream in front of you. Then look in the mirror and see how divine you have become.</p>  </div>
