<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One friend saw me and said, "God gave him realisation and then he had to give something to God. So he gave his hair to God."</p>
<p>Then my friend said, "I too can give God something, but I am not prepared to give Him my hair. However, if God wants my glasses, He can have them."</p>  </div>
