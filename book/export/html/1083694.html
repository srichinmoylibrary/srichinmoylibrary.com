<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> "Argument" is a complicated word in the spiritual sense of the term. The dictionary will say it means "heated discussion." God the Father and God the Mother can easily have an exchange of ideas on a dynamic plane. While they are exchanging ideas on a dynamic plane of consciousness, it may seem to others that they are having a heated discussion or human argument. But it is not a human argument; it is a serious exchange of thought-worlds and consciousness-worlds from where God the Father and God the Mother make a decision.</p>  </div>
