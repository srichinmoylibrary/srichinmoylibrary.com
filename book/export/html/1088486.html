<p>Once an English military officer who was extremely devoted to Bhaskarananda was boasting about his latest military achievement. The Master said, "Fine, fine. I admire your bravery. Now, just give me that pencil which is right in front of you. I have to write something."</p>
<p>The officer bent down to pick up the pencil for the Master, but he could not lift it. Again the Master said, "Please give it to me. I cannot reach it."</p>
<p>The officer tried and tried, but he did not have the strength to lift up the pencil. With utmost affection the Master told him, "Look, it is God's Strength and Capacity that work in and through you on the battlefield. That is why you are victorious. Without God's Strength, you do not have the capacity even to lift up a pencil. So, do not boast, my child. It is all God's Will."</p>  </div>
