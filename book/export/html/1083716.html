<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our consciousness is like a book. When we play divine music, we are able to write down something significant in the book. If it is undivine music, we will write down something undivine. The moment we write something undivine, the quality of the book suffers. When we write divine things, we see and feel that the quality of the book is greatly improved.</p>
<p>If we listen to bad music, it is as though we have a piece of paper right in front of us and we have dropped ink on the paper and ruined it. But if we hear good music, we will immediately feel that we have written something divine and immortal on the paper.</p>
<p>Water symbolises consciousness. Consciousness, like water, is neutral. What we put inside water is of paramount importance. If it is something harmless, sweet and divine, then we will get joy. But if we put something undivine, poisonous and destructive in the water, then naturally when we drink it we shall die. What we mix with the water before drinking it is entirely up to us.</p>  </div>
