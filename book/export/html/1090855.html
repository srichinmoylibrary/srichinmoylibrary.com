<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each experience helps us but at the same time we do not remember each experience in detail. We do not keep the whole experience in the outer world; we keep the essence of the experience in the inner world. The experiences you had at the age of twelve are unknown to you now. In your outer life you have totally forgotten them, but in your inner life their essence remains. In the inner world nothing is lost; everything is recorded. In the outer world, an experience is real for a while, and then a few days later it is totally defaced. Before realisation, certainly all is transmuted in the outer life. It does not stay in our day-to-day consciousness. But in the inner life the real essence remains.</p>  </div>
