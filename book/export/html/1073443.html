<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each person has his own conception of God. If the conception of God as Light satisfies you, then you are perfectly right in thinking of God as Light. Someone else perhaps will be satisfied only with God as a most luminous being, like a most beautiful child. Each person has to think of God according to his own inner capacity and inner receptivity. God is not bound by any form, but He can take any form He wants to.</p>
<p>If you want to see Him in a form, if you have pleased Him, then He is bound to appear before you in that particular form. God is with form and attributes, and He is without form and attributes. If you want to see Him one moment with attributes, if you have pleased Him, He will show Himself to you with attributes. The next moment if you want to see Him in His impersonal Form, as infinite Peace, Light and Bliss, then He can appear in that way also. God is more than ready to appear before you in whatever form to which you are devoted. He transcends both form and formlessness.</p>  </div>
