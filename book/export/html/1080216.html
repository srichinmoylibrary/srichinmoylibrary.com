<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme created the soul of the United Nations the day the vision dawned in the heart of Woodrow Wilson. But the vision did not manifest for many years. And when it did manifest, it did not manifest properly. On the one hand, it was a failure. On the other hand, it was not actually a failure; it was only that the vision was taken over by others. But it was the flow of the same river; it was the same flow and the same force of universal peace.</p>  </div>
