<p>At the airport in London, the stewardesses and their luggage had to be examined thoroughly, like us. The police came inside the plane to take one of the stewardesses back to airport security because she had not been examined. She said, "Yes, I will go, but I hate the person who examines us."</p>
<p>The police said, "Then come with us, and we will find somebody else."</p>
<p>So the police took this stewardess back into the terminal.</p>  </div>
