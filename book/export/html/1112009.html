<p>The first day I was in Los Angeles for the Olympics, I went out running early in the morning. I asked a man where the stadium was. He said, "Forget the stadium. Go have a cup of coffee!"</p>
<p>On another day, I was walking on the sidewalk when I saw three men — simply undivine — coming towards me. I jumped into the street to avoid them. Very loudly one said, "Jesus!"</p>
<p>In silence I said to him, "Thank you for invoking a very good friend of mine!"</p>
