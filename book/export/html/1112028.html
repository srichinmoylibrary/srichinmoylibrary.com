<p>This morning at a quarter to seven, I was walking on 150th Street. I saw an elderly man get up on a bike with difficulty. As soon as he saw me, he got off the bike. He had only covered 20 metres.</p>
<p>He said to me, "You are running and I am cycling. I am 75. How old are you?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am nearing 75."</p>
<p>He was so happy to hear that.</p>
