<p>When I used to practise running in the ashram when I was young, I used to feel sorry for Mother Earth because my legs were so strong and powerful. I felt I was hurting the ground when I ran. When I did the hop, skip and jump, my hop was so powerful that again I felt I was hurting Mother Earth. But now when I run, I find the ground so hard that it hurts me. Mother Earth should bless me now!</p>
<p>I even feel the difference between the sidewalk and the street. The sidewalk is so much harder than the street. Even when I run on the track at St. John's University, the track hurts my legs.</p>
<p>In the ashram I used to go out running barefoot at four o'clock in the morning, and I wouldn't even notice that the ground was hard. Then when I went out at six o'clock, after it had become light, I would see pieces of glass in the places where I had been running. So the Supreme had saved me!</p>
