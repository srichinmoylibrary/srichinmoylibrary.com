<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is through constant self-giving that you can march towards your self-perfection. There is no other way. Give yourself to the Supreme soulfully, devotedly and unconditionally, and feel that there is nothing that He will not do for you. And again, even if He does not do anything for you, it is His business. He knows what is best for you. What you think you need is not the right thing. What He thinks you need is the right thing. Your self-giving is absolutely the right thing, because this is the one thing in your life that the Supreme wants from you. So only through self-giving can you march towards perfection.</p>  </div>
