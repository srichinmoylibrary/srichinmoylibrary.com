<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! Spiritually fat people are those who have made conscious surrender to Godâ€™s Will. And spiritually thin people are those who have no faith either in themselves or in God. Those who have made tremendous progress in offering love, devotion and surrender, plus gratitude, are spiritually fat. Here, fat means inundated with divine qualities. Others who have not developed good qualities to offer are spiritually thin.</p>  </div>
