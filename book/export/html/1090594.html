<p><em>[Matsyendranath's ashram. Gorakshanath is meditating. Enter an itinerant Yogi.]</em></p>
<p>YOGI: What an ugly, undivine, unbearable place! I have never been to an ashram that was so unspiritual. What kind of cowdung Master you must have!</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Don't you dare speak about my Master that way! I have tremendous occult power.</p>
<p>YOGI: Show me your occult power!</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: <em>[grabbing a knife]</em> Here is a knife. If you strike me anywhere on my body you will not be able to injure me at all. That is my power!</p>
<p><em>[Yogi begins stabbing Gorakshanath.]</em></p>
<p>YOGI: All right. When I struck you, you were not hurt, but my blows always created a sound. But if you strike me with the same knife, not only will you not be able to injure me, but also you will not be able to produce any sound.</p>
<p><em>[Gorakshanath stabs the Yogi several times.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: You are right! Not a sound! How is it possible?</p>
<p>YOGI: If one identifies with the infinite, then no sound will be produced by a blow. This proves that I am superior to you in occult power.</p>
<p><em>[Exit Yogi]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: <em>[to himself]</em> O Master, where are you now? I must speak to you about this. I will concentrate on you and see where you are and what you are doing.</p>
<p><em>[Gorakshanath sits down and begins to concentrate.]</em></p>  </div>
