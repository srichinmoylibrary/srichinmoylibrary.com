<p>Yesterday was Thanksgiving, so Sumati went to visit her parents. Once upon a time her parents did not like me, but now they have changed their opinion about me.</p>
<p>When Sumati told her family about my weightlifting, her brother got furious and said, “He is a spiritual man. What is he doing bodybuilding?”</p>
<p>The father took my side. He said, “What is wrong? If one has capacity in any field, one should show it to the world. If I had that kind of capacity, I would also show the world.”</p>
