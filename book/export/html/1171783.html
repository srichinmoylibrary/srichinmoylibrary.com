<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How I wish to kill myself running! If I can kill myself running, then perhaps I can become a good runner. By dieting and not running, one becomes weak and at the same time one remains a useless runner. So it is better to lose weight by running than by dieting. At least if you die, you are dying for a good cause, and Heaven's door will be wide open for you because you died on the battlefield of running.</p>  </div>
