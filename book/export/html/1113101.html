<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, he should seek a Guru because a Guru is one who can expedite his spiritual knowledge, spiritual wisdom, spiritual journey. If one studies books, it will be to his advantage. But mere studying will not be enough to grant him realisation. Again, if someone reads spiritual books and has a Master, then reading adds to his inspiration and aspiration.</p>  </div>
