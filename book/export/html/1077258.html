<p>Incredible, but true. In his first marathon attempt, in the 1952 Helsinki Olympic Games, the fearless runner paced himself with marathon world-record holder Jim Peters, and then relentlessly increased the pace until his competitor was forced to drop out. Zatopek went on to win the gold medal and set a new Olympic record.</p>  </div>
