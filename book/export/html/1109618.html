<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A great philosopher will talk and talk about God. But a good seeker does not talk, because his prayers and meditations are all consciously directed towards God. So a good seeker is infinitely more important to God than a great philosopher, because the seeker is trying to establish his oneness with God prayerfully, soulfully and eternally. A great philosopher is talking about God in a particular language that is called philosophy, but he is not eager to have direct contact with God. He does not care to see God, to feel God, or to grow into God-consciousness.</p>  </div>
