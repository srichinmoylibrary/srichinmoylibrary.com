  <h1 class="book-heading">What does God look like?</h1>
  
 
<p>When I look at you, God looks exactly as you do. If I look at your mother, God looks like your mother. And if I look at someone else, then God looks like him. If I should look within myself, I would find that God looks like Chinmoy. Although you may not see this now, when you are able to see deep within yourself, you will know that each of us cannot be considered separately from God.</p>
<p>Now I am holding my two fingers together. As you see, if I try I can pull them apart. But if, rather than fingers, they were you and God, I could not separate them, no matter how hard I tried. In fact, the more I tried to separate the two of you, the tighter you would stick together.</p>
<p>Because God is in you, God looks exactly like you. Right now, you are God veiled. You have put on a mask, but I see through the mask. In the future, you will be the God unveiled. You will take off the mask and we shall see you as God manifested, the open God.</p>  </div>
