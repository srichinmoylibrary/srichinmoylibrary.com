<p><em>Yogi:</em> In order to conquer your fear, stay near me in your consciousness. Always.</p>
<p>In order to conquer your jealousy, give me all your mental fantasies.</p>
<p>In order to conquer your doubts, shout at your stupid mind as vehemently as possible. Also, there is an easier and more effective way. When doubt wants to assail you, just throw it into my boat. I shall sail it to the shores of total and perfect annihilation.</p>  </div>
