<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the particular human being with whom He is dealing. God is a perfect gentleman. If a teenager, especially a young girl, giggles, then God returns the giggle in a more powerful manner. If a seeker feels inner happiness and smiles at God, then God gives him an infinitely more soulful smile in return. And if a carefree person laughs and laughs, either to forget the pressures of the world or to feel that the world is all illusion, then God also laughs, for it is true that the world is an illusion for those who believe in illusion. God says, "If you believe in illusion, I want to please you by bringing everything to you as illusion." So whenever we laugh, God returns our laughter, for He does not want to remain indebted to anybody. It is we who have to decide whether we shall offer God a soulful smile, a silly giggle or our stupid, shameless laughter. But whatever we offer, God will return it, for He does not want to remain indebted to us.</p>  </div>
