<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know the motive. The mother sees that the child is drowning. She may not be able to know that it is God’s intention that she stay on earth and look after her other children. Only she sees that her son is drowning, so she tries to save him. Then, if she dies, this is not suicide.</p>  </div>
