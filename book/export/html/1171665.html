<p>Put both hands right behind your head. Say, "My God-disappointment-past."</p>
<p>Now put the fingers of your right hand on your forehead, in between your eyebrows. Say, "My today's silver dreams."</p>
<p>Put your right hand on your heart and form a small circle. While forming a circle, feel you are forming the circle with light. Say, "My tomorrow's golden realities."</p>
<p>Clench your fists. Say, "I must immediately shake off my God-disappointment-past so that my Lord Beloved Supreme can smilingly and proudly grow, glow, sing and dance inside my today's silver dreams and my tomorrow's golden realities."</p>  </div>
