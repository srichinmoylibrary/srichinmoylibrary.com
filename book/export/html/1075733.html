<p><em>(London. K.D. Ghosh, with his wife, sons and daughter, comes to the residence of Mr. Drewett. Benoy, Mano and Auro will stay there.)</em></p>
<p>MR. DREWETT: Good morning, Mr. Ghosh. Come, come, my young friends! <em>(Looking at Mrs. Drewett)</em> You were praying for a child. Now God brings you three in a row.</p>
<p>MRS. DREWETT: Thank God. Mr. Ghosh, I shall love them as if they were my own children. <em>(Caressing Auro)</em> I shall teach you English myself. I will not let you go to school at this tender age.</p>
<p>MR. DREWETT: I shall teach you Latin. I shall help you in every way. My young friend, I can brook no delay. Come, let us start our Latin lesson. Just repeat what I say.</p>
<p>Father - Pater</p>
<p>Mother - Mater</p>
<p>Brother - Frater</p>
<p>Sister - Soror</p>
<p>Son - Filius</p>
<p>Daughter - Filia</p>
<p>And now please repeat all the words by yourself.</p>
<p><em>(Auro's answers are perfect.)</em></p>
<p>Wonderful, your memory is wonderful.</p>
<p>AURO: Sir, what is the Latin for "God" and "Goddess"?</p>
<p>MR. DREWETT: Well, "Deus" and "Dea." What made you ask this, my boy?</p>  </div>
