<p>In the half-marathon I lost over a minute because of Databir. First I was screaming because he didn't see me. Then, he delayed me because he didn't have the ERG ready for me. He had put the ERG on one side of the road, near his car, and was standing on the other side of the road. He said, "Do you need ERG?" Then he had to run across the street to get it.</p>
<p>When you stop to drink ERG or water, for two hundred metres or so you lose your rhythm and your strides become short. Then you start getting back to your normal pace.</p>
