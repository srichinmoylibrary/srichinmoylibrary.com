<p>Today at 4:30 a.m., after many, many months, I went out to walk. I was enjoying myself like anything. After one mile I came back.</p>
<p>At my 800-metre mark a short but very fat lady was waiting for the bus. As soon as she saw me, she said, "Mr. Chinmoy, what are you doing at this hour?" Then she said, "Have a very nice day."</p>
<p>I said to her, "The same to you." She smiled.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" she was asking me. She could see that I was walking! I had never, never seen her before.</p>
