<p>Kanu used to cry at every second, either when he was downstairs or when he was upstairs with me in my bed. And sometimes he would fall off my bed and cry.</p>
<p>Cheese, medicine, food, water â€” no matter what I tried to give Kanu, always he gave me a hard time.</p>
<p>One of our disciple boys loves the two dogs so much. Kanu started crying this morning, and then that particular disciple also started crying.</p>
