<h2>The Ideal of Forgiveness</h2>


<p>Slowly the queen of astral virgins moves<br /> Across the giant embrace of teeming clouds.<br /> Below, the runnel meanders murmuring high.<br /> The panorama of the moonlit gloom<br /> Captures the hearts of the lovers of beauty's core.<br /> Our earth's splendour and delight now grow sublime.<br /> The trance that guides Vasishtha's fire-pure hut<br /> Is far beyond all mortal's straining view,<br /> No equal his trees and buds and flowers have.<br /> The flood of their torrent magnificence compels<br /> Eden to bow to them with all its lustre.<br /> A dart of sombre pangs tortures its heart.<br /> It cries aloud, "O Lord! behold my balk.<br /> My pride is broken, I am now a piteous thing."</p>
<p>Quintessence of deep peace in his sage eyes,<br /> With a dawning smile Vasishtha in silence commands,<br /> "Arundhati! some salt from the mighty sage<br /> Vishwamitra I desire, therefore, speed forth."<br /> "Thy words break all my body, I see my doom.<br /> Sorrows of the whole world within me rage.<br /> Alas! no soul to soothe my woeful heart.<br /> It was Vishwamitra, the cruel king,<br /> Who slaughtered my hundred sons of endless knowing.</p>
<p>My children's spirit-stirring hymnal song<br /> I hear no longer; alack! my heart no more<br /> Feels now their calm and joy of the Spirit's gaze.<br /> Thou art, my Lord, the root of my bosom's pangs.<br /> For thee have passed beyond the eternal bars<br /> Those hero-fires sprung out of my flesh.<br /> Why stayed thy voice back from the saving words<br /> 'Vishwamitra, truly the greatest sage'?"<br /> Through the deep of night Vasishtha unveiled the truth.<br /> "My love for him is boundless, Arundhati,<br /> Infinite sparks of bounty within me burn.<br /> The knowledge supreme he has still to con: O then<br /> How can I falsely title him Brahman-rapt?<br /> To be the seer divine his bosom craves.<br /> Unique his high aspiration's fiery wings."</p>
<p>Flushed quivering with tempest-ire had come<br /> Vishwamitra, unbeheld, to the sage's cote.<br /> "The time is ripe, I must slay him, if he still<br /> Pronounce me not the God-omniscient sage."<br /> Suddenly a vision revealing flashed through his mind<br /> As he heard the matchless seer's bounteous words.<br /> Down he fell and kissed the Master's hallowed feet.<br /> "Arise, O king of all the seers, arise."<br /> "Alas! my sire, shame not this mortal self.<br /> The titan eyes of my naked cruelties<br /> Deserve not, I know well, thy pardon divine."<br /> From vastness-stilled summit Vasishtha spoke,<br /> "What urgent need impels thy advent rare?"<br /> The doleful voice of Vishwamitra broke,<br /> "My heart now flames to own Brahman, the One.<br /> My bosom's Lord, fulfil my white desire."<br /> "Speed thou to Ananta — the eternal Snake,<br /> The endless upbearer of this created sphere.<br /> Doubt not my love shall ever harbour thy soul."</p>
<p>"O Lord Ananta! thy grace sublime I invoke.<br /> Reveal the sunlit path to know the One."<br /> "Vishwamitra, that stupendous power I have.<br /> But ere I fulfil thy choice, thy strength divine<br /> I needs must weigh. Become thou now all ears.<br /> Seest thou the earth's globe? — that whole vast is mine!<br /> If thy strength is sure to hold its mighty weight<br /> To thee I shall give the knowledge of the Sole."<br /> The proud sage-king replied, "Upon my head<br /> Leave all: I shall bear the earth's gigantic load."<br /> Lo! he was sunk in disaster's greatest gulf.<br /> Alas! too fast the globe moved round his sense,<br /> The ceaseless terror tortured his living veins.<br /> No volcano-will could calm the universe,<br /> A tenebrous void before his mere man's form.<br /> But Ananta smiled and spoke: "Thou hast known at last<br /> The measure of thy might. Hear me, O sage!<br /> Use for thy strength the fruits of the company<br /> Of sacred souls if any such thou knewest.<br /> Call to thy aid at once the memory<br /> Of their high mood. Away from thee shall pass<br /> Danger." In a twinkling Vasishtha's giant name<br /> Broke on his mind. Ananta's high command<br /> He carried out. All silent was the earth.<br /> Tranquillity was in flood within its heart.<br /> "O Lord Ananta! now fulfil my quest."<br /> "O reckless fool! Vasishtha's bounty implore.<br /> None on this earth but he can meet thy hunger.<br /> The enormous power of his diamond presence<br /> Saved thee from perilous juncture and strengthened thy heart<br /> To bear the colossal earth, O unseeing soul!<br /> Go pray his haven, the time is fleeting fast."</p>
<p>He came again to high Vasishtha's hut.<br /> How base his doom no soul on earth can dream.<br /> "O Master, I beg of thee, by thy feet august,<br /> Drive me not from thy door this time, I pray."<br /> "Thy eagle-high aspiration clasps the Crown.<br /> Vishwamitra, to thee I give victory.<br /> Envy and pride could veil thy mind, and so<br /> The knowledge supreme I gave thee not before.<br /> Thy humble mind and brave heart win it now."</p>
<p>What is chimera's mist or miracle today<br /> Was the immaculate Truth divine of yore.<br /> Immeasurable by our human thought<br /> Was regal Vasishtha's presence and bright power.<br /> But from Above yet greater souls unmatched<br /> Over our Ind imperishably shall lean.<br /> The might of seers antique shall fade away<br /> Before the souls to come with Light new-born;<br /> And she shall sit on splendour's throne in the world.</p>
