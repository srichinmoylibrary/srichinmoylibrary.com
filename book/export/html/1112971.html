<p>I meditate. I meditate not out of curiosity. I meditate out of necessity.</p>
<p>I meditate not out of fear. I meditate out of love.</p>
<p>I meditate not out of possessiveness. I meditate out of selflessness.</p>
<p>I meditate on God not because God is great. I meditate on God because God is good.</p>
<p>I meditate on God not because God will give me everything I want. I meditate on God because God will give me only the things that I need.</p>
<p>There is a special reason why I meditate. I love to converse with God. He is such a charming conversationalist, and I am a charmed listener.</p>
<p>I meditate to unlearn and to learn. I meditate to unlearn my earth-bound mind-education. I meditate to learn my Heaven-free heart-aspiration. I am my heart's hunger-cry. God is His Heart's Feast-Smile.</p>
<p>Some people think that I am not practical, while others think that I am not sincere. Still others think that I am stupid. We all know that criticism is the order of the day. Such being the case, how can I expect to be an exception? Again, in all sincerity, I must tell the world that perfection is still a far cry in my life. I have made an inner promise: I shall fear no criticism when I am right; I shall ignore no criticism when I am wrong.</p>
<p>Meditation is the flowering of my confidence in myself and my confidence in God. I have no confidence in human beings, precisely because I know them and precisely because I do not know them. I have complete confidence in God not because of my helpless life, but because of my sleepless heart. I have complete confidence in myself not because God is my only choice, but because He is always His unconditional Boon.</p>
<p>When I do not meditate, conscience torments me, peace hides from me, joy deserts me and satisfaction ignores me. When I meditate, God's blue Eye blesses me, God's green Heart embraces me and God's red Feet shelter me.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, when I hear God's Voice, I open my inspired eyes and meditate. During my morning meditation, God says to me, "My child, go and prove to the world that you are all for Me." Late at night, when I hear God's Voice, I close my tired eyes and meditate. During my night meditation, God says to me, "My child, lo and behold, you are of Me unmistakably and eternally."</p>  </div>
