<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Always ask yourself at every moment, “How can I please my Guru more? How can I fulfil my Guru more?” Then, in your daily activities, in hundreds of ways, you will be able to make yourself conscious of what you will be able to do for your Guru and you will not forget anything.</p>  </div>
