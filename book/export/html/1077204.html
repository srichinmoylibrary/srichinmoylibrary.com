<p>The scientist Einstein enjoyed the humourist Einstein far beyond our imagination. At times, even before he offered his humour-world to others, he enjoyed it so much himself that it totally engulfed him. Naturally this produced boundless satisfaction and delight in his listeners.</p>
<p>The French writer Romain Rolland, who became very good friends with Einstein, told the world something highly significant about his friend. Extreme seriousness and extreme amusement were mutually happy and perfectly safe in the mind-home and heart-home of the scientist: <em>“He is very much alive and fond of laughter. He cannot help giving an amusing twist to the most serious thoughts. ”</em></p>  </div>
