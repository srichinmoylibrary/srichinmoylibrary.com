<p>My road crew is very good, but sometimes when I give them a job, they forget to do it. Then, I bark at them like anything.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wanted to run only 400 metres, and when I didn't see any mark, I said, "Perhaps I made a mistake." I went on running farther and farther. Finally it became one mile — 800 metres one way and 800 back. My road crew had forgotten to measure that route.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I had them drive that way in a car and we discovered that I had run one mile extra.</p>
