<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Mother India was shedding tears of gratitude because you are all Americans and you have accepted me so devotedly and soulfully. When Mother India sees that children from another shore have accepted her son as their own, very own, she is very happy. Mother India was shedding tears of gratitude because I love you people and you people also love me. In my acceptance of America and in Americaâ€™s acceptance of me, we have become one.</p>  </div>
