<p>The opposite of fear is strength and strength comes from confidence. A human being may unconsciously cherish fear because he does not have enough confidence in himself. He may feel that somebody or something else is more powerful and therefore he is afraid of that person or thing. But if he feels enough confidence in himself, then he cannot be afraid of anything or anybody on earth.</p>
<p>Fear exists precisely because we do not feel that the Almighty is our Source. We feel that fear is something which exists for everyone in our daily life. No. Fear cannot exist if we see the opposite of fear which is strength, inner strength, inner power; and the source of this inner power is the soul.</p>  </div>
