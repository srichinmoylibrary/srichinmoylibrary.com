<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A student who is trying to be spiritual must have a good feeling toward her earthly teachers, for it is God Himself who is teaching her through her earthly teachers â€” for a special purpose.</p>
<p>God is both earth-teacher and Heaven-teacher. When He plays the role of earth-teacher, He tells His students that no matter how ignorant they are, still He is ready and eager to teach them And when He plays the role of Heaven-teacher, He tells His students that He and they are one and inseparable. He is the tree and they are His leaves, flowers and fruits.</p>  </div>
