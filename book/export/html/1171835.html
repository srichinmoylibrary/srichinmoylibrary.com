<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here the strength is aspiration. During meditation, how can you develop more aspiration in order to go deeper. When you meditate, please do not think of diving deeper. If the mind operates, then you will not be able to go deeper at all. When you feel that you are in a sublime meditation, you will see that the meditation itself has its own power. So you only have to try to surrender to the meditative power within you. At that time do not use your mind. If you are having a profound meditation, then there cannot be any intervention of the mind. The meditation that you are having is the result of the meditative power within you. Just allow this meditative power to play its role. This meditative power will always have a free access to the deeper reality within you. Let it dive deep within if such is the Will of God. But sometimes the meditative power does not enter into the inner or deeper reality because it feels that the entire being is not fully ready. If it enters into the inner reality, there may be a revolt from the outer being. So when you enter into deep meditation, let the force that has already created this sublime meditation flow or grow inside you according to the Will of the Supreme. At that time do not bring your mind forward in order to go deeper or higher. The force that has already shown you its capacity can easily carry you into the deeper parts of your being, but it waits for God's Command or the Command of the Inner Pilot,</p>
<p>When you start meditation, the only thing you do is to make your mind calm and quiet, and then let the meditation do anything it wants to do. You do not act like a doer any more; your responsibility is over. When you have made your mind calm and quiet, your responsibility is totally over. Then you have to let the force, the divine force that is giving you the experience of a good meditation, do whatever else it wants to do in you and for you.</p>
