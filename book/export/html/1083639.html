<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul can tune itself to the harmony of the Supreme provided the soul is constantly conscious of its promise to the absolute Supreme. What is its promise? Its promise is God-revelation and God-manifestation on earth. God-revelation is necessary for earth's inspiration and aspiration. God-manifestation is necessary for Heaven-realisation and Heaven-perfection on earth.</p>  </div>
