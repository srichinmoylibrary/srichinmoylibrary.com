<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind is all the time dissatisfied with its position, with its capacity, whereas the heart is satisfied with its capacity, its capacity of identification. The mind doesn't identify itself with any reality; it constantly separates itself from the reality and feels it must judge the reality. Very often it takes the help of doubt, its best friend, or suspicion, to help in its assessment of reality. But the heart doesn't do that. The heart feels reality lies only in identification. Identification is eventually transformed into inseparable oneness; and it is only in real oneness, universal oneness, that we get true peace, light and satisfaction.</p>  </div>
