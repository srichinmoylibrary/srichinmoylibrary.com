 <p></p>
<h2>Perfection-Goal</h2>

<p>Perfection is the seeker's fulfilling realisation and fulfilled manifestation. Everything else has dawned on earth save perfection, perfect Perfection.</p>
<p>Perfection is the tree.</p>
<p>Perfect Perfection is the fruit.</p>
<p>Man's speculation about perfection is his ignorance. Man's concentration on perfection is his knowledge. Man's meditation on perfection is his wisdom. Man's contemplation on perfection is his world-illumining, world-transforming inner eye.</p>
<p>God's Message is Perfection. Man's message is temptation.</p>
<p>God's Message is Perfection. Man's message is frustration.</p>
<p>God's Message is Perfection. Man's message is destruction.</p>
<p>Perfection-Goal and the freedom-soul go together. He who reaches the state of freedom-soul has conquered his inner life and immortalised his outer life. He is the chosen instrument of God. He is the direct channel of God. He is the representative of God here on earth.</p>
<p>Cry and try.</p>
<p>When we cry to see the transcendental Light and when we try to perfect our outer nature, our perfection does not remain a far cry. Perfection is ours.</p>
<p>Exert and control.</p>
<p>When we exert the divine in us and control the animal in us, perfection begins to dawn within us. The flower of perfection blooms.</p>
<p>See and be.</p>
<p>When we try to see the truth with the Eye of God, not with our own eyes, and when we consciously try to be the surrendered instrument of God, perfection in no time dawns. The Golden All of perfection beckons our aspiring hearts. It is true that perfection cannot be achieved overnight. Realisation cannot be achieved all at once. It takes time.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story. A young seeker once came up to a spiritual Master for initiation, and was duly initiated. Then the following day he said, "Master, now that you have initiated me, you have to give me realisation. I want to see God."</p>
<p>The Master said, "My child, how is it possible for you to realise God in one day?"</p>
<p>Two days later, he said, "Oh, I want to realise God."</p>
<p>The Master said, "You are not ready."</p>
<p>A few days later, again the same request: "Master, I want to realise God." He had not completed his task. He had not launched into the spiritual path properly. Just the other day the Master had initiated him, but now he was crying for realisation without following the proper method. Without swimming in the sea of aspiration, he wanted to realise God.</p>
<p>On his way to the Ganges for a dip, the Master invited this particular disciple to come with him. As the two entered the water, the Master pressed the disciple's head underwater for a couple of minutes. When he released it, the Master asked, "What did you feel when I was pressing your head into the water?"</p>
<p>"Master, I was gasping for air. I was practically dying and I thought I would not survive. The moment you released me, I got my life back." The Master said, "If you can come to that same state of consciousness and feel that without God you cannot live even for a few minutes, you will realise God. You will realise God at that moment on the strength of your highest aspiration. Your brightest inner flame has to be kindled, and then you have to cry — cry for God as a child cries for his mother. Only then is God-realisation possible.</p>
<p>The disciple learned the lesson. Truly and soulfully he entered into the spiritual life and listened to all his Master's dictates. Wholeheartedly he launched into the spiritual life. He felt the necessity of freedom from the domain of desires. He felt the necessity to grow into the mounting flame of aspiration, constant aspiration. Then realisation for him was not a far cry. He did realise God.</p>
<p>When we use the term 'Heaven', we feel that Heaven is all light, delight and perfection. But where is that Heaven? It is deep within us, in the inmost recesses of our hearts. High Heaven, higher Heaven and highest Heaven are all within us.</p>
<p>When we offer our soulful thoughts to our brothers and sisters, we live in high Heaven.</p>
<p>When we offer the results of our soulful actions to mankind, we live in higher Heaven.</p>
<p>Finally, when we offer our soulful existence to humanity at large, unreservedly and unconditionally, we live in the highest Heaven.</p>
<p>We can live in the highest Heaven every day. God has given us the capacity. He has given us the potentiality. It is we who have to manifest our inner potentiality and capacity. We are all surcharged with indomitable inner courage. Unfortunately, we do not use our inner unlimited capacity. We use our outer limited capacity. We are afraid of diving deep within. Inside is the treasure. Inside is the key. We do not know where we have put the key. We have totally forgotten. We do not know where the treasure lies.</p>
<p>At this point we see the need for a spiritual Master who knows where the key is and where the treasure lies. He does not give something of his own to the seeker. He only brings to the fore the seeker's inner wealth. God-realisation is not his sole monopoly. Everybody will realise God, without fail. It is a matter of time. One realises God today on the strength of his inner inspiration. Another realises God tomorrow on the strength of his sincere aspiration. Everybody will realise God at God's choice Hour. Again, those of us who are sincere seekers can expedite our journey. We can walk towards our goal. We can march towards our goal. We can run towards our goal. If we run, naturally we shall reach the goal sooner than those who are walking towards their destination.</p>
<p>Perfection-Goal. Perfect Perfection here on earth has to be manifested, but how? We have to start our journey with inspiration. We have to feel every day deep within us in all our activities the necessity of inspiration. Without inspiration there can be no proper achievement. Then we have to go one step further. After inspiration we have to feel the momentous necessity of aspiration. Inspiration is not all. We have to aspire to reach the Golden All, to see the golden Shores of the Beyond, the ever-transcending Beyond. This is what we expect from aspiration, the mounting flame within us.</p>
<p>But aspiration is not enough either. We have to meditate. Aspiration includes meditation. When we meditate, we have to feel that we are entering into Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. These are not vague terms, but our true possessions. To some day enter into our own divine possessions — Infinity, Eternity and Immortality — is our birthright.</p>
<p>Then, when we become advanced in our meditation, when meditation starts offering us its fruit, we enter the realm of realisation. We realise the highest Truth in this body, here on earth. We do not have to go elsewhere to realise God. We do not have to enter a Himalayan cave or sit on a snowcapped mountain in order to practise spirituality. No. Here on earth, in the hustle and bustle of life, we have to practise spirituality. We have to accept earth as it stands, as it is. If we are afraid of earth, if we shy away from earth, then God-realisation will always remain a far cry. Here on earth we have to realise the highest Truth.</p>
<p>But even realisation is not enough. After realisation we have to reveal our realisation. If we do not reveal our realisation, we act like a miser, hoarding our treasure. This is not right. We have to offer our realisation in the form of revelation to mankind.</p>
<p>Yet revelation is not enough either. We have to enter into the domain of manifestation. If we do not manifest what we have realised here on earth, if Mother Earth does not receive the fruit of our realisation, and if she does not have it for good, we can never be truly fulfilled. Mother Earth has to be fed with the fruit of our realisation. Here on earth the manifestation of realisation has to take place; and when manifestation takes place, perfection is bound to dawn. Perfect Perfection is nothing other than the absolute manifestation of God's transcendental will here on earth.</p>
<p>We are all seekers of the infinite Truth. It is our bounden duty to rise high, higher, highest. Each human being has come into the world with the message of perfection. No human being on earth will remain unrealised. No human being on earth will remain unfulfilled. No human being on earth will remain imperfect.</p>
<p>Realisation, fulfilment and perfection: these are three brothers. Realisation is the youngest, fulfilment is the middle and perfect Perfection is the eldest in the family. These three brothers must go together. They have to walk along the field of aspiration. They have to swim in the sea of meditation. They have to fly in the sky, the blue welkin of contemplation. God-Realisation, God-Revelation and God-Manifestation can take place only when man feels that he has to transcend himself. His goal of today is not the ultimate Goal. Today's goal has to be transcended tomorrow. Today's goal is the foundation-stone. Every moment we have to transcend ourselves and, while transcending, deep within us we shall cherish the message of perfection.</p>
<p>Perfection is bound to loom large and important in all our activities if we feel that aspiration is the only thing we need, the only thing we are striving for. In aspiration lies the key that can ultimately open up the door of perfect Perfection.</p>  </div>
