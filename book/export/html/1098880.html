<p>Every afternoon, right across the street from the Consulate, one old man used to come and sell ice cream from a little cart. We used to hear his music and then we would go and buy ice cream. My favourite was the Good Humor bar â€” coconut flavour. It used to cost only ten cents. Almost every day I bought one. But in winter the old man did not come.</p>
<p>On the days when I had very little money, that ice cream bar became my lunch.</p>  </div>
