<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> You say that I have made<br /> Tremendous improvements<br /> In various areas of my life.</p>
<p>You say that I am losing<br /> Fast, very fast,<br /> My heart's insect-insecurity,<br /> My mind's elephant-doubt,<br /> My life's uncertainty-dream.</p>
<p>I know You are telling me the Truth,<br /> My Lord Supreme.<br /> But tell me, where are they going<br /> After they have left me?</p>
<p>"Ah, My child, they are going back<br /> Slowly and quietly<br /> To their source: Ignorance."</p>
