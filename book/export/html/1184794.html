<p>Man's most desired light<br /> Is in his heart's inner cry.<br /> There his wisdom rules;<br /> His eyes have the healing touch.<br /> His is the life that was<br /> Once-upon-a-time<br /> A weak human cry.<br /> But now he is inseparably one<br /> With endless height<br /> And<br /> With endless delight.</p>
