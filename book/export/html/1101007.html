    <title>Question: I read in an article about a Japanese scientist who did an experiment on water crystals. He observed the crystals from different environments in the world, and he discovered that when water is in a very spiritual environment, the crystals are very beautiful. But when the water comes from a very polluted environment, the crystals change forms to become very ugly. He put love&#039; on a glass of water overnight and &#039;hate&#039; on another glass of water overnight. In the morning, he observed that the crystals with the word &#039;love&#039; had become very beautiful and those with the word &#039;hate&#039; had become very ugly. Is there any spiritual significance to this experiment?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely it happens in the crystals! I have heard it, but I have never practised it. How to interpret the experience? The person who is dealing with the experiment is the right person to do that. I will not be the right person to give an adequate answer because I have never tried it. But it is true, absolutely true, that these things happen.</p>  </div>
