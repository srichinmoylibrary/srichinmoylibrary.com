MSUN 406-407. These two questions were asked by Mrs. Hanne Strong, wife of Maurice Strong, Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, when Mr. and Mrs. Strong met with Sri Chinmoy at UN Headquarters on 25 February 1992.</p>
<h2>Question: The degradation of the earth is so far advanced right now that the great mystics, shamans and spiritual people are saying that we have already crossed the line of no return regarding the oceans, the soil and the forests. What is your opinion?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we start doing the right thing, the earth can always start making progress again. Because of our stupidity we are destroying the ocean; we are turning it into a few drops. But if we start doing the right thing, then eventually the drops will form an ocean again. Sometimes it happens that there are no plants in a garden. But when a most skilful gardener begins working there, once again the garden will start producing most beautiful plants, flowers, trees and fruits.</p>  </div>
