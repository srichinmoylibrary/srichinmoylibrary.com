<h2>Question: Isn’t it beneath your dignity to put up with the behaviour of some of your disciples?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, nothing is beneath my dignity. That is the trouble. By becoming one with God’s Will, I cannot say that anything is beneath my dignity. Impossible! Since God is inside everyone and everything, I also have to serve Him everywhere and in everyone.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have to stay with somebody who is very undivine. I am caught inside his ignorance. Here I am dancing. But I can’t say it is beneath my dignity. Only I made a mistake, a bad mistake, when I accepted that particular person as my disciple.</p>  </div>
