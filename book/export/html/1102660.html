<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People are afraid of spirituality because they do not know what spirituality is. Spirituality is not something foreign; it is not something vague. Spirituality shows us our true life and our only goal, and that goal is the realisation of the Infinite within us and without. If people knew the real significance of spirituality, they would in no time embrace it. Spirituality seeks to energise humanity. Without spirituality, humanity would remain always in the dark.</p>
