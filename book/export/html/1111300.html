<p>I was running around four-thirty in the morning when I saw a tall, thin black man was running ahead of me. When he saw a garbage can, he went over to it, removed the cover and threw it onto the owner's lawn. Then he went on to the next one. After he did this to four houses I said, "O God, I am not going to run with him," and I went in another direction.</p>
