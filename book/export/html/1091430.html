<p><em>Governor Macias:</em> You have come at the very time when we are trying to go to the final stages of establishing peace in our province and in our country. Hopefully, if the peace efforts of the government succeed, we can start to pick up. Definitely your visit to our province will energise that peace effort.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We feel that no sincere effort ends in vain. If we have made a most sincere effort, it has to be successful. The only thing is that sometimes we try to get this success in our own way and at our own time. But God has His own fixed Hour. God will definitely give us the peace that we desperately need, but in His own Way.</p>
<p>God is like a soccer player. When the soccer player dribbles the ball, he makes all the players and the members of the audience feel that he is going to kick it with his right leg to score. But at the last moment he fools everyone and uses his left leg. He achieves his goal and scores; only he has used the other leg.</p>
<p>God is playing His divine Game in and through us. We expect Him to play the game in our own way. But He says, "Why do I have to play the game in your way? As long as I take you to the destination, you have to let Me do it in My own Way and feel that I am doing the right thing."</p>
<p>But again, we are also doing the right thing by working for peace. That is why God is so proud of us. Right now I am very proud of the Philippines for having achieved a degree of peace for some time.</p>  </div>
