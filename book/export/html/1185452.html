<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on his faith. If he has implicit faith in the Master and if he feels that the Master is really sincere, then it is advisable to listen to the Master all the time. But I donâ€™t want him to make a mistake, a blunder, by blindly following the teacher when he does not have implicit faith in him.</p>  </div>
