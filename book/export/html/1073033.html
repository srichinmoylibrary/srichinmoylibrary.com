<p>During a meditation at the United Nations on 4 April 1975, Sri Chinmoy invited members of the United Nations Meditation Group to give him spiritual words (poem 1 to 22).</p>
<p>Four days later, during a meeting in Queens on 8 April 1975, Sri Chinmoy again invited spiritual words, this time from his disciples (poem 23 to 50).</p>
<p>As each word was offered, he spontaneously created a poem based on that word.</p>  </div>
