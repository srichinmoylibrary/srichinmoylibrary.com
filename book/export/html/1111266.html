<p>The day before yesterday I was running by the Indian grocery near our old gym. An Indian family was standing beside the grocery. As I came by, a young boy of eight or ten began calling his mother, "Mom, look, Sri Chinmoy is running, Sri Chinmoy is running! We haven't seen him for a long time."</p>
<p>He called his mother, but I had disappeared before she could come out of the store.</p>
