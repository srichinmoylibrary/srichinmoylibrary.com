<p>A particular message of Emil Zatopek should be imprinted on the tablet of every runner's heart: "You must be fast enough. You must have endurance. So you run fast for speed, and repeat it many times for endurance."</p>
<p>Another significant message he has offered to us: "There's a great advantage in training under unfavourable conditions." For when victory dawns, everything becomes sweet, illumining and fulfilling. At that time, unfavourable conditions are no longer seen as unfavourable but as necessary steps to bring to the fore the runner's ultimate capacity.</p>  </div>
