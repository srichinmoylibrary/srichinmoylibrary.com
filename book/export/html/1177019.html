<p>What can you expect<br /> From your idle body<br /> That thinks it is very active?<br /> What can you expect<br /> From your ugly vital<br /> That thinks it is very beautiful?<br /> What can you expect<br /> From your impure mind<br /> That thinks it is very pure?<br /> What can you expect<br /> From your insecure heart<br /> That thinks it is very secure?</p>
