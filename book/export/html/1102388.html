<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The higher and deeper your meditation, the more your face and outer being will radiate. At that time, your friends and colleagues will see and feel in you something that is new but also very familiar, although they do not know what it is. Why familiar? Because we have all come from the same Source. The day you meditate well they will see a tremendous change in you. They will try to know what has made you so divine on that day. So your own example — not only your example but your very presence — will inspire them.</p>
