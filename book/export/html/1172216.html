<p>"Payton Jordan finally is getting what he deserves. Within the next few weeks 'Payt' officially will retire from Stanford University and also be inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.... One of the most popular men in the sport's history, Jordan already is enshrined in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics and the Helms Athletic Foundation Halls of Fame....</p>
<p>"... Making a deep niche in history, Jordan has set 26 age-group world records and lost only one sprint race since becoming a 55-year-old."</p>
