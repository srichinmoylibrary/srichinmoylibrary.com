<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The secret to the art of self-perfection can be found in self-giving. There can be no other way to perfect yourself than to give yourself to the right cause â€” not in a blind way to whomever you see on the street, but to the right person. Who is the right person? The right person is God. If you want to give yourself to the best thing, the most perfect thing, then you have to go to the One who is best in yourself, and that is God, the Inner Pilot. In order to become perfect, you have to mix with the One who is already perfect. If you mix with Him and give to Him what you have, then He will tell you how He has become perfect.</p>  </div>
