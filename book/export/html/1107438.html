<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not we who are the culprits. Some mischievous forces are moving around us all the time. We are not the destructive forces; we have not created them. But we have allowed them to operate in and through us. I am not a thief, but if I allow a thief to do something wrong, then I am as bad as a thief or I am equally responsible. The origin of these forces is not always in the physical; it can be in the subtle vital or subtle physical. These forces can come from the subtle planes. It is true that we are not the doers, but we allow them to work in us. I am not going to steal, but if I help you to steal, am I not as bad as you are?</p>  </div>
