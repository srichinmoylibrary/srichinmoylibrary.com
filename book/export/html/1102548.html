<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no difference between God's Messages and the soul's messages. God's Will and the soul's will are the same, for the soul is the representative of God. The soul resides inside the heart. God's Concern is offered to the heart, and the heart offers it to the entire being. When we are aware of God's constant Concern, we will not make any mistake. When God's Concern becomes ours, we feel that God is the Doer, God is the Player, and we are only the instrument. And God, being the Supreme Musician, will naturally play most divinely and supremely on us.</p>
