<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God shows us what work we must do if we can soulfully promise to Him that our work will be nothing but an extension of His divine Manifestation. Then He is bound to show us our work. But if our work is an expansion of our ego, God does not recognise us; at that time we are nothing but strangers to Him.</p>  </div>
