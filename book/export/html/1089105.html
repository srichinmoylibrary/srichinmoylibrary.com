<p>Although Goshal could not kill Mahavira, he did create serious physical problems for this great soul. Because of Goshal's destructive attack, Mahavira suffered from a burning sensation in his body. This went on for many years.</p>
<p>Mahavira's disciples were very distressed to see their Master in this condition. They begged him, "Please tell us how you may be cured."</p>
<p>"Only one person can cure me," Mahavira said. "Her name is Revati. She is an extremely devoted seeker. She is beautiful in her heart and in her life. You will find her in the village of Shavasti. If you go there and beg for alms, she will give you sweetmeats. Those sweets will immediately cure me."</p>
<p>The disciples hurried to that village and Revati gave them sweetmeats. As soon as Mahavira ate them, his pain disappeared completely.</p>  </div>
