<p>In Calcutta I went to a restaurant and asked for a lassi. On the bill the waiter gave me, it said "5 Rs."</p>
<p>So I went to the owner and said, "Five rupees for one glass?"</p>
<p>The owner said "Who has given you this?"</p>
<p>I pointed to the waiter. The man said, "Oh, he cannot have been mistaken. He has been working here for 50 years."</p>
<p>In Bengali the words for 50 and 15 are very different, so definitely the man said 50 years.</p>
<p>Then I looked at the waiter and said, "Tell me how old you are."</p>
<p>The waiter said, "I am 21."</p>
<p>I said, "You are 21, but you have been working here for 50 years! You deserve five rupees."</p>
<p>As I was coming out of the restaurant, the owner called me and said, "Since I was mistaken, you have to give me only half the price." Then he gave me three rupees back.</p>
