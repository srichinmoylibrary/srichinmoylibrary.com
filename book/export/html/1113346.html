<p>Nolini-da said to me: "Chinmoy, go and ask Priti (Manoj's sister) if she and her sisters, her brother and her friends can come tonight to listen to my talk. If all of them can come, I am ready to read out my article."</p>
<p>I went to Priti-di's place and asked her. Priti-di immediately said: "Go and tell Nolini-da that his time is our time. Needless to say, we are all unworthy of his boundless affection and love. All of us will definitely come to his place tonight."</p>
<p>Then Priti-di lovingly reprimanded me. "Chinmoy, it seems to me that you don't have the right pronunciation. You are mispronouncing my name. My name is Priti. Pri is long and ti is short. You are pronouncing both as short. Anyway, I forgive you. Let me tell you about a most significant incident in my life. When I was in my freshman year at college in Bengal, I bought a copy of Nolini-da's <em>Adhuniki</em> and sent it to him for his autograph. Do you know what he wrote? He wrote ' <em>Sneher Pritike pritir sange'</em> (To dear Priti, with love). You simply can't imagine how happy and delighted I was when I received Nolini-da's blessingful affection and love. And then when I saw him here in the Ashram for the first time, he spoke to me with such heavenly affection, love and concern that the experience will always be with me."</p>  </div>
