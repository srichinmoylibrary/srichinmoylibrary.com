<p>Once Shivaji wrote a letter to the great poet-saint Tukaram, inviting him to come to his palace. Shivaji had heard much about the saint and had developed the highest admiration for him.</p>
<p>But Tukaram declined his invitation. He sent a message back, "O King, you have invited me to come to your palace, but I do not find any necessity to come. You will present me with gifts, but I do not need anything from you. If I want to eat, there are trees bearing fruits. When I walk along the street, I see that people have discarded their old and used clothes. I can use them if I need clothes. If I want shelter, there are many caves all around. What else do I need on earth? I cannot accept your invitation, and I do not need anything from you."</p>
<p>Shivaji immediately realised his mistake and he went personally to see Tukaram, walking barefoot to honour the saint.</p>  </div>
