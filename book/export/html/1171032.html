SCA 563-566. On 11 November 1998 at Tweed Airport in New Haven, Connecticut, Sri Chinmoy lifted a fully fueled twin-engine Beechcraft plane using a modified standing calf-raise machine. The weight of the plane, the fuel and the lifting apparatus was 13,040 lbs. After the lift, Sri Chinmoy was interviewed by a reporter from the <em>New Haven Register</em>.</p>
<h2>Reporter: You lifted heavy things like planes and elephants many years ago. What made you resume it again now?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wanted to see if age has anything to do with physical fitness. I have found that it is our human mind that creates the problem. If we can go beyond the mind by challenging the mind, then the physical body obeys us. But the mind makes us feel that we are very old.</p>
<p>Now I am 67 years old. The moment I use my heart, I feel that I am 20 years old. So I try to use my heart when I do these kinds of weightlifting feats. When I use my heart, I feel oneness with the aeroplane. Everything helps me and everybody helps me when I use my oneness. Whereas if I stayed in the mind, I would not be able to lift heavy weights at all.</p>
<p>The human mind is full of division at each and every level. Our mind appreciates our right hand more than our left hand, for example, even though they are both part and parcel of our body. Since the right hand is stronger than the left, our mind prefers our right hand.</p>  </div>
