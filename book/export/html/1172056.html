<h2>Question: Where is the best place to meditate for purity?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best place is the heart. Meditate on the heart, and the moment you feel the presence of light there, bring it into your navel. Then try to imagine that the navel centre, the vital, is constantly circling or that there is a disk that is rotating all around it. It is going on, going on. And while it is turning, you just repeat, "Supreme, Purity, Supreme, Purity." Or you can say, "Purity is the Supreme, the Supreme is Purity." That is even easier.</p>  </div>
