<p>Nature is so cruel to us! To run 26 miles is not enough. It also has to be so windy and cold! Is it a joke? We say nature is kind. We are all the time trying to be as natural as possible and become one with nature's beauty. But nature has been so hostile to us — both in the Jersey Shore and the Long Island Marathons.</p>
