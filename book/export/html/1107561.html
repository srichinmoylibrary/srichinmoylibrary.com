  <h1 class="book-heading">Liberation</h1>
  
 
<p>Liberation is the freedom from limitation and suffocation. Liberation is the transcendence of the body-consciousness. The body consciousness is the “I-ness” song, the song that says: “I have and I am.” Liberation is the embodiment of Eternity’s poise and Immortality’s voice. Eternity is God’s Silence-Vision. Immortality is God’s Sound-Manifestation. Poise is the God-Beauty in man. Voice is the man-duty for God</p>
<p>A liberated man is he who has smashed the shackles of birth and death. Birth is a painful cry. Death is a fruitless sigh. A liberated man is he who does not suffer from self-created ignorance. Ignorance is the unreal in us. The unreal is the source of all our teeming maladies. But our own birthless and deathless aspiration-ascent is the panacea for all these maladies.</p>
<p>Aspiration is Heaven-power. Heaven-power continuously sings and dances with enlightenment. Desire is earth-strength. Earth-strength is afraid of enlightenment. Enlightenment is not a boon. It is not even a gift. Enlightenment is a supremely fulfilling unfoldment from deep within.</p>
<p>Illumination, liberation and realisation. These three are inseparable friends. These are the rungs in our aspiration-ladder which reaches the highest Absolute. Illumination conquers darkness. Liberation conquers ignorance. Realisation transforms both darkness and ignorance so that we can become a perfect instrument which is used by the Absolute Supreme in His own Way.</p>
