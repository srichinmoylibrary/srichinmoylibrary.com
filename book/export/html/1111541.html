<p>Today when I went out on a short run, for at least two hundred metres I was following Prabhir. Then, after that I didn't see him at all. What happened to him I don't know. I was waiting for the light to change and I was looking forward. When I started running again, I didn't see Prabhir. At one point I turned around, but I saw only Dorothee from the Zurich Centre, who came out of the blue. Prabhir always reminds me of John Landy, the world champion runner.</p>
