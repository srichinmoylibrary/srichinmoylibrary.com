<p>Before he writes a book<br /> He reads ten books<br /> Written by others.</p>
<p>After he has written his book<br /> He stops reading altogether<br /> Books written by others.</p>
<p>He reads and reads and reads<br /> His book until he empties<br /> His appreciation-mountain,<br /> Admiration-ocean, adoration-moon<br /> On his beloved creation-son,<br /> A mere book.</p>
