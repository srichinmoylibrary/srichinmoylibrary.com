<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the sea? Some were destroyed and some were lost in the sea. When things are destroyed, what can you do? I can again get them from the world where I first got them. I have that capacity, but why should I utilise it? I write now far better than I did when I wrote the epic poem in my notebooks. Why do I have to go back for it, even though it was nice?</p>  </div>
