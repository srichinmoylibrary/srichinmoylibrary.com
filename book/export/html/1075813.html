<p><em>(Aurobindo's house. Seated two of the inmates. March 29, 1914. Time: evening.)</em></p>
<p>A: Well, I have seen a new arrival from France meeting Aurobindo to-day. Do you know anything of her?</p>
<p>B: Only this much that in France she was carrying on Sadhana almost on Aurobindo's lines â€” of course, without knowing it; and, what's more, she had several visions of someone she called Sri Krishna!</p>
<p>A: Interesting! Wonderful, too! Then?</p>
<p>B: And the very moment she saw Aurobindo, she recognised him as the Krishna of her vision.</p>
<p>A: What predestination! This is the way the Divine does His work!</p>
<p>B: And you have marked how simple and affable she is as if she has come home to her own people.</p>
<p>A: That's my feeling too. Over and above that, she inspires regard.</p>
<p>B: Quite natural for her personality, for one who could see Aurobindo inwardly from across the seas and who could tread the path the Master has chalked out for us here.</p>
<p>A: I marvel at the coincidence.</p>
<p>B: We may marvel, without doubt. The coincidence seems a symbol of West joining East in a great synthesis.</p>
<p>A: That is exactly my feeling.</p>
<p>B: Let us put this question to the Master. Let us hear him on the point.</p>
<p>A: Very well. To-morrow itself, if possible.</p>  </div>
