<p>Plato, a man of noble birth and deeds â€”<br /> Socrates conquered his life.<br /> The words of his guide highly ever he preached.<br /> His brain, a naked knife.</p>
<p>Through him his youth revealed an athlete great.<br /> To him utterly owes<br /> Philosophy and the budding minds of today.<br /> Fearless, ever he glows.</p>
<p>The deathless day that brought his soul on earth<br /> Appeared in secret again,<br /> To close his diamond eyes and bind the world<br /> With sombre ceaseless pain.</p>
