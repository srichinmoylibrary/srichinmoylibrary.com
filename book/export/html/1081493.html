<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For a few minutes after you wake up, for four or five minutes, don't get up; just meditate in bed. Before you leave the bed, it is always advisable to think of the Supreme for a few minutes. Then get up and do your proper meditation. But you have to be sure you get up in three or four minutes. Otherwise, you will just go back to sleep and you will say that you have meditated for two hours.</p>  </div>
