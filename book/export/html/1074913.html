<p>I DON'T PRAY</p>
<p>I don't pray.<br /> Why?<br /> Because God does not need my prayer.</p>
<p>I don't pray.<br /> Why?<br /> Because man does not understand my prayer.</p>
<p>I don't pray.<br /> Why?<br /> Because my enemies don't believe in my prayer.</p>
<p>Finally I have come to the conclusion that<br /> I don't have to pray.<br /> Why?<br /> Because my friends believe that I always pray.</p>
