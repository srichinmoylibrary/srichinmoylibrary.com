<p>Most of the people who work at the USAir ticket counters near the place where I run are black. An elderly black lady is the supervisor, and there are two other black ladies and one white lady.</p>
<p>The other day I showed them some recent pictures of Sudhahota running with me.</p>
<p>I said, "May I show you something? This is Carl Lewis." They were so happy to see the picture.</p>
<p>Then I was telling them about some of the prominent black figures whom I have met over the years. I mentioned Muhammad Ali and 'Big Man" Clarence Clemons, Mokshagun. I also mentioned Eddie Murphy, Narada, Reverend Jackson and my hero, Jesse Owens.</p>
<p>Then I said, "I know Roberta Flack; she is a very close friend of mine." As soon as I said "Roberta Flack," how thrilled the ladies were. You have no idea how much people love Addwitiya!</p>
