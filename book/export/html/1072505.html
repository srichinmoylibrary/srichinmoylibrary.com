<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The awakening of Kundalini is dangerous only when the seeker is not pure enough. If the seeker is impure on the physical, vital or mental planes, if he has not developed a sufficient amount of purity in his entire being, then it is dangerous. If the seeker is pure, and if it is Godâ€™s Will that the Kundalini power be awakened in him, then it will not be dangerous for him at all.</p>  </div>
