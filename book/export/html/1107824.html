<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We cannot express or explain these higher states of consciousness. Go deep within and feel and experience. It is not a matter of explanation but of realisation. One's highest experience can never be expressed in words. As soon as you have to explain, you have to come down, and in order to convince, you have to come down further.</p>  </div>
