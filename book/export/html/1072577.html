<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you get tired, try to sing inwardly and soulfully, especially the “Invocation.” Then, while you are singing, feel that God Himself is listening to your soulful song and appreciating you. In this way you can easily keep your aspiration high even though outwardly you are tired and exhausted.</p>  </div>
