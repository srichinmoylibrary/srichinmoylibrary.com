<p>An unprecedented thing took place in Cologne on the 27th. It is the very beginning of something unique. "Peace: God's Beauty in His Oneness-Home" has started radiating its divinity and immortality all over the world.</p>
<p>The Germans have spent thousands and thousands of dollars. But I tell you it is not their money-power that achieved this tremendous success. It is their heart-power, oneness-power and cooperation-power that has succeeded. Heart-power, oneness-power, money-power: all the powers should go together.</p>
<p>Over eight thousand people came. Needless to say, they did not come to see the musician in me. They came to me to see a God-lover and peace-distributor. The inner peace that I have and that I am is what they felt long before they even came to the concert. So peace-lovers are the ones who have come to our peace concert.</p>
<p>God's fondest child is peace. Whoever needs peace in life, in his entire being, is bound to be the most perfect instrument of God.</p>
