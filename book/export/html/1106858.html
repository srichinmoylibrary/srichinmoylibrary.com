<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People realise God only by doing one thing â€” loving God. And how do people love God? By praying to God and by meditating on God. I always say that love has to go from the few to the many. You started by loving your parents. Then you came to feel that your brother also is so affectionate to you, and you loved him. So, like this, you go from loving your parents to loving your dear ones, and then to loving your neighbours, your country, the world and, finally, the universe. God is both the Creator and the creation. When you can love the entire creation, God will tell you, "Look, you are loving my whole creation and my creation and I are one. I am very pleased with you. You can realise Me as your own."</p>  </div>
