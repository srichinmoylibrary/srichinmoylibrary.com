<p><em>Beth Day Romulo:</em> I will soon be going to India as an official guest of the Government. They're going to take me around and show me what they think I ought to see and have me interview various people in the government and in the arts. I look forward to it. What should I look for in India?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you look for India's inner wealth, you will be happy. India's inner wealth means the message of the ancient Vedic seers and sages. I spoke about the restlessness of the Philippines. You will see the same kind of restlessness in India â€” if not worse. Outwardly there is so much fighting taking place in India. Even in the name of God they are fighting. The India of yore offered the message that all religions are one. But today, because of one particular temple, the whole nation, the whole subcontinent, is suffering.</p>
<p>If you only look at the outer life of India, I am sure you will be disappointed. But if you are looking for the inner divinity of India, then I am sure you will be satisfied. India is like the ocean. On the surface there are frightening waves and huge surges. But if we dive deep within, we see it is all peace and poise.</p>
<p>The inner India has not lost its peace and divinity, but the outer India is all restlessness and discord. Many things that are destructive and undivine you may see in the outer life of India. But everything that is positive, constructive, illumining and fulfilling will be found in the inner life of India. The outer existence of India may seem deplorable, but its inner existence is something unique. I say this not because I am an Indian but on the strength of my oneness with the soul of India.</p>  </div>
