<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one wants to, one can concentrate on God or on the Christ, Buddha or any other spiritual figure. But even that is not necessary. What is of paramount importance is not to allow thoughts to enter into the mind. But if one wants to repeat Godâ€™s Name, one can do so.</p>  </div>
