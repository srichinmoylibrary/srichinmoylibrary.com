  <h1 class="book-heading">Rogue Taxi Drivers</h1>
  
 
<p>Twice yesterday a taxi driver took advantage of me. In the first incident, the ride was supposed to cost 400 yen, but the man kept driving around until the meter said 1,600.</p>
<p>In the evening another taxi driver took me to the wrong street. I was showing the driver the map, but even then he brought me to the wrong place. He told me in Japanese, "I don't know." What a rogue! I was so furious! In Japanese he apologised.</p>
<p>In Queens some taxi drivers charge $100 for a $10 ride. Such corruption!</p>
