<p>God is my personal experience. In Him is my life's confidence. With me is His assurance in life and death and beyond time and space. I live for God. I live to serve Him with my heart's surrender and with my soul's joy. He lives for me. He lives to present me with His all-transcending Vision, to transform my existence into His heavenly Reality.</p>
<p>When I look up into the skies, He is unchangeable. When I look into the world, He is all changing. Backward I look. He is veiled. Forward I look, He is revealed. When I look within. He is never new. When I look without. He is never old.</p>  </div>
