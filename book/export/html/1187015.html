<p>You have committed so many blunders<br /> That you now feel<br /> You can no longer become perfect.<br /> But that is absurd, absurd!<br /> Your Beloved Supreme<br /> Will never be satisfied<br /> Unless and until you become perfect<br /> To prove to Him that His Vision of you<br /> Was absolutely perfect.</p>
