<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Of disciples who strictly follow the discipline that I impose on them I have about fifty. There are admirers and persons interested in the teachings who come to my lectures and form a much bigger group. These have no obligation but they cannot have me as their teacher. If, for example, something disagreeable in their family comes to happen, I am not obliged to give them help.</p>  </div>
