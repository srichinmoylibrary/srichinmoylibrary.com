<p><em>Madal:</em></p>
<p>Chinmoy, very often humanity on the whole greets the spiritual masters with <em>derision</em>. Why?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>O, Madal, I think humanity greets only the self-styled and unrealised spiritual masters with <em>laughter and mockery</em> and not the genuine spiritual masters. Again I must say that at times even the good and true spiritual masters are greeted with foul mockery and laughter. In such cases, I must say that humanity is not ready to accept their divine light. I feel extremely sorry both for the unaspiring humanity and for the self-giving spiritual masters.</p>  </div>
