<p>This afternoon Garima gave me a book to read. The title of the book is Age Doesn’t Matter Unless You’re a Cheese — a super-excellent title! Two or three wise sayings I read out, and I got immediate inspiration to write a book with a similar title.</p>
<p>This is the title of my book: Age Does Not Matter. [fn:4] I shall read out a few pages. The first page reads:</p>

<p>“Age does not matter,<br /> Unless you love to surrender<br /> To your age.”</p>

<p>During my birthday week we shall publish the book.</p>
