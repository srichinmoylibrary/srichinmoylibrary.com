<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything is a degree of truth. Such being the case, philosophy is also a degree of truth. The truth that philosophy embodies may be earth-bound; again, this truth may be Heaven-free. When philosophy gives us the message of renunciation, when it tells us to go beyond, then it becomes something more.</p>  </div>
