  <h1 class="book-heading">George Washington</h1>
  
 
<p>Born February 22, 1732</p>

<p>A divinely-inspired dream, daring and desperate;<br /> A surprise that made history.<br /> A farmer's son founds the New World.<br /> "Inferior endowment from nature," he thought himself.<br /> But the Divine made him His efficient instrument.</p>
<p>High character and majestic will powerfully blended<br /> With courage and capacity,<br /> Stood forth the Man of the Hour,<br /> The Man of Destiny, the Man of God,<br /> And from his mighty dream mightily<br /> Executed burst forth a new free world,<br /> Destined to be the hope and defence of more<br /> Free worlds to be.</p>
<p>Victory in the War of Independence —<br /> England lost to her own offspring,<br /> Now a powerful foe;</p>
<p>England won for herself a mightier friend.<br /> A new era heralded,<br /> A new shattering blow struck<br /> At man's domination over man —<br /> Independence the first step to unity —<br /> And unity, one Truth of God.</p>
<p>George Washington, first to embody America's hope,<br /> First in inspiration, first in confidence, first in war,<br /> First in victory,<br /> First in conquering the heart of his Nation,<br /> First to envisage a federation of states,<br /> Single, powerful, united, whole.</p>
