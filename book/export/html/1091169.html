<p>Imagination carries me into the skies to see God. Inspiration carries me to the farthest corner of the globe to see God. Aspiration tells me that it will bring God to me from above. Vision tells me that it will bring God to me from afar. Realisation tells me that I have not to go anywhere to see God. To go elsewhere outside to see God will be an act of sheer stupidity. For God to come to me from elsewhere is absurdity. God is where I am.</p>  </div>
