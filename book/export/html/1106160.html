<p>I have been studying many, many pictures of Bill Pearl. In each picture I see clearly a different inner wealth. One is flooded with power, one is flooded with compassion, one is flooded with determination. Each picture of his, each pose, has a very, very special significance for me in the inner world. He reveals his inner strength and power through his outer body-manifestation. And it is no exaggeration, no exaggeration!</p>
