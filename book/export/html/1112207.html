<p>I was running and walking early in the morning in Yogyakarta. It gave me such joy. Today, for the first time, I walked for one hour. On other days, I walk for forty or fifty minutes. Today it was one hour. After I crossed over the mile mark, I saw Savita and Ankhi. Then I went a mile and a half and I saw Indu and another girl. Running here is so beautiful. Farmers are ploughing their paddyfields and nature's beauty is all around. I was walking and walking so happily.</p>
