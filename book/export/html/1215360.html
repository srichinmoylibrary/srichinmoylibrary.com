<p>About two months ago, when I was warned by a quarter, I very faithfully bent down and picked it up. Since then, I have picked up pennies, nickels, dimes and so forth. Today also I got a penny. I bent down very devotedly so that I would not displease Mother Lakshmi. If Mother Lakshmi becomes mad, she can turn someone into a street beggar, so we have to be very careful.</p>
