<p><em>Mr. Quinones Vidal introduces the Master:</em> <em>Here with us is a representative of spiritual philosophy from the Orient. Although many great Masters have come from India like Buddha, Ramakrishna and others, I don't want to say that philosophy belongs to India because philosophy, like religion, is universal and does not belong to any particular country.</em></p>
<p><em>I greet Sri Chinmoy Kumar Chose with much love in the name of the station WKAQ and in the name of this program, Quinones Vidal. It is a pleasure to have such a noble person on our program.</em></p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>Earth's cry meets heaven's smile, part 3</em>, Agni Press, 1978<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/ecmh-389e1</p></small>    </div>  </body>
