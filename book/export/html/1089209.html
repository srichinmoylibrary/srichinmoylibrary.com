<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Those days were filled with an inner cry for God, and I meditated for hours and hours a day. I also read the Indian scriptures such as the <em>Mahabharata.</em> Then I lived in an ashram in Pondicherry, India, where I spent every day in strict spiritual discipline.</p>  </div>
