<p>Today was the first day I attempted to lift 320 pounds and it was also Agraha’s birthday. In the morning I tried to lift the weight four times, but I did not succeed. Then Agraha made such a sincere and fervent request for me to try again that I did try again late in the afternoon. That time I did it.</p>
<p>Yesterday was Unmilan’s birthday, so I was honouring both Agraha and Unmilan with my lift. Without Unmilan’s machines, my weightlifting does not exist.</p>
