<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only a slight difference between delight and bliss. You can see the difference between delight and bliss in a very simple way. Delight takes a liquid form. It is like water, a vast expanse. Bliss is something thick and condensed. Bliss does not spread. It does not have the capacity nor does it want to spread. Everything it has; it stays in one place. But delight flows and spreads. Bliss does not want expansion, but delight wants expansion, the expansion of its capacity. Also, in delight there is subtlety, transparency and light. Inside delight there is light in a flowing form. Light is flowing in delight.</p>  </div>
