<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They do not have to go to the soul’s world. When they are sitting in a meditative or contemplative mood, immediately they know that you are doing the right thing, but their ego and their jealousy do not allow them to admit it. Even in a dream perhaps they will see that their children are doing absolutely the right thing, but they do not want to admit it. If they admit it, then they will be embarrassed because previously they were wrong.</p>
<p>Good parents only want happiness for their children. Unfortunately, they sometimes become jealous when they see that their children’s happiness is coming from a different source and not from them. They wanted to give happiness to their children and they could not. But from an Indian the children are getting it. This the parents find difficult to bear.</p>  </div>
