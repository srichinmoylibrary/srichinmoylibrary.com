<p>Human life is beset with difficulties, anxieties and worries. We are constantly assailed by these destructive forces. But he who practises spiritual discipline can remain far above the snares of these negative forces and enjoy supreme relaxation by virtue of detachment-light. To quote U Thant’s brother, U Khant: “He [U Thant] is one of the fortunate men who have the capacity to cast aside care and relax, however anxious the situation. He has that power of detachment in a most remarkable degree.”</p>  </div>
