<p>I hear a still small voice in the depth of my heart.<br /> It tells me that now is the only time for me<br /> To become great in the outer world,<br /> And that now is the only time for me<br /> To become good in the inner world.<br /> My greatness is from God the omnipotent Creator.<br /> My goodness is from God the omnipresent Liberator.</p>
<p>Now is the only time to do God’s Will.<br /> What is God’s Will?<br /> God’s Will is that I should never try to earn<br />        anything from God.<br /> I cannot earn anything from God.<br /> Indeed, that is an impossible task.<br /> Indeed, that is an absurd notion.<br /> I can only cheerfully accept from God<br /> What God unconditionally gives me.<br /> Needless to say, God grants me at every moment<br /> What He has and what He is.<br /> But alas, where is my receptivity?<br /> I know God has a special Will for me.<br /> He always wants to take the initiative.<br /> He wants me to follow Him.<br /> He tells me that I am not going to lose my personal<br />           freedom.<br /> On the contrary, I shall increase my freedom,<br /> For His Freedom-Vision is carrying me to my<br />         destination<br /> Which is flooded with Perfection-Delight.<br /> In this connection, I have also discovered<br />         something very important.<br /> There is a great difference between these two<br />         realisations:<br /> I am one with God’s Will and God is one with<br />         my will.<br /> I am one with God’s Will. What does it mean?<br /> It means that I am swimming in the ocean of<br />         God’s Wisdom-Delight.<br /> God is one with my will. What does it mean?<br /> It means that God is more than willing to be<br />         with me in my ignorance-night<br /> With His infinite Compassion-Light.<br /> To know God’s Will, surrender is the real way.<br /> Indeed, that is the road for me.<br /> I can weather all the storms of my inner life<br />         and outer life<br /> When my existence becomes unmistakably and<br />         unreservedly<br /> A surrendered flower-heart.<br /> God tells me. “True, you do not know Me,<br />         but your surrender-life knows.<br /> True, you do not love Me,<br />         but your gratitude-heart loves.<br /> Your surrender-life is my cosmic Vision-Seed.<br /> Your gratitude-heart is my cosmic Reality-Fruit.</p>
