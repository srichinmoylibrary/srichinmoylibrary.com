<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the divine life, consecration is fulfilment. But it is not the kind of fulfilment we get when we achieve something in a particular field. That kind of outer fulfilment we call success, whereas divine fulfilment comes only in progress. Progress means an upward, inward or forward journey. Each time we consecrate our body, vital, mind, heart and soul to a higher or inner cause, we are proceeding forward; we are climbing upward and diving inward. And this movement is continuous progress.</p>
<p>Consecration is self-giving to the Divine. It is through self-giving that we eventually become godlike. So let us consecrate all our good qualities, our very existence, to the Divine in others. Each human being houses a few good qualities and a few bad qualities. If we offer our own good qualities to the good qualities of others, it is like two persons joining in a tug-of-war against ignorance; naturally the divine forces shall win. This is the correct and safe way to transform ignorance and change the face of the world.</p>
