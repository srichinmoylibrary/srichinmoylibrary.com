<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is a difficult question to answer. There are some politicians who do not want to disclose their names, but they do take my help secretly. They don't want to be exposed; they don't want to attach themselves to the so-called religious or spiritual life. But when we have soulful meetings, they come and join us in their capacity as seekers and not in their capacity as politicians.</p>  </div>
