<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In some countries it is true that people are growing away from organised religion and running towards meditation. In other countries people are still practising their religions faithfully, and some feel that religion is the only answer. Over the course of time, many people from various religions have practised meditation without feeling that it presented any obstacle to their religious beliefs. On the contrary, they saw that meditation increased the power and the light of their own religious beliefs.</p>
