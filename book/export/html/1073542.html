<p>God, do You have a minute? I have to ask You something. My mother says that I have to love You every single day. Is she right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your mother is right.”</p>
<p>“How can I love You when I don’t know You very well?”</p>
<p>“Let Me tell you what to do. It is true that you don’t know Me well, but you know your mother pretty well. From today on, try to love your mother more. The amount of love that she needs from you she will keep for herself, and the rest she will give to Me. We shall share your love. O.K.?”</p>
<p>“Thank You, God.”</p>  </div>
