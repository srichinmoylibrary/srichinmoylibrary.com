<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, among your disciples, is there anyone who has cast <em>aspersions</em> on you while speaking to others about you?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, I donâ€™t think that any of them would make <em>derogatory criticisms</em> of me. First of all, my disciples are not so unkind. And then, I am also not as bad as you think.</p>  </div>
