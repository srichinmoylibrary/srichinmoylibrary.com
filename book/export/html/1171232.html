<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The German mind is not stubborn at all. A German has a scientific brain, and that brain sometimes operates in and through the mind. You cannot say that the German mind is stubborn or rigid, no. In the German mind there is a kind of solid power. That solid power is not always dynamic. It wants to enjoy rest. When it does not want to operate, you may say that the German mind is stubborn. When solid strength is not utilised for a divine purpose, then you may call it stubborn because it is not moving forward, it is not turning towards light at that time. Otherwise, by nature, the German mind is not at all stubborn.</p>  </div>
