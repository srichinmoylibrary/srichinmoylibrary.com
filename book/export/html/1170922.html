<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your question has to be answered either by God Himself or by the disciples like you who are most sincerely and most devotedly trying to manifest my divinity’s light on earth. It depends on the disciples who are sleeplessly trying. Again, sleeplessly one can try, but at the same time if sincerity, eagerness and enthusiasm are missing, then one’s sleepless effort will be of no avail. One can work for hours and hours, but if there is no sincerity, eagerness or enthusiasm, then nothing can ever happen to establish my light.</p>
<p>The answer to your question can adequately be given either by God Himself or by the disciples who are trying to manifest me all over the world. I am the last person to be able to answer that question.</p>  </div>
