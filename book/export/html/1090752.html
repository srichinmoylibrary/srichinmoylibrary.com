<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Think of the time when you had your highest meditation, three months ago, or yesterday, or this very morning. Just imagine it, and try to enter into it. After a while, imagination will grow into reality, and you will enter into deep meditation.</p>
<p>Another way is to feel that your Guru is hungry. Feel, “I have not fed my Guru and he is very hungry. It is time for me to feed him. He asked me to feed him, but I am loitering or roaming about in the streets. I am such a bad fellow, such a rascal.” You can immediately increase your aspiration by thinking that through your meditation you are feeding me. If you have that idea, immediately your heart will compel you to meditate.</p>  </div>
