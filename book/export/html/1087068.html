<p>Before leaving for San Francisco, I went with X to buy a new bow for my esraj. There were seven flutes in the store and I decided to buy the cheapest one, which was for beginners. The man said, "Do you want the one in the showcase or would you like to have a new one?" I took the old one, which cost $206. This was the cheapest beginner's flute. It is so useless that I can't play it.</p>
