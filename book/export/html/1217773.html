  <h1 class="book-heading">Death</h1>
  
 
<p>Death is natural. Nothing natural can be detrimental. Death is rest. Rest is strength in disguise for a further adventure.</p>
<p>At the present state of human evolution, to conquer death may be an impossibility. But to overcome the fear of death is not only practicability, but inevitability.</p>
<p>Death is the hyphen between man's growing fear and his shrinking life-energies.</p>
<p>Death is normally the sign that the soul, under the particular circumstances, has exhausted the possibilities of its progress in a particular body.</p>
<p>When the strength of possibility loses to the strength of impossibility, it is called Death.</p>
<p>A useless life is a cordial invitation to Death.</p>
<p>The valley of the shadow of death cordially invites all, without exception and without preference.</p>
<p>He who prefers Death to Life has only to climb up the Tree. But he who prefers Life to Death has not only to climb up, but also to climb down a gain to do God's work.</p>
<p>When Death approaches a man, his psychic being says to Death, "Death, just wait, let me see what I wish to work out in the next birth." Death says, "You want life, evolutionary growth. Sorry, you are asking a favour from the wrong person. One second's delay on my part may add something to your experience!"</p>
<p>Death says that it is immortal. Man's achievements say: "Death, you are right. But the truth of the matter is that we shine perpetually upon your very breast. Not only that, we shine forever in you, through and beyond you."</p>  </div>
