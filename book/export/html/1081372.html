<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Beauty's evolving manifestation in man is man's increasingly conscious awareness of his ultimate height and his God-ordained mission on earth. The more he is aware of his transcendental height, the sooner he will be manifesting beauty. His God-ordained mission is to expand his own inner and outer reality. His inner reality is his dream; his outer reality is his conscious appreciation of his own achievements.</p>  </div>
