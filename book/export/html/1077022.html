<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you dream of me, that means you are actually receiving one part of my being. When you see me in a dream, part of your physical being, part of your vital being or part of your mental being is receiving me. Or instead of a part, it can be the whole being; the whole physical being, vital being, or mental being can receive me. But if it is a part of your physical being, or the physical being proper, if it still has impurity in it, it will be frightened to receive and welcome the Master. If it is the vital being or a part of the vital being, it may be frightened because of its aggressive and stubborn qualities. If it is a part of the mental being or the mental being proper, it may be frightened because of its obscurity and lack of wideness.But there comes a time when the disciple has made considerable progress in the spiritual life. The moment he receives his Master with part of his physical being or the physical being proper, he feels a sense of tremendous joy â€” the joy that awakens him and makes him aware of the world within him and without him. Then if part of the vital or the entire vital being receives the Master, he feels that he is marching and running toward his destined Goal. And if part of the mind or the entire mental being receives the Master, then he feels that he is flying, flying in the sky of Infinity and Eternity. So, almost any part of our being can actually receive the Master in a dream.</p>  </div>
