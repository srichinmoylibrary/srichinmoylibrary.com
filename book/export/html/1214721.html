<p>President John F. Kennedy saw in U Thant a sun of wisdom-light. President Kennedy discovered in U Thant a colossal achievement.</p>
<p>In a telegram, President Kennedy declared: “The election of His Excellency U Thant is a splendid achievement in which the whole world can rejoice.</p>
<p>“Please express the congratulations of the United States Government to the United Nations membership for their action in electing so distinguished a diplomat to succeed the late Dag Hammarskjold.</p>
<p>“In preserving the integrity of the office of the Secretary-General, they have reaffirmed their dedication to the U.N. Charter....As he [U Thant] begins one of the world’s most difficult jobs, he has our confidence and also our prayers.”</p>
<p>Mr. Zenon Rossides, Ambassador of Cyprus to the United Nations, described President Kennedy’s response to U Thant’s handling of the Cuban missile crisis: “The most dangerous of all crises since the Second World War was resolved in a manner that prompted President Kennedy to say, ‘U Thant has put the world deeply in his debt.’”</p>  </div>
