<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you stay in our boat, do you sometimes not feel the urge to help other passengers or to inspire the boatman, even to look around and see where the boat is heading? There will come time when you have reached the destination. Then you yourself will be called upon to bring the boat with new passengers from this shore to the destination. If you are sleeping while the boatman takes you to the destination now, then when he asks you to do him a favour and take few passengers, at that time you will say, “I don’t know how to navigate the boat.” So always keep your eyes wide open.</p>  </div>
