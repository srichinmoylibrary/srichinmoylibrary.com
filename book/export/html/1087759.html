<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we create something we are revealing what we have felt. Our revelation is inferior to what we have felt, so we get a kind of inner pain or psychic pain. Also, when we create something sometimes an inner gratitude comes. This gratitude can manifest itself as physical pain. Tearful joy is extremely important. If you feel that the pain is from the Supreme, then take it as something most significant. Otherwise, please disregard it. The best thing is to offer our gratitude to the Supreme when we have manifested Him according to our capacity.</p>  </div>
