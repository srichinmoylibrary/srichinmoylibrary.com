<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ours is the philosophy of self-transcendence. Based on this philosophy, every day I am trying to become a better instrument of God. So in my case there is no such thing as an ultimate goal. As soon as I reach a goal, I know that my Inner Pilot will not allow me to stop. He will always want me to continue. As long as He grants me inspiration, aspiration and dedication, I will continue most faithfully attaining new goals.</p>  </div>
