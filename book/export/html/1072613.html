<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am fully aware that many of you are studying books that deal with occultism, but my sincere request to you is that you do not study books on occultism unless they were written by spiritual Masters or realised souls. Most of the books on occultism are collections of fanciful ideas. By merely studying books on occultism, one can never get even an iota of occult power. Books can teach the secrets of occultism, but one can only develop the powers by going deep within and enlarging oneâ€™s consciousness, or by sincerely crying to bring these hidden forces to the fore, hopefully for the sake of the Divine only.</p>  </div>
