  <h1 class="book-heading">Poise</h1>
  
 
<p>Once you have God-realisation, at that time your highest and best quality is poise. When disturbing, discouraging and disheartening things happen, outwardly they do bother me, absolutely as if I were an ordinary person. As a matter of fact, I am more profoundly affected than anybody else, because I am one with the entire world, so I am fully responsible for what is happening. When anybody does anything wrong, on the strength of my oneness with that person, I may become very upset and angry; I may be full of anxiety and worries. But in the inner world, I am not at all affected. Worries and anxieties may be ruling the outer world but, for a God-realised person, poise is ruling the inner world.</p>
<p>Once we have oneness with Godâ€™s Divinity, whether that Divinity is manifested or yet un manifested on earth, we shall definitely have boundless poise. We know that although today the creation is moving the wrong way, eventually it will move in the right direction. It is like a child playing football. This side and that side the child is running, but the mother knows that, after playing for a few hours, the child will come back home.</p>
<p>Poise is the real home of a spiritual Master. Outwardly he experiences the anxieties and worries of the whole world because of his identification with the world. Then again, he knows that he has a home where there is perfect peace, infinite peace, and that home is his poise.</p>  </div>
