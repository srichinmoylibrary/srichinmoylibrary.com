<p><em>Later that evening, Sri Chinmoy asked one of his disciples to perform something to entertain the others. When the disciple said he had nothing to perform, the Master made the following remarks:</em></p>
<p>Sometimes I ask you people to perform, but you don’t want to. You have a box with a treasure inside; only you are not parting with it. Some people keep their box under lock and key because there is nothing inside. People think that just because it is kept under lock and key there is most precious wealth inside. But no, as soon as they open it up they see that it is empty. But when I am pleading with you — please, please give us a little bit of your wealth — it is because you do have something. At that time you can really share it. So if you have wealth, and we are begging you to share it, you should share it. Otherwise, we have every right to feel that the box is all empty. You have to prove that, no, there is something inside the box. So take up the challenge.</p>  </div>
