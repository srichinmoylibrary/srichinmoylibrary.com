<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the Supreme comes to earth, without fail He will spend his vacation in Australia, and at the end of His vacation he will not forget to take with Him one kangaroo and one koala bear to Heaven, for those two cute animals are not available in Heaven.</p>
<p>But on the way, if the immigration authorities will not allow the Supreme to take His animals to Heaven, then He will borrow two most beautiful lambs from His Saviour Son and give them to the immigration authorities as bribes so that He can take a kangaroo and a koala bear safely to Heaven.</p>  </div>
