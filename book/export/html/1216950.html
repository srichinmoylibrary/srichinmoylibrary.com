<p>When I went to get radiation treatment for my knee, the technician said to me, "Are you <em>the</em> Sri Chinmoy from the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He couldn't believe it. He was showing me such love and such respect.</p>
<p>He asked, "Can I take your picture?"</p>
<p>I told him to take it and gave him a nice smile.</p>
<p>When I went back the following day, the technician asked, "Can I have a picture taken with you?"</p>
<p>His name was John. I gave him a T-shirt and he was so happy. He has run two marathons and now wants to run our marathon.</p>
