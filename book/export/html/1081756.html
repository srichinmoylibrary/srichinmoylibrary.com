<p>Why are you<br /> Wedded to worry?<br /> He who ranks above<br /> Your life-plan<br /> Is bound to protect you.<br /> Don't you know that<br /> This is your God's only business?<br /> Don't worry.<br /> Let me see what more<br /> I can do for you.<br /> Ah, I have a splendid idea.<br /> On behalf of God<br /> I shall liberate you,<br /> If you want me to,<br /> And<br /> If such is the Will of God.</p>
