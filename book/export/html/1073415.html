<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Face of God is our own highest, eternal Reality. The Face of God is the Reality which is Eternity, Immortality and Infinity. It is Reality in its purest form. Infinity, Eternity and Immortality are vague concepts to most of us. But if we say ‘face’, immediately it becomes something vivid for the physical mind. Our physical mind is convinced when we give a form to Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. If we say ‘face’, then immediately we know that there is somebody who has this face. The face may be beautiful or ugly, but at least it has some reality. If there is no face, then it is very difficult for us to comprehend the Reality which is revealed and expressed as Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.</p>
<p>When we speak about the Face of God, it is a matter of belief. When I am in my highest consciousness, my students enter into me or into themselves, and the Face of God is a reality for them. They feel Bliss or Peace in boundless measure. It need not even be my students. When I hold public meditations in New York, hundreds of people come and in their meditation they feel Peace, Light and Bliss in boundless measure. At that time a sense of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality looms large in their life of aspiration.</p>  </div>
