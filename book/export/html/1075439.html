<p>FATHER, BE CAREFUL!</p>
<p>Father, be careful!<br /> I am going to expose You<br /> This time.<br /> You have repeatedly told me<br /> That in fifteen years' time<br /> I would realise You<br /> And also far surpass You.<br /> I have been with You<br /> For thirty long, slow years,<br /> Yet for me God-realisation<br /> Is a far cry,<br /> Not to speak of surpassing You.<br /> Father, You are an impossible liar,<br /> And I am going to expose You<br /> Definitely,<br /> Mercilessly,<br /> This time.</p>
