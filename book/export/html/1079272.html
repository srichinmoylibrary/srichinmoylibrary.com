<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am now in a high plane of consciousness, but not in my highest plane of consciousness. I am in a calm plane of consciousness, where I can observe what is taking place in both the inner world and the outer world. I am right now in the psychic world, the world of the heart, where there is all love, all oneness. Here my heart is wide open. I have come here to be of service to the seeker in each of you, so my consciousness is the consciousness of inner dedication. We are sharing here. You are sharing your aspiration with me and I am sharing my realisation with you.</p>  </div>
