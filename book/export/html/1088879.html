<p><em>Caller:</em> I am particularly interested in astral Projection. I had an experience three years ago, where I left my body. I had just read about this some time before that, but I didn't do it consciously. It just happened to me. Since then I have been trying to do it consciously. I would like to ask Sri Chinmoy if this is safe. Is it a safe thing to go into by myself?</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> Interesting question. Astral projection, leaving the body. Can people actually do this?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People can do this, but it is advisable to have a teacher who is well qualified in this adventure. Otherwise, it can be a very dangerous thing. It is like learning to drive a car. One needs a teacher in the beginning. If someone tries to learn driving by himself, he is very likely to have an accident.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> What can a teacher teach one about leaving the body?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything can be taught by a qualified teacher. If one can learn a language from a teacher, if one can learn music, if one can learn to dance, one can learn this also.</p>  </div>
