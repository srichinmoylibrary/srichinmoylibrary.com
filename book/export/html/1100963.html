MHDI 20-23. The following questions were answered on 27 November 2005 at Pangkor Island Beach Resort, Malaysia, during Sri Chinmoy's annual Christmas Trip with his disciples.</p>
<h2>Question: Suppose somebody dies and they are supposed to go to a lower world. Then you help them inwardly and they go to a higher place. My question is, do you also help their spiritual consciousness so that when they go to that higher place, they actually fit in there, or is that soul like a kindergarten pupil in a high school class?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good question! The answer is, I raise their consciousness so that they can fit in. Otherwise, the souls who are in that higher world will say wonderful things about me! I raise their consciousness so that it is of the same standard as the souls who are already there. I have done this for the parents of many of my disciples because I love their children.</p>  </div>
