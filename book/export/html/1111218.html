<p>The day before yesterday, around 5:30 in the morning, three dogs came running after me. One little dog ran very fast and came within a metre of me. He wasn't barking; he was just running. I didn't even see this dog until it tried to bite my ankle. Luckily, a car went by and the noise scared the dog away.</p>
