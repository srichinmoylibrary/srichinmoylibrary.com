<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My favourite Indian joke is what happened the first day I came down from the highest type of <em>samadhi.</em> I forgot my name. I was trying to think of my name, but I couldn't remember it. Then it came to my mind that one of my school notebooks had my name on it. So I looked at the cover of the notebook and found my name. When I came down from that consciousness the second and third time, I had to ask my friends what my name was. My friends were my greatest admirers. They knew my realisation, so they didn't cut jokes with me.</p>  </div>
