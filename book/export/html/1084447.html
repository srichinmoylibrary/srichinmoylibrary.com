<p>Do you know<br /> Why God is so pleased with you?<br /> He is pleased with you<br /> Because<br /> You have realised<br /> That there is no stranger<br /> In the kingdom of humanity.<br /> Do you know<br /> Why God is so pleased with you?<br /> He is pleased with you<br /> Because<br /> You have realised<br /> That there is no intruder<br /> In the country of Divinity.</p>
