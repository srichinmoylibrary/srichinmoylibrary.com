<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know that there is a vast difference between a truly spiritual person and one who goes to church to pray for a half hour, obtains some peace, and then goes to a cafeteria and there abandons his peace. It is only when one meditates for many hours and firmly establishes this practice that he will obtain lasting results. If you can enter into your inner world and remain there for some time during your meditation, then the day will come when your peace will remain undisturbed and constant even when you are in the outer world, talking and mixing with people.</p>  </div>
