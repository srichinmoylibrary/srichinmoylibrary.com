<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one has great faith in his own religion, then he should cultivate the same type of faith in other religions, since all religions are important in God's Eye. Only he should not try to follow all the religions. Religion is like a road. If someone tries to walk along every road while heading towards his destination, then his progress will be very slow. This moment he is on one road, the next moment he is on another road and the following moment he is on a third road. Each time he changes roads in order to reach the destination naturally he is losing time. So the thing to do is to feel that each religion is true in its own way, but to walk only along the path of one's own religion.</p>  </div>
