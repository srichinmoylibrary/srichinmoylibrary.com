    <title>Question: The Preamble of UNESCO&#039;s constitution states that wars begin in the minds of men and it is there that they have to be eradicated first. I believe that the minds of men are changing, yet a general war is still a possibility. Would you comment?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is true that wars begin in the minds of men. If the mind changes, there will be no wars. But the mind will change only when it is transformed, and the only way to transform the mind is to bring the reality and divinity of the heart to the fore. The mind of humanity is changing, true, but it is going at the speed of an Indian bullock cart. At any moment the storm of doubt and the hurricane of jealousy can stop humanity's mind from proceeding further. Only if the heart's qualities come forward and illumine the mind, can we be free from doubt-storm and jealousy-hurricane. An illumined mind founded upon a loving heart can not only put an end to war but also expedite world-oneness, world-perfection and world-satisfaction.</p>
