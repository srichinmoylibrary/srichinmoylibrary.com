<p>There was a doctor who always treated the poor free of charge. He always went to their homes and offered them his heart's purest love, concern and care.</p>
<p>Once a rich man was sick and said to the doctor, "Please tell me, how much will it cost for you to take care of me? I will pay you $10,000 for the treatment."</p>
<p>The doctor said, "$10,000? I am not the right doctor for you. You can go to another doctor who will charge you $10,000. I am for the poor. I take care of poor patients, not rich patients."</p>
<p>The rich man said, "But I have heard that on rare occasions, when rich people are really suffering, you agree to treat them out of your compassion and concern."</p>
<p>"Yes, that is true. But I will not take any money from you! In that case, do you still want me to treat you?"</p>
<p>The rich man answered, "I am coming to your place for you to examine me."</p>
<p>The doctor said, "To my place? Whenever people are in trouble, I go to them. I do not want to compel you to come to my place just because you are in trouble. I do not want to show off. I will feel miserable if you come to me, because I will not be able to show you all my love and concern. I cannot assure you that I will be able to cure you, but I am coming to your place free of charge."</p>
<p>The doctor went to the rich man's house and cured him. He did not accept even a penny for treating the rich man.</p>  </div>
