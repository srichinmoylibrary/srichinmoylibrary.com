<p>One Sunday I went to the Consulate. The Consulate was closed, but I was standing outside. All of a sudden, I saw the Consul General, S. K. Roy, coming out of the building. He did not pay any attention to me, but I saw that his face was very serious. I asked him, “Sir, what has happened? Will you be coming back?”</p>
<p>He said, “I have no idea.” Then he told me that his mother had passed away.</p>
<p>I meditated with him for a few minutes. Afterwards I wrote a poem about his mother and left it with Sher Singh, the gatekeeper. As it turned out, the Consul General did come back to the office later that afternoon, and he did get the poem.</p>
<p>The following day, when I arrived at work, whom did I see? The Consul General. For him to come to our section was really something! He stood at the door with a sorrowful face. As soon as he came, everybody stood up. When I stood up, he said, “Ghose!” Then he looked at me, showing such love and gratitude, all through his eyes.</p>  </div>
