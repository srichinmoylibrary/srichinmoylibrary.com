<p>In your human life<br /> You notice that the world<br /> Is full of fools.<br /> You are right, absolutely right.<br /> But let me add just a little to your great discovery:<br /> There is just one more fool than you think<br /> And that is you,<br /> And that is you.</p>
<p>In your life divine<br /> You feel that the world<br /> Is full of fools.<br /> You are right, absolutely right.<br /> But let me add just a little to your great discovery:<br /> There is just one less fool than you feel<br /> And that is you,<br /> And that is you.</p>
