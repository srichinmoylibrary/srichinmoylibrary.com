<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They can come to anybody. They are not the sole monopoly of Christianity. Christianity talks about angels, but so do other religions. An angel can also take the form of a deity, and a deity can take the form of an angel if they wish to have certain angelic qualities.</p>
<p>Here I am not referring to Kali or Durga or the cosmic gods and goddesses of a very high order. Angels take the form of ordinary deities who have compassion, affection and concern.</p>  </div>
