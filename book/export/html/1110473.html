<p>Russia was immensely impressed by the unique personality of Tagore. And the poet also appreciated considerably her great stress on education. In one of his letters he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I wish to let you know how I have been impressed by the amazing intensity of your energy in spreading education among the masses. I appreciated it all the more keenly because I belong to the country where millions of my fellow countrymen are denied the light that education can bring them. You have recognised the truth that in extirpating all social evils one has to go to the root, which can only be through education.”</p>
