<p>"At our bliss-dawn who dares to gaze?<br /> But alas, my brothers, sisters bear<br /> From morn to eve and every where<br /> Contempt wild from the human race.</p>
<p>From burning soil and slushing shower<br /> Our million comrades save mankind,<br /> Yet thick are the faults the mortals find.<br /> Humanity brings no dower.</p>
<p>Mother, between our doleful race<br /> And us alas, what dire contrast!<br /> Worshipped for all ages we shall last.<br /> Off will they be kicked without praise."</p>
<p>"My children, aim not your anger's arrow<br /> At breasts of human souls, nothing wrong<br /> They do, your kin round them can throng<br /> Only when their high service they throw<br /> On earthly men with perfect bloom.<br /> For you know, your future brothers as well<br /> Must cherish the feet of men and dwell.<br /> In it my renewal and doom."</p>
