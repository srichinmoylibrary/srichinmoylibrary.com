<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can manifest our spiritual aspiration in our daily conduct provided we try to see the divine in other people all the time. We know that all human beings have defects. But by just thinking of their weaknesses and shortcomings, we do not help them in any way. At the same time, when we look at the dark side of a human being, we immediately create some spots on the tablet of our own heart. When we are aspiring we should try to see only the good things, the divine things in our friends, relatives and neighbours. We should try to look at others and deal with others as we would like them to deal with us. This is the Golden Rule. But if we pay attention to the defects and shortcomings of others, then today we will see a few defects, tomorrow teeming defects and the day after tomorrow infinite defects in their nature. What benefit will anybody get from this? This is the wrong approach. The right approach is to see divinity in others. Today if we see an iota of divinity in an individual, tomorrow we will be able to see a little more and the day after tomorrow much more. Light, then more light, then abundant light, then infinite Light we want to see in ourselves and in others.</p>
<p>But we can do this only if we sincerely aspire and make ourselves feel that we are all players in God’s cosmic Game. We are all equally important. Today we are awakened and tomorrow others will also be awakened. If we are seekers and if we see somebody who is not aspiring, we will say, “No, his hour has not struck today; but his hour may strike tomorrow.” Knowing the fact that he will be awakened tomorrow, let us give him our love, our light and our feeling of oneness. If we can establish the feeling of oneness, then our problem is solved.</p>  </div>
