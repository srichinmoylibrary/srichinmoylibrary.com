<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What you call evil, that very thing I call ignorance. There is a great difference between ignorance and evil. Ignorance is an experience and this experience ultimately will lead me to a higher truth. We go from the lesser light, to the greater light, to the greatest light. What you call evil and sin are actually experiences of bondage and imperfection. Evil is in our mind. In our aspiring heart there is no such thing as evil, but only imperfection. And this imperfection can easily be perfected when we pray to God for Light, Peace and Bliss.</p>
<p>I am most grateful to each of you for allowing me to be of service to you. To be of service to you is to be of service to our Eternal Father.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy chanted the Gayatri Mantra.</em></p>

<p>Aum bhur bhuvah svah<br /> Tat savitur varenyam<br /> Bhargo devasya dhimahi<br /> Dhiyo yo na pracodayat.</p>
