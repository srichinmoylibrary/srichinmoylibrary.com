<p>I</p>

<p>The human teacher shows you how to read.<br /> The teacher divine sleeplessly reads for you.<br /> The one leads your mind to wisdom's portal,<br /> The other opens your soul to the sky-vast blue.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>The Guru is He who shows the Way;<br /> His heart is Love, his mind is Light,<br /> His body is Grace in the realm of night.<br /> Silence and Power sustain his Play.</p>
