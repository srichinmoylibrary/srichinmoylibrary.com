  <h1 class="book-heading">The great man</h1>
  
 
<p>Yesterday on my way back from the United Nations I went to an Indian restaurant in Manhattan called Curry in a Hurry. A young man came up to me and said, "Are you Sri Chinmoy? I am so happy to see you. I interview great men like you." Then he gave me a brochure about a book he had written on an Indian mental giant.</p>
<p>The man who was serving the food was looking at me with such admiration when he saw the other man talking to me, so I asked him, "Where do you come from?" First he said, "Bangladesh." Then he said, "Chittagong." Previously, whenever someone said he came from Bangladesh, it was always from some other district.</p>
<p>Here, for the first time, I heard "Chittagong," which is my own district. And then he said the name of a village which is only four and a half miles away from my village. For seven or eight years he had been in Cairo.</p>
<p>Thousands of miles from Chittagong we met. So is this not destiny? If the other man hadn't come up to me and said that I was a great man, I would probably not have spoken to the man who was serving. But if somebody says you are a great man, immediately ten persons look at you.</p>
