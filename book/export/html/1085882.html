<p>Silence increases our divine qualities and decreases our undivine qualities. Silence is God's language and that language we can learn only through our heart's tears; that language we can learn only through constant self-offering. At every moment we can increase the beauty, fragrance, light and delight of the divine within us by exercising the enormous power of silence. The power of silence is infinitely stronger than the power of sound in the spiritual life. Silence is the inner beauty for God-realisation and silence is the outer power for God-manifestation. If we have silence, faster than the fastest we can go to the farthest corners of the globe and do the needful.</p>  </div>
