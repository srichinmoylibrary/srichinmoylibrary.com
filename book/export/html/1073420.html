<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The physical body is like a temple, a shrine. If there is no temple, where will the soul, the living deity, remain? From the highest point of view, the physical body is needed for the manifestation of the divine reality on earth. If we stay on earth in the physical, we get the opportunity to manifest the divinity which the soul embodies. When the physical aspires consciously, the physical receives light, peace and bliss from the soul and then tries to manifest these qualities on earth in humanity.</p>  </div>
