<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The gross physical has inertia. This matter does not aspire. When you go very high, into deepest meditation, if you happen to see that the physical is cooperating, well and good. At that time it becomes part and parcel of the soul itself. Otherwise, it will be like a dead body, a corpse, and it is just a heavy load. The Light is descending, descending. But the lowest is the physical, and here the Light finds it extremely difficult to operate. The physical is the last obstacle to the descent of Light.</p>  </div>
