    <title>Examiner: A few weeks ago I interviewed Baba Ram Das, and he contended that the spiritual teachers Americans get come here for a different reason than the spiritual teachers the Indians get. In this country we get the people who are still attached to power or wealth or the idea of doing a lot of good for a lot of people, which is still an attachment, he claimed. What is your comment on that?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What he thinks, he will say. I will say what I know. I am not trying to contradict his philosophy, but I know much better than anybody else does what I am and what I stand for. I have no idea why other spiritual Masters have come to the West. It is up to the individuals to answer this statement. In my case, I definitely listened to the dictates of my Inner Pilot. He wanted me to be of service to Him in the sincere seekers in the Western world, who are my spiritual brothers and sisters. He is like a father. A father has every right to have many homes, and if the father wants a particular son of his to go to some other house, and help or serve him inside the aspiration of his other children, then he is perfectly entitled to do so. And the son who is devoted to the father must listen to him. So America is one home of our Father Supreme, India is one home; Russia is one home; Japan is one home. All the countries are homes of our Eternal Father. And being the Father, He has every right to ask His children to move from one home to another to help His other children.</p>  </div>
