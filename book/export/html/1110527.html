<p>Tagore’s handwriting was so beautiful, so beautiful. Mine is nothing compared to his, although my teacher used to say my handwriting was very beautiful. My sister Lily imitated Tagore’s handwriting, and hers was quite good. Many people have imitated Tagore’s handwriting. His artwork was also so beautiful.</p>
<p>I have many, many of Tagore’s books. Some of them show his original manuscripts. Tagore made so many corrections. One can see where he crossed out this and that. They are such immortal poems, but it is surprising to see how many times in one page he made corrections. We talk about perfect perfection. Tagore also believed in the same thing. So many lines Tagore crossed out and crossed out and crossed out before he was satisfied with the poems. He was a perfectionist.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
