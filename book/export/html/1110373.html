<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one way to deal with these. We must feel that the world is not around us or in front of us, but deep within us; therefore, we have to try to achieve our own purification and the transformation of our nature. The more we are inwardly purified and transformed, the sooner the world's transformation will take place.</p>  </div>
