<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. Then it is up to my students whether they execute the message or not. If they do not execute it, then they suffer and I also suffer along with them. I will not be able to ignore their suffering and just tell them that they are suffering because they did not listen to me. No, on the strength of my oneness with them, I will also suffer. Parents tell their children to do the right thing. But at times the children do not listen. Then the parents suffer as much as the children. If the children do not listen to their parents and they suffer, will the parents not feel miserable if they are real parents? They may say, "You did not listen to us. That is why you are suffering." But they cannot say, "We will have nothing to do with your suffering." They have to bear the same suffering as their children.</p>  </div>
