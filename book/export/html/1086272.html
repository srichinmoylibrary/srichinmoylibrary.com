<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it is not bad at all. If you have to sleep after meditation you can go to sleep, but if you can continue meditating from two to five without going back to sleep, that is infinitely better. But if that is not possible for you right now, if you can meditate for an hour, then the result of your meditation you can assimilate after your meditation.</p>
<p>The only difficulty is that if you meditate from two to three or four o'clock, then afterwards there will be quite a few hours before you get up. If you get up at nine or ten o'clock, just because you meditated at two o'clock, then between seven and eight the vital forces — your own vital forces or the aggression of the earth which is agitated at seven or eight o'clock — will cause your consciousness to become agitated. The agitation from the earth's consciousness or from your own lower vital can enter into the results of the meditation which you did at two o'clock or three o'clock. So after your meditation, either you have to have a very peaceful sleep or you have to get up again at five or six o'clock. If you get up at nine o'clock or ten o'clock, just because you meditated at three o'clock, then the agitation and the hustle and bustle of life around you can disturb you totally.</p>
<p>So you have to be very careful. For an hour or so, from two to three, you can meditate and then you can sleep again from three to five. But please be awake by six o'clock. Otherwise the consciousness of the earth, which becomes awakened and agitated at that time, can create a disturbance in your consciousness.</p>  </div>
