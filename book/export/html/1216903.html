<p>The airline this time was so bad. In the San Francisco airport they kept us waiting in the plane for an hour and a half. Then they said that something was wrong with a battery and told us we had to leave the plane.</p>
<p>After an hour and a half, they decided to give us another plane. Then they said, "All right, we have fixed the battery. In ten minutes we shall start."</p>
<p>But after ten minutes they said that now one engine was not working. So we had to go out again.</p>
<p>We were practically three hours late in leaving.</p>
