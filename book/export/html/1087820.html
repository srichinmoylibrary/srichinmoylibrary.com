<p>RADHA: Christopher, did Mother tell you why she used to go to church in the days when she was a confirmed Catholic?</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER: No, Mother didn't tell me.</p>
<p>RADHA: She went for two reasons. One reason was because she didn't want to become a confirmed lunatic by staying home with us, and the other reason was to see if her real enemies and so-called friends were there.</p>  </div>
