<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there are many gardens in Heaven, and the most famous garden in Heaven is called <em>Nandan Kanan.</em> And the most beautiful flower is called <em>parijat.</em> I wish to tell you that, as there are gardens in Heaven, so also is there a garden in God's Heart; and the name of this garden is Kanan, the ever-blossoming gratitude.</p>  </div>
