<p>In September or October of 1964, I was running in Woodstock, in a place called Cherry Hill. Believe it or not, my Beloved Supreme began running with me, right in front of me. He was holding a golden wand â€” like a magic wand. You can call Him my highest part or my separate part, but I was overwhelmed with Light and Delight. This was my first running experience in America. From this concert hall it is only half a mile to where I had that experience.</p>
