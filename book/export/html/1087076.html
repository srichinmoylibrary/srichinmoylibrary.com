<p>The other day I was in a store shopping for something for A. A very, very fat lady came into the same store to buy something for herself. The lady had her hand on a garment when she saw me. She kept her hand on the garment and started looking at me with such awe. Then she said, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>So I smiled at her. Then the owner started asking her, "Who is he?"</p>
<p>I have been at that clothing store on Jamaica Avenue at least sixty or seventy times, but the owner thinks that I am an ordinary person. After talking to the lady, the owner realised that I am an "important person." So that's how I became an important person overnight!</p>
