<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can be more soulful and more devoted in your work if you feel that you are working here not just to earn money but to serve the Supreme inside the soul and inside the body of the United Nations. The United Nations is a world organisation that sincerely wants to bring about peace and harmony on earth. To work here and serve the soul of the United Nations is a great honour, a great privilege, no matter in which capacity you are working. If you think of the high, sublime goal of the United Nations, automatically you will become soulful and devoted because the goal itself will try to bring from the depths of your being your devoted heart-qualities. If at every moment you try to think of the soul of the United Nations and of your own soul's commitment to the goal of the United Nations, your soul will work very hard in and through you.</p>
