<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Singing is a form of meditation, I tell you. If you cannot carry a tune, no harm. Then you will not sing in public. But certainly you can sing when you are alone. Once a day you should sing the Invocation. If you don't sing the Invocation once a day, please feel that something is missing in your life. For that day you are not feeding the Supreme; and if you don't feed the Supreme every day, it is an unpardonable crime. The Supreme is not going to give you a mark if you cannot carry a tune. As long as you sing soulfully, the Supreme will be extremely pleased. Tagore once wrote in a poem, "You gave the bird a voice, musical talent. To me you have not given a voice, but still I am singing." When you don't have something, and still you are offering it to God, God is very pleased with you. So try to sing in your own way. Even if the tune is wrong, if you sing soulfully, it is a real form of meditation.</p>  </div>
