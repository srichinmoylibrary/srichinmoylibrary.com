<p>Lord, will You not give me<br /> A higher position and raise my salary?</p>
<p>"Your salary: Peace, Light and Delight<br /> I can and shall easily increase.<br /> But I am afraid I shall<br /> Not be able to give you a higher position.<br /> A few years ago,<br /> When I accepted you,<br /> I accepted you as an instrument of Mine.<br /> Then I raised your position.<br /> I declared you as a chosen son of Mine.<br /> Now you want to be My representative on earth.<br /> I am sorry! For that you have to work very hard.<br /> I am afraid it may take a few incarnations<br /> For you to represent Me on earth."</p>
