<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It can be their intuition or it can take place in a dream. Sometimes when people dream, their third eye is unconsciously open and they can see angels. But again, while they are awake, if they want to open their third eye without having the spiritual capacity, it is impossible. On another level, sometimes when God, the Highest Absolute, wants to manifest in and through someone, He will give that person an angelic touch.</p>  </div>
