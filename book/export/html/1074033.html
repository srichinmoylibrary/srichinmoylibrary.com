  <h1 class="book-heading">Question: Does consciousness have a sound vibration?</h1>
  
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, consciousness has a sound vibration, but this sound vibration one can feel and hear only when one is highly advanced in the spiritual life or is on the verge of realisation. One can have a sound vibration reverberating in one’s own day-to-day life, but it need not come directly from the soul’s consciousness. It can come from any part of the being.</p>  </div>
