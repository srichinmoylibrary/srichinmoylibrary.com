<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The seeker can only try to do the right thing, try to realise God. He himself is imperfect, but he knows there is Somebody who is perfect, and that is God. A real seeker feels that if he goes to God and gets Light, and if he is able to transform his own life, then he will be able to help others whom he has caused to suffer. Just because he was ignorant, he did something wrong. If he wants to make up for his past bad actions, first he must get something higher than or superior to what he had, and that something he can get only from God. So when he gets Peace, Love and Light from God, he can offer it to those whom he has caused to suffer. This is the best thing he can do for them.</p>  </div>
