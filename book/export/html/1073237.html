<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not necessarily so. This is one theory, and it has a kind of truth. But many times the imperfection starts in the physical body itself with no prior connecting link in the subtle body. The gross physical body is not aspiring, and there is some imperfection in it: so it gets diseases.</p>
<p>When a disease attacks the subtle body before coming to the physical, and the person is aware of it, then he has time to fight and prevent it from entering the physical body. But if it attacks the physical directly, then the victim has almost no time to prevent its entrance.</p>  </div>
