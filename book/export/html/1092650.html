<p>December 5, 1.26 A.M. 1950</p>
<p>In Heaven</p>
<p>"Swarna, my dear sister, what now compels<br /> Your dawn-pure eyes to swim in the sea of tears?<br /> My heart breaks into a million fragments now.<br /> Take off the garment of your gloomy fears."</p>
<p>"Sister, console my ravaged heart, I beseech.<br /> Alas, my sweet Auro has left the earth.<br /> Sombre pangs torture the deep heart of the vast.<br /> No longer his Soul enjoys the human birth."</p>
<p>"Ah, that away you threw your eyeless dule.<br /> All from self-choice He has stopped<br /> his heartbeat's march.<br /> He has left the flesh and blood and nothing more.<br /> Are you all void by his withdrawing search?<br /> Ecstasy, a stupendous ecstasy shall soon<br /> Enflood your within, without, my sister sweet.<br /> To bring on earth his golden Sun ere long<br /> He has left his body's shrine, his human retreat.</p>
<p>Auro and Mira are one in Spirit's gold fire.<br /> No fate dare divide their timeless union.<br /> She breathes his Breath limitless august, supreme...<br /> A seed of a newer Birth, a newer Sun."</p>
