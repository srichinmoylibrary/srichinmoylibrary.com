<p>While I was running, six or seven people recognised me. Two or three stopped and shook hands with me.</p>
<p>Just before the twelve-mile point, there was an Indian ahead of me. He turned around and shouted, "Are you an Indian?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>Then the man he was running with, an American, said, "He is the big boss."</p>
<p>That Indian lives only three houses away from X. She knows him.</p>
