<p>Who else is utterly helpless,<br /> If not I?<br /> An urgent matter compelled me<br /> To phone Heaven.<br /> Heaven's line was busy, as usual.<br /> I phoned earth.<br /> Earth was not at home.<br /> I phoned my soul.<br /> My soul told me that<br /> My problem was too complicated,<br /> And I should not bother it.<br /> I phoned my Lord.<br /> My Lord said, "Son, when will<br /> You learn the supreme secret:<br /> 'Self-help is the best help'?"<br /> Now tell me, my seeker-friends,<br /> Who else is utterly helpless,<br /> If not I?</p>
