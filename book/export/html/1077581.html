<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The psychic being cannot be damaged, it can only be eclipsed. Whatever is divine cannot be destroyed. It is only covered by ignorance and the cloud of human doubt. But like the sun which is only temporarily overcast by clouds, the psychic being again peeps through. However, if we soulfully pray, concentrate and meditate, the psychic being cannot be eclipsed.</p>  </div>
