<p>I shall now sing an immortal song. This particular song is immortal for various reasons. When Naren, who later on became Swami Vivekananda, met with his Master, Sri Ramakrishna, for the first time, Naren sang this song. While the song was being sung, Sri Ramakrishna entered into a very, very deep trance.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna heard the song from his beloved Naren for the first time. Later on, many, many times Naren sang this song to please his Master. This particular song in the spiritual world, in the inner world, especially in the heart of Bengal, has become immortal. It has touched the very breath, if not of the Indian, then of the Bengali heart.</p>
<p>Originally the mind came from the high, higher, highest Source. In this song, the first line begins, “O my mind, go back to your own highest realm, to your own Source. In this foreign world do not roam. O my mind, let us go back, you and I, to the Source.”</p>
<p>In India I heard this song many, many times, and it inspired me to a great extent. About six or seven years ago I heard it for the first time from the wife of Dr. Jayaraman-ji, our dearest sister Tulsi-ben. Physically she is no longer with us, but spiritually she is. She sang this song at my request, and her prayerful heart and soulful voice gave my heart tremendous delight and a divine sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Naren inspired his Master to such an extent that the Master entered into his deep, deeper, deepest trance. As you all know, my Master is my Lord Beloved Supreme, and those who are in my boat, my students, also have the same Master, our Lord Beloved Supreme. My song may not or will not or cannot inspire my Master to enter into His Trance, but I can do something else. I can most prayerfully and most devotedly place the light and delight of this song at the Feet of my Lord Beloved Supreme and I am making a special request to my students to do the same while I am singing this song.</p>
