<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You will be the best judge. But if you get satisfaction, that is more than enough. If you get real satisfaction, you don't have to worry about whether it is coming from the mind or the vital. Let us take the planes of consciousness as the floors of a building. Right now you do not have free access to the building. There are quite a few floors. But when you make considerable progress in the spiritual life, a day will come when you will be able to know which floor, which plane, these experiences are coming from. Whether it is the vital plane, the psychic plane, the mental plane, the over-mind, the higher mind, the intuitive mind â€” easily you will be able to know. But as long as you get joy, try to claim this joy. You don't have to know from which floor the experiences are coming. Continue creating. That is the right thing. As long as you claim divine satisfaction from the creation, that is sufficient. You don't have to know everything in minor detail. Just see the reality. If you want to become an expert, you have to realise God. When you are aiming at God-realisation, don't worry about the minor things that come along the way. As long as you are satisfied, it is more than enough.</p>  </div>
