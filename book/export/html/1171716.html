<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I have been doing more. Today I have completed 76,000. It is my wish, on the 19th of November, to exhibit 100,000 birds in Ottawa. About nineteen years ago, I entered into the art world in a hotel room in Ottawa. There I did my first drawing in the West. I have students in Canada, and every year they observe the anniversary of that first drawing. This November it is our plan to have a huge gallery that will house 100,000 birds. I do hope that by the end of October I will be able to complete them.</p>  </div>
