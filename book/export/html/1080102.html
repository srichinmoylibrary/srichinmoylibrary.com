<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, we have to know what the two goals are. The outer goal of the United Nations is the expansion of its lofty ideas. The inner goal of the United Nations is the manifestation of its illumining and fulfilling ideals. A lack of self-giving stands between the ideas and ideals. If individuals and nations, instead of being self-centred become self-giving, then there would be nothing to separate the ideas from the ideals, the outer goal and the inner goal.</p>  </div>
