<p>Sri Aurobindo is the Song. The Mother is the Singer.</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo is the all-containing Book. The Mother is the all-explaining Teacher.</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo is the Handkerchief. The Mother is the Hand to wipe their disciples' tearful eyes.</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo is Immensity in its growing revelation. The Mother is Intensity in its blossoming fulfilment.</p>

<p>Sri Aurobindo is the Unfailing Hope. The Mother is the Constant Help.</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo's eyes are All-Grace for the fallen earth-consciousness. The Mother's eyes are All-Solace for the fallen earth-consciousness.</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo is our souls' Reserve Bank. The Mother is the Banker.</p>
<p>The disciple sees in Sri Aurobindo an Ocean of Peace the moment he places himself at His Feet. The disciple sees in the Mother an Ocean of Ecstasy the moment he places himself at Her Feet.</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo says: "The Mother is Everything." The Mother says: "Yes, but all I am is in Him, with Him, of Him and for Him."</p>
