<p><em>Madal:</em></p>
<p>Chinmoy, among your friends and acquaintances does anybody think that it was just a <em>caprice</em> that took you away from the Eastern shore to live on the Western shore?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>Madal, if anybody thinks that it was a sheer <em>whim</em>, an abrupt and unmotivated decision and not an express command from my Inner Pilot, the Supreme, then I am afraid my sweet and devoted Western spiritual children, not to speak of my fanatic disciples, will without fail, sue that person in the Supreme Court.</p>  </div>
