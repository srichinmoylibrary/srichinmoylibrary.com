    <title>&lt;em&gt;Mrs. Marcantonio (Albert and Marc&#039;s mother):&lt;/em&gt; I don&#039;t have a question. This is about the seventh time I have had the pleasure of being here. And I am taking the opportunity to thank you for crossing my sons&#039; path. You brought so much happiness to our family. I wouldn&#039;t have the pleasure of having Marc with us at times and seeing him if it weren&#039;t for you. I really mean it. That I really mean. &lt;em&gt;(Many of the mothers stood up and began clapping.)&lt;/em&gt;</title>
