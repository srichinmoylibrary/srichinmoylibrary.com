<p>Ambition. If you cast aside your ambition while still in the unaspiring life, lo, you have become a brainless sheep.</p>
<p>Ambition. Embrace ambition in your aspiring life; lo, you become the condemned convict. You can never come out of the finite.</p>
<p>Ambition. In your outer life, ambition is the highest height.</p>
<p>Ambition. In your inner life, ambition is the darkest night.</p>
<p>Ambition. In your outer life, the closer you come towards the land of fulfilling ambition, the mightier is your hopeful security.</p>
<p>Ambition. In your inner life, the farther away you go from the shore of ambition, the greater is the strength of God's protection for you.</p>
<p>Before you became an aspirant, ambition was the highest aim. After you have become an aspirant, ambition is not only a low aim, but a serious fall.</p>
<p>Be sure, ambition is not aspiration. Ambition wants to command the world. Aspiration cries to serve the Creator in His creation.</p>
<p>Ambition is a human passion, never to be satisfied. Aspiration is a divine glorification, ever to be satisfied.</p>
<p>Ambition is the end of human realisation. Aspiration is the beginning of divine realisation.</p>
<p>Ambition is the chosen child of man. Aspiration is the chosen child of God.</p>
<p>Aspiration. Aspiration. Aspiration. In aspiration an aspirant lives far above the skies. In aspiration an aspirant's eye becomes one with the highest God. In aspiration an aspirant's heart becomes the Absolute.</p>  </div>
