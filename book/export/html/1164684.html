<p>Self-examination: What is it? It is the purification of my body.</p>
<p>Self-examination: What is it? It is the intensification of the determination of my vital.</p>
<p>Self-examination: What is it? It is the preparation of my mind.</p>
<p>Self-examination: What is it? It is the consecration of my heart.</p>
<p>Self-examination: What is it? It is the realisation of the vision universal of my soul.</p>
<p>Self-examination: What is it? It is the divinisation of my nature.</p>
<p>Self-examination: What is it? It is the perfection of my life.</p>
<p>Self-examination: What is it? It is the manifestation of the Satisfaction transcendental of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>The human in me wants to examine the world without examining itself. The human in me wants to judge the world without judging itself. The human in me wants to change the world without changing itself.</p>
<p>The divine in me loves the world. The divine in me cries with the world. The divine in me wants to console the world. The divine in me wants to fulfil the world.</p>
<p>Self-examination is another name for conscious and permanent separation from the ignorance-chain of birth and death. Self-examination has many more names: doubt-destruction, faith-invocation, surrender-perfection and gratitude-satisfaction.</p>
<p>Self-examination is for my immediate God-need and not for my disproportionate devil-greed. Self-examination is the confident success-walk in my outer world. Self-examination is the transcendent progress-march in my inner world. Readiness is the secret of my success. Selflessness is the secret of my progress.</p>
<p>Examination, examination, examination! I examine God to see if He has Compassion-Shower, Forgiveness-Tower and Realisation-Hour for me. God examines me to see if I have a tiny flame of purity in my heart, a small grain of sincerity in my life and an atom of receptivity in my entire being.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you, my seeker-friends, what actually happens when I examine God and when He examines me. When God examines me, my old friend fear advises me to hide immediately and my old friend anger advises me to fight dauntlessly. When I examine God, He immediately, lovingly and unreservedly quenches my heart's thirst and immediately, compassionately and unconditionally feeds my life's hunger.</p>  </div>
