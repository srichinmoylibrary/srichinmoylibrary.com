<p>In London I spent half an hour in Barkers looking for a pair of shorts. All the shorts were sizes 32 and 34. A salesman went to look for my size, but after fifteen minutes he came back and said they did not even have one pair in size 30. I was disappointed not to be able to get a pair of shorts, but secretly I was very happy to find that it is so rare for a man to have a size 30 waist!</p>
