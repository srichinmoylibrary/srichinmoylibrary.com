<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Arjuna wanted to abstain from the fighting that was his duty. He did not want to fight. He thought, "If I don't kill anybody, they will think highly of me, appreciate me and be my friends." Sri Krishna said, "No, your warrior's duty is to fight this righteous battle, because it is the Divine Will. You are not to behave like a Brahmin who has to spurn earthly activity and dedicate himself to the interpretation of the scriptures. What God demands from you is to protect your subjects. You have to protect the world. Your duty is to fight."</p>
<p>At most you can say that Arjuna was ignoring his own dharma or inner law and indulging his own feelings of weakness and fear. This is not <em>viveka,</em> the soul's discrimination.</p>  </div>
