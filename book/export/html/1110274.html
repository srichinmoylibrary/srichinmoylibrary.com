<h2>Question: I meditate at night from 10:00 to 10:30. I would like to know if it is a good idea to go to sleep right after my evening meditation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Immediately after a half hour of meditation it is not good to go to sleep. You should remain awake for five or ten minutes. This will give you time to consciously assimilate the benefits of your meditation. If you do go right to sleep, you may get pain in your back, or your mind may become tense. Let the body slowly, slowly move from the world of meditation into the world of sleep; then go to bed.</p>  </div>
