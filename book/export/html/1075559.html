<p>At last I have come to realise<br /> That my need<br /> Is my only limit.<br /> Otherwise, by this time<br /> I could easily have become<br /> Another God.</p>
<p>"My child, you are a fool.<br /> You are already<br /> Another God."</p>
<p>If I am another God,<br /> How is it that there is<br /> Such a difference<br /> Between You and me?</p>
<p>"The difference exists<br /> Because<br /> Unlike Me,<br /> You have been all along<br /> Neglecting all your duties<br /> And<br /> Avoiding all your responsibilities."</p>
