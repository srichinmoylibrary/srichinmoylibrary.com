<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Beauty comes from both Light and Peace. When it comes from Light, it carries the seeker high, higher, highest to the transcendental plane of Consciousness. When it comes from Peace, it spreads and spreads and enters into the universal Consciousness. When beauty comes from Light it goes upward, and when it comes from Peace it spreads outward.</p>  </div>
