<p>When Switzerland was ruled by France, a Swiss army captain asked the French Emperor for a large sum of money for the military. The Emperor told the treasurer to give him the money, but the treasurer said, "Do you think it is wise? They are not French people. Why spend so much money on the Swiss army? Instead of giving the money to the captain, let us build a long and excellent paved road."</p>
<p>The captain said, "I do not deny that this road is a splendid idea. But what about the countless Swiss soldiers who have sacrificed their lives for you? Instead of a road, can we not have a river flowing with the blood of the Swiss soldiers who have offered their lives for the French Emperor?"</p>
<p>The Emperor was very pleased and very embarrassed at the same time. He scolded the treasurer and said, "Give him the money immediately!"</p>
<p>The Emperor had quite a few swords. His most treasured sword he gave to the Swiss captain for his wisdom and brave words.</p>  </div>
