  <h1 class="book-heading">The significance of a birthday</h1>
  
 
<p>The soul comes down. Mother-Earth smiles. Father-Heaven smiles. Father smiles in His divine offering. Mother smiles in Her divine acceptance.</p>
<p>A soul comes not alone. It arrives with God’s Promise and God’s Fulfilment. A new Thought, a new inspiration, a new Light, a new Power and a new Manifestation of God enter into a physical body, the fort of protection.</p>
<p>God once more inspires the soul and energises the body to enter dauntlessly into the battlefield of life with a stronger inspiration, a brighter freedom and a deeper peace.</p>
<p>Each birthday flowers into a special significance. The yet unfulfilled desires of a man knock at the Door of his soul. His soul opens the Door and comes to the fore on this special day.</p>
<p>The Supreme sends Eternity, Infinity and Immortality down into the world to feed His divine child, the soul. Eternity serves the breakfast, Infinity the lunch and Immortality the dinner. Eternity tells the soul where it is, Infinity tells the soul how far to go, Immortality tells the soul when and where to stop.</p>
<p>God dreams in the soul, for the soul. The soul dreams in the body, for the body. The body dreams in the senses, for the senses. The senses say to the body, the physical consciousness: “United we are playing our roles to fulfil you.” The body then says to the soul: “I am coming to fulfil you. Please stay for a while.”</p>
<p>The soul says to God: “I am come. Be pleased to fulfil Yourself in me.”</p>  </div>
