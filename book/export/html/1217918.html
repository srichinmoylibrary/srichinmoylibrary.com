<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, Saturn and Venus have no mind, either human or divine. Secondly, only the Yogis can have free access to the planets Venus, Saturn, etc. Ordinary souls cannot have this capacity, but they can have a glimpse of these planets in their dreams, or in a very high state of meditation.</p>  </div>
