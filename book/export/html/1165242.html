<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ordinary human beings wonâ€™t know, but if the Master wants a disciple to know what he has done, the Master can make the disciple feel that he has done it. Then the disciple will believe it.</p>
<p>But the individual will act differently, though he will not know why. He is doing something, but he cannot account for it. He may act crazy, as if some force has entered into him. Again, he may act differently in a good way.</p>  </div>
