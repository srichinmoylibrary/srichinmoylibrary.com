<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Simplicity is the direct way of bringing sweetness into our life. Pure people can sometimes be very nicely arrogant. Indian saints are pure, but if you try to take a flower from their garden, they will come and break your head because they care only for justice! But if you only want to lead a simple life, then when a thief comes to steal your blanket, you will go running to give him your pillow also. You will tell the thief, "You like these things more than I do, so you keep them. I am satisfied only to look at the moon at night." In this way you are making your life simpler and simpler and depending only on Mother Nature. In this kind of simple life, sweetness grows.</p>  </div>
