<p>I was going through the money order coupons while Nolini-da was sitting on his bed reading a magazine. I said to him: "You have an article called 'Kabitwer Ekti Shutra'. What is the English word for 'Shutra'? May I use 'principle'?"</p>
<p>For a minute or two we meditated. Then Nolini-da said: "Yes, you can use 'principle' since I am not getting a better word."</p>
<p>"I have completed your book <em>Madhuchhandar.</em>"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean that in the latest issue of the <em>Mother India</em> I completed the translation of your <em>Madhuchhandar Mantramala.</em>"</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "Oh, I see. What is next?"</p>
<p>"I am planning to translate your <em>Vaidic Kathopakathan</em> (Vedic Conversations), which are not yet out in book form."</p>
<p>Nolini-da said "That's fine."</p>  </div>
