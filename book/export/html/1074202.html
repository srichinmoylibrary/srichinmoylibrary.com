<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mother tells them that they have a friend. They have such faith in their mother; so who knows? Children are full of imagination. Y mentioned an experience that she had as a child, of a goddess who came to her in a dream. In Y’s case, it was Athena, the Greek goddess. That goddess has some connection with her. A being of Athena’s visited her six or seven months ago. I don’t know which time it happened — when she was a child or just recently, six or seven months ago — but first the being came to me for a blessing.</p>  </div>
