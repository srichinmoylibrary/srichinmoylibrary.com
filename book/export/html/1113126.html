<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I chant <em>Aum,</em> immediately I feel inside my heart the presence of the cosmic gods and the Supreme. When we chant, we are feeding our nearest and dearest ones. They are hungry, and we have to feed them. This is the experience I get. Again, sometimes I get the opposite experience: I am hungry, and they are feeding me. Sometimes they are hungry and at that time I feed them. Sometimes I am hungry, so they come and feed me. We have to nourish each other.</p>  </div>
