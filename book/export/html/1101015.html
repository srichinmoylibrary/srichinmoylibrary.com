    <title>Question: Both my husband and I have seen you in your previous incarnations with different clothes and different ornaments. It was perhaps a few hundred years back or maybe a thousand years back. Once you were giving a concert. Afterwards, my husband asked me, &amp;quot;Did you see what I saw?&amp;quot; Then I said, &amp;quot;You&#039;re talking about Guru&#039;s new earrings?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; Then when you came out, when the concert was over, you appeared as normal. But throughout the concert you were wearing a different costume from a different time period. That was amazing.</title>
