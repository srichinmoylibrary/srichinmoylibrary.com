<p>At the U.S. Open there was a man standing almost on top of me, blocking my view. All of a sodden Databir came up, shouting, "Hey, Mom! Hey, Mom!"</p>
<p>I said to myself, "What is Databir's mother doing here? Does she like tennis so much that she would come all the way from Connecticut?"</p>
<p>But Databir's mother wasn't there at all. Databir was just trying to get the man to move. By drawing his attention, Databir was able to move the man aside. Then the man went away.</p>
