<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Witches are tremendously hostile, destructive forces. They can easily destroy someone if they use a little bit of their witch-power. Then the person won’t be able to budge an inch. Or tongue-power they take away and the person won’t be able to talk. In India they destroy nostrils, ears. Each one has a certain destructive power, but it is not always of the same type. If they want, they can look at someone who is very young, four or five, and then that child is finished. If they want, they won’t give the child any more height. In the circus there are some who are midgets because of witches.</p>  </div>
