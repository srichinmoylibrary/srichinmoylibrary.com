<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No! Real peace and happiness are inseparable. But we have to know that peace must be established on all the levels of our being. Perhaps we have established peace inside our heart, but not inside our mind. If we do not have peace of mind, then how will we have happiness? If one part of the being remains without peace — either the heart, the mind, the vital or the physical — then happiness will remain a far cry. Real peace — divine peace, illumining peace, fulfilling peace — is bound to give us happiness when the entire being is inundated with it. We are bound to be happy if the entire being is peaceful.</p>  </div>
