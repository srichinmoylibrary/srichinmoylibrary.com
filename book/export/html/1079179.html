<p>With your kind permission, I wish to say that this is my fourth visit to Harvard University. In 1969 I spoke on <em>The Vedanta philosophy</em>; in 1971, on <em>The Upanishads: The crown of India's Soul</em>; last year, on <em>The glowing consciousness of Vedic Truth</em>; and now, my fourth talk will be on <em>Realisation, revelation and perfection</em>. Since I am a spiritual seeker, a seeker of the highest transcendental Truth, the subject of today's talk is one with which my heart and soul are intimately familiar.</p>
<p><em>Realisation, revelation and perfection</em>. The animal in us has realised that destruction is perfection. The human in us has realised that separation or partition is perfection. The divine in us has realised that the transformation of our human nature is perfection. The Supreme in us has realised that the manifestation of our inner divinity and reality is perfection.</p>
<p>Destruction is power. Separation or partition is power. Transformation is power. Manifestation is power. Destruction-power is the animal revelation. Separation-power is the human revelation. Transformation-power is the divine revelation. And manifestation-power is the supreme revelation.</p>
<p>As we advance in our spiritual life, we come to realise that destruction-power is abominable and separation-power is deplorable, but that transformation-power is admirable and manifestation-power, the divine manifestation-power, is most adorable.</p>
<p>A sincere and genuine seeker goes deep within and discovers the truth that animal life is sheer futility; that human life, if it does not aspire, is stark stupidity; that divine life is immediate necessity; and that spiritual life is deathless and birthless immortality.</p>

<p>For God-realisation, we need aspiration-<br />  cry.<br /> For God-revelation, we need dedication-<br />  smile.<br /> For God-manifestation, we need patience-<br />  wisdom.</p>

<p>Aspiration is a perfect stranger to rejection. It accepts everything within and without. Then, the things that have to be transformed, it transforms on the strength of its climbing cry.</p>
<p>Dedication is a perfect stranger to calculation. When a sincere seeker dedicates himself to the right cause, to the inner goal, he forgets how to calculate. He goes far beyond the domain of calculation. His dedication is soulful giving, unconditional giving, self-giving, of what he has and what he is.</p>
<p>Patience is a perfect stranger to imperfection. When aspiration and dedication loom large in our spiritual life, patience, our third friend, plays its role most satisfactorily. Patience and God's infinite Compassion play together and dance together. At that time, we see that our teeming imperfections are ready to be transformed into perfect Perfection.</p>
<p>Realising God is like climbing up a tree. Revealing God is like climbing up and down the tree time and again at God's choice Hour. Manifesting God is offering the fruits of the tree to the world at large.</p>
<p>Love, always love. When we love soulfully, realisation does not and cannot remain a far cry. Serve, always serve. When we serve and serve devotedly, revelation cannot remain a far cry. And when we unconditionally become the transcendental Truth and Reality, God-manifestation does not and cannot remain a far cry.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna realised God, the absolute Supreme. After he had realised the Lord Supreme, he became God the eternal Lover and God the eternal Beloved. The Christ realised God, the transcendental Father. On the strength of his supreme realisation he declared, "I and my Father are one." The Christ became the universal brother. We too, if we are humble and sincere seekers, can realise God the Supreme Pilot. After realising God the Supreme Pilot, we can become universal servers of Truth and Light.</p>
<p>Realisation tells us who God is. Revelation tells us what we can do for God. Manifestation and perfection tell us what God does for us and what we do for God.</p>
<p>Who is God? God is our inner cry and our outer smile. He cries with us and for us on earth. He smiles with us and at us in Heaven. God is at once our heart's eternal Lover and our soul's supreme Beloved.</p>
<p>What can we do for God? We can do one thing, and that is to establish the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. The Kingdom of Heaven is not a chimerical mist. It is a reality with us trying to come to the fore and reveal and manifest itself on earth.</p>
<p>What does God do for us? What God does for us is simple, spontaneous, illumining and fulfilling. He liberates us from our teeming imperfections with His unconditional and transcendental Compassion. And what do we do for God? What we do for God is equally simple, spontaneous, illumining and fulfilling. On the strength of our heart's constant, inner mounting cry, we try to make Him smile, smile with joy at His creation vast.</p>
