<p>As you know, I like bargaining. Here in Maracaibo it is quite possible to bargain. Today I wanted to buy something, but I don't speak Spanish, so I wrote down the price I wanted to pay. The storekeeper wrote down something else. Then what a battle we had! He wrote down 460 bolivars. I wrote down 350.</p>
<p>He said something very emphatic which, fortunately, I couldn't understand.</p>
<p>Then I wrote down 360. He wrote down 400. I said to myself, "No, I am not giving four!" and I started to leave.So I got it for 370.</p>
