<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Through your deep prayer and meditation. Once you see your soul, you will be able to see the soul in everything. The soul is not an easy thing to see just now. Now you are studying, seeking for the result of your M.A. course. If a kindergarten student asks about university courses, you can try to explain. But it is difficult to explain to him. Similarly, with your mind you are asking me about the soul and with the mind I have to answer. Mentally we are trying to formulate some ideas, but actually it has to be understood on the strength of oneâ€™s own inner awakening, inner experience. Questions can be answered, but if you go deep within, in the process of your own spiritual awakening the answers will be there.</p>  </div>
