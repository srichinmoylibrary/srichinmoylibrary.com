<blockquote>
<p>I am determined to set an example myself. I do not want excuses. I do not want very learned reasons as to why things cannot be done. I want results, and results will necessarily follow dynamic action.</p>
<p><em>On the Wings of Thought</em><br /><em>by Ranasinghe Premadasa</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Action, dynamic action, self-giving action: that is what the President wants from himself and from others. It is not his way to offer excuses. He is wise; he is brave. Excuses accomplish nothing. It is determination that is of paramount importance. Determination begins the journey; dynamic action, concludes the journey.</p>  </div>
