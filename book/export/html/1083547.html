<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mother loves her son in spite of his imperfections. How is it that God the all-loving Father, will find it difficult to love you? No, He loves you and your imperfections. He considers your teeming imperfections as His very own. He will have no peace of mind unless and until He has transformed your teeming imperfections into His glowing Perfection.</p>  </div>
