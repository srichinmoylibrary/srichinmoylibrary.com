<p>The great Mogul Emperor Babar was once fighting a very bloody battle known as the first Battle of Panipat. Babar's enemy was King Ibrahim Lodi. The armies fought for quite a few days, and finally Babar's army began to overpower the other one.</p>
<p>One of the commanders of Ibrahim Lodi's army said to him, "O King, you stay at the rear of the army. Don't stay in the thick of the battle. As a matter of fact, let us keep fighting to the bitter end while you go and escape. We want you to be safe."</p>
<p>The king said, "How can I do that? If my army, my friends and my relatives are ready to give their lives for me, will I run away in order to save my own life? If they are willing to give their lives, can I not also be willing to give my life?"</p>
<p>The king fought very bravely but finally he was killed. The commander who killed him was full of happiness that the enemy king was dead, and he hurried to tell Babar the news. Babar immediately asked the commander to take him to the dead body.</p>
<p>When he got there, he raised Ibrahim Lodi's head from the ground and said, "I admire you. You fought very, very bravely. Now I will take full responsibility to see that you are honoured as a king should be when he dies. I will give you the grand reception worthy of a king, and I will have a king's tomb erected. I will do everything for you. You are a real hero!"</p>  </div>
