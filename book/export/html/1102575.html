<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can feel safe from the dark forces within you provided you have faith in Someone who is infinitely stronger than these forces. You have to feel that the divine forces and the undivine forces are like two little boys. The divine one is afraid of the undivine one because the undivine one wants to strike him and he feels he does not have enough strength to put up a brave fight. But if he sees that his father is standing beside him, he knows that his father will protect him. So if you can feel the Presence of the Supreme inside you, you will feel safe. Just as the little boy knows his father is beside him to protect him and save him, you also have to feel that the Absolute Supreme is inside you to do the needful. Provided you have confidence in Him, He will do everything for you and He will not allow the undivine forces to come and attack you.</p>
