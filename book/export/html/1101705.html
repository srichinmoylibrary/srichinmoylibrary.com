   <div id="node-1101706" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">1.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Now that my love for You<br /> Is strong once more,<br /> And my faith in You<br /> Is strong once more,<br /> I have decided to address<br /> All my petitions and supplications<br /> To Your Lotus-Feet once more.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101707" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">2.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> When I pray and meditate,<br /> I most lovingly clasp<br /> The Smiles of Your Eye.<br /> Will You not clasp<br /> The tears of my heart<br /> In return?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101708" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">3.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You do know the depth<br /> Of my love, devotion<br /> And surrender.<br /> I must say, they all come<br /> From the depth<br /> Of my sincerity-heart.<br /> My Lord, do You<br /> Agree with me?<br /> "My child, I do, I do."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101709" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">4.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> One day You inject<br /> Elephant-confidence in me,<br /> Next day You inject<br /> Lion-confidence in me.<br /> This way, alternately,<br /> You give me<br /> The elephant-lion-confidence<br /> Early in the morning.<br /> But, alas, as the day advances,<br /> My confidence disappears.<br /> I become an object<br /> Of pity-insecurity.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101710" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">5.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord, fulfil me.<br /> Fulfil me, my Lord.<br /> Why delay any further?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101711" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">6.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Inwardly I may argue with You<br /> In season and out of season<br /> But, rest assured,<br /> If You are ever in need of me,<br /> I will immediately throw myself<br /> Heart and soul<br /> At Your Feet.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101712" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">7.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I know I argue with You<br /> All the time inwardly,<br /> But I know You are the only One<br /> To take notice of me,<br /> You are the only One<br /> To take care of me,<br /> You are the only One<br /> To tolerate me,<br /> You are the only One<br /> Who has not lost<br /> Even an iota of hope<br /> In me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101713" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">8.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Whether You give me permission<br /> Or not,<br /> I shall go here, there<br /> And everywhere<br /> Telling the whole world<br /> That I am Yours,<br /> Solely Yours.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101714" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">9.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Now it has become<br /> An open secret.<br /> Every day we barter:<br /> You give me<br /> Your Compassion-Eye;<br /> I give You<br /> My gratitude-heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101715" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">10.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I stand in front<br /> Of the world-assembly<br /> And pray and meditate,<br /> And speak so highly of You.<br /> Can You not secretly come to me<br /> And whisper a sweet word to me-<br /> Even once?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101716" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">11.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You have told me time and again<br /> That when I am desperately<br /> In need of You,<br /> You will come to my rescue.<br /> My Lord,<br /> I need You badly.<br /> How is it that You are neglecting<br /> Your Promise to me?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101717" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">12.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Every day<br /> I am sending my heart-letters<br /> To You<br /> And asking You when both of us<br /> Will meet once again.<br /> Perhaps You do not know<br /> Or You do not care to know<br /> Of my heart's excruciating pangs.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101718" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">13.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I am swimming<br /> In the sea of ecstasy,<br /> For You are deeply enjoying<br /> My heart-garden.<br /> I am commanding my eyes<br /> Not to lose sight of You,<br /> Even for a fleeting second.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101719" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">14.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Everybody has special possessions.<br /> My only priceless possession:<br /> Your Forgiveness-Feet<br /> Inside my heart-home.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101720" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">15.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Sorrows attend my eyes<br /> And tears attend my heart<br /> When I fail to be intoxicated<br /> By Your outer Beauty<br /> And Your inner Fragrance.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101721" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">16.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I admit that I have made<br /> Most serious blunders<br /> And I admit that my faults<br /> Are innumerable.<br /> That does not mean<br /> That You cannot overlook<br /> My faults.<br /> That does not mean<br /> That You cannot forgive me.<br /> If You cannot overlook my faults,<br /> If You cannot forgive me,<br /> How are You going to preserve<br /> Your reputation that You are<br /> The Compassion-Forgiveness-Lord<br /> Of the fallen?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101722" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">17.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> My outer life is fast asleep<br /> But my inner life is fully awake.<br /> Do not abandon me because of<br /> My outer life's misbehaviour.<br /> There shall come a time,<br /> I am sure,<br /> When my outer life<br /> Will follow my inner life<br /> Happily and proudly.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101723" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">18.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> We know that earthly happiness<br /> Is of short duration.<br /> How is it that<br /> We do not increase every day<br /> The speed<br /> Of our climbing aspiration?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101724" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">19.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Every day I want to wash<br /> Your Feet<br /> With my heart's gratitude-tears.<br /> Nothing else ever concerns me.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101725" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">20.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I want to adore<br /> Your Compassion-Feet<br /> Sleeplessly and breathlessly.<br /> My Lord,<br /> I want to enjoy indifference<br /> To all else.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101726" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">21.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> My entire being is burning<br /> With love, devotion<br /> And surrender for You.<br /> I simply cannot understand<br /> How You can remain aloof.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101727" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">22.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Now that You have allowed me<br /> To gain Your Compassion,<br /> Please never allow my love<br /> To wane.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101728" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">23.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I am unable to steal Your Heart<br /> With my love<br /> Because Your Heart is too vast.<br /> Since my heart is so tiny,<br /> Can You not steal my heart<br /> With Your Love infinite?<br /> I am sure You can do it<br /> Easily.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101729" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">24.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> When I serve You,<br /> I pray to You,<br /> Do not pay me with Your<br /> Affection-Gratitude-Smile.<br /> What I need from You<br /> Is Your express Command<br /> To please You always<br /> In Your own Way.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101730" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">25.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Why do both of us boast<br /> Unnecessarily?<br /> Who chose whom first<br /> Is of no consequence.<br /> As long as we love each other<br /> Unreservedly,<br /> Let us put an end<br /> To our sweet dispute.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101731" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">26.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You have allowed me<br /> To remain seated at Your Feet<br /> All the time.<br /> What an extraordinary favour<br /> I have received from You!<br /> Now I need<br /> Another favour from You:<br /> Please destroy<br /> My shamelessly towering pride<br /> Immediately.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101732" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">27.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You have given me the capacity<br /> To serve You<br /> Day in and day out.<br /> If You want to bless me in return,<br /> Then I pray to You to grant me<br /> Your Ocean-Delight as a reward<br /> And nothing else.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101733" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">28.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I want to be deeply attached<br /> To Your Compassion-Eye<br /> And Forgiveness-Feet<br /> Exactly the way a desiring man<br /> Is attached to his desire-life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101734" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">29.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Your Love has entrapped my eyes,<br /> My heart, my life and my all.<br /> May I be allowed to entrap<br /> The hallowed dust of Your Feet?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101735" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">30.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I know what I offer You<br /> Is always small, very small,<br /> Yet Your Heart overflows<br /> With Nectar-Delight.<br /> I am prepared<br /> To come into the world<br /> Again and again<br /> Only to fathom Your Love<br /> Unfathomable.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101736" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">31.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Why are You so indifferent<br /> To me today?<br /> "My child,<br /> I do not even know the meaning<br /> Of indifference.<br /> Therefore, your opinion of Me<br /> Does not apply to Me."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101737" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">32.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Today I want You to avoid me,<br /> The impurity of my presence.<br /> I am really ashamed<br /> To call You my own.<br /> "My child,<br /> If I do not accept you<br /> As you are,<br /> Then how can I claim you<br /> To be My own, very own?"</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101738" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">33.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I have been waiting<br /> For a long time<br /> To hear from You.<br /> Why do You not ask for me?<br /> Does it cost You anything?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101739" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">34.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Time and again<br /> You are commanding me<br /> To come to You<br /> Not as a beggar, but as a prince,<br /> Your prince.<br /> My Lord, are You sure<br /> You mean what You are saying?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101740" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">35.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I have forgotten<br /> The beauty, fragrance,<br /> Majesty and divinity<br /> Of Your Feet.<br /> Do run towards me<br /> Fast, faster, fastest.<br /> Your absence<br /> Is stabbing my heart.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101741" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">36.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> There is no real reason for me<br /> To torture You<br /> For Your outer attention.<br /> Alas, alas, yet why...?</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101742" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">37.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Since I am not pleasing You<br /> In Your own Way,<br /> Please do me the greatest favour:<br /> Please hand me over<br /> To the darkest oblivion-night.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101743" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">38.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I live in earth-bound time,<br /> But I am certain that a mere glance<br /> From Your Compassion-Eye<br /> Can chase away the power of time<br /> That has enslaved my life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101744" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">39.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You have shown me many things,<br /> But out of Your infinite Compassion,<br /> Do show me Your own Path<br /> Through my life.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101745" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">40.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I beg of You to give me<br /> The capacity to ceaselessly cry<br /> At Your Lotus-Feet<br /> Until all my voice is lost.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101746" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">41.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> It seems to me<br /> That You have ceased<br /> To care for me.<br /> If I am right,<br /> Do show me the way<br /> And if I am wrong,<br /> Then prove it.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101747" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">42.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> If I jump into Your Arms,<br /> Will You hold me<br /> Or drop me?<br /> "My child,<br /> If you believe in your courage,<br /> Then I believe in My Concern."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101748" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">43.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I have purified my mind,<br /> I have widened my heart.<br /> Is there anything more<br /> You expect?<br /> "My child,<br /> Only one thing more:<br /> Patience."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101749" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">44.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I have given myself<br /> Another name:<br /> Earth-bound suffering.<br /> "My child,<br /> If you do not mind,<br /> I can add<br /> One more name:<br /> Heaven-free delight."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101750" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">45.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Every day I sing<br /> Your Victory-Songs<br /> For at least four hours.<br /> May I know from You<br /> What You do for me?<br /> "My child,<br /> You do your work<br /> And I do My Work.<br /> I energise your mind<br /> And inspire your heart."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101751" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">46.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You ask me to keep<br /> My consciousness<br /> One inch above my head<br /> When I meditate.<br /> Is there any reason?<br /> "My child,<br /> Your mind is inside your head.<br /> I want you to remain<br /> Outside your mind-jungle,<br /> At least when you meditate<br /> On Me."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101752" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">47.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> My love does not please You.<br /> My devotion does not please You.<br /> My surrender does not please You.<br /> Is there anything I have<br /> That can please You?<br /> "My child,<br /> Cultivate more sincerity.<br /> Cultivate more eagerness."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101753" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">48.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> My desire-life who chose,<br /> If not You?<br /> "My child,<br /> If you think that way,<br /> Then I have something new<br /> For you:<br /> Aspiration-heart."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101754" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">49.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> I am proud<br /> Of my gratitude-heart-tears.<br /> Do You have anything<br /> To be proud of?<br /> "My child,<br /> I have nothing<br /> To be proud of.<br /> From time immemorial<br /> I have been performing<br /> My self-imposed Task:<br /> I love you.<br /> I care for you."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101755" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">50.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> You have sent for me<br /> And I am now here.<br /> "But, My child,<br /> I have asked your whole family<br /> To come.<br /> You and your body only are here.<br /> Where is the rest of your family-<br /> Vital, mind and heart?<br /> How is it<br /> That you have come to Me<br /> Leaving them behind?<br /> Alas, I wanted to take<br /> Your whole family<br /> Together with Me<br /> To My new Home:<br /> Satisfaction."</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101756" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">51.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Everything is topsy turvy<br /> In this world.<br /> I am supposed to run after You.<br /> You are running after me<br /> Instead.</p>
  </div>
<div id="node-1101757" class="section-2">
  <h1 class="book-heading">52.</h1>
  
 

<p>My Lord,<br /> Have You any idea how beautiful<br /> Your Compassion-Eye is?<br /> My Lord,<br /> Have You any idea how powerful<br /> Your Protection-Hands are?<br /> My Lord,<br /> Have You any idea how merciful<br /> Your Lotus-Feet are?<br /> My Lord,<br /> Have You any idea how blissful<br /> Your Satisfaction-Heart is?<br /> "My child,<br /> I do not know.<br /> But if you think<br /> That I should know,<br /> Then let Me hear it from you."<br /> My Lord,<br /> On one condition,<br /> I expect Your undivided attention.<br /> "Of course, My child, of course."</p>
