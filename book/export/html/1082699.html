<p>After hearing Nag Mahashay's life story, Sri Ramakrishna said to him, "There is no harm in what you have done by marrying a second time to please your father. One can easily pray to God while living a householder's life."</p>
<p>"How can it be possible?" asked the disciple. "How can a householder's life and God go together?"</p>
<p>The Master said, "It is quite possible. In your case, I can clearly see that you will be able to do it."</p>
<p>"Please tell me how!" begged the disciple.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna then told him, "Kindly try to be in the company of sadhus, religious people, as often as possible."</p>
<p>"How can I find them? Where will I find them?" asked Nag Mahashay.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna replied, "You do not have to go and find them. They will come to you. I am sure that wherever you are, they are bound to come to you. Religious people, sadhus and mendicants, will all flock to you."</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna's words proved to be absolutely true. From far and wide, spiritual people used to come and visit Nag Mahashay in his little village home.</p>  </div>
