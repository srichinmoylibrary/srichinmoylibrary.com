<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the seeker is very sincere, very genuine and very highly developed, then the influence of the planets cannot affect him. Spiritual Masters are not affected at all by the planets. If something happens in a spiritual Master's life, and the planets have indicated its occurrence, it doesn't mean that the planets have brought it about. No, that is coincidence. But in the lives of absolutely ordinary human beings, the planets do play a considerable role.</p>
<p>The planets are like a broken record. They go on and on playing the same music. But there is a world infinitely higher than the planets. From there we can easily create and we can also delete anything in the record. If we delete what is there, then we can add something new. Your fate can also be adjusted by the Grace of the Supreme. If a seeker is very highly developed and gets considerable Grace, either from God or from a great spiritual Master, then the planets cannot influence that seeker. Even if one is an ordinary seeker, if the Master intervenes, then the planets cannot do anything.</p>
<p>I have done this many times for the most ordinary, unaspiring disciples. It was the Will of the Supreme; that was why I had to do it. If it had not been His Will, I would not have done it at all.</p>  </div>
