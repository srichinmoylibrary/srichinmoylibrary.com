<p>Imagination was aspiration.<br /> Inspiration was aspiration.<br /> Now aspiration is inspiration.</p>
<p>When imagination was aspiration<br /> I felt that I was of my inner Pilot<br />        And<br /> I was for my inner Pilot.</p>
<p>When inspiration was aspiration<br /> I felt that I could fly<br /> To my Eternity's Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>When aspiration is inspiration,<br /> When the real becomes conscious<br />   Of its existence in us,<br /> God the unmanifested Reality<br />   Becomes not only the manifested Reality<br />   But the only Reality<br /> In the world of glowing hope,<br /> In the world of flowing reality.</p>
