<p>My three old friends, my three good friends, my three intimate friends, my three indispensable friends, my three inseparable friends are inspiration, aspiration and realisation.</p>
<p>My inspiration-friend always helps me run far, farther and farthest and, at the same time, fast, faster and fastest. My aspiration-friend helps me fly high, higher and highest and, at the same time, fast, faster and fastest. My realisation-friend helps me dive deep, deeper and deepest and, at the same time, fast, faster and fastest.</p>
<p>At the end of my journey's close, my inspiration-friend shows me my Beloved Lord's illumining Feet. At the end of my journey's close, my aspiration-friend shows me my Beloved Lord's fulfilling Head. At the end of my journey's close, my realisation-friend shows me my Beloved Lord's immortalising Heart. Right from my spiritual journey's start, my inspiration-friend has accelerated my progress. My aspiration-friend has created a new world of all-illumining dawn for me. My realisation-friend has liberated me from the meshes of ignorance.</p>
<p>With inspiration my Beloved Supreme created the entire Universe. With aspiration my Beloved Supreme wants to become His Universe With realisation my Beloved Supreme wants to sing the song of perfection in His entire creation.</p>
<p>My inspiration-friend is always for a new creation, a new realisation, a new manifestation and a new fulfilment. My aspiration friend creates inside the new creation the message of transcendence, constant transcendence. Today's ultimate height is tomorrow's starting point: this is what my aspiration-friend teaches me. Finally, my realisation-friend tells me that these divine realities — the new creation and the message of self-transcendence — are not something that I acquire in the process of evolution. No, these are something that I eternally am. They are my own Eternity's Divinity.</p>
