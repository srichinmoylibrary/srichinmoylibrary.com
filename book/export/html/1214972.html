<h2>Excerpts from a statement made by Sri Chinmoy after receiving the United Nations' fortieth anniversary medal from Mr. Robert Muller</h2>

<p>The United Nations is something that the Creator, the Author of all Good, at every moment cherishes. No human force will ever be able to destroy the United Nations, for the United Nations is not a mere building or a mere idea; it is not a man-made creation. The United Nations is the Vision-Light of the Absolute Supreme, which is slowly, steadily and unerringly illumining the ignorance-night of our human life. So the divine success and supreme progress of the United Nations are bound to become a reality. At His choice Hour, the Absolute Supreme will ring His own Victory-Bell here on earth through the loving and serving heart of the United Nations.</p>
