<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Kindly feel that you are only studying to please the Supreme in you. Whatever the result, don't take it as success or failure; take it as progress. Otherwise there will always be a competitive spirit and you will be tense. But if you feel that you are studying to please God, then you won't separate your outer life from your inner life and there will be no tension. Keep in mind that you are not doing these things for name and fame. If you are doing something just to please God, then you are not responsible for the result. At that time you live in the soul; and when you are in the soul, there is no tension.</p>  </div>
