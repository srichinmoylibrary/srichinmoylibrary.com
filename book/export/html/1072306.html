<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Before I lifted, I breathed in three times. The first time I offered my gratitude to God the Creator, who has created me. The second time I offered my gratitude to God the Preserver, who is preserving me on earth. The third time I offered my gratitude to God the Transformer, who is transforming my mind, my vital and my physical. I believe in these three aspects of God, so three times I offered my gratitude.</p>  </div>
