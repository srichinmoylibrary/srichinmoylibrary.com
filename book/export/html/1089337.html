<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there are certain simple spiritual guidelines that can help an average lawyer or lawmaker. He should try to be as sincere and as simple as possible and he should try to bring to the fore the loving heart rather than the demanding vital. Our point of view may be no better than others' point of view. If that is the case, then a heart of compromise is undoubtedly the best spiritual guideline.</p>  </div>
