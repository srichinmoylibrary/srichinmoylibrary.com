<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Human beings can get realisation in two to three thousand years. Again, some are tired soldiers; they want to take rest after one incarnation, and then they don't make progress for a long time. For many years they make no progress at all. Like bad students, they come back to the same class again and again.</p>  </div>
