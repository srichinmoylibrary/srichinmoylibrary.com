<p>To succeed in life, devotion is necessary and patience is necessary. Devotion has to be spontaneous. Patience has to be sleepless. There is no other way to succeed in life.</p>
<p>Greatness and devotedness perfectly rhyme. Patience is nothing short of strength; devotion is Eternity’s Length. Both devotion and patience are of supreme importance. Devotion wants to run fast, faster, fastest. Patience says to devotion, <em>“You run the fastest. I shall conquer all obstacles on the way for you.”</em> To quote Einstein: <em>“If one gets hold of something that will not let go its hold on him — in short, if one has the devotion for a great work — what more is necessary? Patience! Then a little more patience.”</em></p>  </div>
