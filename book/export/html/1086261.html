    <title>Question: Most disciples fold their hands when you are meditating and looking at them. But sometimes when I am meditating with you this doesn&#039;t come naturally. Is it all right not to fold our hands while you are looking at us?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Folding your hands should always be spontaneous. It should never be an outer show. It will be wrong if just as I look at you, you fold your hands and as soon as I look at the next person, you drop them. This is just like a mischievous boy. When the teacher comes, the clever student pretends to be working and as soon as the teacher looks to the other side, the student misbehaves. That is very bad. If I am looking at somebody else and then I turn to you, if you suddenly fold your hands and it is not spontaneous, then you are not getting anything from it.</p>
<p>But again, there are some disciples who are by nature very good, extremely devoted. They know that they cannot always remain in their highest, on the peak. They feel that when the Master looks at them, they get additional inner joy, thrill, confidence and enthusiasm. If there is anything they have not done which may further elevate their consciousness, then they will do it. They feel that if this outward gesture, folding their hands, is done soulfully, it definitely increases their aspiration.</p>
<p>In some instances you may even have a better meditation when I am looking at someone else than when I am looking at you. I may be looking at someone else who is receiving according to his capacity and receptivity. At that time, if you feel that you are in your highest consciousness and if you look at me, like a magnet you can pull my light. Although I am looking at somebody else, more of my light can be going to you than to him. On the other hand, while I am concentrating on you, perhaps you are thinking that all the other disciples are looking at you. Or your mind may be counting how many seconds I am looking at you and comparing this with how long I looked at others. So, if you fold your hands, it has to be spontaneous. If it is spontaneous, it adds to your aspiration. If it is not spontaneous, it is a useless outer gesture.</p>  </div>
