<p>Each time I drive around, there will be some people looking at my car. They cannot believe the car is so small, so tiny! They are quite surprised. They get tremendous joy and thrill when they see such a small car.</p>
<p>The car is tiny, but inside it is very compact, and I feel much more secure inside than I felt in the previous cars that I used. They were not so solid as this one.</p>
