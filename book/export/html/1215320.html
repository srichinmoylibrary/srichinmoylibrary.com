<p>This morning I went with my guards to the Armory to walk and jog. I was walking on my toes and doing sidesteps, crossovers and other exercises. The boys were watching me in silence very devotedly. One older lady who happened to be there came up and said, "It is so quiet here â€” like a library or a church!"</p>
