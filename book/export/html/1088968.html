<p>A certain king had three astrologers. He relied on astrology for everything. But for a few months the predictions of the astrologers were not coming true. The king became extremely displeased with them and eventually he dispensed with their services.</p>
<p>Then he asked his prime minister to get a new astrologer. He said, "I don't need three. One will be enough. But I want an astrologer who will always be able to tell me about my future and about the world's future so that I can always take advantage of what I know is going to happen. If I know beforehand what is going to happen, then definitely I will be able to be successful in everything that I undertake."</p>
<p>The minister made an announcement that he would interview any astrologers who would like to get the post at the palace. The minister found seven astrologers who wanted the post, and the king decided that he would personally see all of them and make the choice.</p>
<p>After interviewing them, the king casually said, "It seems that all of you are great astrologers. Do you know of any astrologers in the kingdom who have not come here because they know that you are greater and feel that they do not have a chance?"</p>
<p>One astrologer said to the king, "Your Highness, I have a friend who is an astrologer. But I know infinitely more than he does. Therefore, he did not dare to come to the palace."</p>
<p>The king said, "Tell me his name and address and I will summon him."</p>
<p>When the other astrologer was brought before the king, the king asked him, "Why didn't you come here to apply for this post?"</p>
<p>The man was very clever. First he remained silent. Then he said, "Your Majesty, these astrologers are all fools. How could any of them be your astrologer? Did any of them know who was going to be appointed? I knew all along that I would be appointed. Therefore, I did not bother coming. It is I who was destined to be your astrologer."</p>
<p>The king said to him, "You are right. I am making you my new astrologer." Then the king asked all the other astrologers to leave the palace.</p>  </div>
