<p>Divine Lord Supreme,<br /> How is it that You have given me<br /> Trouble after trouble,<br /> An endless series of troubles?</p>
<p>"Child, since you think and feel<br /> That I am the only and real culprit,<br /> Then the best thing is<br /> For you to offer them back to Me.<br /> I shall gladly accept them."</p>
<p>Divine Lord Supreme,<br /> How is it that I smile and smile<br /> And have become a sea of smiles?<br /> Who made me so?<br /> For God's sake, You have to tell me the truth!</p>
<p>"Child, for God's sake,<br /> I am telling you the absolute truth.<br /> Ah, don't you know that your divine smiles<br /> Are the great and unchallenged contributions<br /> Of your devoted heart and surrendered life?"</p>
