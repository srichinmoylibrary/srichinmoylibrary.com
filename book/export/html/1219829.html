<p>A simple life, a oneness-heart,<br /> A soaring soul, a glowing goal:<br /> O Pilot brave, your selfless role<br /> Is now silencing the dart<br /> That tortured the New York City.<br /> You are its perfection-cry.<br /> Millions shall treasure your vision high,<br /> Its wonder-progress-beauty.<br /> [Dedicated to Edward ‘Ed’ Koch, who served three terms<br /> as mayor of New York City from 1978–1989. Sri Chinmoy<br /> composed this tribute on 15 August 1978 and the song<br /> was performed during his meeting with the mayor at City<br /> Hall on 16 August 1978.]</p>
