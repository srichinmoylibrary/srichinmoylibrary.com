<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, you often move around wearing your Indian shorts and Indian robes. What do your disciples think of you? Are you not an <em>anomaly</em> in New York City?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, strangely enough I myself have asked them the same question. They have said to me that, although my clothes are a <em>deviation from the usual</em>, and I am not like them in my outer way of life, they like my cute Indianism, for they love my Indian heart.</p>  </div>
