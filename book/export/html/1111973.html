<p>I was running by my 600-metre mark, and Baoul and Kailash were 200 metres behind me in a car. Then I saw Neeta in a car, so I smiled and waved.</p>
<p>When I mentioned it to Nishtha, she told me that Neeta doesn't drive; she doesn't even have a car. Then I began doubting myself. Am I so blind? Later I found out that Neeta does have a car, and it was Neeta I saw.</p>
