<p>I was observing all the disciples during the ultramarathon. Pranika sometimes found it difficult to smile at me because she was dying. Shephali dies inside when she runs, but she always smiles at me. Such a peculiar style Shephali has! She runs as if she is boxing. Her elbows stick out.</p>
<p>Heinz was the rabbit of the day. He is such a good sprinter. He was ahead for so long. Then all of a sudden, he slowed down and disappeared. He sells tofu for Abarita's factory, so he should have kept some tofu inside his pocket to give him energy.</p>
<p>Databir's goal was to defeat Khudita, but what could he do? At one point she was 16 laps ahead of him.</p>
