<p>God and I<br /> Have a joint bank account.<br /> He earns and deposits;<br /> I neither earn nor deposit.<br /> "Son," He says, "why don't you<br /> Withdraw and buy your desires<br /> So that at the end of the year<br /> We shall be paying<br /> Less income tax to Satan?<br /> And also for another reason<br /> I would like you to withdraw<br /> Our wealth from the bank:<br /> If you issue cheques to others,<br /> The world will see that<br /> You and I are good partners,<br /> Loving partners, eternal partners."</p>
