<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life good character is of paramount importance. To have good character means that soulful and boundless life-energy is operating in and through the seeker. If the seeker does not see and feel boundless energy, peace, light and bliss, then how can he remain in his highest consciousness?</p>
<p>If one is a seeker, then he has to be a person of character; otherwise, his life will be contradictory. God is all purity. If one wants to make real, solid, tangible progress and realise God as fast as possible, then purity must come first. Purity is the ladder we climb up in order to reach God's Abode. If there is no ladder, then how can we climb up?</p>
<p>Without good character, there will be no purity. And if one does not have purity inside the heart and inside the physical, then how can he make progress? Purity and character go together. If someone has inner purity, then he also has good character. And if somebody has good character, it means he is maintaining in his inner life tremendous purity.</p>
