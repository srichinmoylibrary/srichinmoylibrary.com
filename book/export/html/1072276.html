<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything I do is meant to please God, my Inner Pilot. While pleasing Him, I am being satisfied. I do not have a sense of separativity. If I can consciously and soulfully please Him in His own Way, then I feel that I am more than rewarded. If I establish my oneness totally with you, then on the strength of my oneness, whatever gives you joy definitely gives me joy. My Inner Pilot is my highest reality-existence, and I am part and parcel of Him. So when I please Him in His own Way, I am more than pleased.</p>  </div>
