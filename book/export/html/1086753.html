<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is definitely a human being like us. Unfortunately, we do not recognise Him. Why do we not recognise Him as a human being? Because inside us there is a special eye and a special heart. When once that special eye and special heart are opened, then you will easily be able to see that like us, He is a human being. This eye is between our two ordinary eyes and a little above. The spiritual heart is inside our ordinary heart. So if you can see that heart and feel your presence there, if you can see your third eye and also feel your presence, then you will easily be able to know that God is also a human being like you and me.</p>  </div>
