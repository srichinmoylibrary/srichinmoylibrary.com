<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We both accept God's Light, but if your inner hunger is not as intense as mine, naturally you will not be able to eat the same quantity. If one person has an insatiable hunger and someone else is satisfied with only a little, naturally the former will accept more.</p>  </div>
