  <h1 class="book-heading">The death of Akshyoi</h1>
  
 
<p>Ravana, the great hostile force, and his wife, Mandodari, had a few sons. Akshyoi was one of their very, very powerful sons, and his parents were very proud of him.</p>
<p>One day Hanuman, Rama's dearest devotee, was sent by Sri Ramachandra to find out where Sita was. He came to Sita with greatest difficulty and saw her and talked with her. On his way back to Rama, he destroyed Ashokvana, a most beautiful garden where Ravana and his people enjoyed themselves to their hearts' content. Hanuman destroyed it completely.</p>
<p>On hearing this, Ravana sent five of his captains and also his son Akshyoi to attack Hanuman. The captains and his son were all killed. His wife, Mandodari, got furious, and scolded him and insulted him, "Because of you, because of you, I have lost my son! He was dearer than the dearest in my life. Why did you send him? Those five captains were not enough?"</p>
<p>"They were not enough and here is the proof," replied Ravana. "They were also killed along with my son."</p>
<p>"You should have sent them only! So what if they are killed. Who cares for them? But because of you, my son was killed. I hate you! Never dare to send any of our other sons to fight. You are paying the soldiers in your army. You are paying the captains and the commanders. They have to work for their pay. For them it is either victory or defeat. Either they will take their enemies' lives or their enemies will take their lives. So let them play with life and death. I want my children to be with me. Let them be heroes with me."</p>
<p>Ravana asked, "How can they be heroes if they don't fight and kill?"</p>
<p>"One can become a great hero by developing strength. But one does not have to go into battle to show one's capacity. One can demonstrate it without killing or being killed," said Mandodari.</p>
<p>"O Mandodari, you are talking philosophy," Ravana said.</p>
<p>"My philosophy is if you are sure, then fight and kill. But if you are not sure, then don't go. Cleverness is also strength. Who wants to lose his life? Life is so precious. If my son is one hundred per cent sure of killing someone, then I will allow him to go. But if he is not sure, then I will not let him go. This son of ours, who was so close to my heart and soul, I lost. But before you send the rest of our sons to any other battle, you must ask me and I shall see."</p>
<p>Ravana said, "I am the monarch and you are ruling my life. But love is blind, and because of my love for you, I am surrendering to you."</p>
<p>Mandodari said, "I shall not exploit your love. My love for you shall give you wisdom always."</p>
