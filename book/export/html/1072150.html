<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Art is at once finite and infinite. Geometry offers us the message of the finite proceeding toward the infinite. Sometimes geometry wants to offer us a glimpse of the Infinite in the finite itself. Art also does this, but when art does it, it does it in a subtle, delicate and soul-stirring way. Geometry does it in a dry, one-pointed way with the intellectual mind and the developed brain.</p>  </div>
