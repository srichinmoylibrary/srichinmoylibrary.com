<p>"God, do You not feel sad that You make me first in all the things I do? Others are all second, third, fourth and so on. What do they think of You? Do You not feel sad in their sadness?"</p>
<p>"My child, I don't feel sad because they don't feel sad. Do you want to know how they can not be sad when they lose to you in everything? Because, unlike you, they are spiritually mature. They have already established their complete oneness with My Heart of constant Oneness-Delight!"</p>  </div>
