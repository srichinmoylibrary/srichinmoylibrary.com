<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Don't think of doing anything. Just keep the door of your consciousness open to see whether it is a thief or a guest that is coming in. Allow in only those that you want. Keep out the lower thoughts. Open the door to higher, sublime thoughts. This is the first step in working on your consciousness. The following steps will come to you from within.</p>  </div>
