<p>Why are you in a hurry? Do you think that your aspiration-train, which is bound for satisfaction-goal, is leaving soon and that your body, vital, mind and heart are not ready, that only the soul is ready? Is that why you are in a tearing hurry?</p>
<p>Why are you in a hurry? Do you think that Godâ€™s Hour already struck while you were fast asleep? Is that why are you sad, embarrassed and fearful? Is that why you are in a tearing hurry to pray and meditate and thus see the Face of God?</p>
<p>Why are you in a hurry? Do you think that your promise to God has not been fulfilled? Do you think that the time has passed and your promise remains unfulfilled? Do you feel sad and miserable that you are not a man of truth? Do you feel you are not a true devoted and soulful instrument of God? Is that why you are in a hurry to meditate, to dive within to do the needful sooner than at once?</p>
<p>Why are you in a hurry? Is it because you desperately need a fruitful smile from your Beloved Supreme in response to your soulful cry? This soulful smile can alone give your life its life-breath; your heart its nourishment-love; your mind its nourishment-clarity; your vital its nourishment-integrity; and your body its nourishment-purity. Is it because of this that you are in a hurry?</p>
<p>If all these questions are answered in the affirmative, then I wish to say that you have every reason to be in a hurry. If today you miss your aspiration-train that is bound for realisation-goal, then rest assured you will have to wait indefinitely. So if you are on time, if you catch the aspiration-train that is heading towards realisation-goal, then you are bound to see everything that you wanted to see, feel everything that you wanted to feel and become everything that you wanted to become. So do not miss the aspiration-train.</p>
