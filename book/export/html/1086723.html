<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The difference that you notice between your closest friend, God, and your other friends is very simple. God thinks that you are as good as He is, as divine as He is, as perfect as He is; whereas your other friends think you may be good, divine and perfect, but they feel that they are better, more divine and more perfect than you are. All your human friends outwardly think and inwardly feel you are not on their level, but you like them, they like you; you love them and they love you. That is why they are your friends and you are their friends. But in God's case, He loves you not because you are His eternal friend, but for something more: you are He and He is you.</p>  </div>
