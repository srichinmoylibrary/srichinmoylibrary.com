<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> White light is the light of divine purity, infinite purity. It is also the light of the Divine Mother. God is both Father and Mother; He is our Eternal Father and He is our Eternal Mother. When God wants to express His Divinity in the feminine aspect, He uses white light. When he sees white light, the seeker can rest assured that he has established an inner connection with God the Universal Mother.</p>  </div>
