<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Subtle art is the sound that most closely approaches silence, the Silence-Height. There is also another sound which is very, very close to the Silence-Height and that is the earth-transforming sound of the seeker's dedicated and surrendered service.</p>  </div>
    <small><p>From: Sri Chinmoy, <em>The height of silence and the might of sound</em>, Agni Press, 1974<br />    Sourced from http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/hsms-37</p></small>    </div>  </body>
