<p>Art is I; Science is we.</p>
<p>Similarly, Tagore is I; his creative genius has the power to be we. The well-known scientist Meghnad Saha fervently hoped that Tagore, like Goethe, would turn to science.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“May we not hope that, like his illustrious predecessor Goethe, he [Tagore] will turn for a while to modern science, and give expression in his inimitable poetry to the Hope behind the invading despair and the Harmony behind the modern Babel of jarring voices.”</p>
<p>— Sri Aurobindo <em>The Golden Book of Tagore</em></p>
