<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In God's case, His Law and His Compassion are one and the same. Our demanding vital will call something God's Law, whereas our aspiring heart calls that very thing God's Compassion. God's Compassion-Light and God's Justice-Might are the same. It all depends on who receives it. If it is the aspiring heart, then we call it God's Compassion-Light. But if it is the demanding vital, the constricting vital, then we call it God's adamantine Law.</p>  </div>
