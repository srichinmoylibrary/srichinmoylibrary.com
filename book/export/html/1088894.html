<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> Has meditating with you and studying with you changed the lives of the musicians that you have had as disciples?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> According to my inner vision, it has definitely changed them. In the outer life, anyone who knows them can be the judge.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> How do you think it changed them?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They have intensified their inner cry. Their cry for God, for Truth, for Light has immensely increased. Also, they have simplified and purified their outer life to some extent. They have definitely made progress in the spiritual life.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> Do you think it helped their music in any way?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it has inspired their creative capacities and it has made their music better in whatever way they wanted.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> How about their attitudes towards what they did before â€” drugs and alcohol and things like that?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They have given up these things.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> They still refrain from all those things?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, as long as they remain on my path.</p>  </div>
