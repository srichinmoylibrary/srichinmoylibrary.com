<p>Education is that which tends towards the formation of character. To quote Tagore,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I believe that the object of education is the freedom of mind which can only be achieved through the path of freedom — though freedom has its risk and responsibility as life itself has.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He throws more light on education when he observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A school, however perfect, is nothing more than a road leading to education. Who is ignorant of the fact that Tagore himself was not a school product? Yet at the same time, Rabindranath’s knowledge was as vast as the Indian Ocean.</p>  </div>
