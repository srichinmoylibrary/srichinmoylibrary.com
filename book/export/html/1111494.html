<p>Tom Curtin did so well in the Seven-Mile Reversible Race. Out of 500 people he stood tenth, and he was sixth in his age category. He never smiles, but today he came up to me smiling and said, "Guru, I stood tenth."</p>
<p>I said, "I am so proud of you."</p>
<p>He said, "I am getting a trophy, but I have to wait an hour for it."</p>
<p>I told him, "You should wait for it."</p>
