<p>My Lord, my Lord, not many things but only one thing I need from You, and that thing is my happiness.</p>
<p>"My child, My child, I am anxious to give you happiness; I am eager to give you happiness. But you are not ready to receive it and I do not know when you will be ready.</p>
<p>"My child, you can have happiness when you feel your own heart's sweetness and your own life's fulness in My transcendental Will."</p>
