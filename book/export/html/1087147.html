<p>In Germany Projjwal and I went into a music store looking for a violin. They had one for $300, but it was very bad. I said, "Since the expensive one is so bad, show us one that is quite cheap."</p>
<p>The lady brought us one that cost $65. I liked it so much. I asked, "Can you give us an expensive bow?"</p>
<p>She said, "You don't get a bow." Then she gave me a rotten bow.</p>
<p>At first she couldn't find the case. Buy a violin, but there is no case! Finally she found one.</p>
<p>She knew English well, but all the time she was talking in German. Just as we were ready to go, she started speaking English. For four or five minutes she had to speak to us in English!</p>
<p>So this is how we got the violin that Projjwal bought me on his birthday.</p>
