<p>"The difference between You and me, my Lord, is this: I come to You when I need You; You come to me even when You don't need me."</p>
<p>"My child, it seems that I shall have to correct your philosophy all My Life! You come to Me outwardly when I inwardly need you. I come to you even when you unconsciously need Me."</p>
