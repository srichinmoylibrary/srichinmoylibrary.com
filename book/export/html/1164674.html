<p>Yesterday I knew how to multiply necessities. Today I know how to minimise necessities.</p>
<p>Yesterday necessity was my great friend. Today simplicity is my good friend.</p>
<p>Yesterday my desire-necessity made me the obscure man. Today my aspiration-necessity has made me the obvious angel.</p>
<p>God's Compassion-Height was my yesterday's necessity. God's Justice-Light is my today's necessity.</p>
<p>Yesterday my earth-desiring necessities appreciated God the indulgent Grandfather. Today my Heaven-longing necessities admire God the disciplinary Father.</p>
<p>Three wise necessities in the spiritual life: God-Compassion, God-Protection, God-Satisfaction.</p>
<p>Two wiser necessities: God-Protection and God-Satisfaction.</p>
<p>One wisest necessity: God-Satisfaction.</p>
<p>God's Necessity was man's divine aspiration.</p>
<p>God's Necessity is man's supreme realisation.</p>
<p>God's Necessity will be man's total and perfect Perfection.</p>  </div>
