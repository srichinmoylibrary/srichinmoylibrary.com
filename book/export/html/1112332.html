<p><em>(In Heaven. The Absolute, George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson.)</em></p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> George, John and Thomas, you three have worked very hard for your country's independence. Now your country is a free nation. Are you not happy?</p>
<p><em>John Adams:</em> Of course we are.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> But it was all Your Grace, Your unconditional Grace.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> Of late I have been feeling that if America could make more inner progress, then her outer success would be more illumining, more fulfilling.</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> You are completely right, My son. Now, tell Me something. Who said this while he was on earth: "Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth. "</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> Me! it was I who said that!</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> You are right in remembering what you once said. And I am right in telling you that your words are correct, O Father of America-Father, indeed, in body, vital, mind and heart; Father in action; Father in realisation.John, do you know who said this: "If it be the pleasure of Heaven that my country shall require the poor offering of my life, the victim shall be ready, at the appointed hour of sacrifice, come when that hour may. But while I do live, let me have a country, and that a free country..."?</p>
<p><em>John Adams:</em> Of course I know, Father. It was I who said it while I was on earth. And this was not a mere emotional outburst. It was an inner experience of mine. I am really and truly grateful to You, Father, for having given me that heart-nourishing and soul-illumining experience.</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> John, everything that I have is for you and for your brothers and sisters, for humanity, for my entire creation. Your enemies called you a stubborn mule, John, but I call you a determined truth-fighter.</p>
<p><em>John Adams:</em> I thank You from the very depths of my gratitude-heart.</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> Thomas, you wrote the Declaration of Independence. To Me, it was not a mere declaration. It was something infinitely more. It was the freedom-cry of humanity's aspiration-day from the frustration-night of ignorance.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> Father, out of Your infinite Compassion You made me Your humble instrument.</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> And with your most striking receptivity you received Me, my world-illumining Light. For your extraordinary service to your country, you would have been known as a great man. But for the offering of your independence-declaration you are known as a good man, a God-messenger, a Vision-son of God.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> Father, I also said something on earth.</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> Let Me know what it is.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> "The God who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time."</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> True, absolutely true, My son. George, John, Thomas, I hear that you have been practising three splendid songs. Can I hear them?</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> Certainly You can, Father.</p>
<p><em>John Adams:</em> Father, our teacher is Thomas.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> But, You have not given us the capacity to sing, Father. So if we do not sing well, then it is our fault and not Thomas'.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> I shall take the full blame if they don't sing well.</p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> All right, all right. Let us not remain in the world of blame. Let us remain in the world of practicality and reality. Teacher, you sing first.</p>
<p><em>(Thomas Jefferson sings:</em></p>

<p>O star spangled banner of the hour Supreme,<br /> You are God’s Sound-Delight.<br /> In you is God’s Silence-Might.<br /> For you is the world-Pilot’s Transcendence-Dream.</p>

<p><em>The Absolute, George Washington and John Adams offer thunderous applause.)</em></p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> Now, John, you sing your song.</p>
<p><em>(John Adams sings:</em></p>

<p>O high I flew to see God's Home<br /> And far I ran to see God's Eye<br /> And deep I dived to feel God's Love.<br /> Behold the wings of my victory-sky!</p>

<p><em>The Absolute, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson offer thunderous applause.)</em></p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> Now, Father of the Nation, you sing.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> Father, I am also the father of the non-musical family. And now I am going to prove it.</p>
<p><em>(George Washington sings:</em></p>

<p>My life began with duty's pride,<br /> My life shall live with beauty's light.<br /> My life shall sport with reality's soul,<br /> My life shall end with Divinity's height.</p>

<p><em>The Absolute, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson offer thunderous applause.)</em></p>
<p><em>Absolute:</em> Thomas, you and your students have sung most beautifully and most soulfully. You have done a very good job in teaching them how to sing. I am offering you My special blessingful Gratitude on behalf of these two brothers. I wish you three always to be together here in Heaven and there on earth.</p>  </div>
