<p>A real member of the United Nations is he who does not forget that his is the supreme responsibility to bring to the fore the inspiring capacities and aspiring qualities of his own nation so that other nations will faithfully and gloriously be inspired to do the same. Needless to say, the divine capacities and supreme qualities of all the nations combined will fulfil the zenith-climbing longings of mankind.</p>  </div>
