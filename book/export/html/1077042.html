<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you are having a bad dream, if you really want to transform your bad dream into a good dream, then you must immediately try to wake up. Stand up and stretch your limbs; then sit down and meditate. If you dive deep within, then the strength of your inner meditation and light is bound to transform your bad dreams into good, illumining and fulfilling dreams. This is what you have to do if you want to transform them. But if you want to get rid of the bad dreams, then get up immediately right after you have had the dream and say, “Ah, I am now relieved from the evil attack. ” Before you go back to sleep, smile and laugh and dance that the attack is over.</p>  </div>
