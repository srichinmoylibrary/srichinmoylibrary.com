<p>Today on a street in Marrakesh, a lady was trying to sell Pulak a necklace. He said he didn't need it.</p>
<p>She said, "You need it. Please buy it as a gift."</p>
<p>So he paid her two dirham and took the necklace. Then he said, "This is now mine. So I want to give it to you." Then he gave her back the necklace.</p>
<p>This is how he got rid of the lady who was bothering him.</p>
