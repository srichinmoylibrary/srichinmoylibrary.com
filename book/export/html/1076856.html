<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I feel very happy that you have asked all these questions and it is with real joy that I have answered them. At the same time I wish to say that this house is open for all, but only those who have a genuine interest in these teachings can derive benefit from them. If you want to buy a pair of shoes you go to a shoe store. If you want to buy a suit you go to a clothing store. In the same way we here offer something that is of interest only to those who want to acquire Truth. Thank you.</p>  </div>
