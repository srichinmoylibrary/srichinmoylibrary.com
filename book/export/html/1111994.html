<p>When I was watching the Olympic marathon trials on video, I was looking for Gary Fanelli, but I could not see him anywhere. They were showing only the lead runners — the first five or six. He ran 2:18 and his position was 23rd out of 160. The next time he comes to New York I will definitely honour him.</p>
<p>He is such a great runner! A few months ago he had an operation. He is not fully recovered. Only two months ago at our race in Connecticut he asked me to pray for him. He is very receptive; that is why my prayers work for him. He told me that he prays and meditates on my picture every day.</p>
<p>Once when he was sitting beside me at Madison Square Garden, he said, "Guru, to sit beside you is to sit beside the whole world."</p>
<p>His brother and also a friend of theirs join our races in San Francisco.</p>
