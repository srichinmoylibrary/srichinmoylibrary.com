<p>This morning at four o’clock I vividly saw one of the disciples in the inner world. His soul came to me. He was so happy, and I blessed him. His soul is very small, but most beautiful and most powerful. His body is much more stout than his soul — much more! His subtle physical being gave me a beautiful blue lamp, very bright. How happily his subtle body was giving me this lamp! I was very pleased.</p>
<p>Now, in the outer world, I have given this disciple a job: I have requested him to find a lamp like that for me. That experience took place in the higher world. Now he will bring me many lamps, I am sure. Easily he will be able to do it. I shall have to choose the one that will satisfy me.</p>
<p>This is what happens when we are dealing with the soul.</p>
