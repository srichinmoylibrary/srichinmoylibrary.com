<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on what kind of affection you have for your pet. If you keep something near you, you have to show it affection and love. But at the same time, you have to know that there is something else called attachment. Affection is very good. God is full of Affection, full of Compassion; but He is not attached. Our difficulty is that when we use the term compassion, we are only fooling ourselves. We say that we are showing compassion, but if we go deep within we see that it is all attachment. Only God has Compassion.</p>
<p>You have to know how much time you spend on your dog or cat, and how much time you spend on meditation. When the dog takes up your time, do you feel the presence of God inside the dog? Do you feel that you are serving God in him? If you say yes, then it is wonderful. While you are feeding the dog, if you feel that the dog is not your God but that inside the dog is the Presence of God, then it is all right. But do not let your pet become the first and foremost object of love and adoration. If you are attached to your dog or cat, if he takes all your attention, then it is like being attached to your child. And this kind of attachment is not at all good.</p>  </div>
