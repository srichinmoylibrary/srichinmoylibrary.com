<p>My Lord Supreme, this is a special day, Gratitude Day. Alas, I do not have even an iota of gratitude to offer You. Since I have no gratitude, please tell me what I can offer You instead.</p>
<p>"My child, then give Me a soulful promise."</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, I do not know what a soulful promise is. I always break my promise. I promise in season and out of season. But never do I fulfil my promises. Such being the case, my Lord Supreme, please tell me what I can offer You instead of a soulful promise.</p>
<p>"My child, then tell Me that you love Me divinely."</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, I do not know what divine Love is. How can I offer You divine Love when I do not know what divine Love feels like?</p>
<p>"My child, then give Me a fruitful cry. Cry for Me once, only once in your life."</p>
<p>Alas, my Lord Supreme, I do not cry even for myself. How do You expect me to cry for You?</p>
<p>"My child, let Me tell you one thing. Both of us deserve two special names. Each of us will have a new name. Your new name will be a secret and clever unwillingness, and My new Name will be an unreservedly open and compassionately stupid Forgiveness."</p>  </div>
