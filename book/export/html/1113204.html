<p>"How is Nirmala today? Have the doctors decided when they are going to operate?"</p>
<p>"Arpita-di told me that the doctors have given Nirmala-di a blood transfusion and that she is looking fine. Arpita-di asked me to tell you something else."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"She says that Nirmala-di is sad that the Mother has to spend fifteen rupees a day to keep her in the hospital."</p>
<p>"Chinmoy, you tell your sister to inform Nirmala-di that she does not have to think of such things. Instead of thinking of the Mother's financial problems, she must think only of her own health problems."</p>
<p>At that point Arita-da happened to pass by and he overheartd the phrase 'health problems'. He said to Nolini-da: "I overheard your conversation. You were telling Chinmoy about Nirmala's health problems. What are you going to do about my ignorance problem?" Then, without saying another word, he just walked away.</p>
<p>Nolini-da burst into laughter and said: "Amrita, our eternal Amrita." Then he said: "Come with me. I have something for you to give to Nirmala." I followed him into his room, where he gave me some of the Mother's <em>prasad</em> for Nirmala-di.</p>  </div>
