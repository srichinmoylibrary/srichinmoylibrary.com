<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Many people have tried and are trying to change the consciousness of criminals by not putting them into jail. There are many methods that have been applied, but no method will be of any avail unless and until the spiritual method is fully applied. The spiritual method is prayer and meditation. If prayer and meditation can reign supreme on earth, then there will be no necessity for putting anybody in jail or taking any outer measure to correct or perfect anybody. Prayer and meditation are the most effective ways to put an end to all crimes.</p>  </div>
