<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You get joy when I ask you to do something for me, to work for me. I get joy if I ask you to work for me and also if I ask you not to work. It is the same with the spiritual Masters. The Supreme asks some souls to work for Him on earth and some not to. Some souls, when they realise God, don’t want to manifest Divinity on earth and with God’s approval, they remain in the soul’s region. But those who want to manifest are like divine soldiers. They come down again and again and work for the Supreme for the transformation of humanity. For these souls, manifestation is always necessary. They feel that if manifestation doesn’t take place, then realisation is useless.</p>  </div>
