<p>A few days ago I was running past the bus stop on 150th Street. A black man and a white woman were standing there waiting for the bus.</p>
<p>Because of the construction there, I can't run very fast and I always have to go from one side of the road to the other. When the lady saw me, she said, "Good going! You're going so fast."</p>
<p>The man said, "No, he's not. I could have run much faster when I was his age."</p>
<p>The lady said, "No, you couldn't have."</p>
<p>Poor man, he was jealous of my running ability.</p>
