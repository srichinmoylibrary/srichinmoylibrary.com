<p>In the three-mile race, a teenage girl with a bandage around her knee was ahead of me. Then she gave up.</p>
<p>The race counted on the honour system. Otherwise, in five or six places you could have taken a shortcut.</p>
<p>The first mile, according to Pahar, I did in under eight minutes. But then the second mile was slower because at least twenty times I had to run through puddles.</p>
