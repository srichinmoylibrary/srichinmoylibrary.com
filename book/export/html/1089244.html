<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have about sixty Centres all over the world. From time to time I visit all the Centres and they keep inner contact with me. I have written over two hundred fifty books. I go to the United Nations twice a week and hold meditation for the delegates and the members of the staff. I try to serve mankind in the community of nations according to my inner capacity, which I call my devoted soulful service. This is what I do. Everywhere I try to serve and whenever I get an opportunity to serve, I feel my life on earth is worth living.</p>  </div>
