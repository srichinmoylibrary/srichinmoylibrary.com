<p>I am not going to talk back<br /> To anyone any more.<br /> No, not even to God.<br /> Let Him scold me,<br /> Let Him insult me.<br /> I shall prove to Him<br /> That I have not one,<br /> But three striking qualities:<br /> I know how to hear,<br /> I know how to bear,<br /> I know how to transfigure.<br />         Of course,<br /> It is for our mutual good.</p>
<p>If I become perfect,<br /> God will definitely be proud of me.<br /> If I become perfect,<br /> I won't have to fight<br /> Constantly against Him.</p>
