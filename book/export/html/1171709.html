SCA 1218-1225. This interview with Sri Chinmoy was conducted on 6 August 1993 at the Jharna-Kala Gallery in Soho by Ms. Tricia Curry of <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine.</p>
<h2>Interviewer: Is there one thing that has inspired you to do all these small drawings of birds?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am a Truth-seeker and God-lover. I pray and meditate. From my prayer and meditation, I receive inner messages and inner inspiration. So from deep within I get inspiration to compose songs, write poems, draw and do various other things. And this inspiration carries me. I listen to these inner dictates and try to offer what I can to the world at large, according to my capacity. I try to receive inspiration from within and, with this inspiration and aspiration, I try to be of service to mankind in various ways.</p>  </div>
