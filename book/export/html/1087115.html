<p>I was in another store. I had only four bolivars left, so I wanted to change some American dollars. The shopkeeper said he would give me 11.30 per dollar. I knew the rate was higher, so I said, "12.30, or I am not going to buy!"</p>
<p>He said he would raise it to 12, but I insisted on 12.30, and finally he agreed.You may ask, "Is it good to do that kind of thing?" But with these people it is good, because they are such rogues! I never take those shopkeepers seriously! They say "fixed price," but you have to bargain with them if you want a grain of satisfaction.</p>
