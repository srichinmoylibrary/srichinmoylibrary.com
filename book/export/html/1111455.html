<p>Around fourteen, fifteen or sixteen miles, a young man was running ahead of me. All of a sudden he turned around and asked, "Do you recognise me? Last year I was at your place."</p>
<p>Immediately I recognised him. It was the great runner Jay Helgerson, who ran a marathon every week for one year in 1979. He was on his last loop, but he stopped to chat with me. At first he didn't smile, but then he started smiling at me.</p>
