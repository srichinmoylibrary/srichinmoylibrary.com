<p>I will tell you a few anecdotes about a God-intoxicated man who was devotion incarnate, humility incarnate and surrender incarnate. His name was Durga Charan Nag, but he is known as Nag Mahashay.</p>
<p>This seeker happened to be one of the foremost disciples of Sri Ramakrishna. According to many, he was insane in every sense of the term, but according to the Truth-seekers and God-lovers, he was a radiant example of purity, simplicity, sympathy and oneness-heart.</p>  </div>
