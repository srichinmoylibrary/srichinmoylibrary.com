  <h1 class="book-heading">Admiration</h1>
  
 
<p>Admiration is not the sign of inferiority. Rather it is often a sign of the reciprocal recognition of two souls.</p>
<p>Familiarity and admiration can rarely be long-enduring friends, unless the uniqueness of the one finds an echo in the other.</p>
<p>It is easy for our admiration to win over another’s love. But often it is too difficult for our love to win over another’s admiration.</p>
<p>Can one separate our admiration from our sincerity? Decidedly not. For admiration demands a truthful selflessness.</p>
<p>Self-love must know that its annihilation will begin when admiration enters.</p>
<p>Admiration begins to show the psychic touch when it reaches out towards those eternal qualities possessed by seers, saints and sages.</p>  </div>
