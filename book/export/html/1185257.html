<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the beginning God was One, but He wanted to be many. God is like a tree. If the tree has no branches, it has no beauty. The tree looks beautiful only if it has many branches, leaves and fruit. Otherwise, if you see a tree that has only the trunk, you wonâ€™t appreciate it. God is the tree with all its branches and leaves. Again, God is also the root. The tree cannot live without the root. God is the root, and from the root the life energy goes to the rest of the tree.</p>  </div>
