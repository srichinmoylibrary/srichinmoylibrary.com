<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I have heard of them. I wish to say that God is everywhere. God is in this table. God is in the chair. God is in the wall. He is everywhere. So I believe in God the Omnipresent. As I believe in God the Omniscient, Omnipotent, so I believe in God the Omnipresent.</p>  </div>
