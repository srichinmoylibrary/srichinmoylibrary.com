<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us say, more about satisfaction, light and delight. There may be great musicians who do not believe in God, but they do believe in satisfaction, joy, delight. If you play divine music, spiritual music, then you are bound to give and get satisfaction.</p>
<p>Caller: I'd like to know how much discipline is required to master meditation.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All the discipline that one can muster in one's own life. Discipline is a continuous process. In this process we make progress. It depends on how sincerely the individual has accepted the spiritual life. If he wants to become perfect, then he has to discipline not only his body, vital and mind but also his entire life, totally. But if he wants to derive only a little satisfaction from life, a little bit of peace from life, then he does not have to go through this total self discipline. It entirely depends on how much the seeker needs from his inner life.</p>  </div>
