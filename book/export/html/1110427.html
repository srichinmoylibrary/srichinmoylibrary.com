<blockquote>
<p>"Fortunately for me I was brought up in a family where literature, music and art had become instinctive."</p>
<p>— Tagore <em>Personality</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>True, Tagore was a fond child of Fortune; but how wonderfully he developed and utilised his gifts in the creation of love and beauty is of supreme importance. He was, we can say, a golden chance. But Tagore made himself infinitely more valuable than this chance. By dint of his unique genius he has become the loveliest choice of present-day humanity.</p>  </div>
