<p>Around ten-thirty a.m. five young boys came to Amrita-da and said: "We don't want to stay in the Tyanga House anymore. We don't like it at all. We want to move to some other place."</p>
<p>Amrita-da said: 'That is a good idea but I cannot be of real help to you. Go to Nolini."</p>
<p>The five young boys came up to Nolini-da and pleaded with him to find a new place for them.</p>
<p>Nolini-da said: "I sympathise with you, but you have come to the wrong person for help. Go to Amrita. He always deals with this kind of thing. It is his domain. I can't enter into his domain so easily."</p>
<p>The five boys came up to Amrita-da and told him what Nolini-da had said. Amrita-da replied: "I told you that I could not solve your problem. I thought Nolini could. Since even Nolini finds it difficult to solve your problem, there is only one person left and that is the Mother. Tomorrow I shall speak to her and she will take care of the matter."</p>  </div>
