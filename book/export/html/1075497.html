<p>I believe in oneness.<br /> A child adds his achievements<br /> To his parents' achievements.<br /> Thus the three become one.<br /> Here I hear the song of oneness,<br /> Here I see the dance of oneness,<br /> Here I feel the reality of oneness.<br /> But for me to say<br /> A child's achievements<br /> Equal his father's achievements<br /> Or<br /> His mother's achievements<br /> Is sheer stupidity.<br /> You are on the top of the life-tree,<br /> He is in the middle of the life-tree,<br /> I am at the foot of the life-tree.<br /> How can our achievements<br /> Be equal?<br /> But we are one,<br /> Undoubtedly one,<br /> Because we have established<br /> Our inseparable oneness<br /> With the life-tree.</p>
