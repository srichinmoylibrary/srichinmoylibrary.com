<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spirituality did not arrive only through the Indian bullock cart! Spirituality came also through modern vehicles that have tremendous speed. You cannot say that only India brought spirituality. One country cannot get the full credit or glory for awakening or elevating the rest of the world. No, God gave some Light to this country and some to that country. No country can claim to be the pioneer in receiving the Light of God and offering it to the world at large.</p>  </div>
