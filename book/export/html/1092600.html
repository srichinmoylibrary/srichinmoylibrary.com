<blockquote>
<p>"You cannot teach a man anything; you can help him to find it within himself. " â€” Galileo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what Tagore says about the teacher is also quite striking: "A teacher can never truly teach unless he is still learning himself. A lamp can never light another lamp unless it continues to burn its own flame."</p>
<p>We all know that Nature teaches more than she preaches. The same thing holds good in Tagore's life. He taught us not only more but much more than he actually preached.</p>  </div>
