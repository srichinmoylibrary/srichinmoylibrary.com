<p>There was a great man whose name was Divida. Once upon a time he was nice to Balarama. But alas, it is difficult to always remain a kind, good and nice human being, and slowly he developed arrogance and tyrannous qualities. He did many, many undivine things, and people could not bear his arrogance or his tyranny.</p>
<p>The worst incident occurred when he was tempted to steal Balarama's ploughshare. He entered into Balarama's house in the middle of the night and stole the ploughshare.</p>
<p>When Balarama discovered his loss, he challenged Divida to mortal combat, in a few seconds cutting off the thief's head.</p>
<p>He told Divida's friends and others, "Never, never dare to steal my main instrument, the ploughshare. That is my life-breath. If you create any problems for me, ignorance will befriend you. I do not want ignorance to befriend you. When you allow ignorance to befriend you, eventually death comes to befriend you. So be wise. Don't try to make a fool of me and don't try to make a fool of my brother, Krishna. Do not make a fool of anyone, or eventually yours shall be the unimaginable punishment!"</p>
