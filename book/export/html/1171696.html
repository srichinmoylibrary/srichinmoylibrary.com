<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I really forgive someone, why do I have to allow what he did to return to my mind and destroy my inner joy? If I allow it, that means my forgiveness was not a lasting forgiveness; it was waiting only for the individual to make the same mistake again. So, after a few days, when that person does the same thing wrong, he will be at my mercy. Our human life is so clever in that respect.</p>
<p>Without forgetfulness, forgiveness is no forgiveness. If we forgive someone, then we have to absolutely obliterate the incident from the tablet of our heart, as though it had never existed.</p>  </div>
