<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If somebody strikes you while you are meditating, will you feel pain? Am I correct? Now, if it is the highest type of meditation, you will not feel any pain because at that time you are not in the body, but in the soul. In the body, if somebody pinches you, immediately you will feel pain because your consciousness is in the physical. But, if you are in the soul, you will not be affected. The soul is the divine part in us, the divine light, which is the representative of God. This soul cannot be disturbed, cannot be burned, cannot be destroyed. This is something in us that is immortal. So, when you are doing your best meditation, your highest meditation, you are not in the physical, you are in the soul. You become one with the soul. Here we live in ignorance. That is why somebody can come and strike you. Somebody is in darkness. That is why he is disturbing you. But, if that particular person is in the light, he will not bother you. He will not disturb you. He will never pinch you. On the contrary, when he sees that you are meditating, he will come and he will also start meditating with you because he feels that you are doing something right, something good, something divine. Naturally, he also wants to do the same thing, so that he can be a divine child.</p>  </div>
