<p><em>Madal:</em></p>
<p>Chinmoy, does God feel it as an <em>affront</em> when someone speaks ill of Him?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em></p>
<p>No, Madal, God does not feel it as an <em>insult</em> when someone speaks ill of Him. God's Mind is all concern for man. His Heart is all compassion for man. You are following the spiritual life. Just wait a few years. You yourself will not feel insulted if someone speaks ill of you.</p>  </div>
