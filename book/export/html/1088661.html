<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here you have to know that you are not trying to surrender to me. Kindly try to surrender to the Supreme in me. It is by offering gratitude daily to the Supreme that you can increase your surrender to the Supreme. This is the fastest and most effective way. Every seeker has to give to the Supreme what is best in him. Gratitude is by far the best quality that you and others have as seekers. So if you give to the Supreme your best quality, your best possession, naturally He will give you something which will expedite your journey, increase your speed towards God-realisation, towards your own self-discovery. If you give what is best in you, He will offer you something which will immediately help you to run the fastest to achieve your ultimate Goal, and that is surrender. The Supreme will increase your surrender provided you give Him your best quality, which is gratitude.</p>  </div>
