<p>In the spiritual life, the awakening of the soul is not enough. Many people are awakened to the truth, to the inner life. But after being awakened, one has to dive, one has to run, one has to fly. One has to dive into the innermost, run to the farthest, fly to the highest. Only then can the seeker's awakening blossom into the flower of realisation.</p>  </div>
