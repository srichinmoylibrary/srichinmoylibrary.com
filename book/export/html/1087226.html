<p>While I am standing on a line, if I hear the word 'credit card', I go away! Today I was so lucky! The old lady in front of me said, "Cash!"</p>
<p>While the cashier was taking care of her, the poor lady removed her glasses and put them into her glasses case. She forgot to put the case back in her purse and went away without it. I saw what had happened, so I took the glasses and tried to find her. But I am lame and cannot walk very fast, and I didn't know in which direction to go. I was praying to God that I could find her.</p>
<p>Then I saw her browsing only five or six metres away. I was a little doubtful that it was the right lady, so I asked, "Are these yours?"</p>
<p>She was so happy. She said, "I do this thing all the time. I am so grateful to you."</p>
