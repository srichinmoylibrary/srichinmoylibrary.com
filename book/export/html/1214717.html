<h2>Abdelaziz Bouteflika</h2>

<p>The past and the present can be United. The past can offer its wisdom-light to the present so the present can be a source of pride, light and delight to the future. It happens that sometimes it is necessary to break asunder the past in order to have a clear and illumining vision of the years to come. But U Thant had the unusual inner strength to do what was nearly impossible and unite the past, the present and the future.</p>
<p>Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the U.N. General Assembly in 1974, has brought to the world’s attention something unique with regard to U Thant’s unusual capacity and unprecedented achievement: “Who was better qualified than U Thant to preside over such a transformation without breaking with the past while keeping a clear vision of the future, without frustrating the great powers or driving the small ones to despair? The metamorphosis through which our Organization went at that time resulted from a gradual evolution the scope or depth of which, since it took place smoothly, was often unguessed at.”</p>  </div>
