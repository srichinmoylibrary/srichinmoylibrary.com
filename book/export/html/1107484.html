<p>"Master, forgive me. I have lost all faith in you.</p>
<p>"My child, why?"</p>
<p>"I thought you would give me much outer success."</p>
<p>"My child, I am the wrong person. Please go to some other Master."</p>
<p>"Master, forgive me. I have lost all faith in you.</p>
<p>"My child, why?"</p>
<p>"I thought you would bring much harmony, peace, joy and understanding into my family."</p>
<p>"My child, I am the wrong person. Please go to some other Master."</p>
<p>"Master, forgive me. I have lost all faith in you."</p>
<p>"My child, why?"</p>
<p>"I thought you would give me true aspiration."</p>
<p>"My child, in order to get pure and genuine aspiration, you have to sell yourself unconditionally — body, vital, mind, heart and soul — to the divine in me."</p>
<p>"Master, forgive me. I have lost all faith in you."</p>
<p>"My child, why?"</p>
<p>"Master, you have not given me realisation."</p>
<p>"My child, I am more than eager to grant you realisation. But first you have to grow into the eternally climbing flame of aspiration. And then you have to stay in my boat. If you do not jump out of the boat and enter into the sea of ignorance any more, at God's chosen Hour I shall grant you the highest realisation. And I wish to tell you that it is my ever-descending divine Compassion which expedites God's chosen Hour for you and which is the very breath of God's chosen Hour in you. Love me. Lo, the Supreme has come into your life of love. Devote yourself to me. Lo, the Supreme is offering you His choicest Blessings. Surrender yourself unconditionally to me. Lo, the Supreme is eternally yours, the eternal Servant of your unconditional love, devotion and surrender."</p>  </div>
