<p>I am a wonderful Indian soldier. Usually, after the age of fifty, God invites us to join Him in Heaven. Now I am approaching sixty-eight. Ten years ago I tried to lift up 160 pounds with both arms and I did not succeed. I could not lift the dumbbells even an inch. And I made eight attempts. At that time I was on the wrong side of fifty.</p>
<p>Today I tried the same weight and the very first attempt the dumbbells went well over four inches. Usually people achieve things in the physical world and then they descend. In my case, I have made a new record.</p>
