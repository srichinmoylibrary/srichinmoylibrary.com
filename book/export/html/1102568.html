<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no negativity in the soul. The soul is all divinity and perfection. It is our divine, immortal existence on earth and it carries the message of perfection within us. The problem is that inside our inner existence is not only the soul but also the vital; and inside the vital is a lower vital, an aggressive vital, a destructive vital. Since we are not consciously aware of the presence of the soul, whatever we feel inside our body, vital and mind we take as the soul. But this is a mistake. There are many wrong, undivine tendencies and movements within us, but these have nothing to do with the soul. These are enemies that have accidentally entered into our living room. We wanted to have only our friends, but in an unguarded moment we opened the door and our enemies entered.</p>
<p>These enemies we have to either throw out or transform through conscious and continuous effort. If we want to learn something, we have to practise or study for hours and hours. Similarly, if we want to perfect our nature, then we have to bring to the fore the soul and feel its presence at every moment. How can we do this? Through our prayer and meditation. When our prayer goes up, it reaches the highest Height. And when we meditate most soulfully, peace, light and bliss descend into us in abundant measure. When we can reach the highest Height or feel ourselves inundated with peace, light and bliss, the wrong forces within us are automatically illumined and perfected.</p>
