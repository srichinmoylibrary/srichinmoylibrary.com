<blockquote>
<p>“No amount of political freedom will satisfy the hungry mass.”</p>
<p>— Lenin <em>Speech, 1917</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dignity is the brave son of freedom and the true father of joy.</p>
<p>Tagore asks women not to try to tie down their husbands, but to allow them full freedom. The imposition of bondage is sure to recoil on them, and, at the same time, it is apt to deprive the male of his manliness.</p>
<p>In his <em>Fruit Gathering</em>, Tagore sings as regards his own freedom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let me not crave in anxious fear to be saved but hope for the patience to win my freedom.”</p>
