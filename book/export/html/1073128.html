<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, America has something special to offer to the United Nations during the Bicentennial year. America is not going to intimidate her weak, small brother and sister nations, even unconsciously. America will offer her unprecedented capacity to the community of nations and make all nations feel that her height and depth and speed and power are for them to claim as their very own, and thus create a satisfying and satisfied world-family.</p>  </div>
