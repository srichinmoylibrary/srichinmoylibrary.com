  <h1 class="book-heading">Surrender</h1>
  
 
<p>In the spiritual life when we surrender, we consciously surrender our lower life to our higher life. We surrender our lower life because we feel that our higher part is truly our very own. True surrender means the conscious acceptance by the finite of Infinity's will and vision.</p>
<p>We have to surrender only to the One in whom we have perfect faith. We shall not surrender to others' thought or will or command or demand, even if they are superior to us in terms of age or position. No! We shall surrender only to Him in whom we have perfect faith, to the Reality, to the Inner Pilot where we will get our true fulfilment.</p>  </div>
