<p><em>Madal:</em> Chinmoy, there are some spiritual Masters who constantly think of and talk about their ex-disciples. Is this not a <em>lugubrious</em> pastime for them?</p>
<p><em>Chinmoy:</em> Madal, it is true that it may <em>be sad or overly mournful</em> when the spiritual Masters talk of their ex-disciples. But one thing you do not know and perhaps will never know is that the souls of the ex-disciples cannot and do not leave the Masters so easily. That is why the sincere concern and compassion of the Masters extend to their ex-disciples.</p>  </div>
