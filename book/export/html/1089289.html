    <title>Question: Guru, I had this dream about Sri Anandamayi Ma. She gave me four pictures. The two middle ones were white. The first one was that of my former Master&#039;s own Master, and the one on the far end I could not recognise.</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good! There are many, many false teachers on earth, but Anandamayi Ma happens to be one of the absolutely sincere spiritual Masters who has really realised God. You hear of hundreds of spiritual Masters, but I wish to tell you people that you will realise God before many of them. But Anandamayi Ma is one of the very, very few who have really realised God and who can speak on God with authority.</p>
<p>I have a very close inner connection with her. Outwardly we have seen each other only once, many years ago, and then we didn't talk. We didn't have the necessity. We just stood near each other, and she looked at me and I looked at her; that's all. But in one second's glance we did many things inwardly, although outwardly we didn't have any time. Then I went home and wrote a beautiful poem about her, using the word <em>Nirmala</em> in the first line. Believe it or not, at that time I didn't even know her given name. Later I read her biography and learned much about her. On the first page I got her name, <em>Nirmala</em>.</p>
<p>To come back to your dream, the white colour means purity. <em>Nirmala</em> also means purity. Out of the four pictures, she gave you two white ones which represent purity. She gave you the highest purity, transcendental purity, and warned you about the purity of the Master and the other person you did not recognise.</p>  </div>
