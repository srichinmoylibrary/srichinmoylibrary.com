<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can be more soulful and more devoted in your work if you feel that you are working here not just to earn money, but to serve God inside the soul of the United Nations and inside the body of the United Nations. The moment you think of the United Nations, you have to feel that it is a world organisation that sincerely wants to bring about peace and harmony on earth. To work here and serve the soul of the United Nations is a great honour, a great privilege, no matter in which capacity you are working. If you think of the soul of the United Nations and of your own soul's commitment to the United Nations, your soul will work very hard in and through you. The United Nations has a very high, sublime goal. If you think of this, automatically you will become soulful and devoted because the goal itself will try to bring from the depth of your being your devoted heart qualities.</p>  </div>
