<p>When old ladies go ahead of you, you say, "O Lord, You have destroyed my pride. What else will You do?"</p>
<p>Then later, when a sixty-year-old lady starts passing you, you say, "O Lord, You have left some competitive spirit in me still."</p>
<p>I was trying to keep up with a sixty-year-old lady who was passing me, but her strides were so short that I couldn't run with her. Finally, after five hundred metres, I stopped, and she went away with her shorter than the shortest strides.</p>
