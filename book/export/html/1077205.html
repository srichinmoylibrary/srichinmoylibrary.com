<p>Who can describe Einstein the humourist better than he himself? Unparalleled he remains in his own humour-life. The scientist-humourist once wrote the following letter to his eight-year-old niece, who was sad about not being able to see him when he was in town:</p>
<p><em>“I hear from Elsa that you are dissatisfied because you did not see your Uncle Einstein. Let me therefore tell you what I look like: pale face, long hair, and a tiny beginning of a paunch. In addition, an awkward gait, and a cigar in the mouth — if he happens to have a cigar — and a pen in his pocket or his hand. But crooked legs and warts he does not have, and so he is quite handsome — also no hair on his hands such as is often found on ugly men. So it is indeed a pity that you did not see me.</em></p>
<p><em>With warm greetings from Your Uncle Einstein.”</em></p>  </div>
