    <title>Question: When we were listening to your synthesiser the other day, it seemed as though different qualities were coming out in different parts of the performance. I was wondering if you wanted to tell us anything about what was happening inwardly?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not a matter of telling; it is a matter of feeling. Somebody will feel that it is thundering. Somebody else will feel that a flute is being played. If you like a thunder-roar, you will appreciate it in that way. If you like the sweet melody of the flute, you will appreciate it in that way.</p>  </div>
