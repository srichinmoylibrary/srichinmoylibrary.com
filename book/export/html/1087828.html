<p>CHRISTOPHER: I find it very difficult to get up early in the morning.</p>
<p>TEJIYAN: I can easily tell you how you can get up quite early in the morning: just forget to turn off the television set. You don't have to go to sleep at all. In that way, the question of waking up does not arise. But don't tell Guru what I have told you; otherwise, I will be in serious trouble.</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER: I don't think you will have any more serious trouble than I will have when I do not run in the morning and Guru scolds me.</p>  </div>
