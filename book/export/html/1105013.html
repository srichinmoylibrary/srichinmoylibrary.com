<p>My Lord, please forgive me.<br /> Today I do not have any special prayer<br /> To place at Your Feet.</p>
<p>“My child, tomorrow you must pray to Me<br /> More than usual.”</p>
<p>My Lord, today I am unable to think of You.</p>
<p>“My child, tomorrow you must think of Me<br /> Much more than usual.”</p>
<p>My Lord, today I am unable to love You.</p>
<p>“My child,<br /> Tomorrow you must and must and must<br /> Love Me infinitely more<br /> Than you usually do.<br /> My child, today I am forgiving you,<br /> But you must not be negligent<br /> In your prayers.<br /> You must not be negligent<br /> In thinking of Me.<br /> You must not be negligent<br /> In loving Me.<br /> If you want to claim Me to be yours<br /> And if I want to claim you to be Mine,<br /> Then you must never, never, never<br /> Forget your morning spiritual<br /> Love-devotion-surrender-disciplines.”</p>
