<p>CHRISTOPHER: Radha, I am going to tell Guru that you are singing only one song every day, and, what is worse, it is not his song. You have composed your own song and you sing it every day at home.</p>
<p>RADHA: I am going to tell Guru that you preach the same sermon to me every day, and, what is worse, it is your own sermon and not his sermon!</p>  </div>
