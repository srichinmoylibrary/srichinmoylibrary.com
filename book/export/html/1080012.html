<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Women should not remain always under the control of men: women should stand on their own feet. Both men and women are of equal importance in God's Eye. God is both male and female. If we take man as God's Face, we have to take woman as His Smile. If we see a face without a smile, we don't appreciate the face. The smile immediately conquers our heart. But if there is no face, how can there be a smile? Each is of equal importance, but each need not play the same role. Both men and women should march together toward the same destination. Women need not lag behind. They can run soulfully, devotedly and speedily towards the same goal.</p>  </div>
