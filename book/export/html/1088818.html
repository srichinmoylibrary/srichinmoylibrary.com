<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can renew your aspiration by realising only one fact. That fact is that you are no longer the boss of your body, vital, mind, heart and soul. There is somebody else who is the boss and that is your Guru. The Supreme is your Guru. Previously you were the boss. That is why you ordered your vital to do this, your body to do this, your mind to do this. Now you have to feel that the Supreme in me is the boss. Now you have to constantly refer every important matter to the higher authority.</p>
<p>When you feel that you have to solve your problems, then you can never renew your aspiration. If you feel that it is your problem, if you feel that it is you who are suffering and you who can alone solve the problem, then you are creating more problems. But when you feel that all your problems can be solved only by me, then you are safe. A higher authority means a more illumined person. Previously you thought that you had more illumination than your physical body, so that is why you ruled your body. Now you have to feel that you do not have that capacity. When a higher reality rules you, then automatically you can aspire, because you want to grow into the higher reality. So you have only to be the servitor and not the boss. If we see that there is nobody more illumined before us or around us, then we don't aspire. We have to see that there is someone who is an inch higher than us and that our actions depend on his will. In that way we can increase and not just renew our aspiration. Renewal is not the right word. If our aspiration has been eclipsed, our inner sun can easily come out of the clouds provided it gets the sanction of a higher authority.</p>  </div>
