<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The contribution of philosophy in the process of evolution is considerable. Although philosophers cannot prove the existence of the other world, they have spoken about it. When we feel that this world is full of suffering and there is no way to reduce it, then we can find tremendous consolation in philosophy.</p>  </div>
