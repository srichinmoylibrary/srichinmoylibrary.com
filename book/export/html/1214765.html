  <h1 class="book-heading">U Thant the wisdom-bestower</h1>
  
 
<p>U Thant the wisdom-bestower is unique in presenting us with his soul’s largesse: <em>“We have already begun to realise that in modern war there is no such thing as victor and vanquished: that there is only a loser, and that loser is mankind.”</em></p>
<p>We are all aware of the undeniable fact that war results in victory and defeat. But this is a surface experience that covers our human mind and our human life. The inner experience is totally different. In the inner world, war is an immediate experience of separativity, and separativity is nothing short of tremendous loss in the world of oneness. Oneness alone can feed humanity’s eternal hunger and bring about satisfaction. Those who cherish the body-reality’s separation-consciousness are deplorable losers in the process of God’s evolution in and through mankind.</p>  </div>
