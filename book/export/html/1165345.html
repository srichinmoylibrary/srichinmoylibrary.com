<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not necessary for you to know your past incarnations. When you accepted me as your Master, you turned over a new leaf in your life. All you have to do now is to practise obedience. If I say to do this, then immediately do it â€” not tomorrow or the next day, but immediately. If you do whatever your Master tells you, then you don't have to worry about your past lives or even your former life before you became a disciple.</p>  </div>
