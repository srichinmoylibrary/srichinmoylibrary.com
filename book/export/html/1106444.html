<p>This morning, when I was lifting up my 600 pounds, I was seeing with my human eyes two souls watching: my sister Lily and R. My sister’s soul was clapping and R.’s soul was full of awe and fear because the dumbbells are so massive. On the video, you can see me looking at the door where they were stationed.</p>
