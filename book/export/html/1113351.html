<h2>Question: How may spiritual qualities such as patience and identification with Eternity be manifested in a dynamic fashion?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spiritual qualities such as patience and identification with Eternity can be manifested in a dynamic fashion provided we can see in them at least an iota of dynamism. Usually we don't think of patience as a great virtue. We take it as an unavoidable weakness. But no, patience is Eternity's strength in disguise. And usually we think of identification as a feminine aspect of reality, which cares for identification in order to make up for its limitation. But if we can think of identification as the revelation of the fulfilled aspiration for oneness, then we are bound to see in it tremendous dynamism.</p>
<p>Usually dynamism is closely connected with the masculine aspect of reality; at least that is what the human mind tells us. Therefore, be clever and think of patience and identification as something strong, powerful and challenging. Then you are bound to see and feel the dynamic aspect of reality in both patience and identification.</p>  </div>
