<p>His mind-clock tells him<br /> That he does not have to waste<br /> His precious time<br /> Waiting for God,<br /> Since God's existence is quite uncertain.</p>
<p>His heart-clock tells him<br /> To wait and watch,<br /> For God will definitely come.</p>
<p>His soul-clock tells him<br /> That God has already arrived<br /> And asks him what he is doing<br /> And why he is not taking care<br /> Of the Supreme Guest.</p>
