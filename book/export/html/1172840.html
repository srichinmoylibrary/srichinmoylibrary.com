<p>I shall always say that those who value me, I also value. Not only that, but those who value me inwardly, outwardly, lovingly and self-givingly are the ones who are my true, true, true disciples. A million times I can say “true.” It is our mutual appreciation, mutual acceptance. There are many, many, many disciples, here, there and everywhere, who do value me. They offer their hearts to our spirituality. The more we can develop our inner hunger, the more we will be able to receive from Above.</p>
<p>Allow me to say one thing more. Many, many disciples came recently to Italy and France when I went there. They also come regularly to New York, twice a year, in April and August. Some of them come even four or five times a year. As soon as they have the necessary means, they come. And the same people came to see me in Italy and France. If this is not their spiritual hunger, what else is it?</p>
