<p>When Mumtaz Mahal died in 1631 while giving birth to her fourteenth child, Shah Jahan was overwhelmed with grief. In order to pay homage to his beloved wife, he began the construction of a magnificent tomb made of white marble. It was built at Agra, on the banks of the Yamuna River. This 'Tomb of Light' is now known as the Taj Mahal and it is one of the wonders of the world.</p>
<p>Tagore has written about the Taj Mahal, "Only let this one teardrop, the Taj Mahal, glisten spotlessly bright on the cheek of time for ever and ever. O King! You sought to charm time with the magic of beauty and weave a garland that would bind formless death with deathless form!"</p>  </div>
