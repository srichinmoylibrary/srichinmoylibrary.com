<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I fully agree. The world-disciple must needs help bring the nations' souls to the fore. When the soul comes to the fore with its inner effulgence, divine effulgence, then it is only a matter of time before the mind, vital and body accept it. The aspiring heart immediately accepts it, but the other members may take some time. But we have to come without from within. We sow the seed underground and then it germinates. It becomes a sapling, a plant and finally a giant banyan tree. So from within the reality must come forward, and it is the soul that embodies the reality and the divinity within.</p>  </div>
