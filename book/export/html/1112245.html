<p>This morning, I went out to run. As I was leaving the hotel, Adhirathaâ€™s soul came to me. Then just as I turned the corner, I immediately saw him standing there, looking at his watch. He was all ready to start running. He did not see me.</p>
<p>For some reason I changed my mind and went back into the hotel. Adhiratha also changed his mind and went back into the hotel. When he entered the lobby, at that time he saw me.</p>
