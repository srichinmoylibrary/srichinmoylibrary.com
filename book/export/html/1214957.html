<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The inner road is the road of sincere dedication to the highest cause. In the outer world one can aim at a particular goal without having sincere dedication to the goal. But the inner road represents the attitude of the seeker. The seeker tries in every way to lead a more illumining and more fulfilling life, to find and follow the way that is right from the highest point of view.</p>
<p><em>UPI:</em> Do you envision the day when your goals will be achieved?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the outer world it is a very, very slow process. In the course of time, definitely we will reach the Destined Goal. No sincere cry will meet with frustration, disappointment or failure. If we have a sincere cry, the day is bound to dawn when our sincere cry will meet with satisfaction, supreme satisfaction, which is illumination within and without.</p>
<p><em>UPI:</em> But you don't ever see the day when your work will be done, do you?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, my work is not like that. It is a slow and steady process. We have to sow the seed, which has to germinate, then become a sapling and gradually become a huge banyan tree. We are now in the process of consciously becoming that which we always were in the inner world. But this process of growth is an ever-transcending process. We can grow eternally. We need never stop.</p>
<p><em>UPI:</em> Where are you now? Have you dropped the seed? Do we have a seedling?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is a most inspiring, encouraging question. I have been asked thousands and thousands of questions all over the world, but this last question of yours so far nobody has asked me, not even my disciples. We have sown the seed. Now we have a tiny plant. This tiny plant will grow and become a strong tree. If storms of doubt and hurricanes of jealousy and other undivine forces enter, then naturally the progress can be very slow. But if there is implicit faith and devoted oneness, then the plant will very soon grow into a tree. Now we are in the plant stage; we have sown the seed, and it is no longer a seedling. It has germinated properly. Previously it was only a seedling, but now it has become a tiny but healthy plant. So there is every hope that it will weather all the buffets and blows of human doubts and weaknesses and grow into a huge tree.</p>
<p><em>UPI:</em> Thank you very much.</p>  </div>
