<p>My Lord, my Lord, my Lord, what is more important: what I do for You or what I am to You?</p>
<p>"My child, My child, My child, what you are to Me is infinitely more important than what you do for Me. In spite of being a most deplorable seeker, all of a sudden if you do something great for Me, that achievement of yours will not satisfy Me.</p>
<p>"Be close to Me, be close to Me on the strength of your sincere aspiration-heart and sincere dedication-life. Your closeness is infinitely more important than your great performances if they do not have a spiritual foundation."</p>

<p>â€” 27 December 1987</p>  </div>
