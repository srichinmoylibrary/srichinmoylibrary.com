<p>The other day I went shopping and I bought a few things. At one store I asked a saleslady for a shopping bag. She said I had to pay twenty cents extra.</p>
<p>I asked, "Are you Hawaiian or Japanese?"</p>
<p>She said, "I am Japanese, and I am sorry I asked you for twenty cents extra."She gave me the bag and wouldn't take the twenty cents from me. Afterwards, I got a few more things. As I was going out, she followed me and said very fast, "I am sorry."</p>
