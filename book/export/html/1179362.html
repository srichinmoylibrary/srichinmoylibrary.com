<p>There are those who blame their Master<br /> For not giving enough importance<br /> To meditation.<br /> But who are the ones who really meditate?<br /> Those who really need God<br /> And God alone,<br /> Those who see the Supreme in their Master<br /> As their only Guru,<br /> Are the ones who sleeplessly,<br /> Soulfully and breathlessly meditate.</p>
