<p>I am happy because I always choose the right moment.</p>
<p>I am happy because I am a good listener.</p>
<p>I am happy because I keep my voice down.</p>
<p>I am happy because I do not try to convince others.</p>
<p>I am happy because I do not complain.</p>
<p>I am happy because I do not do two things at the same time.</p>
<p>I am happy because I never think of two objects at the same time.</p>
<p>I am happy because I have realised the truth that the most important thing in my life is self-improvement.</p>
<p>I am happy because I unreservedly accentuate the good in others.</p>
<p>I am happy because I have considerably cut down on my desiring needs.</p>
<p>I am happy because I follow my thought-control programme every day.</p>
<p>I am happy because I never quit.</p>
<p>I am happy because every day I purify my heart by offering my heart of gratitude to the Absolute Supreme.</p>
<p>I am happy because I know that my love of purity works wonders.</p>
<p>I am happy because of a soulful daily prayer of mine, and that prayer is:</p>

<p>O Beloved Supreme,<br /> O Eternity’s Pilot Supreme,<br /> Do transform the world<br /> Starting with me, my life, my all.</p>

<p>I am happy because every day I cry and cry to see the Real in me. The Real in me is my oneness divine, unreserved and unconditional, with the Will of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>I am happy not because I am for my Supreme Pilot, not because my Supreme Pilot is for me, but because my Supreme Pilot eternally is. His very existence here on earth, there in Heaven, is my satisfaction. When I try to have Him for myself, I pull Him into my desire-life. But when I am for Him, I carry my desire-life into Him. In no way do I want to bind my Beloved Supreme. From now on my satisfaction, my supreme satisfaction, will lie only in my discovery of the fact that He alone eternally is.</p>
