<p>I was at a fruit stand on 147th Street, beyond Jamaica Avenue. The Japanese girl there said to me "Hi! I have not seen you for a long time."</p>
<p>I said, "I have also not seen you for a long time."</p>
<p>Then I got seven or eight items. I came to her and she added it up on the cash register. It came to $13. I said, "It is wrong. Are you sure?"</p>
<p>She said, "Do you think I am overcharging you'"</p>
<p>I said, "No, it seems to me that you have not charged me for all the items."</p>
<p>Then she took the receipt out of the cash register and checked each item to show me that it was all right. I was wrong.</p>
<p>Then she said, "You are such a nice man!"</p>
