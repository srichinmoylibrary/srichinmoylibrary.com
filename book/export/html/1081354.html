<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When one sees beauty in everything, it is an aspiring consciousness, evolving consciousness, illumining consciousness, fulfilling consciousness, divine consciousness. It means that one has come out of the gross physical consciousness. Actually, reality is nothing but beauty in oneness, beauty of oneness and beauty for oneness. When one has that kind of experience, it means that one has transcended the boundaries of the physical, which is limited right now, and entered into a higher reality. When the boundaries of the physical have been transcended, only then does one have the experience of beauty in everything.</p>  </div>
