<p>A true disciple is he who cares for his Master's Grace. A true disciple is he who feels that his Master's physical existence and God's constant flow of Grace are inseparable. A true disciple is he who has realised that without his Master's Grace, he is nothing, he can do nothing. A true disciple is he who has realised that with his Master's Grace he can become not only the perfect ideal of humanity but also the greatest Pride of God.</p>  </div>
