<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Always say, "Whatever God does is for my good. If He wants to give me a smart slap, it is for my good. If He wants to smile at me or caress me, it is all for my good. If He wants to bless me, it is for my good. If He wants to kick me, it is for my good." When God uses His Justice-Light, we have to say that it is for our good. We have to say, "I have done wrong for such a long time. Now He has destroyed my wrongdoings, my weaknesses, in the twinkling of an eye." God waits and waits for us to change. Finally, when He uses His Justice, it is a matter of a few seconds. But how many people are ready to say that it is for our good that He has done it? We say, "God is cruel. Why could He not give me another chance? If He had given me only one more chance, I would have stopped doing the wrong thing." We feel that we deserve one more chance, but we do not count how many times God has given us chances.</p>  </div>
