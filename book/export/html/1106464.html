<p>From 13Â½ inch biceps at long last I have come to 15 inches. I hope you people can see it.</p>
<p>I may not have giant muscles, but I do have greed. Today I did more than 100 repetitions with 400 pounds alternating my right and left arms. I am doing them so fast. It is like a jackhammer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since I came back from India a few days ago, my tiredness is killing me. A long journey definitely weakens the muscles.</p>
