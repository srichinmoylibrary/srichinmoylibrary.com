<p>Man says to God: "O God, you have created the world. But at any moment the world may collapse. So I want to save the world. You are the Creator and I am the Saviour."</p>
<p>God says: "Wonderful, my child, it is simply wonderful. You save the world."</p>
<p>Lo, in a twinkling, the world devours man and his foolish pride. Poor God, He has now to save the self-styled Saviour. The world says to God: "Father, you are my Creator, you are my Protector, and you are my Transformer. I need no human help. Nor, I pray, impose human help upon me." God smilingly says: "There is no such thing as human help. It is only the darkest futility of human stupidity."</p>  </div>
