<p>FIRST FATHER: “How do you express your love to your son?”</p>
<p>SECOND FATHER: “Easy! I just give him a dollar every morning and ask him every night if he has saved 90 cents out of this dollar. Right from the beginning, I want my son to be economical. How do you show your affection to your son?”</p>
<p>FIRST FATHER: “I express my love to my son by giving him advice as to how he can live all his life without caring for money.”</p>  </div>
