<p><em>(The sage is studying the Vedas, the Upanishads and the other scriptures. Evening has set in. Upamanyu comes back.)</em></p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: So you have brought all the cows back?</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: Yes, Father.</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: What have you eaten, my son, for breakfast and lunch? Have you had a decent meal?</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: Oh, while the cows were grazing, I went out for some time and begged a little food from door to door. That is what I ate, Father.</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: Unthinkable! You didn’t have my permission! You didn’t ask me whether you could go out to beg food from others while the cows were grazing. You must not do that. That is not right.</p>
<p>UPAMANYU <em>(with folded hands)</em>: Yes, Master. Forgive me, I shall not do it anymore.</p>  </div>
