<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some souls did not want to take any more incarnations; they did not want to make progress on the earth-planet. So they entered into the soul's world and remained there. Again, some souls wanted to be part of God's manifested creation. They wanted to make progress on the earth-planet, so they entered into the process of evolution and started taking birth in different forms as animals and human beings.</p>  </div>
