  <h1 class="book-heading">Love: sacrifice</h1>
  
 
<p>Fulfilment is nothing but voluntary sacrifice.</p>
<p>Where your sacrifice is, there will as well be your delight.</p>
<p>Sacrifice is fulfilment attained. Surrender is delight obtained. Love is union organised.</p>
<p>How beautiful is the union of two self-dedicated souls, but how hard and how long is the road to that goal!</p>
<p>Love is precious. Surrender is, more precious. Union is still more precious.</p>
<p>Self-giving alone has free access to Joy everlasting.</p>
<p>It has been delightfully claimed that: "Love in France is a comedy; in England a tragedy; in Italy an opera seria; and in Germany a melodrama."</p>
<p>In the true Indian tradition love has always been a self-offering and a self-fulfilment.</p>
