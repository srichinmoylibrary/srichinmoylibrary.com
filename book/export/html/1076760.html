<h2>Question: Is it correct to think of love, forgiveness and wisdom while one pronounces the name of the Supreme?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. Do not think of anything at all. When you invoke the Supreme, do not keep anything in your mind. Try only to feel that your whole existence is inside your soul. If, from the soul, love comes, wisdom comes or forgiveness comes while you are chanting, well and good. But mentally do not formulate any thought or concept regarding the Supreme. The divine aspects of love, forgiveness and wisdom are wonderfully inspiring. But while you are chanting or invoking the Supreme, please do not try to formulate with your mind any of these divine attributes.</p>
<p>Let the Supreme work through your soul and bring to the fore the divine qualities that He wants to reveal or manifest in your outer life. This will be the best attitude. Let Him work in and through your soul.</p>  </div>
