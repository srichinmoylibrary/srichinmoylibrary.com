<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As I said before, I do not believe in meditating in the mountain caves or in the depths of the forest. Our philosophy and way of meditation is to accept the world as it is. We try to become better and inspire others to make their lives better. Some say that meditation is meant only for the select few. But I say that meditation is for everybody, for we are all God’s children. Just because we value the outer life, we feel that prayer and meditation can be practised amidst our day-to-day activities — not only in a church or a temple or some other sacred place.</p>  </div>
