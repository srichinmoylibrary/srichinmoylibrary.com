<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can achieve constant progress in our day-to-day life only when we dare to say that the Supreme is ours. God-realisation is our birthright. Each aspiring soul must feel the Supreme as his very own. Then alone can he make infinite progress in his life here on earth.</p>
<p>How is it that we cannot make satisfactory progress? We cannot make satisfactory progress primarily because of our doubt. When we see our future, doubt tells us that we can never be so good, so devoted, so self-giving to the Supreme. When we look backwards, doubt immediately tells us that once upon a time we were not so bad; we were not so hostile or undivine as we think. Doubt will never tell us the truth about where we stand or what we stand for. When we spontaneously, consciously, deliberately and soulfully cast aside doubt from our existence, God-realisation becomes easy.</p>
<p>And how can we cast aside this doubt, this slow poison from our existence? We can do so only on the strength of our constant aspiration, flowing determination, total self-giving and love, devotion and surrender. I wish all of you to know the actual significance of these soulful, divinely intoxicating words: love, devotion and surrender.</p>  </div>
