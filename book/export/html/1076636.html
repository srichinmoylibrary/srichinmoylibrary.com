<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why must there be a God? Why must there be yourself? Why must there be a human being like you? If somebody says, “Why must there be a God?” then I immediately say, “Why must there be you on earth?” We know that there is something called the source. We must know that there are parents on earth. That is why we have come into existence. We must know that there is a seed and the seed germinates into a plant and the plant grows into a huge banyan tree. So there is always a source. We see that from something, something else comes. So we came into existence similarly from God. Our Source is God the light, God the Delight and God the Perfection. There is a God. For me the question “Why must there be a God?” has no meaning. When you have known God and spoken to God, this question sounds entirely foolish. Only someone who has not seen you personally can ask, “Why must there be a boy like that?” Similarly, before one has felt the presence of God, he can ask this question.</p>  </div>
