<p>I have been asking the boys to find me a two mile course to run — flat, without sidewalks and side streets and no more than ten minutes away by car. Nobody has been successful; perhaps nobody ever will be successful. Vinaya last week told me he had found place. I believed him, and he took me there. God! It was a useless road! He wasted my time, but I forgave him.</p>
<p>Then, three days ago, he said he had found Heaven on earth. Those were his words. I said, "To find Heaven on earth is really something!"</p>
<p>So I went to see his Heaven. It was Heaven, according to Vinaya — our old course at my seven mile mark. His course was full of small pebbles and stones, and it was not even clean. It was very bad, very bad! The other day Lorne look me to a place that he said was extremely beautiful. He said that Kanan was the witness, that Kanan had taken him there. So I went to see the place. O God! It was almost like a highway, with a tiny path for cyclists on the side. Thousands of cars were going by very fast. So how could I run? That was Lorne's place. Like that, many people tempt me to go and see their discoveries, but their discoveries always frustrate me.</p>
