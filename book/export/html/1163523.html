<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can sustain purity if we can consciously feel that there is a rose inside our heart blossoming petal by petal. Always we have to see the living image of a flower, let us say a rose or a lotus. The moment we see a flower, consciously or unconsciously we breathe in the purity of that flower. If we feel that a rose is blossoming petal by petal from within, then naturally the fragrance and purity of the rose will permeate our whole inner and outer existence. Or, if we wish, we can try to see a candle flame within our heart. The candle flame is constantly climbing up high, higher, highest. While it is climbing, it is illumining our ignorant, obscure, impure and undivine existence. So in this way we can sustain our purity and have abiding satisfaction in our life.</p>  </div>
