<p>While I was taking pictures at the L'eggs Mini-Marathon, a man came up to me and wanted me to help him put film in his camera. He was giving me his camera and the roll of film.</p>
<p>O God! I know next to nothing about cameras! Even my own camera, I ask one of my students to load for me. So I said to the man, "I am the wrong person!"</p>
<p>He said, "Thank you!"</p>
