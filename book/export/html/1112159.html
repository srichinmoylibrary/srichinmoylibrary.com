<p>I was running on Queens Boulevard at five in the morning. After a mile and a half, I saw a young Chinese couple who were very drunk. The poor husband was trying to hold up his wife, but she was fat and he was thin. With such difficulty he was holding her up!</p>
<p>At that hour, at five o'clock in the morning, old people sit at the bus stop reading the newspaper!</p>
