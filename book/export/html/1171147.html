    <title>Question: I am familiar a little bit with Sri Aurobindo’s notion that there is a descent of a new consciousness in the world, a new level of awareness. Would this be similar to intuition?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are levels of the mind: higher mind, upper mind, divine mind and so on. Then comes the Supermind. After the Supermind there is another level which is called <em>sat-chit-ananda</em> (Existence-Consciousness-Bliss). But the Supermind itself is far beyond the ordinary mind. It is not in the mind proper.</p>
<p>Intuition is something totally different. Intuition comes from the third eye, the vision-eye. The level of the Supermind is infinitely higher than the plane of intuitive consciousness which you call intuition.</p>  </div>
