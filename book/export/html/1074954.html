<p>        In my case,<br /> My forgiveness is kind to me.<br />        In my case,<br /> My ignorance is kind to me.<br />        In my case,<br /> My Lord is kind to me.</p>
<p>My forgiveness lovingly says:<br /> "I will give you infinite chances<br /> To perfect your life."</p>
<p>My ignorance cheerfully says:<br /> "Don't be in a hurry.<br /> I have spoken to the Mother, Eternal Time, about you.<br /> She will wait for you indefinitely;<br /> So, you can take your own time."</p>
<p>My Lord compassionately says:<br /> "Son, you are a sick man,<br /> You are a weak soldier,<br /> You are a poor seeker.<br />        Therefore<br /> It is my duty supreme<br /> To do everything within you,<br /> Everything for you."</p>
