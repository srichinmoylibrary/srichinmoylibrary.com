<p>You wanted name.<br /> God has given it to you.</p>
<p>You wanted fame.<br /> God has given it to you.</p>
<p>God wanted you<br /> To give Him a smile.<br /> Still you have not played your role.<br /> God will bless you<br /> Since I cannot.</p>
<p>God wanted you<br /> To serve Him in humanity.<br /> Still you have not played your role.<br /> God will love you<br /> Since I cannot.</p>
