<p>When I was walking near my house, two little kids saw me. One of them said, "This is the man!" He meant that I was the one who lived in this house.</p>
<p>The other one said, "No!" So they were having an argument.</p>
<p>Then I said, "Good morning, good morning," and smiled. I made them feel that I was the person who lived here.</p>
