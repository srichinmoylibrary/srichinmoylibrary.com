<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Never! We never reject matter, because if we reject matter, then where are we going to establish the Kingdom of Heaven? Heaven is a state of consciousness and the Kingdom of Heaven must be established here on earth, not somewhere else.</p>
<p>We never reject anything. We accept it and then finally we transform it. In matter, spirit is hidden; but the aspiration of matter we are unable to feel or see right now. When we practise the spiritual life, we enter into matter and see that matter is spirit which has been asleep for some time. When we energise matter with our conscious aspiration, immediately matter becomes fully vibrant with energy. Here on earth the material life and the spiritual life must go together. Through meditation one can unite matter and spirit.</p>  </div>
