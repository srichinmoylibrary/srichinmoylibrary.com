<p>My Lord, may I say something to You?<br /> “Yes, My child, yes.”<br /> My Lord, I want to be near You.</p>
<p>“No, My child, I want you to say:<br /> ‘My Lord, I want to touch You.’<br /> No, My child, I want you to say:<br /> ‘My Lord, I want to catch You.’<br /> No, My child, I want you to say:<br /> ‘My Lord, I want to embrace You.’<br /> No, My child, I want you to say:<br /> ‘My Lord, I want to fulfil You.’<br /> No, My child, I want you to say:<br /> ‘My Lord, I want to surrender<br /> My earth-existence to You.’<br /> My child, then do it!”</p>
<p>My Lord, I am doing it.</p>
<p>“Heaven, look, look! Earth, look, look!<br /> My child has made his unconditional<br /> And complete surrender to Me.<br /> My child, you have now become<br /> The Heart of My Life<br /> And the Breath of My Soul.”</p>
