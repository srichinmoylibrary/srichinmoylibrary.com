<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We create H-bombs with our ignorance and with the limited freedom that God has given to us. God does not create everything for us; we have received a little freedom from Him. He has given us the freedom to come here and meditate, or to stay home and sleep. But we are using our freedom for a divine purpose, to meditate.</p>
<p>Right now we are not inseparably one with God’s Will. We usually do not know what God’s Will is and, on the very rare occasions when we do know, we may still not act according to His Will. This is what has happened with the H-bomb.</p>  </div>
