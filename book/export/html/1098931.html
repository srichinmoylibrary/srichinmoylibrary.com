<p>Luckily my fate changed and quite a few people came to my second talk in Minneapolis. On the third evening I gave another talk which was attended by many college students. A lawyer who was in the audience was so moved. He said he had a church and he wanted to give it to me in my name so that we could inaugurate it as a centre. He even told me the name of the church.</p>
<p>The following day, Ida contacted the authorities of that particular church and they informed her that this lawyer was not even a member of the congregation. He had no connection with their church.</p>
<p>So that is the story of the lawyer who became so devoted that he wanted to give me a church!</p>  </div>
