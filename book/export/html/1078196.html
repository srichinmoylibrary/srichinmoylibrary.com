<p>Why does he love his enemies?<br /> Because<br /> They help him unconsciously<br /> In his heart-expansion.</p>
<p>Why does he love his friends?<br /> Because<br /> They help him consciously<br /> In his life-satisfaction.</p>
<p>Why does he love God?<br /> Because<br /> God helps him unconditionally<br /> In his God-realisation.</p>
