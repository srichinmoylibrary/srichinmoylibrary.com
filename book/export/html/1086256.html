<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have a friend who knows how to meditate, and if you meditate with him, even unconsciously you may receive inspiration from him. Then, automatically the power of meditation will increase in you and your ignorance will decrease. You will learn many things from your spiritual friends; you will be able to have a new perspective on life.</p>  </div>
