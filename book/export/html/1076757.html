    <title>Question: Now once I have entered into this ocean of Bliss and I come back down to my normal self, would I be normal in the sense that I was the same as before I went into this ocean, or would I be radically different?</title>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly you will be different. There will be a radical difference from your old consciousness. You will be a totally different man. And your intimate ones, your wife and daughter, will see a great change in your movements, your conduct, your attitudes.</p>
<p>I attained my highest experience at the age of thirteen. I became conscious of what I was. Then again I had to toil. At the age of thirteen, I knew what I was and what realisation I had achieved and all that. But again for years I had to struggle to make it permanent. To know something and to make it permanent in oneâ€™s life are two different things. It takes time.</p>  </div>
