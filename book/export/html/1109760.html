<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible that what you are reading in the newspapers is correct. There is no shadow of a doubt that spiritual healing is possible. In God's creation everything is possible. God, being omnipotent, can do anything that He wants to do in and through us. If a healer cures someone with a good motive, we can call it compassion. But if he does it only to show off his capacity, then that is not good. We have to know whether healers are doing the right thing by curing someone. Somebody may have this healing capacity, but he may be using it against God's Will. There are many occultists who use their occult power against God's Will. If it is God's Will that someone should be cured by this healer or that healer, then the healer is one with God's cosmic Plan. But God may feel that a particular human being who has done many things wrong has to go through some painful experiences so that he does not make the same mistakes over and over again. The things that he has done wrong must bear some undivine fruit. If we do something good, then naturally the fruits will be divine. But if we do something wrong and if we do not meet with the necessary experience of punishment, then we will never learn.</p>
<p>So we have to know whether or not it is God's Will that a person be cured. If it is God's Will, then somebody who is suffering certainly should be cured. But if it is not God's Will that the person be cured at that particular moment, then what actually happens is that after the patient is cured he will make the same mistake again, and when he does it for the second time, perhaps his suffering will be worse.</p>  </div>
