<p>The Concorde is quite small. The windows are very small and there are only two seats in each row. A middle-aged man was sitting beside me. As soon as he sat down, he said, "I hope you do not mind if I put my legs a little bit on your side." Throughout the trip he was sitting with his foot on his knee, and his leg bent towards my seat. Then he turned on the light and went to sleep with his hands over his eyes. He turned on the light, and then he wouldn't open his eyes! He wouldn't eat anything. After an hour I turned out the light. All of a sudden he woke up and said, "Where did I lose my ballpoint?"</p>
<p>Everywhere there are ballpoint problems! He was telling the stewardess that he had a silver pen. The stewardess was begging the person behind him to look for it. Then they found that it had rolled two seats behind. So the man got back his pen and he was very happy.</p>
<p>When we were about to get out of the plane, the man started looking for his passport. He couldn't find it, so he said, "That is interesting." He was banging everything around, searching here and there. Everybody was standing up in the aisle, waiting for him to find his passport. He was blocking everybody.</p>
