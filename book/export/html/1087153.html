<p>At a bookstore in Hawaii, I wanted to buy so many books, including one of my own. The owner touched the register and said, "You please tell me what I should do. If I take money from you for your own book, I will be able to buy two more of your books. But if you don't pay me, I will not be able to buy those books."I said, "Yes, I am ready to pay!"</p>
<p>Then he told me that I have a very big heart.</p>
<p>I bought $70 or $80 worth of books, and he had to tell me that only if I paid for my book would he be able to buy two more of my books!</p>
