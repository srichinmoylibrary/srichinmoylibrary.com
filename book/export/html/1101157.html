<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For the most haunting voice, for a soft, delicate, sweet quality in the voice, you have to open the throat chakra.</p>
<p>In some cases it does not come from the throat chakra. There are some world-famous singers who will get zero in the spiritual world because their singing comes from the navel chakra. The vital also can have a very subtle, delicate feeling, but the capacity of the vital is limited. It may last for 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, but at the end of the life of that particular singer, it will end.</p>
<p>But if somebody can bring the very subtle, delicate, sweet, soulful quality from the throat chakra, then it lasts forever. Not only that, it helps to raise the consciousness of mankind. Many famous singers touch the vital of others, but they are never going to raise the consciousness of any human being, not to speak of their own consciousness. Millions of people may appreciate these singers, but they are appreciating their songs from the vital plane. Because the vital and the heart are very close to each other, sometimes we feel that the heart is also getting joy when the vital is excited. No, the heart is not getting anything. But if the music comes from the throat chakra, the body, vital, mind, heart and soul will all benefit.</p>
<p>There is also another way to make your voice sweeter. While singing, try to think of your heart. As soon as you start singing the first line, try to feel that something is coming out from your heart into the song. Try to sing each line from the heart. Or while you are singing, feel that not only the melody but the words are coming through your nostrils. While you are singing, you are opening your mouth, but each and every word is passing through your nostrils because the life-breath is going out from there. Where the life-breath is coming in and going out there is tremendous sweetness.</p>  </div>
