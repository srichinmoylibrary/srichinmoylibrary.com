<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I ask God, "God, where are You in suffering?" God will immediately answer, "My son, I didn't create suffering. Why do you want Me to be in your suffering? I am not responsible for your suffering. It is you who have created suffering for yourself, it is your ignorance that has created it. Again, I wish to say that I am ready to be in your suffering provided you do not create suffering again and again for yourself."</p>  </div>
