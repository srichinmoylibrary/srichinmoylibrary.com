<p>In one house on 150th Street there are two ladies who are dead against us. They are very rude. Recently, I was trying to help one of them who was having difficulty getting her car out of her driveway because there were too many cars going by. Finally, I signalled to her that she could go. Sometimes when we help people, our help is accepted. But she ignored me completely.</p>
