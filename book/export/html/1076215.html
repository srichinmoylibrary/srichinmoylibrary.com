<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a deplorable mistake when we take God as only a male figure. The Eternal Supreme is everything. God is not bound by our ideas of masculine and feminine. No. He transcends everything. He transcends all our human concepts. That is why He is God. If we feel that God is masculine and not feminine, then we have to know that it is our mind that is convincing us to believe in this idea. God is both masculine and feminine and also He is beyond masculine and feminine. The Father-aspect of God shows wisdom; the Mother-aspect shows Compassion. But God the Mother and God the Father are the same person. This moment He becomes God the Father, the next moment He becomes God the Mother. At this moment, when He shows Compassion, we call Him Mother. Then, the next moment, when He shows Wisdom-Height, we call Him Father. Again, Wisdom itself is Compassion and Compassion itself is Wisdom. They go together. Especially in the West, people use the term “Father". “Our Father Who art in Heaven” and “I and my Father are one.” In India, we do not have that kind of conception. The Brahman is neither masculine nor feminine; it is neuter. God can be seen as an infinite expanse of Energy, Light and Bliss. That is the impersonal aspect. And again, God can be seen in the form of a most luminous being.</p>  </div>
