<p>In the midst of Subhas Chandra's hectic round of activities,<br /> He did meet with Tagore.<br /> Alas, nobody knew that would be his last,<br /> Very last, heart-to-heart conversation with Tagore.<br /> Once Tagore discovered that Subhas Chandra's<br /> Soul-heart-mind-vital-body<br /> Had become a perfect sacrifice for Mother India,<br /> Tagore declared Subhas Chandra's service<br /> To Mother India indispensable<br /> And proudly claimed him<br /> As the Supreme Pilot of the Bengal-Life-Boat<br /> And the pinnacle-Mother-India-patriot.</p>
