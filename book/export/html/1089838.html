<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Since we cannot slaughter the soul or destroy the soul in any way, it is the same kind of soul. Through evolution a soul may go through a specific experience, but this does not mean that it is a different type of soul. Who knows, perhaps when we were in the animal kingdom, we were also slaughtered, if we were lambs or goats or cows. But now our souls have passed through so many incarnations. A certain kind of death does not require a certain kind of soul. It is just an experience. While walking from one place to another we can walk along a road that is very beautiful, or along another road that is desolate, but the destination is the same.</p>  </div>
