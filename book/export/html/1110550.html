<p>In our Indian philosophy, we have a particular goddess named Saraswati. Saraswati is the goddess of learning, the goddess of art and the goddess of inspiration. In the West, you use the term ‘muse’. As we have a human world, where we get all earthly things, even so, there is a world of inspiration. If we go deep within, we can enter into that world and find that poems are already written there. If you want to write an article, you can enter into the world of inspiration and actually see that the article is already written. Then all you have to do is copy it down in your notebook. The lines are written there on the wall, you can say — on the inspiration-wall. You just copy them down, and they become your possession. Our greatest poet, Tagore, did this. He entered into the world of inspiration, and from there he got many poems. There is a world of poetry, a world of prose, a world for all literature that exists.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
