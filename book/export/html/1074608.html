<p>To see the face of joy<br /> He went along with the world.<br /> No joy.</p>
<p>To see the face of joy<br /> He adapted himself to wishes of others.<br /> No joy.</p>
<p>To see the face of joy<br /> He allowed others to outtalk him.<br /> No joy.</p>
<p>To see the face of joy<br /> He fasted for two long weeks.<br /> No joy.</p>
<p>To see the face of joy<br /> He denied himself even an iota of human love.<br /> No joy.</p>
<p>To see the face of joy<br /> He entered into the zone of silence.<br /> No joy.</p>
<p>Finally a little bird whispered:<br /> "Joy on earth no longer is.<br /> Prepare yourself for the world Beyond<br /> Where joy is married to Eternity's Life."</p>
