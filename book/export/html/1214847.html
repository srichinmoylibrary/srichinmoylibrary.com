<p>I see a few new seekers today. I wish to tell all the new seekers that your presence definitely adds to our aspiration.</p>
<p>We are the most fortunate people on earth, for God has chosen us to be His instruments to serve Him in mankind. Please try to feel that the United Nations is not a mere building, but a place of worship, a place where all human beings can worship and pray to God. This place is a living shrine for the Supreme.</p>
<p>If we do not do what we are expected to do now, if we do not offer our soulful meditation and soulful dedication now, in days to come we shall feel sorry. But if we do the right thing now, in the near or distant future the Supreme will entrust us with higher tasks. Each time we do something for Him, He is pleased with us and He gives us the responsibility to do something higher and more fulfilling in His cosmic Game.</p>
<p>God is pleased with us if we try every day, every hour of our inner and outer existence at the United Nations to be soulful and self-giving. If we are soulful and self-giving, then our Goal can never remain a far cry. On the contrary, instead of seeing ourselves running alone toward the Goal, we shall see that our Goal is also running toward us.</p>
<p>Run always very fast. In the month of March let us try to run the fastest toward our destined Goal.</p>
