<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is something called mental music, something called vital music and something called physical music. But again, there is something called psychic music. If one wants to get true delight from the heart and from the aspiring life, then he must dedicate his music to God. He must play soulful, psychic music — music that will inspire his own life of aspiration and inspire others who hear his music — not music that will excite the vital and arouse the physical consciousness.</p>  </div>
