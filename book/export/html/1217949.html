<p><em>Question:</em> Yes, I would like to ask the Master what is the difference between Experience and Realization in the spiritual life?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The difference between Experience and Realization in the spiritual life is this: a realized person can say, "I and my Father are one; I and God are one"; whereas an aspirant having many spiritual experiences, or even one, can say and feel that he is slowly but inevitably growing into the realization of God.</p>
<p>Experience shows and tells us what we will eventually become, the possessor of God-Consciousness. But in realization, we come to know what we truly are: absolute oneness with God forever and through Eternity. This is the difference between Experience and Realization.</p>  </div>
