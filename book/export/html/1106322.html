<p>Peter Hensel told us a story that one time he was supposed to be in a weightlifting competition the following day. That night, in a dream, he saw a kind of light and he felt that the weight was very light. Then the following day he had the competition and with no difficulty he lifted up the heavy weight. So that was his inner experience.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are some of the happy and fulfilling experiences from our trip to Switzerland and Germany.</p>
