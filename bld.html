Was Arjuna's oneness with Sri Krishna such that if a balloon was blue and Sri Krishna said, &quot;No, it is green,&quot; Arjuna's physical eyes literally saw it as green? He was not just agreeing; he was not just saying, &quot;Yes, you are right.&quot; He literally would see it as a different colour. Was that the kind of oneness he had?</a></li>
