 <p></p>
<h2>God the Supreme Musician</h2>

<p>God the Musician knows that music is spirituality, music is Immortality. Man the musician thinks that music is sensuality, music is mortality.</p>
<p>God the Musician knows that His Music is His transcendental Self-communion. Man the musician thinks that his music is his world's lifelong companion.</p>
<p>God the Musician is divinely and eternally mysterious. Man the musician is humanly and temporarily marvellous.</p>
<p>God's Music tells us that music is the realisation of the universal Soul. Man's music tells us that music is the aspiration of the individual soul.</p>
<p>God's Music runs from the height to the depth. Man's music runs from the breadth to the length. At its height, God's Music is His Vision. In its depth, God's Music is His Realm. In its breadth, man's music is his crying soul. In its length, man's music is his victory's goal.</p>
<p>God's Music is the constant expansion of His Soul's Delight. Man's music is the preparation of his life's hunger for perpetual joy.</p>
<p>God's Music kills God with its infinite luminosity. Man's music kills man with its undying curiosity.</p>
<p>Music in the unlit body is destruction. Music in the unlit vital is passion. Music in the unlit mind is confusion. Music in the unlit heart is frustration.</p>
<p>Music in the aspiring body is creation. Music in the aspiring vital is purification. Music in the aspiring mind is liberation. Music in the aspiring heart is revelation.</p>
<p>My God the Supreme Musician has two families. One is in the East, the other is in the West. God tells His Eastern children, or more precisely, His Indian children, that music is the soul's purity. God tells His Western children that music is life's beauty. God tells His Eastern children that music is the fulfilling rest at the bottom of the life-sea. God tells His Western children that music is the dance of the multitudinous waves of the life-sea.</p>
<p>God tells His Eastern children: "My children, those among you who can walk will walk, those who can march will march and those who can run will run towards their destined goal." God tells His Western children: "My children, I want you all to stay together. I want you all to run together towards your destined goal."</p>
<p>God tells His Eastern children: "My children, what you have is a one-pointed and unbroken chain of unity. That is good." He tells His Western children: "My children, what you have is unity in diversity. That is great."</p>
<p>God tells His Eastern children: "My children, what you have is your dream's poetry, what you have is your reality's literature." He tells His Western children: "My children, what you have is your dream's arithmetic, what you have is your reality's mathematics."</p>
<p>Here we are all seekers, seekers of the infinite Truth. Some of you are consumed with the desire to arouse and awaken your Kundalini so that you can acquire occult powers and perform miracles. But I wish to tell you that you do not have to practise any specific spiritual discipline in order to awaken your Kundalini. Beethoven is a striking example. He was a genuine seeker and his soulful music of the other world awakened his Kundalini. You also try with your own soul's music. I assure you that you, too, will succeed.</p>
<p>What Beethoven says on music is true not only from the intellectual and emotional point of view, but also from the spiritual point of view:</p>
<p>"Music is the mediator between the spiritual and the sensual life. Although the spirit be not master of that which it creates through music, yet it is blessed in this creation, which, like every creation of art, is mightier than the artist."</p>
<p>Music is the Vedic bird in us. This bird is called Suparna. This bird divine flies in the welkin of Infinity, through Eternity, with the message of Immortality.</p>
<p>Here on earth we do notice that birds have the capacity to sing in endless measure, whereas we human beings try to create or develop this capacity. Tagore defends us:</p>
<p>"To the birds you gave songs, the birds gave you songs in return. You gave me only a voice, yet asked for more, and I sing."</p>
<p>The poet-bird in Keats, divinely intoxicated, flies in front of me, before my ken.</p>
<p>"Was it a vision, or a waking dream? Fled is that music:-Do I wake or sleep?"</p>
<p>The music-bird is within us to stay, to give us love. The music-bird is without us to fly, to give us joy.</p>
<p>Since music is a universal language, it has no need to express itself in any particular language of the world. Rabindranath Tagore says:</p>
<p>"Music is the purest form of art and, therefore, the most direct expression of beauty, with form and spirit which is one and simple, and least encumbered with anything extraneous. We seem to feel that the manifestation of the Infinite in the finite forms of creation is music itself, silent and visible."</p>
<p>Our body's food is either vegetable or meat, or both. But our soul's food is music. Undoubtedly it is so. Even our physical nature at times desperately needs music.</p>
<p>What Bovee says is undeniably true:</p>
<p>"Music is the fourth great material want of our nature-first food, then raiment, then shelter, then music."</p>
<p>In the spiritual world, next to meditation is music, the breath of music. Meditation is silence, energising and fulfilling. Silence is the eloquent expression of the inexpressible. Aldous Huxley says:</p>
<p>"After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music."</p>
<p>They say, "Music is another woman who talks charmingly, but says nothing." I say, "Music is verily the woman who at once tells everything divinely and offers everything unreservedly."</p>
<p>They say, "Classical music is the music without words; modern music is the music without music." I say, "Classical music is the music that lasts after it has all been sung; modern music is the music that begins long before it has actually begun." In classical music we try to see God the eternal Beyond. In modern music we see God the eternal Now.</p>
<p>Music is our soul's home, God is the Supreme Musician. In Sri Krishna, I see God the Supreme Musician. Krishna's flute stirs the Universal Consciousness. He plays on His flute. We listen. We do something more. We barter our body's dust with His Soul's plenitude. To Sri Krishna I bow, we bow.</p>  <div id="book-navigation-1083705" class="book-navigation">
