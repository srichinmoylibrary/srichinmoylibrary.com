<p>All of you have come with aspiration — some with more, some with less. You have heard me say that we have first class disciples, second class, third class, fourth class and so on. We also say that some people are disciples, some are followers. Followers are not the same as disciples; disciples are far more intimate than followers. After the followers we have admirers.</p>
<p>Among the disciples, some possess me or are trying to possess me. Again, there are other disciples whom I possess as my very own. But I wish to say that there is a great difference between these two. Those who are trying to possess me sometimes adopt foul means. By hook or by crook they want to be close to me; they use trickery and all kinds of false ways and undivine methods. Then, they finally do possess me, but what happens? A few days later, a few months later, or even a few years later, worldly temptation comes and captures them, captures their mind. When they are caught by temptation, they are lost. They leave the spiritual path and go away, or sometimes I am compelled to ask them to leave.</p>
<p>I will give you an analogy. A father is standing with his two sons right in front of a well. One child is possessed by the father. The father is holding the child’s hand. The other is possessing the father, he is holding the father’s hand. Now, up in the sky a beautiful kite is flying. The child who is holding onto the father’s hand sees the kite and is so delighted that he starts clapping his hands. While he is doing this he loses his footing and falls into the well. Now, the one who is held by the father also sees the kite and is also happy and delighted. He is admiring the kite but, at the same time, he is caught and held by the father; so he does not fall into the well.</p>
<p>You may ask, “How is it that you have possessed certain disciples and claimed them as your very own while others you do not claim as your very own?” It is the disciples fault. When you came I did not make a selection, saying that you will be possessed by me or that I will be possessed by you. All were given the same opportunity and will always be given the same opportunity. But some of you make faster progress with regard to the divine qualities in our path: love, devotion and surrender. I see that some of the disciples are really ready for our path: their whole life revolves around our mission. They are destined to do everything for us in the outer world and in the inner world they have already done everything: surrender and consecration have already taken place. Their inner life is constant consecration and dedication. Not only have they made the inner commitment, but in both their daily acts and the inner world they are actually living their commitment. When I concentrate on them, I see that in the outer world, the field of manifestation, at every moment they can do what I ask. These people have given me the assurance of their inner capacity and I have possessed them, not in a bad sense, but in a very good sense. I have not grabbed them; I have gladly taken them into my heart. I claim them as my very own, for I know that they will be the real chosen instruments of the Supreme. Because they would like to be my very own, they will say, “Give us anything you want.” With that idea they have accepted the spiritual life and entered into our path, and now they are being fulfilled.</p>
<p>I have also given others the same opportunity, but they did not take it; they wanted to possess me for their own use. They wanted to give their love, affection, concern and everything, but with the idea that if they gave to me, I would give something to them. They feel that they can either give or not give; it is up to them. But those who have possessed me or who are trying to possess me can also enter into the world of real dedication. Within six months or a year or two, if they do well, we shall see their progress.</p>
<p>These are my secrets that I am letting out. Some I call my very own. Why? Because they deserve it; they are doing well. Others who are not doing well are only possessing; they are only playing tricks with me and thinking that by doing or saying certain things they can possess me. But they are mistaken. Your Guru is a very, very clever fellow. If you say that you can play tricks on him, that you are a rogue, I will say I am an infinitely more clever rogue. You cannot deceive me. Sometimes I keep my eyes shut only because I don’t want to enter into more problems. When you deceive me I say, “Go ahead and deceive me.” But you have to feel that I immediately see right through your deception. So please do not try to grab me with your desiring mind, but allow me to possess you with my heart — my heart of joy and pride that you are doing everything for me both in the inner and outer world. When you do this, you truly become my chosen instrument.</p>  <div id="book-navigation-1172652" class="book-navigation">
