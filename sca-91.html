Is that correct?</h1><span property="dc:title" content="Mr. Clennell: Yes, it makes very good sense. It is about spirituality and limitlessness. It is a definition.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. I have to feel that I am not a swimming pool or a lake. God wants me to be a murmuring, running river flowing from the inner Source and carrying that Source to the outer reality. If I want to be an expression of the Source, then I cannot separate my inner and outer existence. The main thing is to bring to the fore the limitless potentialities that I have deep within. From this point of view, even to speak of three million birds is binding.</p>
<p>Spirituality is not something abnormal or unnatural. Spirituality is more normal and natural than anything else. God is limitless, infinite, immortal, and I want to become consciously part and parcel of His Existence so that I can serve Him in His own Way. At the same time, the One who is infinite, eternal and immortal is trying to express Himself in and through my limitations. He says, "Now I want to express Myself in and through your artistic life. I want to express Myself in and through your poetic life, your sports life." But He can do it only according to my receptivity. A mother gives some candies to a three-year-old child and tells him to distribute them to his friends. Then, when she sees that the child is doing well, she gives him lots of sweets so that he can feed hundreds of people. In this way the mother is offering the sweets to others in and through her child.</p>
<p>I always say that the Supreme is expressing Himself in and through me, according to my receptivity. I am not the doer. I cannot claim these three million birds as my own and I do not want to claim them as such. I am grateful to the Supreme for having given me the golden opportunity to serve Him in His own Way. My poetry, my music, my art and everything else that I do are only expressions of Somebody who is operating in and through me. At every moment He is seeing how much purity I have, how much humility I have, how much sincerity I have, how much eagerness I have. According to these, He is able to express Himself in and through me.</p>
<p>Some people may say, "What is he doing? He is an artist, he is a musician, he is singer. Why is he not taking one subject and doing the utmost with it?" But I do not see it that way. A piano has many keys. Why should the pianist always stay on one key? If he plays only one key, one note, how can he produce the cosmic melody, the universal melody? Similarly, I feel that art is one key, poetry is another key, meditation is a third key and sports is a fourth key. If you strike the different keys, then you produce nice music. Otherwise, it will not sound good.</p>
<p>If I want to be a flower inside God's Heart-Garden, or if I want to be a flower placed at the Feet of God, how can I have only one petal? If a flower is to be beautiful, it must have at least a few petals. If I bring you one petal on a stem, you will say, "Is it a flower? This is silly."</p>
<p>My body has hands, legs, eyes and so forth. Shall I give importance only to my hands? Shall I make them stronger than the strongest and not pay any attention to my legs? And if I pay attention only to my legs and discard the mind, then who will tell me to walk? Again, if my eyes are not functioning, then how are my legs going to take me anywhere? As the body is integral, so life itself must be an integral whole.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Clennell:</em> That is a lovely explanation. That makes something about you very clear, and I really appreciate your saying that.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because you are practising yoga, I am able to speak to you in this heart-to-heart way. I am coming to you with my heart â with what I have and what I am. You are also accepting what I have and what I am. There is a great difference between 'have' and 'am'. When 'have' and 'am' become one, then only can we become a real instrument of God.</p>  <div id="book-navigation-1170512" class="book-navigation">
