  <h1 id="page-title">Disciples leaving the boat</h1><span property="dc:title" content="Disciples leaving the boat" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Recently some disciples left our boat and today I had to ask two or three more to leave the boat. People come and people go, but I have only one request to you: don’t mix with the disciples who have left us. No matter who you are, no matter how spiritual and how divine you think you are, even if you think you will realise God tomorrow, please listen to my request. People who have left the Centre also have power. The force that took them away has tremendous power. In this case, it is negative power, an undivine power, but don’t think that negative power is not strong. If you mix with them, without fail they will influence you, tempt you and try to take you away. And this has been happening during these last two weeks.</p>
<p>You should not even think of them, because when you think of them, unconsciously or consciously you are bringing their present consciousness into your aspiring life. You have enough problems of you own to solve. Do not try to deal with the problems of others as well. If you carry news about those who have left our path or bring gossip about them, you are only taking poison into yourself and throwing it into others. You are doing an injustice to the Supreme. Do not be in touch with them even in a mental way, unless it is absolutely necessary. Even if you just indulge in hearing from them yourself and don’t spread a word to others, you are equally guilty. Even if you don’t open your mouth, if you open your ears, you are guilty. If they approach you, simply say, “As you are not in our boat, we are not in yours.”</p>
<p>Otherwise, you are only digging your own grave. Those who leave a path often try to take more people away by sharing their doubts and dissatisfaction. If you really want to be loyal and faithful to your Guru, if you sincerely want his boat to take you to the Golden Shore of the Beyond, then have no unnecessary connection with the ex-disciples of your Master. Just feel how sincere and devoted you are, and then in your actions you will prove it. If you really want to be loyal, then you will neither think of these people, talk of them, nor have any connection with them. Two weeks ago one disciple left and now three or four other disciples have left just because of this one individual. We know who wins; the divine in us eventually wins. But I am telling you that only on the day you realise God will you be absolutely strong. If you mix with disciples who have left us, to be sure you may also leave our path. You are also weakening yourself even if you mix with others who are about to leave. They may tell you their problems — not for consolation but only to share their burdens with you, to add to your own problems — and these last few weeks this has also happened.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a wave of hostile attacks. Often we use a very mild term: undivine. But there is a great difference between undivine and hostile. A hostile attack is an immediate attack: “I have left, and I want to take ten people with me.” This is what is happening now. So please be very careful if you want to stay in our boat to the end of your life. This is only one life and it is like a fleeting second. If you take this incarnation as one fleeting second, you can easily offer it to the Supreme in me. When people leave and make you feel that they are now doing extremely well, far better than when they were with us, I wish to say that they are fooling themselves, and this I am saying on the strength of my own realisation. When disciples leave, most if not all of them go back to their ignorant life. When some of them say they are going to some other path, rest assured that they are just fooling themselves. After following a real, well-established path, to go to another path is very rare.</p>
<p>Previously you were in the sea of ignorance. Now you are in the sea of Light, according to the amount of Light you are able to receive from the Supreme in me. If you go back to your old life, at that time you can’t say that where you presently are is the sea of Light and that this path is the sea of ignorance. If you say that, you are only fooling yourself, as some people are now doing. I feel sorry for them and I feel more sorry for those who are being converted back to ignorance. Again, in my absolute Highest, I don’t feel sorry; I offer everything at the Feet of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Who is our enemy? Ignorance. We have to conquer ignorance in our life. Before we come to the spiritual life we are in ignorance; we stand against the light. At that time we are fighting against light and trying to devour light. But when we are in light, we stand against ignorance, not to devour it but to transform it. Night wants to devour light as soon as it conquers light, but light feels that as soon as it conquers ignorance it will transform it into light. We ourselves were against light, we fought against light; but now that we have become spiritual we consciously take the side of light and try to transform the ignorance in and around us. We now feel that ignorance is something foreign to us.</p>
<p>So after accepting the spiritual life, if we still consider ourselves to be totally in darkness or swimming in the sea of ignorance, than that is a total mistake. It is only false modesty and I don’t approve of this attitude. We have to know we are now in the sea of light. We may swim slowly while others who are more expert swimmers may swim fast. But although you may not be an expert swimmer like someone else, please feel that once you accept my path or someone else’s path you are on the side of light, fighting to transform darkness. When we are on earth, we have to feel that it is absolutely necessary to get everything sooner than at once, because we have three goals. Our first goal is realisation, our second goal is revelation and our third goal is manifestation. There is no final end to any of these goals, but still we can call them our first, second or third goals. Even the first goal is a far cry, not to speak of the second and third. So, when we are here on earth, each fleeting second is very important. But if we don’t take the goal seriously, then we have to wait. We have waited for millennia and, if we choose, we can go on waiting for millennia.</p>  <div id="book-navigation-1172652" class="book-navigation">
