To my mind, it is no less than a miracle. Is it not the greatest place on earth?</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-dr-robert-muller-em-u-thant-often-said-that-in-his-view-the-west-was-too-materialistic-and-intellectual-and-not-spiritual-enough-whereas-the-east-was-too-spiritual-and-fatalistic-and-not-caring-enough-for-the-material-and-intellectual-welfare-of-people-do-you-see-a-synthesis-developing-between-the-two-and-how-would-you-envisage-a-harmonious-happy-world-society- mid-1751707"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/msun-3"><em>Dr. Robert Muller:</em> U Thant often said that in his view the West was too materialistic and intellectual, and not spiritual enough, whereas the East was too spiritual and fatalistic, and not caring enough for the material and intellectual welfare of people. Do you see a synthesis developing between the two, and how would you envisage a harmonious, happy world-society?</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-dr-robert-muller-em-the-first-three-of-u-thant-s-four-categories-of-needs-namely-physical-intellectual-and-moral-needs-do-not-create-any-insuperable-problems-for-me-but-the-last-and-most-important-one-in-his-view-spirituality-gives-me-considerable-difficulties-because-there-are-indeed-so-many-definitions-of-that-term-u-thant-described-it-as-quot-faith-in-oneself-the-purity-of-one-s-inner-self-quot-how-would-you-define-the-spiritual-goals- mid-1751708"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/msun-4"><em>Dr. Robert Muller:</em> The first three of U Thant's four categories of needs — namely, physical, intellectual and moral needs — do not create any insuperable problems for me. But the last and most important one in his view, spirituality, gives me considerable difficulties because there are indeed so many definitions of that term. U Thant described it as &quot;faith in oneself, the purity of one's inner self.&quot; How would you define the spiritual goals?</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-dr-robert-muller-em-i-often-think-that-u-thant-s-four-categories-of-human-qualities-physical-intellectual-moral-and-spiritual-could-well-form-the-basis-for-a-world-agenda-of-human-goals-from-your-writings-i-notice-that-these-categories-are-also-quite-fundamental-to-you-but-you-add-to-it-a-fifth-which-you-call-the-vital-could-you-elaborate-on-it- mid-1751709"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/msun-5"><em>Dr. Robert Muller:</em> I often think that U Thant's four categories of human qualities — physical, intellectual, moral and spiritual — could well form the basis for a world agenda of human goals. From your writings, I notice that these categories are also quite fundamental to you. But you add to it a fifth, which you call the vital. Could you elaborate on it?</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-dr-robert-muller-em-when-i-speak-to-audiences-about-u-thant-s-four-ways-to-happiness-physical-mental-moral-and-spiritual-i-sometimes-hear-the-following-criticism-quot-life-cannot-be-artificially-cut-into-four-everything-is-interdependent-and-linked-we-must-concentrate-on-life-as-an-entity-and-not-on-components-that-are-the-product-of-the-intellect-quot-i-am-not-overly-impressed-with-this-argument-for-i-have-indeed-observed-that-life-is-richest-when-i-cultivate-simultaneously-all-four-categories-nevertheless-there-is-some-truth-in-that-criticism-and-i-would-be-grateful-to-learn-how-you-would-respond-to-it- mid-1751710"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/msun-6"><em>Dr. Robert Muller:</em> When I speak to audiences about U Thant's four ways to happiness — physical, mental, moral and spiritual — I sometimes hear the following criticism: &quot;Life cannot be artificially cut into four. Everything is interdependent and linked. We must concentrate on life as an entity and not on components that are the product of the intellect.&quot; I am not overly impressed with this argument, for I have indeed observed that life is richest when I cultivate simultaneously all four categories. Nevertheless, there is some truth in that criticism and I would be grateful to learn how you would respond to it.</a></li>

All these forms were associated with changes in the social structure. Recently, the &quot;age of reason&quot; and the scientific and industrial revolution have rendered religion and spirituality obsolete, even harmful, in the eyes of many. What, in your view, is likely to be the religion or spirituality of humanity tomorrow as a satisfactory answer to man's queries about his relationships with the universe, his fellow men and the mysteries of life? And will this be reflected in the United Nations as a forum where humanity is seeking new ways for its destiny and fulfilment?</a></li>
