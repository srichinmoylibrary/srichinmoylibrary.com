And before the end of the day it’s pretty tough to sit back and take a spiritual view of what’s going on because you have to go out there and hustle. You have to earn a living. Is there a way of integrating the spiritual life into what we call the economic life?</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-steve-powers-em-do-you-believe-that-god-provides- mid-1835071"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/tfm-8"><em>Steve Powers:</em> Do you believe that God provides?</a></li>

<li class="leaf id-em-caller-em-if-you-learn-peace-and-serenity-from-a-guru-you-may-have-peace-and-serenity-in-your-own-mind-and-heart-but-what-do-you-do-about-people-in-the-street-who-are-not-the-same-way- mid-1835074"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/tfm-11"><em>Caller:</em> If you learn peace and serenity from a Guru, you may have peace and serenity in your own mind and heart, but what do you do about people in the street who are not the same way?</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-caller-em-how-do-you-know-whether-you-are-speaking-to-god-or-just-speaking-to-yourself-and-saying-it-s-god- mid-1835075"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/tfm-12"><em>Caller:</em> How do you know whether you are speaking to God or just speaking to yourself and saying it’s God?</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-steve-powers-em-i-think-one-of-the-callers-was-asking-in-effect-if-i-become-sensitive-and-mellow-and-spiritual-will-i-not-get-eaten-up-on-the-street-by-the-sharks-do-you-know-what-i-mean-by-that- mid-1835076"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/tfm-13"><em>Steve Powers:</em> I think one of the callers was asking, in effect: If I become sensitive and mellow and spiritual, will I not get eaten up on the street by the sharks? Do you know what I mean by that?</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-steve-powers-em-one-of-the-problems-i-think-people-have-is-that-even-if-they-pray-and-meditate-or-if-they-just-try-to-be-good-when-they-go-out-into-the-world-they-find-there-are-people-there-just-waiting-to-rip-them-off-they-see-no-justice- mid-1835077"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/tfm-14"><em>Steve Powers:</em> One of the problems I think people have is that even if they pray and meditate or if they just try to be good, when they go out into the world they find there are people there just waiting to rip them off. They see no justice.</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-caller-em-i-was-brought-up-in-my-daily-life-to-ask-god-to-help-me-with-the-things-that-i-wanted-out-of-life-but-i-find-that-i-don-t-have-any-of-the-things-i-wanted-and-now-god-is-asking-me-to-do-things-for-him-rather-than-to-expect-things-from-him- mid-1835078"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/tfm-15"><em>Caller:</em> I was brought up in my daily life to ask God to help me with the things that I wanted out of life. But I find that I don’t have any of the things I wanted, and now God is asking me to do things for Him rather than to expect things from Him.</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-caller-em-i-have-tried-for-several-years-to-become-a-more-spiritual-person-in-my-own-way-with-very-little-knowledge-of-it-i-had-one-or-two-experiences-which-have-frightened-me-i-don-t-understand-them-and-yet-i-believe-in-them-i-would-like-to-ask-sri-chinmoy-how-i-could-continue-to-further-my-knowledge-and-develop-myself-so-that-i-could-begin-to-experience-more- mid-1835079"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/tfm-16"><em>Caller:</em> I have tried for several years to become a more spiritual person in my own way, with very little knowledge of it. I had one or two experiences which have frightened me. I don’t understand them and yet I believe in them. I would like to ask Sri Chinmoy how I could continue to further my knowledge and develop myself so that I could begin to experience more.</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-steve-powers-em-sri-chinmoy-i-know-people-who-are-most-kind-and-gentle-and-yet-have-no-belief-in-god-they-seem-to-be-fine-human-beings-even-though-they-have-no-interest-in-spirituality-from-your-point-of-view-do-they-need-realisation-of-what-you-are-talking-about- mid-1835080"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/tfm-17"><em>Steve Powers:</em> Sri Chinmoy, I know people who are most kind and gentle and yet have no belief in God. They seem to be fine human beings even though they have no interest in spirituality. From your point of view, do they need realisation of what you are talking about?</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-caller-em-i-was-trying-to-give-some-healing-to-my-father-who-was-not-too-well-and-i-felt-some-energy-moving-in-my-hands-am-i-right-to-feel-that-this-and-other-kinds-of-experiences-that-i-ve-had-may-be-coming-from-god- mid-1835081"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/tfm-18"><em>Caller:</em> I was trying to give some healing to my father who was not too well, and I felt some energy moving in my hands. Am I right to feel that this and other kinds of experiences that I've had may be coming from God?</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-steve-powers-em-if-there-is-a-healing-power-why-do-we-need-specific-methods-in-order-to-heal-in-other-words-let-s-assume-that-god-is-the-source-and-he-is-capable-of-healing-whomever-he-wishes-why-do-certain-people-feel-that-they-have-to-go-through-a-number-of-incantations-wave-the-hand-over-the-disturbed-area-four-times-to-the-right-three-times-to-the-left-and-so-on-why-these-systems- mid-1835082"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/tfm-19"><em>Steve Powers:</em> If there is a healing power, why do we need specific methods in order to heal? In other words, let’s assume that God is the Source and He is capable of healing whomever He wishes. Why do certain people feel that they have to go through a number of incantations, wave the hand over the disturbed area four times to the right, three times to the left and so on? Why these systems?</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-caller-em-i-have-intellectual-pursuits-but-i-do-believe-in-a-very-very-deep-spiritual-life-and-i-have-become-much-more-of-what-i-would-call-a-human-being-but-the-more-you-become-that-the-more-you-are-eaten-as-you-said-before-by-the-sharks-by-the-life-around-you-what-is-to-be-done- mid-1835083"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/tfm-20"><em>Caller:</em> I have intellectual pursuits, but I do believe in a very, very deep spiritual life and I have become much more of what I would call a human being. But the more you become that, the more you are eaten, as you said before, by the sharks, by the life around you. What is to be done?</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-caller-em-if-god-is-all-loving-why-does-he-permit-suffering- mid-1835084"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/tfm-21"><em>Caller:</em> If God is all-loving, why does He permit suffering?</a></li>

Instantly I was besieged with a barrage of complaints and criticisms.</a></li>

I tried to see the good in everyone around me, always to see them as God, as spiritual beings, as good children. At this time I lost a son in an accident. How am I supposed to accept this in my life? Is it God’s plan, or is this my reward for being good?</a></li>
