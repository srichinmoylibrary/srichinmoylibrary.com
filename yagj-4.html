<p>"I am simply fed up with your vital life! You must put an end to your emotional life. You must put an end to your life of ignorance. You are simply an impossible creature," the Master said to Viman. "I don't think I will be able to keep you anymore or offer you light anymore. It is enough! I am fed up with you."</p>
<p>Viman, with a sad face, said, "Master, Master, please forgive me once again. I know I have done many wrong things, many undivine things. But if you do not forgive me, who will forgive me?"</p>
<p>"Stop, stop, stop your philosophy!" said the Master. "Now tell me, Viman, you know that I am not a fake."</p>
<p>"No, Master, never, never! I know that you are not a fake."</p>
<p>"Then why do you have to behave like a fake disciple? They say, 'Like father, like son.' Why can it not be, 'Like spiritual father, like spiritual son' in your case? Why can't you be divine like me?"</p>
<p>Viman said, "I am trying, Master, I am trying to be like you."</p>
<p>"Viman, tell me one thing. What do you think of me in your mind? Do you think of me as an ordinary Master or a great Master or the greatest Master?"</p>
<p>"Master, when my consciousness is low, at that time I think you are an ordinary Master. When my consciousness is high, I think you are a great Master. But when my consciousness is at the highest, according to my standard, then I feel you are the greatest spiritual Master."</p>
<p>The Master said, "So you have three different states of consciousness: low, high and highest, When you are in one consciousness, you feel I am an ordinary Master. When you are in another consciousness, you feel I am a great Master. When you are in a third consciousness, you feel I am the greatest Master. I wish to say that I have something on my mind. You have done so many undivine things that you have cast a slur on my ashram. Now you have to do something with your life. This time I am really serious. You just said that sometimes I am an ordinary Master, sometimes I am a great Master and sometimes I am the greatest Master. Now how am I going to deal with you? Today I have to do something with you. You tell me what you think an ordinary Master will do in a case like yours, what a great Master will do, and what the greatest Master will do if he has to deal with a disciple like you."</p>
<p>"Master, an ordinary Master will punish me severely for what I have been doing. A great Master will scold me mercilessly. The greatest Master will forgive me unconditionally.</p>
<p>"All right, Viman. Since you take me as an ordinary Master, a great Master and the greatest Master at different times, I wish to play these three roles today in your life. As an ordinary Master, I am punishing you. You will have to leave me for twelve years. You cannot keep any connection with me or with my disciples. When and if you come back, I shall scold you mercilessly for twelve days. Then I shall forgive you."</p>
<p>"Master, first you will punish me, then you will scold me and then you will forgive me? What kind of forgiveness is that? Please forgive me; I don't want to be audacious, but I don't understand. After punishment and after scolding, is there any necessity for forgiveness? Master, please let me know. I don't understand."</p>
<p>"Viman, you believe in the past, you believe in the present, but it seems you don't believe in the future. Before coming to me you did many things wrong, you know. And you are still doing many things wrong, even after having accepted my path. So you see, in the past you did things wrong, and in the present you are doing wrong. Now how can you think you won't do things wrong in the future? I know in the future you will do many, many things wrong. But I give you the promise that I will forgive you. As an ordinary Master, I shall punish you for twelve years. As a great Master, I shall scold you for twelve days. After that my forgiveness will be forever, from that day on. Be happy that this is my judgement. Twelve years will fly away and twelve days will pass in the twinkling of an eye. Then, for the rest of your life, I will only forgive you and forgive you, no matter what you do."</p>
<p>Now Viman said, "Master, since you <em>will</em> use the most powerful weapon on earth, out of your infinite kindness how I wish you would use it now!"</p>
<p>"Viman, you are such a clever fellow. Yes, I shall use my forgiveness-weapon, at the last. But I have two weapons, two mighty weapons to transform the nature of my disciples. One is force, and the other is love. Force-power I shall use first, and then I shall use love-power. But I have to tell you that force itself is love. Who forces whom? He who loves somebody forces him to be good. The mother forces the child to do the right thing because the child is hers. Again, the same mother loves the child because it is her child. She knows when to use force in the form of love and when to use love in the form of force. In your case I am first using force-power as love, and then forgiveness-power, which is love, as force. Right now if I use only love as force, you will not value this love-power, or forgiveness-power.</p>
<p>"Love as force and force as love are equally indispensable. But in your case I want to use force as love first, and then love as force. I feel that in this way only will I be able to bring about transformation in your life and to offer you realisation in this life of yours.</p>  <div id="book-navigation-1217393" class="book-navigation">
