 <p></p>
<h2>Surrender and oneness</h2>

<p>The Guru will never expect or ask a disciple to give him something which he has not already given to that particular disciple. Whenever I ask someone to do something, it means that I have already given him the capacity to do it. God will never ask us to do anything beyond our capacity. He has given us the necessary capacity. He won't ask a beggar to give Him millions of dollars. He has made the person a beggar, so how can He ask the beggar to give Him millions of dollars? But if someone really has millions of dollars, then God may ask him to give. Similarly, when I ask some disciple to make constant, unconditional surrender, to give his life totally to the Supreme in me or to the Inner Pilot, then it means that that person already has the capacity. Only the mind is obstructing that capacity, or the aggressive vital is fighting against the dynamic vital which constantly wants to establish the divine Truth here on earth. Nothing will be asked of a disciple unless he has already been given the power, the capacity, the strength or the light long before.</p>
<p>If the disciple is totally for the Master, then there can be no pain, no misunderstanding, no doubt, because immediately the disciple will feel that what the Master is doing is not only best for him but also what God wants from him. In my case, there is no individual will. An ordinary human being has more individual will than I have, because I have offered my will to the Supreme. From the spiritual point of view, when I ask some disciples to do something. it is not my will, it is the Will of the Supreme. You people have more freedom than I have. My freedom is the infinite freedom, but it is only the expression, the revelation and manifestation of the highest Truth. Ordinary people have more freedom: they can say this, they can do that, they can break something. I cannot do these things because I know that inside me is the Cosmic Law. I know what will happen if I break the Cosmic Law and what disharmony I will create in the world's atmosphere, so how can I do it? I have sold my individual will to the Supreme; I cannot take it back. Ordinary people have not yet realised what individual will is. They are constantly using their own whimsical will; and when they are conscious of it, they think that it is so precious. They feel that their will is their freedom. But there is no freedom in that will. A time comes when they go deep within. Then they realise that their individual will is all frustration; it is all limited achievement whereas only unlimited achievement can give them real joy.</p>
<p>I wish to say that unconditional surrender comes only when the mind has become totally one with the soul. The soul is the climbing flame of aspiration and the messenger of the divine Truth on earth. If we become one with the soul, then we are constantly happy. And who can make us one with the soul? For those who have a spiritual Master, it is only the Master who can do it since he alone is able to bring down Grace from Above. Personal effort on the part of the disciple is not enough. Only if the individual disciple is conscious of the fact that the Master is responsible for his life can this oneness of soul and mind take place. If a disciple has a Master, then the disciple has to feel that his life is his Master's responsibility. If he thinks that he himself is responsible because it is his body and his mind, then I wish to say that surrender has not been made at all.</p>
<p>Surrender means oneness. If I have become one with my Master, then how can I have a different will or a separate will? If my surrender is total, complete and constant, then the very fact that the Master tells me to do something should be honoured. The Master does not ask all and sundry in the street to do things for him. The Master asks only the dearest ones. The Master demands something from the dearest disciples which he does not demand from ordinary disciples. Among my disciples I have first class, second class, third class, fourth class, fifth class and so on. The first class disciples must feel that they have to surrender all that they have and all that they are to the Supreme in me. Then only can I give them everything that I have and everything that I am.</p>
<p>When Lord Krishna used to play on the flute while tending the cows, his compatriots â his friends and his female companions who used to adore him and worship him â would immediately leave their husbands and wives even if there were sick persons in the family. They used to discard the whole world and immediately come to listen to his music. When Lord Krishna used to play in Vrindavan on his flute, he was calling and inviting the aspirants. Immediately all the gopis and all the other aspirants went to him. They left their homes and relatives, because the divine call had come. When the divine call comes, you have to give up everything. Then, when you give up everything, you get the Infinite.</p>
<p>When the hour strikes, when the Guru makes a decision, you have to know that the decision comes directly from the Supreme. The Guru, if he is a real Guru, has no individual will to exercise. A first class disciple has to sit down if the Guru says to sit down. If the Guru says to stand up, then the first class disciple has to stand up. This is the relationship between a first class disciple and the Master. Second, third and fourth class disciples can do anything. They can have their ego, they can have their doubts, they can have the responsibility for their own lives, but not the first class disciples. The first class disciples have to give total responsibility to the Master.</p>
<p>So, when the call comes from the Master that God wants you to do something, if you want to be first class disciples, then please do not look for the world, do not look for society, do not look for your relatives. If you do, then you are violating the divine Will in the Guru and the divine Will in yourself. The world may misunderstand you, the world may hate you to the end of your life, but God will embrace you. God will put you in His Lap. At that time, you will become one with God. If you become one with God, then let the rest of the world hate you, let it say anything against you. But if you go away from God just to please humanity, then you may please humanity, but God will not be pleased.</p>
<p>Again, to tell the truth, you can never, never please humanity. No matter how sincere you are or how pure you are, the very nature of humanity is to demand of you, to misunderstand you, to find fault with you: "You could have easily given me more; it is not enough." But God is not like that. He is all Love. He asks of you only what He has already given to you. He won't ask from you one cent more than He has already given to you.</p>
<p>When the hour strikes, the outer world and the inner world have to become one, cheerfully one with the decision of the Guru. At that time you should just run. You have to be really proud when your Guru makes a decision for you. The Guru has many things to do with the Supreme and with the other disciples; so when he makes a special decision for you â "do this or say this, come here or go there" â then you should be really proud. It means that your Guru has entered into your life totally.</p>
<p>There are many disciples. If the dearest and nearest disciples can become one with my inner family, my spiritual family, then I will do everything for them in the inner world and everything for them in the outer world. If they cannot dance with me, if they cannot sing with me, if they cannot run with me, then automatically the cosmic force will take them away from me no matter how sincerely they try to stay. They will be pulled away by the cosmic ignorance and I will be helpless. Now the family is very small, but it is sincere and dedicated. When this family grows, when our mission grows very large, at that time only the purest, absolutely the most dedicated, will be with me. The rest will automatically fall away even if they try hard to remain.</p>  <div id="book-navigation-1088913" class="book-navigation">
