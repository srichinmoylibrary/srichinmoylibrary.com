  <h1 id="page-title">Wisdom-Light</h1><span property="dc:title" content="Wisdom-Light" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Dear sisters and brothers, dear seekers of the infinite Truth and Light, I wish to give a short talk on wisdom-light.</p>
<p>Wisdom-light is life-loving. Wisdom-light is self-giving. Wisdom-light is God-becoming.</p>
<p>He who loves life is beautiful. He who gives himself to others is fruitful. He who becomes God — like the Christ, Lord Buddha and Sri Krishna — is complete, perfect and supreme.</p>
<p>Why does one love? One loves because he knows that loving is self-expansion. Why does one give himself to others? He gives himself to others because he knows that in self-giving is the real satisfaction. Why does one want to become God? He wants to become God because he knows that God-becoming is perfect Perfection.</p>
<p>Our heart embodies the message of self-expansion. Our life embodies the message of satisfaction. Our soul embodies the message of perfection. In Heaven the message is the light of Divinity. On earth the message is the night of Eternity. In God the message is the delight of Immortality.</p>
<p>When we pray, Divinity blesses us. When we meditate, Eternity blesses us. When we surrender our earth-bound life to the adamantine will of the Absolute Supreme, we become the delight of Immortality.</p>
<p>Divinity, Eternity and Immortality. Divinity we already had. Eternity we already have. Immortality we are in the process of becoming.</p>
<p>God's Vision and God's Reality we embody together. Our earthly existence is the transformed Vision of God manifested in living reality. Each vision is a seed of the reality-tree. Each form of reality is the tree which is embodied in the vision-seed. Silence-cry is the soul of the vision-seed. Sound-smile is the body of the reality-tree.</p>
<p>Each human being has a seeker and a lover in the inmost recesses of his heart. The seeker in him wants to reach the Highest, the transcendental Height, and then wants to come down to transform the teeming ignorance of earthly life and make of earth a Kingdom of Heaven. The lover in him wants to spread his universal wings and satisfy the inner hunger of millennia the hunger that can be fulfilled only by God's infinite Love, Compassion and Light.</p>
<p>The seeker in each human being is the collector and the receiver of God's Light. The lover in him is the distributor of God's Light to the world at large.</p>
<p>Wisdom-light is the awareness of God's Presence all-where, the awareness that God is omnipresent. This reality we can be aware of only when we see God within and without. There is an Indian parable about a spiritual teacher who offered a fruit to each of his disciples. He said to them, "Children, go and eat your fruit unseen by anybody at all. You must eat your fruit in complete privacy." Each went and ate his respective fruit except one. That one came back to the Master with his fruit. The Master asked him, "How is it that you have not eaten your fruit?" The disciple answered, "Master, how can I eat? You have asked me to eat the fruit only when there is nobody observing me. But God is all around me, so I have not eaten. If I eat, I will be caught red-handed." The Master was exceedingly pleased with this disciple.</p>
<p>From this parable we learn that a sincere seeker of the transcendental Truth sees and feels God both within and without. There also dawns in him a higher and deeper vision. He comes to realise that he is expected to say and do to the world at large only those things that can be said and done before God. Today's world of imperfection can easily be transformed into a world of perfect Perfection when the seeker in us sees God everywhere.</p>
<p>The motto of the State of Florida is, "In God we trust." For an ordinary seeker this loftiest message may seem redundant, for since we are all lovers of the highest Truth and Light, it goes without saying that we trust in God. But from the spiritual point of view I wish to say that there is a significant hidden truth inside this motto. This freedom-loving country has something significant to offer to the world at large. When we live an ordinary life, we place our trust in ourselves. When we have faith in ourselves, we sing the song of separativity and individuality, the song of 'I'. At that time the question of 'we' never arises. But when we say, "In God we trust," our individuality merges into the sea of universality. On the strength of our inner cry we are trying to grow into God's Universality. When a seeker says, "In God we trust," he feels that his individuality has left him. He has now embraced God's entire creation as his own, very own.</p>
<p>A seeker trusts God and God trusts him. A seeker trusts God in order to reach the highest pinnacle of Light, Truth and Bliss, and God trusts him in order to reveal Himself and manifest Himself on earth. They enjoy a reciprocal need. The seeker needs God for his self-discovery and life-mastery and God needs the seeker for His perfect manifestation and complete satisfaction on earth.</p>
