His achievements and his accomplishments are amazing. They have been reported world-wide. We will talk about those achievements with a Guru, a genuine Guru — really genuine — Sri Chinmoy. And Sri Chinmoy, of course, is an international figure.</a></li>
<li class="leaf joel-martin-we-have-to-expound-i-have-learned-what-the-term-inner-pilot-means-but-for-the-people-that-don-t-know-it-s-so-important-when-we-first-met-many-years-ago-you-explained-to-me-all-about-the-inner-pilot-could-you-do-it-again- mid-1720914"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/abis-64">Joel Martin: We have to expound. I have learned what the term ’Inner Pilot’ means. But for the people that don’t know, it’s so important. When we first met many years ago, you explained to me all about the Inner Pilot. Could you do it again?</a></li>

Could you tell us the significance of that colour?</a></li>
<li class="leaf joel-martin-people-who-watch-me-know-that-i-ve-done-many-programmes-about-the-occult-and-about-psychic-phenomena-over-the-years-you-don-t-have-any-quarrel-with-the-spirit-world-or-those-things-that-we-call-psychic- mid-1720918"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/abis-68">Joel Martin: People who watch me know that I’ve done many programmes about the occult and about psychic phenomena over the years.

I mean, this was heavy also. Wow! Did it hurt? I’ve got so many questions. What do you think about when you do that — is it total concentration?</a></li>
<li class="leaf joel-martin-you-re-not-pushing-for-people-to-all-lift-elephants-are-you- mid-1720921"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/abis-71">Joel Martin: You’re not pushing for people to all lift elephants, are you?</a></li>

You have lifted an elephant, you have lifted a seaplane, a boat, various weights. How does that further the cause of world peace, which is so elusive?”</a></li>
<li class="leaf joel-martin-it-s-not-that-long-ago-that-you-began-weightlifting-and-you-are-55-now-before-that-you-had-been-running-for-a-long-time- mid-1720923"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/abis-73">Joel Martin: It’s not that long ago that you began weightlifting, and you are 55 now.

I can use that strength to be aggressive.</a></li>

I’m going to come back to that. I think we have one more visual. This is where you bettered the one-arm press of 450 pounds and lifted 503 pounds. You don’t lift that much every day, do you?</a></li>

In his pursuit of God and Truth, he has used his meditation powers to accomplish amazing things, from writing 700 books and composing 3,000 songs to creating over 140,000 esoteric paintings.
