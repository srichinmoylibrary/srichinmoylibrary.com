  <h1 id="page-title">Question: Guru, if the Supreme is in everything, then He must also be in the mind. So why is the mind bad?</h1><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, if the Supreme is in everything, then He must also be in the mind. So why is the mind bad?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two minds. One mind is extremely nice, extremely divine, extremely pure. The other mind, which is in the physical, is not so divine and pure. When we say that the mind is not as good as the heart, we are speaking about the mind that is inside the body. This mind does not allow our own heart to become big. Right now you are thinking of me; the next moment you will think of your friends who are somewhere else. The mind thinks of only one person or one thing at a time, and the next moment it goes somewhere else. This mind cannot hold four or five things at a time; it is very limited. It sees one thing at a time and it goes very fast.</p>
<p>Right now the mind that you are using is called the physical mind. If I smile at one of your friends, you will become jealous. The mind will say, "Oh, Guru didn't look at me." But when you use the other mind, the pure mind, you will say, "After all, so-and-so is my friend. Why have I to become jealous when she and I are one?"</p>
<p>The heart is all oneness. So, if you remain inside the heart, you will not feel jealousy. If I smile at someone else, immediately you will say, "Oh, she is my dearest friend." Then you will have no suffering, no anxiety, no doubt, no jealousy. You are a sincere girl, so try always to have the heart that tells you, "We are all one, we are all one." If I look at your mother and bless her, you will be very happy that I am blessing your mother and nobody else. Similarly, if you feel that these other girls in the Centre are also like your mother — members of your own family — then you won't feel miserable in the mind. The mind makes you feel that your spiritual sisters and brothers do not belong to you. But the heart makes you feel that everybody belongs to you. That is why the heart is better. Remain in the heart, pray in the heart, meditate in the heart. Then you will see that everybody is yours and you are everybody's.</p>
<p>I am trying to simplify the matter; otherwise it will become a philosophy. God is in everything. God is also inside a tiger, but will you stand in front of the tiger? No. The tiger will just eat you up. You have to know that the God that is inside the tiger is not to be worshipped by you right now. God is inside everything, but in some things He is manifested to a greater degree. You are a human being and I am also a human being. You eat rice, you eat bread, you eat pizza; I also eat these things. But there is a little difference between you and me; that is why you have come to me. So, the Supreme is in the mind also, but in the heart He is more accommodating, He is broader, He is kinder and more compassionate. Again, the water that I am drinking is good water, pure water. There is also water in the street, but I won't drink it. It is dirty, filthy. So, you have to know where God is more divine, more sympathetic, more loving.</p>
<p>God is inside cauliflower, tomatoes, everything. So you may say, "Oh, I am eating God!" But if you don't eat cauliflower, potatoes, tomatoes, rice, then you won't be able to live on earth. Here on earth always we are living at the expense of something. But we have to know who is more conscious. Human beings are more conscious than plants. Again, among human beings there are some who are more conscious than others. At the age of eleven you are praying to God. So, you are more conscious than millions and billions of people on earth who are not praying to God. I am showing preference to you and not to your friends and neighbours. Inside them also is God, but inside you God is more conscious right now.</p>
<p>The heart and the soul love God much more than the mind. That is why we say that the heart is better, the soul is better. It is a comparison. The mind is not totally bad; if we don't have the mind, we won't be able to think and we will be like a fool. But there are quite a few things which are better than the mind. Better than the mind is the heart, and better than the heart is the soul. Again, right now the mind is the boss. As long as your mind is the boss, it will make you feel miserable. But when you realise God, you will see that the mind is under your command. When you become the boss of the mind, at that time you are free.</p>  <div id="book-navigation-1081920" class="book-navigation">
