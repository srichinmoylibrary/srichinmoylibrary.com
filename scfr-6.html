<p><em>(George Washington is admiring the beauty of one of his farms.)</em></p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> Indeed, England was right. The English said that we are not in a position to rule our country. Look how my countrymen are angrily and endlessly fighting over absolutely unimportant things. Each one treasures his own ideas as flawless and perfect jewels. To me, all of their ideas are nothing but ridiculous idiosyncrasies. England is mocking us. Although we have won the war for independence, the British are making fun of us. We must immediately put an end to it. And also, we must shatter England's idea of the supreme necessity for a king. We don't need a king. Of late, out of their tremendous love and respect for me, my countrymen have started calling me King. But no, I reject this honour! Have I not fought against the injustice of the King of England? Why enter into the same ridiculous position? No, it is beneath our country's dignity to follow in the footsteps of England. In England people become scared to death at the very mention of the King's name. They think that to defy the King's authority is the worst possible crime. They are not afraid of bullets and death. They are afraid only of His Majesty's supreme authority, nay, autocracy. Look at the height of their stupendous stupidity! They sincerely believe that their King was chosen by God Himself. As if God has nothing else to do either in Heaven or on earth! And even after touching the highest height of stupidity, still they are not satisfied. They think that to disobey the King is to disobey God. O Almighty One, if You have time, forgive their stupidity. If You have more time, illumine their minds so that they do not fall helplessly into the sea of stupidity any more. The King is a man, a mortal like me. He can never be infallible. Why worship a king who is as prone to committing mistakes as any other ordinary human being?</p>
<p><em>(Enter Thomas Jefferson.)</em></p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> Sir, I have brought your song. I do hope that you will be satisfied with my tune.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> I am sure you have done a good job. Jefferson, I have two more names for you: excellence and perfection.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> I shall eternally remain grateful to you for offering me these two most precious names. But it is you alone who are entitled to these names: excellence and perfection.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> All right, let us share our excellence and perfection.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> That is a splendid idea. Let us do that. Now, here is your song.</p>
<p><em>(Thomas Jefferson sings, accompanying himself on the violin. Then, he and George Washington sing together.)</em></p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> Dear Jefferson!</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> Sir Washington!</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> All-where your wings of capacity fly.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> You are the sun-vast pride of your banner high.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> You are our America's peerless brain.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> You freed us from bondage-chain.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> In your mind is our country's vision-light.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> Your shoulders, our country's mission-height.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> You have told us no more dark night.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> You have given us nectar-delight.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> Marvellous!</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> Now, let me teach it to you.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> You know that God has not granted me a singing voice.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> Sir, I do not subscribe to your conviction. Unless you have tried, how can you know? Please sing with me. I am sure you will also excel in music, as you excel in everything else.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> Helpless, I am surrendering to your clever and inescapable encouragement. Let me try. Teach me how to sing.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> I am teaching you with great pleasure and honour.</p>
<p><em>(Thomas Jefferson and George Washington sing together. Washington carries the tune perfectly.)</em></p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> You see, sir, I was right.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> You were an inventor. Today, you have become a discoverer-the discoverer of a singer in me.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> Let us each sing our respective lines.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> That is a nice idea. Let us do that. <em>(They sing.)</em> All glory to you, Jefferson! I was a soldier, but you have turned me into a singer. Look at your capacity-height and my gratitude-light.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> Sir, you are our country's constant pride, in everything that you do and say.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> I thank you, Jefferson, from the depth of my heart. Now, if you don't mind, may I change the subject?</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> Of course. To please you is to please myself.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> If that is so, then right from today I want you and Alexander Hamilton to work together peacefully. I have chosen both of you to be my two strong shoulders. Alas, my shoulders are causing me endless worries.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> Forgive me, sir. I know Hamilton and I are two real culprits. We create constant troubles for you. Sometimes, even when we see and know that the other party is perfectly right, we find it difficult to admit it outwardly. Such is our unpardonable weakness. But, on my part, I shall try my utmost to work with Hamilton peacefully from now on. It was kind of you to bless us by calling us your two shoulders.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> Not mere shoulders, but my giant shoulders. Jefferson, it is you who have written our Declaration of Independence. There you have said something truly precious to my heart and soul. You said that we derive our just powers from the consent of the governed and not otherwise. A gift of immortal glory you have offered to our country. Your matchless mind is all illumination. If you do not come forward and put an end to the constant sad dispute between yourself and Hamilton, who will and who can? It was with great joy and pride that I made you Secretary of State and Hamilton Secretary of the Treasury. Both of you are more than qualified in your respective fields. But alas, I do not know what prevents you two from working together peacefully.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> I am sure you know what prevents us from working together. It is our unlit jealousy. It is our disproportionate sense of supremacy.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> Your diamond sincerity, Jefferson, deserves all my heart's unalloyed admiration. Now, please tell me if I have understood your point of view and Hamilton's point of view. At your journey's start both of you had the same notion: that some people have more wisdom and more honesty than others. Am I correct?</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> Yes, you are perfectly correct.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> But you feel that these wise and honest people are as likely to be found in one class as another, whereas Hamilton thinks these people are more likely to be found among well-educated, well-established and successful men, rather than among the other classes.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> True, sir.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> To me the difference is very small, almost negligible. Both of you are making a mountain out of a molehill. You two can easily reconcile your points of view in the twinkling of an eye, if you want to.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> We know that. But our ego-ignorance still lords it over us.</p>
<p><em>George Washington:</em> Ignorance-life does not become you, especially in your position of responsibility and leadership. So, my dear brother, please try for an immediate reconciliation.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Jefferson:</em> I shall. I give you my word of honour, sir.</p>  <div id="book-navigation-1112324" class="book-navigation">
