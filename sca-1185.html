<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, you do not believe in prayer. You have to consciously pray to God or you can pray to your Master. You can say, "O Master, you know better than I do. I want to make surrender to God. Please give me the capacity." That kind of prayer very few people make. But that is why prayer exists! However, because of their minds, my disciples do not realise that fact. Outwardly you may say, "My Master knows better than I do," but your mind has so many preconceived ideas: "If I do this or if I do that then..." That 'if' has to go away from the mind. When 'if' goes out of the mind, then prayer becomes serious. Otherwise, your prayer will be, "If you do this, then, Master, I will do that." Or you may say, "If you do this, God, then I will do that."</p>
<p>By putting 'if' between you and God, or between you and your Master, or between you and your inner existence, you are ruining all your prayers. But take away 'if' and where is the difference between your heart and God's Will or your Master's will or your soul's will? Absolutely no difference! The heart is always ready to do God's Will, but the mind comes with 'if' . The heart will never put 'if' between itself and God. Only the mind puts it there.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the mind is saying, "God, if I give You one per cent, you have to give me ninety-nine per cent." But again, the same mind can be excellent. On rare occasions, the mind will say, "God, I am ready to give You ninety-nine per cent, but I expect one per cent from You." The highest the mind can give is ninety-nine per cent, but it will never give one hundred per cent. That is because the mind has put the word 'if' into the picture.</p>
<p>When the heart comes, there is no 'if'. The heart will spontaneously say, "God, I will give You one hundred per cent. You do not have to give me even one per cent." The heart is not tricky. The heart knows that God will give everything in return. If a child is very close to his mother, this child will never expect anything from the mother. And whatever he has, even if it is only one cent, he will go and give to his mother. He will not go to the mother and give his one cent and expect a dollar in return, no. His entire possession is that one cent piece. And yet, he will just go and give it to his mother and run away. Then his mother has to call him, "Where are you? Where are you?" After giving his possesion, he is nowhere near his mother. His job is over. That is what the heart does.</p>
<p>The mind is also giving, but while giving, it is watching to see whether the other person is also giving something. The mind will look to see whether your hand is in your pocket to give something in return. The heart does not look. The heart gives and does not expect anything in return.</p>
<p>Everybody's heart is good. Again, God also created the mind. Do you think that God will not transform our minds one day? He created something. If it is something completely useless, will He keep it that way forever? He wants to challenge His own impossibility. Right now, we are saying that it is an impossible task to transform the mind. But God gets tremendous Joy in challenging His Capacities. That is what we do not understand. God's Capacity is limitless, true. But He gets tremendous Joy by challenging Himself. His Infinity is challenging Itself.</p>
<p>We, as humans, do not challenge our capacities. The capacities that we have, we are using for our own purpose. But our will-power is not challenging those capacities. Am I making it clear? Will-power itself is capacity. From my will-power, I have got a certain capacity. But once I have separated capacity from will-power, I do not try to increase my capacity further with the help of my will-power. Why? Because capacity itself has formed some idea that I cannot go beyond this particular limit, or this particular domain. Capacity has formulated its own ideas.</p>
<p>You have to know that will-power can come and challenge this capacity. If the capacity does not want to increase, then will-power cannot do anything because we have separated capacity from will-power. That is the mistake we are making. We have to realise that capacity came from will-power. If capacity surrenders to will-power, then at every moment we can challenge impossibility. We can!</p>  <div id="book-navigation-1171656" class="book-navigation">
