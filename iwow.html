I'm Donna Halper. You never know what you are going to hear on &quot;The Other Hour,&quot; but what you are going to hear tonight is a little bit different and a little bit unique. We have a very, very great person, with whom you are probably familiar if you are into music at all. He's been the spiritual Master of a number of major musicians, and is also a great philosopher and teacher, and a musician himself. Of course, I am talking about Sri Chinmoy, who is our guest in the studio tonight. You can call in and speak with him a little bit later. I think before we do anything else. Sri Chinmoy would you like to play some music for us? I believe this is connected with meditation. Am I correct Guru? Music for meditation.</a></li>

How does it do this? If I were an atheist and I heard that music I don't know if I would think about God, but I know that I would feel very relaxed and peaceful. Would you say that that feeling means being closer to God?</a></li>

To continue on the subject of religion, Guru, there are so many people claiming to be Gurus these days, there are so many people claiming to be Messiahs, claiming to have the right answer.

They are not allowed to eat meat and they pretty much just stay inside and meditate all the time. Is this the kind of life that your disciples live?</a></li>

Is there any difference between the two, or are both just steps along the same way?</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-donna-halper-em-do-you-tell-your-students-how-to-meditate-or-are-they-free-to-choose-for-themselves-the-best-way- mid-1738314"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/iwow-15"><em>Donna Halper:</em> Do you tell your students how to meditate, or are they free to choose for themselves the best way?</a></li>

I can hear people out there saying, &quot;That's great, to sit there and think good thoughts and things like that. But what about when you are in the middle of the material life and everything is going wrong and it has been a bad day at the office and your boss just yelled at you and so forth and so on. How do you get the good thoughts in your mind at a time like that?&quot;</a></li>
<li class="leaf id-em-donna-halper-em-i-think-there-is-a-tremendous-precedent-for-that-if-i-remember-correctly-in-the-bible-it-says-that-the-best-time-to-pray-is-in-the-morning-because-you-start-out-your-day-thinking-about-spiritual-things-and-that-carries-you-through-the-rest-of-the-day-so-what-you-are-saying-is-not-really-very-different-from-what-we-call-western-religion- mid-1738317"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/iwow-18"><em>Donna Halper:</em> I think there is a tremendous precedent for that. If I remember correctly, in the Bible it says that the best time to pray is in the morning, because you start out your day thinking about spiritual things, and that carries you through the rest of the day. So what you are saying is not really very different from what we call Western religion.</a></li>
