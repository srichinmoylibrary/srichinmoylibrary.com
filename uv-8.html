<p>I wish to give a very short talk on simplicity, sincerity and purity. All we need is simplicity. A child is simple; therefore everybody loves the child. All we need is sincerity. A child is sincere; therefore everybody loves the child. All we need is purity. A child is pure; therefore everybody loves the child.</p>
<p>Simplicity, sincerity and purity. On the one hand, these three things we are able to use at any moment in our day-to-day life. On the other hand, they are the most difficult things that we have to achieve. It takes only a few seconds to spell ‘simplicity’, ‘sincerity’ and ‘purity’. Again, these are not mere words. These are not mere ideas or conceptions. They represent three illumining and fulfilling worlds: a world of simplicity, a world of sincerity and a world of purity.</p>
<p>Each individual on earth is running towards his destination. If the runner is simple, he will wear only the basic garments that are necessary. He will not wear something very heavy or expensive to draw the attention of the spectators. If the runner is sincere, then he will run in his own lane. He will not enter into the lanes of others and thus disturb them and create confusion in them. If the runner is pure, then in silence he will conquer the spectators’ hearts. So by being simple, sincere and pure he will run the fastest. Not only will he run the fastest, but while he is running there will come a time when he will feel that the goal itself has been within his easy reach right from the beginning.</p>
<p>Each time an individual becomes simple, he feels an extra amount of peace and joy inside his restless mind. Each time an individual is sincere, he feels that he has gained a considerable portion of the world, of the length and breadth of the world. And each time an individual is pure, he feels that the whole world is not only in him but also for him.</p>
<p>Each human being — no matter how old he is, how mature he is, how developed he is, how intelligent he is — if he wants to have an iota of peace, abiding peace, then he must needs have simplicity, sincerity and purity. These are the three things that are most essential in each individual life and in the collective life.</p>
<p>There are people who are of the opinion that simplicity is almost tantamount to stupidity. A child is simple, yet inside the child’s simplicity some people are apt to see stupidity. But I wish to say that simplicity and stupidity are like North Pole and South Pole. One can be as simple as a child and, at the same time, one can have boundless knowledge, light and wisdom. The great philosopher Socrates is a striking example. He was at once simplicity and wisdom. And, in his case, we can see something more. He was not only a man of simplicity, but also a man of inner sincerity and inner purity.</p>
<p>It happened once that a friend of his invited a palmist to read Socrates’ palm. While examining Socrates’ hand the palmist said, “I have never seen such a bad man! He is full of such undivine qualities. This man has impurity flowing through him like anything.”</p>
<p>Socrates’ friend became furious and said, “It can never be!” But Socrates replied, “Wait, my friend. I am sure the palmist has something more to say.” The palmist said, “Yes, I have something more to say. All these undivine things that I am seeing are under his perfect control. The evil forces that I noticed have not manifested and will not be able to manifest in and through him. Socrates has the wisdom-power to keep them under perfect control like an animal that is tamed by the master.”</p>
<p>Each human being wants satisfaction. Satisfaction in life can come only by acquiring some knowledge, more knowledge, abundant knowledge, infinite knowledge. In order to achieve infinite knowledge, we have to become students. Socrates, a great philosopher, a man of boundless wisdom, said, “I would like to become an eternal student.” A child is a student. A child’s life is the life of a student. A child feels at every moment that he has something new to learn and to become. A child grows; he opens his heart’s door to the world-knowledge. And each time he learns something he feels there is something more he has to learn. A new sun has to dawn in his life.</p>
<p>All those who are working at the United Nations or working for the United Nations are serving the United Nations individually and collectively according to their capacities. But if we want to increase this capacity, either in the physical world, the vital world, the mental world or the psychic world, then we all have to feel that we are students, that we are children.</p>
<p>The United Nations is at once the body and the soul of God’s unique Vision. Those of us who serve the body and the soul of God’s Vision will be blessed divinely, supremely, unreservedly and infinitely — but only when we feel the necessity of seeing in ourselves a child’s heart, feeling in ourselves a child’s life. The dreamer in us is a child. He dreams of God’s infinite Peace, Light and Bliss. And today’s dream-life of his will tomorrow grow into reality-experience and reality-satisfaction.</p>
<p>The more we feel the necessity of simplicity, sincerity and purity, the more we become perfect instruments — not only of the nations that we represent, but also of the Almighty, whom we represent here on earth. Let us become simple. Let us become sincere. Let us become pure. If we can become simple, sincere and pure, then not only will the dreams that we treasure for our own countries soon be fulfilled, but also all the dreams that the Almighty has for His own Manifestation will be manifested in and through us. Not only our dreams for our own countries, but also the dreams for Manifestation that God has, in and through us will be manifested. At that time we shall grow into His Reality-Satisfaction and Reality-Perfection.</p>
<p>Simplicity, sincerity, purity: right now they are our most faithful, devoted instruments which will help us reach the ultimate Goal. There will come a day when we see that the Goal of the transcendental Heights is smiling in and through these three faithful and devoted friends of ours. And in this transcendental Smile we will see and feel that we are not mere mortals subjected to ignorance-life, but rather we are part and parcel of Infinity’s Light, Eternity’s Love andImmortality’s all-embracing, all-illumining and all-fulfilling Oneness.</p>
