  <h1 id="page-title">The doctor&#039;s diagnosis</h1><span property="dc:title" content="The doctor&#039;s diagnosis" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was an excellent Ayurvedic doctor who lived in a particular village. This doctor was very generous. He frequently treated poor people for free. He had a student who aspired to be like him in every way. This student said to the Ayurvedic doctor, "If I study devotedly and seriously, will I not eventually become a good doctor like you?"</p>
<p>The doctor said, "You can study, but I cannot say what the result will be. It is very difficult to become a really good doctor. I will try my best to teach you." This young boy went on studying with the doctor and learning from him very devotedly. One day the doctor went to visit a rich patient. By this time the doctor had become well known. The student accompanied the doctor as his assistant. Before giving the patient any medicine, the doctor felt his pulse and said, "How can I cure you? You are not taking me seriously."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" said the patient.</p>
<p>The doctor said, "I can clearly see that you are eating sugar cane. It is inside your blood. Did I not forbid you to touch sugar cane?"</p>
<p>The patient was astounded that the doctor had this kind of capacity. He said, "In the future I promise I shall always listen to you. I will not take anything other than what you say. I shall not take sugar cane any more. Please cure me."</p>
<p>Then the doctor said, "I shall be able to cure you before long if you obey me implicitly."</p>
<p>The rich patient agreed, and the doctor and his assistant returned home. The young man said, "I did not know you were so great! How could you tell by taking the pulse that he had eaten sugar cane? It is a miracle!"</p>
<p>The doctor said, "You fool! There was no miracle involved. I saw a few pieces of dried sugar cane under his bed. Then I was absolutely sure that he had secretly eaten some. Otherwise, how is it possible to know from the pulse whether someone has taken sugar cane or not?"</p>
<p>A few days later, the doctor was supposed to pay a visit to another patient. This patient was also extremely wealthy. Unfortunately, the doctor himself was sick on that day. He tried his best to get up out of his sickbed, but it was too much for him. He had all kinds of problems and ailments. By this time, the young man had learned a considerable amount. He was eager to go and cure the rich man. The doctor said, "You do not even have to diagnose his problem. I know what he is suffering from. I am giving you medicine. You will not need to do anything else. Just go and give him the medicine and make enquiries whether he has developed any new symptoms."</p>
<p>The young man went to see the patient and said, "The doctor has given me some medicine for you, but before that, let me feel your pulse. I have to give him a fair report."</p>
<p>He felt the rich man's pulse and said, "I can clearly see that you have gobbled frogs!"</p>
<p>The rich man said, "What? I have eaten frogs? How dare you accuse me of such a thing!" The patient happened to be very strong and he delivered six blows one after another to the young student. Everybody in the household was shocked. They kept repeating, "How can there be frogs in the blood? What does it mean?"</p>
<p>The poor student came back to the doctor's house, very badly injured from the rich man's blows. The old doctor said, "What has happened? What has happened?"</p>
<p>The student said, "Right after taking his pulse, I said to him that he had gobbled frogs."</p>
<p>The old doctor was horrified. "What did you say?" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>The young student continued, "The other day you told me how you were able to deduce that the patient had eaten sugar cane. Today, while examining the patient, I saw one tiny frog under his bed. So, very confidently, I told him that he had gobbled frogs. The patient got furious, and I received a volley of blows. Now this is my fate!"</p>
<p>This is how deception is eventually exposed. The first deception was successful, but the second deception did not succeed, and the perpetrator was dealt a severe punishment!</p>  <div id="book-navigation-1112414" class="book-navigation">
