<li class="leaf question-i-think-that-one-should-not-try-to-imitate-the-laws-of-nature-inasmuch-as-each-one-has-his-own-nature-which-is-more-important-to-him-we-cannot-imitate-a-tree-the-tree-does-not-have-to-know-that-it-is-a-tree-to-be-a-tree-a-man-has-to-know-that-he-is-a-man-to-be-a-man-we-have-to-be-conscious-but-the-tree-is-not-required-to-be-conscious- mid-1725954"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/ecmh-266">Question: I think that one should not try to imitate the laws of nature, inasmuch as each one has his own nature which is more important to him. We cannot imitate a tree. The tree does not have to know that it is a tree to be a tree. A man has to know that he is a man to be a man. We have to be conscious, but the tree is not required to be conscious.</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-we-try-to-live-the-spiritual-life-and-then-we-feel-that-the-forces-of-the-world-seem-to-act-apart-from-us-and-try-to-drag-us-down-when-we-give-in-to-those-forces-something-happens-and-then-we-lose-our-contact-with-the-divine-we-get-mixed-up-with-the-things-of-the-world-we-have-desires-passions-and-we-ask-god-for-material-things-then-when-we-try-to-go-back-to-the-spiritual-life-we-find-that-we-do-not-deserve-it- mid-1725955"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/ecmh-267">Question: We try to live the spiritual life and then we feel that the forces of the world seem to act apart from us and try to drag us down. When we give in to those forces, something happens and then we lose our contact with the Divine. We get mixed up with the things of the world. We have desires, passions, and we ask God for material things. Then when we try to go back to the spiritual life, we find that we do not deserve it.</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-how-do-you-find-a-guru-this-is-all-new-for-me-in-this-life-idle-urge-is-already-there-but-how-does-one-know- mid-1725956"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/ecmh-268">Question: How do you find a Guru?

Joshua was Moses’ disciple. I see also in Indian books that there is always a disciple who starts a line of followers. Is this spiritual chain a necessary part of the manifestation?</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-this-state-or-condition-of-complete-surrender-is-not-easily-obtained-on-the-other-hand-you-cannot-obtain-liberation-until-first-you-reach-the-condition-of-complete-surrender-however-we-find-out-that-we-cannot-reach-that-goal-unless-we-bypass-the-limitations-and-self-consciousness-of-the-limited-mind-be-it-in-the-sphere-of-the-personality-or-elsewhere-to-by-pass-that-self-consciousness-we-find-that-we-cannot-do-so-by-the-development-of-the-intellect-or-by-the-development-of-the-reasoning-power-because-this-condition-transcends-the-sphere-of-both-of-the-intellect-and-the-reasoning-power-and-there-is-a-difficulty-here-because-to-attain-this-condition-you-cannot-be-consciously-immersed-in-life-s-problems-i-mean-to-say-we-cannot-be-attached-or-chained-by-those-problems- mid-1725958"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/ecmh-270">Question: This state or condition of complete surrender is not easily obtained. On the other hand, you cannot obtain liberation until first you reach the condition of complete surrender. However we find out that we cannot reach that Goal unless we bypass the limitations and self-consciousness of the limited mind, be it in the sphere of the personality or elsewhere. To by-pass that self-consciousness, we find that we cannot do so by the development of the intellect or by the development of the reasoning power because this condition transcends the sphere of both, of the intellect and the reasoning power. And there is a difficulty here because to attain this condition you cannot be consciously immersed in life’s problems. I mean to say, we cannot be attached or chained by those problems.</a></li>
<li class="leaf question-i-cannot-see-anything-created-by-god-as-imperfect-how-can-he-create-a-soul-that-is-not-perfect-and-then-say-alright-you-go-ahead-in-your-own-free-way-develop-the-best-you-can- mid-1725959"><a href="http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/ecmh-271">Question: I cannot see anything created by God as imperfect.

I mean, can he stay in a state of joy?</a></li>

I mean . . . does the spiritual life mean that you have to give up what you happen to be doing at the time, say, being an interior decorator?</a></li>

This self-consciousness will limit you in the world of plurality, differentiation and phenomena. Now, this is what we want to transcend because we are searching for that oneness of the Absolute. If we are searching for that oneness, where all differentiation ends and where you will integrate with the universal consciousness, you must try to pull away from these forces that will limit you in the sphere of personality or the ego, that will give you a distorted view of what humanity is, of what the purpose of life is and many causes of differentiation. You are dealing with phenomena that takes place in space and time. But you are not dealing with true values, the eternal values of the real Self. What I mean to say is that when I say that you have to transcend that self-consciousness, it is that you have to destroy this consciousness of the individuality as the &quot;I&quot; or the personality as the &quot;I.&quot; You will have to live in a broader consciousness, in a broader vision, otherwise you cannot attain that goal. To reach that goal, we need the Master because the Master will be like a catalytic agent who will bring up those forces that are hidden in the inner Self so that they will flow into view.</a></li>
