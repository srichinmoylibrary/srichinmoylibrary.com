<p>This morning during our 24-hour race at Francis Lewis High School, people were bothering me while I was walking along the track. One man stood in my way and said, "Are you running 24 hours?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He said, "Crazy! They are crazy people!"</p>
<p>Then ten minutes later he came back to me and asked, "This is a meditation group?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>Then he asked, "Are you connected with the meditation group?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>I thought the conversation was over, but a few minutes later he came back to me again and asked, "Are you the teacher?"</p>
<p>When I said, "Yes," he started trembling.</p>
<p>Then he said, "I am going to a class taught by one of your students. His spiritual name I don't remember, but his American name is Jeremy. He is very tall. I like his teaching very much. But right now I am in trouble. Can you help me?"</p>
<p>I said, "What kind of trouble?"</p>
<p>He said, "Just before I joined his class, I ordered Edgar Cayce's tapes. Now they have come, but I have not listened to any of them yet. I wonder if I should listen to the tapes or continue with the classes."</p>
<p>I told him, "Continue with the classes and at the same time listen to the tapes. Then make your choice. If my teachings give you more joy, then continue with the classes. But if Edgar Cayce's tapes give you more joy, then follow his path."</p>
<p>The man said, "Such nice advice! Thank you."</p>

<p>Three or four important runners have said that in order to increase your stride you have to practise running down a very gradual hill for about 400 metres. We have found a gradual 300 metre hill on Union Turnpike and Baoul has marked the hill with 55-inch stride marks.</p>
<p>I was practising 100-metre intervals there, since Baoul had not yet put the marks for the second and third 100 metres. Baoul said, "Larry and his mother live somewhere near here." Two minutes later a bus stopped and who came out of the bus? Larry's mother, Susan! They live on the same side of the street that Baoul had put the stride marks on. She was so happy that I was practising in front of her house, and she stood outside watching me. At one point she was waiting for me to run by, expecting that I would continue. But I was leaving in the car, and we passed by her.</p>

<p>While I was running in Flushing Meadow Park, one of the boys on the road crew was driving behind me. Three girls who were visiting from other Centres were in the back seat — X, Y and Z — and W was asleep in the very back</p>
<p>A middle-aged man came out of his car and said to me, "What do you think you are — a very important person?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, I don't think so."</p>
<p>Then I ran 200 metres. When I came back he again came up to me and asked, "Why do you need so many bodyguards, especially girls?" He didn't see W because W was still sleeping. He saw only the three girls. The man was smiling and joking with me.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday, when I was coming back after having run seven miles, Pranika was running nearby. After running seven miles, I was walking the last 20 or 30 metres. An old man who looked about 70 saw me running, and then he saw me stop. He said to me, "Keep it up, keep it up!"</p>

<p>The race counted on the honour system. Otherwise, in five or six places you could have taken a shortcut.</p>
<p>The first mile, according to Pahar, I did in under eight minutes. But then the second mile was slower because at least twenty times I had to run through puddles.</p>

<p>I started running our recent marathon in Zurich before the other runners. Then I stopped during the race for fifteen minutes so that I could watch everyone run and see the styles of the disciples. Haridas had such a funny style! Even though I stopped, I finished before the first man.</p>
<p>It was difficult to run in the early morning hours. It was totally dark while I was passing through the woods. Three times I fell and both my knees went down to the ground. After the third time I said, "I am not going to fall again," and I was especially cautious.</p>
<p>Projjwal and Benny were going before me. Each one had a flashlight. Occasionally Kailash was able to come with the car and shine the headlights on the course.</p>
<p>Several times I was dying for something to drink, but Kailash could not come because the car could not drive on the course. Two or three times Shikha came running 600 metres into the woods to help me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The friendly dog</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The friendly dog" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This morning I ran three and a half miles and then I walked one mile. I started out down 150th Street and turned onto the Grand Central Parkway service road toward Parsons Boulevard. Right from there, a dog started running with me. He would run alongside me for a while, and then he would be inspired to go ahead 200 metres. Then again he would come back and run 30 or 40 metres with me.</p>
<p>The dog had a collar and he was very nice. He would come near me to smell my trousers, but he wouldn't bark. I didn't see any ferocious qualities in him, but a dog is a dog. God only knew what would happen next. When I was running down Parsons Boulevard to Union Turnpike, I saw a car going slowly and making a turn. At about my 1100-metre mark I stopped and stood looking at the car. The driver seemed to be very nice, so I said to him, "This dog is bothering me. Can you help me?"</p>
<p>He said, "Oh yes, I have been seeing that he has been following you. But what can I do?"</p>
<p>I said, "Can you please give me a ride for two blocks so that the dog won't see me?"</p>
<p>He said, "Oh no, I will be stopping in half a block!"</p>
<p>Then the dog went 40 or 50 metres ahead, hoping I would follow. I ran back very fast in the other direction and turned again onto the Grand Central service road. For about 300 or 400 metres I ran on the service road. Then I made a left turn and ran to Union Turnpike again. The dog was not to be seen. I had fooled the dog.</p>
<p>At about my two-mile mark on Union Turnpike, I was on the sidewalk when a car started honking. I said to myself, "What is this? I am doing nothing wrong. Perhaps someone wants to ask me for directions."</p>
<p>When I turned around, what did I see? The same car and the same man to whom I had spoken earlier. He said to me, "Mister, I feel very sorry that I didn't give you a ride when you asked me. Please come with me."</p>
<p>I said, "I thank you for your offer, but no thank you."</p>
<p>He was a nice looking man. His conscience was hurting him, so he wanted to compensate. After that I walked half a mile and then turned around and started running back.</p>
<p>So these kinds of experiences I get no matter what hour of the day I go running. Always there will be some obstruction. Most of the time my road crew follows me in the car; but when I go alone, I always have wonderful experiences!</p>

<p>When I was coming back, I saw Karabi the Great running. What did I do? I immediately looked at my wristwatch to see what time it was. I wanted to see if Karabi could have run that far if she had started after her six o'clock morning meditation. I wanted to catch her to see if she had missed meditation to go running.</p>

<p>This time when I ran the Jersey Shore Marathon, every quarter mile Pavaka would come running to indicate the mark. After about five and a quarter miles, God knows if the place he indicated was actually the right distance. But at the third quarter of that mile he was at least 40 metres behind the 1200-metre mark. Then, when I was about to complete the mile, he came and stood right on the line.</p>

<p>This morning in Tokyo I ran for an hour and a half. On the way out I made four turns. I tried to remember two or three landmarks at each turn — the light, the telephone pole and so forth. Then, out of three things if I forgot one, no harm. In that way I wouldn't get lost.</p>
<p>Coming back, at one point I made a wrong turn. Instead of getting lost, I discovered that that way brought me back to the hotel sooner. If I had followed my planned route, I would have made the turn two or three minutes later.</p>
<p>Even at five o'clock in the morning there were so many people running! People in Japan love to run.</p>
