Is there some special advice you have for people who don&#039;t have access to their Inner Pilot?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Inner Pilot is for everybody, but how many people sincerely want to find Him? People who sincerely want to find their Inner Pilot will definitely succeed, but it takes many, many years of practice. I have practised meditation for many, many years in this incarnation and also in past incarnations. To get a Master's degree, you have to study for 17 or 18 years. The inner study, which will take us to the Transcendental Consciousness, is also like that. For many, many, many years you have to concentrate and pray and meditate. It is like sowing a seed. When we sow a seed, immediately it does not become a tree. It takes months and years. First it becomes a sapling and only gradually does it grow into a giant banyan tree that will last for many years.</p>
<p>If we start praying and meditating today, we may not immediately have access to the Inner Pilot. But just as the seed grows into a tree, our prayers climb up, up, up and eventually reach the Highest. Then the Highest immediately gives us the capacity to feel its Presence in the depths of our heart. It takes time, but if we start praying and meditating, definitely we will become aware of our Inner Pilot and get a free access to Him.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To discover one's Inner Pilot and to become one with Him is more difficult than God-realisation. It comes long after God-realisation is achieved.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a tree in front of us which has a delicious fruit. It is difficult to climb up the tree to where the fruit is and get the fruit; but there is also another thing you can do. That is to say, after getting the fruit, you can climb down the tree and share it with others who are waiting at the bottom of the tree. There are many levels in achieving something in the spiritual world. As you can climb up a tree and bring down the delicious fruit and share it with others, you can go deep inside your heart to bring forward peace, love and joy and share these qualities with others. This is what I do when I meditate.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Running is a symbolic sport in the sense that it reminds us of spiritual seekers continuously running towards the goal; it resembles the seekers running inwardly to achieve the ultimate goal in meditation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Japan is a country filled with infinite beauty. It has an image of a beautiful flower garden. This beauty is expressed through inner peace. Man has seen many things, but of these things peace is new. Japan is offering this new treasure to the world.</p>
<p>Japan has some other very special capacities to offer. Japan produces such small, beautiful things. God is infinite and finite — larger than the largest and smaller than the smallest. He is both the ocean and the drop. He is inside me as a human being and, again, He is inside the vast sky and ocean. In Japan I see God the Creator in His small aspect, but at the same time, so beautiful and powerful. Here I see the finite expressing the Beauty and Divinity of God in such a powerful way, and I am deeply impressed. It is like the difference between seeing a child do something and a grown-up do it. When the child does it, I get much more joy. In Japan's case, the child is Japan's childlike flower-consciousness — a beautiful flower is reaching the highest in terms of beauty and purity. As soon as I think of Japan, my mind feels beauty, my heart feels purity and my life feels humility. I could write hundreds and hundreds of poems about Japan. In fact, I have already written them in the depths of my gratitude-heart.</p>
<p>During this trip I feel that I received more than I offered. I tried to give a little peace to the hearts of my Japanese brothers and sisters, and they gave me their love — which is so deep and profound. I am grateful to you for asking me such wonderful and important questions today.</p>
