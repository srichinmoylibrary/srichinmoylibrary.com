<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some of the planets are in perfect harmony with one another. Some of them are friendly. Others fight like anything. They don’t want other planets to enter into their territory. When one planet starts building, then another planet comes and ruins everything.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When two planets are not on good terms, when they are fighting, the earth consciousness usually changes for the worse. The inhabitants of earth don’t know why, but they are unexpectedly unhappy or depressed or frustrated.</p>
<p>When the year ends, the earth usually passes through a dark tunnel. It is all depression, frustration. Then, when the new year comes, it brings a new light. Definitely the planets have something to do with it.</p>
<p>Some good planets want the seekers to make fast progress in the new year which is on the earthly calendar. Other planets don’t want this. Human progress in no way can threaten the planets or take away any of their glory. Still, some don’t want to become one with the earth-consciousness. They don’t want human beings to make progress and become fulfilled.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It can take physical form. But the only thing is, with this gross physical we can’t go to these worlds. The soul can take physical form, but the physical cannot take subtle form. You, as an individual can take any form, but your body will not be able to take the soul’s form.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They did. They used flimsy planes, like the Japanese planes during wartime. It started in the Ramayana era. There were very few planes, only two or three. They didn’t have petrol or gasoline. But they knew how to control the life force, life energy, with occult power. They used consolidated energy; it was tangible, not fluid. It was energy you could grip, energy in solid form. But you had to know how to use this energy. I used to do it in my previous incarnations. When I did it the first time, it was such magic. You won’t believe it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the individual. Each spiritual Master has a special world of his own, a well-protected world. Naturally, his close disciples will be together there. They do go and enter into their relatives and close friends for God-manifestation. Also, they watch which souls are going to take human incarnation. So they do participate. There is no end to their work. They are all the time offering good will to mankind — this way, that way, here, there.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are not always serious. If every second we only do serious things, we can be neither in Heaven nor on earth. Most of the time we do serious things. If you want to make a comparison between silly and serious things, then I must say that our amusement is nothing in comparison to the serious things that we do. Here also, I am talking to you for three or four hours. But the rest of the time I am doing serious things. Again, I know how many things I am doing right now. You people can also do several things at a time if you just develop your capacity. You can do it with the power of concentration in the inner world.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In your case, most of the time when you come up you have two problems. One is shyness. You feel that if you make a fast movement, if you just grab the prasad and go, then everybody will appreciate your fast movement. You have heard that some people don’t leave me soon enough after I give them prasad, so when you come near me, you get a kind of shyness. Then, a stupid guilty consciousness comes. Fear comes and you try to cover that fear. Sometimes you give me a smile; sometimes you just run away from me so that the thief will not be caught red-handed. You look at my face and run away. I say, “For God’s sake,” but what can I do? Some people, when they come to me, they give me all their frustration and all their lower forces.</p>
<p>One question you people have not asked. It has happened that, on my birthday, for example, the whole day somebody is praying to God. His mind is very pure. Then, when that person comes to me for prasad, immediately wrong forces, lower forces, will attack. He comes with the hope that Guru will be very pleased. All day he was absolutely pure. But when he comes to me, wrong forces attack and he feels, “Master is seeing how bad I am,” and he feels miserable. Here the answer is, don’t associate with those forces. All day you have prayed and meditated, so just feel that this is a golden opportunity: “Master has seen everything. Now out of his compassion, he won’t allow these forces to remain in me.”</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The only wrong thing was accepting others’ suggestions as to whether you should go to a doctor or not. Because doubt had entered into you, because this other force had entered, I had to put a special force on your foot. Otherwise, it would have gone its natural course. It is like a patient. The patient is getting well in a natural, normal way, but then the patient does something more undivine, so the divine doctor gives him a more powerful dose of medicine.</p>
