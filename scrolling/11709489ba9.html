  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Then what happens to the country? Does it take a new soul, or does it evolve in a different way altogether?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Then what happens to the country? Does it take a new soul, or does it evolve in a different way altogether?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It has happened that the souls of some countries want to reincarnate in a human form and the Supreme sanctions their wish. When the country-soul enters into a human body, at that time the Supreme creates a new soul and puts it into that country.</p>
<p>Some mighty souls who were previously country-souls have become very famous, world-famous, when they have taken a human body, because of the gratitude that was offered to them. The soul may have received tremendous affection, love, gratitude and worship, unconsciously, let us say, from the human beings living in that country. Perhaps some patriots and revolutionaries worshipped their country. In India they sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Janani janmabhumishcha swargadapi gariyasi</em> — “Mother and Motherland are superior to Heaven itself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the revolutionaries and patriots love their country like a human being, if they admire, adore and worship their land as a tangible reality, then the aspiration, the devotion that the soul gets from those human beings can be of great help when the soul takes a human body. This has happened in the case of some souls of countries who have become kings, emperors and other world figures. Again, they may be very bad after becoming kings and emperors in future incarnations because their body, vital and mind may not be totally aspiring. That has also happened. While they were country-souls, the souls were able to manifest their divinity; but when they took human form, the darkness and ignorance that the human body cherishes stood in the way of the soul. In such cases the soul finds it extremely difficult to manifest the divine light on earth.</p>

Can the soul also be cute or sweet?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul embodies all types of divinity, so inside the soul’s divinity one may feel cuteness or sweetness. But although the soul embodies all the divine qualities, and sweetness or cuteness may be present, we cannot say this soul is sweet, that soul is cute and so on. All the souls are divine. Inside their divinity it is we who try to see sweetness and cuteness. We say, “This child is cute, that child is sweet,” but our perception is on the physical or mental level. It is not like that in the soul’s realm. We cannot put a human being and the soul on the same footing. The reality of the soul is on a totally different plane.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the soul has not completed its task, it may continue in the next incarnation. Again, the soul may feel that it is not necessary to complete the task; it may want to take up another vocation, to enter into another line. Let us say in a previous incarnation a soul took a certain body and became a doctor, but then as a doctor it felt it had not finished its job; it had not learned everything. If it still has the desire, it may continue as a doctor in its next incarnation. Again, one may become frustrated as a doctor in this incarnation; one may feel it is enough. In that case, one does not have to complete the journey in the next incarnation. One may wish to be something else, to pursue a totally different career. Either the soul may continue in the same line and allow the body, vital and mind to strive for greater perfection, or the soul may think it is not necessary. The soul may say, “I do not want to have perfection in that line or satisfaction from that career; I want to change my career altogether.” It is up to the soul’s will to continue or to discontinue.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does the soul ever inhabit two bodies simultaneously or have parallel lives?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does the soul ever inhabit two bodies simultaneously or have parallel lives?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul is one. Within each body resides one soul. The soul has the capacity, if it wants to, to take a portion of itself out of that body and be in two different bodies simultaneously, but only for a short time. This is a rare occurrence. The soul does not like that game, because although going out of the body is easy, coming back each time is difficult. The body may be very impure, very undivine; the vital may be very aggressive, very destructive. In that case, it is difficult for the soul to come back to the body. So, the soul can be in two bodies if it wants to be. A portion of the soul may be in a second body. But the main portion of the soul has to be always in one particular body.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the connection between the inner sun and the soul?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the connection between the inner sun and the soul?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They are two totally different things. The inner sun signifies illumination. Spiritual Masters can have many, many inner suns. One individual can also have many inner suns. Sri Ramakrishna once said a particular person, who was a great spiritual leader, had only one sun, but Vivekananda, his Naren, had eighteen suns. Again, Vivekananda had only one soul. A person can have only one soul, but he can have many, many inner suns — one, ten, twenty or more. Ordinary people have one or two, but highly advanced souls can have three or four. Then again, spiritual Masters, according to their height, can have many inner suns. But there is still only one soul. Vivekananda had eighteen inner suns; unfortunately or fortunately, I have many more. One inner sun is enough to illumine a large number of people and many, many countries.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When you are fat and you lose weight, is that any help to the soul?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When you are fat and you lose weight, is that any help to the soul?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Losing weight does help the soul, because the mind becomes clear. When one loses weight, when the body becomes light, the mind does not have that heavy pressure. Again, many spiritual Masters of the highest order were unimaginably, unbelievably fat. India’s Troilanga Swami was one of those. Again, some were thinner than the thinnest. In terms of physical fatness, the Jain Master Mahavira and the Lord Buddha were also not thin. God-realisation does not depend on physical fitness or fatness. But, to be perfectly frank, if you are fit and not fat, it helps the mind considerably to start decreasing its normal train of thoughts. At that time the mind does not become jealous or impure. In this way, physical fitness does help the mind, and if the mind becomes clear, the mind is likely to listen to the soul, which it often does not do when it is clouded.</p>
<p>So, to come back to your question, it helps to lighten the mind by losing weight. Again, I am telling you that fatness has nothing to do with the soul, but it has to do with the physical proper, the mind and vital. If the vital and mind are under control, then it is infinitely easier to realise the soul. Physical fitness has nothing to do with the soul, but physical fitness can help the mind. If the mind is in a better frame of consciousness, then definitely the mind can be of tremendous help to the soul. The heart is always eager to be of service to the soul, always. But one day the mind tries to be of service to the soul, and then it may take weeks, months or years for the mind once again to be of any service to the soul.</p>
