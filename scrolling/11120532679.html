<p>Some 60-year-olds are more energetic than 35 or 45-year-olds. I saw a very fat 75 or 80-year-old man practising the high jump alone. Each time he was about to jump, I got a heart attack. Twice he fell on the mats. Once his right leg crossed the bar but his left leg was under the bar. I thought that a serious accident would take place. But no, each time after he fell, he stood up and gave me a smile. Such adamantine will he had! The height he was jumping was quite negligible, but he was so happy that he could jump at his age.</p>
<p>For 75 and 80-year-olds to do the pole vault, hurdles and hammer throw is really something! They were not carried away by the weight of the hammer. They were strong, strong people, with strong bodiesand strong minds. Everything about them was strong!</p>

<p>There were quite a few former Olympians at the Masters Games. Another 10 or 15 per cent were not Olympians but were previously national champions. So the standard was quite high.</p>
<p>One former Olympic hurdler from California said nice things to me at least seven or eight times. He is a poet and he told me that he had read some of my poetry books. Sometimes he would see me three times in the interval of four hours, and each time he would stop and say something nice and smile. What nice people!</p>

<p>Mr. Mikio Oda, the Japanese man who visited our Centre in San Juan, failed miserably in the 1920 Olympics. Then, in the following Olympics, he was first. His event was the hop, skip and jump. He was quite short, but he gave all the credit to his ankles. He had strengthened his ankles like anything. He was the Japanese national champion, but he was very, very humble and modest. He told us that he never gives talks about his event or about his Olympic experiences, but he was kind enough to speak at our Centre. He said this was because my simplicity had touched his heart.</p>

<p>The other day I was running on Union Turnpike at my three-and-a-half-mile point when I saw Dhananjaya on his bicycle. How fast he was riding! He was so happy to see me that he called out to me, "Hello, Guru!" But before I could open my mouth, he was gone. With bullet speed he was riding although there were so many cars!</p>

<p>Last Friday, when I was running on Union Turnpike, I saw a police car pulling a trailer with horses inside. I was amused because for the first time I was seeing a police car pulling horses. The horses were not facing me; they were facing the police car. They were very smart horses.</p>

<p>This evening at a quarter to seven, as I was going to the tennis court, I saw an elderly lady walking a big dog behind Jamaica High School. The dog was on a leash so I was not at all afraid of it.</p>
<p>The lady said to me, "Hi! Good evening."</p>
<p>I said, "Good evening."</p>
<p>She said, "Do you recognise me?"</p>
<p>I couldn't recognise her.</p>
<p>Then she said, "You can't recognise me? I know your name — Sri Chinmoy." She said my name correctly.</p>
<p>I smiled at her and said, "Now tell me what your name is."</p>
<p>She said, "Shame!"</p>
<p>What was I going to tell her? She knew my name, but I didn't know her name. I have never seen her, but she knew me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Good morning, Sri Chinmoy</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Good morning, Sri Chinmoy" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>On the way to Flushing Meadow Park today, I was walking toward Main Street. After my 1200-metre mark, a bearded young man in a van saw me as I was waiting for the red light. He had the green light in his favour but he waited, allowing me to cross.</p>
<p>I was looking at him and he was looking at me. Then he said, "Good morning, Sri Chinmoy. It is so nice to see you again."</p>
<p>God knows when I had seen him before!</p>

<p>After being greeted by the man in the van, I made a left turn. At the Kew Motor Inn, two water pipes had broken, and there was a flood, so I had to take a detour. At the one-mile mark also the water was knee-deep. I had to turn one block before that.</p>
<p>But that was not enough adventure for one morning. Before I reached two miles, a Puerto Rican man in a car stopped and said, "Hi! How can I get to the Triboro."</p>
<p>I smiled and said, "I don't know how to get there."</p>
<p>He said, "The hell with you!" and drove away very fast.</p>
<p>Just a mile before that, somebody saw me and was so happy! His morning started with such joy because he saw me. Then a mile later I ruined somebody else's joy.</p>

<p>Today, the day of the U. N. Peace Run, I walked over 22 miles. From my house I walked to Flushing Meadow Park on a particular course which is five miles. Then I walked two miles on our Flushing Meadow "Runners Are Smilers" course. After that I took a little rest.</p>
<p>Then, for the first and last time, I walked along Queens Boulevard into Manhattan to the U.N. It is very bad to walk that way into Manhattan. There were so many undivine things, but the noise of the cars was the worst. It killed me. Why did I have to listen to so much noise? I took an oath that it would be the last time.</p>

<p>There were three cars following me while I was walking on Queens Boulevard. Pranika was following me to give me drinks. In another car, Databir was driving Jason, my masseur. Niriha and Chetana were in the third car, videotaping. In spite of the fact that three cars were following me, at one point I got lost.</p>
<p>Chetana told me I had to cross the 59th Street Bridge and then turn right. But on Queens Boulevard there is a small bridge before the 59th Street Bridge. So after I crossed this bridge I thought I had crossed the 59th Street Bridge. I didn't see any of the three cars following me, so instead of continuing straight, I turned right. Nobody saw that I was going the wrong way. Because of that wrong turn, I started going back toward Jackson Heights. I was totally lost, and there was nobody to give me directions.</p>

<p>Finally I saw an old man walking. I asked him if this was the right way to get to Manhattan. I had gone astray, but he brought me back to the right path. We became friends.</p>
<p>Then he became very undivine and started criticising everything. He felt the world was very bad, everything was very bad. He was not interested in anything. He was very happy to see that I was walking, because he hated running.</p>
<p>The man said to me, "Only insane people walk in the street. Always walk inside the park where there are very few people."</p>
<p>At one point he said to me, "Are you injured?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He asked, "How?"</p>
<p>I said, "From running."</p>
<p>He said, "So now you are wise. You are walking."</p>
<p>He did not want me to run anymore. He said, "Only fools run. You and I are wise."</p>
<p>I smiled at him, and just then we saw a young man with a headband, running very fast. When he ran by me, he said, "Hi, Sri! You are here!"</p>
<p>The man said to me, "Your name is Sri?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, my name is Sri."</p>
<p>He said, "Who is he?"</p>
<p>I said, "I don't know."</p>
<p>Look at this! Only a minute earlier, the old man had said that only fools run. Then a runner came to greet me.</p>

<p>The other day I was running near the outdoor flea market on the corner of Parsons Boulevard and Union Turnpike. Some young boys were playing near the street. One of them stopped playing and came running towards me. He folded his hands and called out, "Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>Only two hours before that, in the Queens shopping mall, someone else had stood in front of me and folded his hands when I was there shopping.</p>

<p>Then, two houses before Niriha's house, a man called me by name and asked, "How is your tennis going?"</p>

<p>A few days ago in Connecticut a boy was running, when someone came up to him and smashed his head with a hammer and stole his wristwatch. The boy was admitted to the hospital in a coma. The doctors gave up hope even before the operation.</p>
<p>But after a day or two he came out of his coma, and the first thing he did was to write down "Sri Chinmoy" and then "Love and Serve."</p>
<p>His mother went to Love and Serve restaurant today and told the disciples how grateful she is to me. She felt that I had done something for her son inwardly. Her son had been to Love and Serve a few times, but he had never seen me.</p>

<p>Three days ago I was walking, and X and Y were following me in the car. I was near my two-and-a-half-mile mark on Main Street — in the middle of a big intersection — when a young man stopped his car abruptly and got out. He said, "O Guru, I am one of your new disciples!"</p>
<p>Master and disciple were in the middle of a big intersection — with cars this side and that side.</p>
<p>I asked, "What is your name?"</p>
<p>He said, "Michael. I am in the Blue Centre." He was so happy to see me; he was jumping with joy.</p>
<p>He said, "Yesterday I was at the tennis court."</p>
<p>The night before, new disciples had been invited to the tennis court.</p>
