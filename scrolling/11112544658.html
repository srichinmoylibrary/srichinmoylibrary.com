  <h2 id="page-title">My Japanese companion</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My Japanese companion" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My first evening in Greece I went out to run. It seems that taxi drivers and car owners there are insane, especially at night. How badly they drive!</p>
<p>At every moment you are at their mercy, even in the park. I don't know how, but they manage to drive right into the park itself. There is no street or anything; far from it. But they drive right into the park, and so speedily. Then they leave their cars there while they go to a party or some place. And we are trying to run there!</p>
<p>Inside the park an old Japanese man — very short, very skinny — started following me as I was running. I thought I was shorter than the shortest, but he was practically at my shoulder. And he was very old.</p>
<p>With such affection, such affection, he started running with me. Then we started talking. He told me all about his running experiences. I was very happy.</p>
<p>He was about 70 years old and he said he had come all the way from Japan for the marathon.</p>
<p>He was staying at the same hotel that I was. There were quite a few Japanese staying there. They all had come to run.</p>
<p>The following day also we ran together. I always make complaints about my strides, but his strides were shorter than mine. I ran two miles with him, very slowly.</p>
<p>I saw him once more after the marathon. He took seven hours and fifteen or twenty minutes. He was so delighted that he had completed it. Who would not be proud of him!</p>

<p>Later that day, which was the day before the marathon, I took a cab and went to the marathon starting point. I was disappointed, frightened, to say the least, when I saw the whole course.</p>
<p>I said, "Since I came all the way, best thing is to die on the battlefield."</p>
<p>But when you are in the car, the battlefield is not a real battlefield. Only when you start running, when you are on the ground, is it a real battlefield.</p>
<p>When I saw it in the car, I still had a little hope that I would be able to manage it. Secretly I had a little hope that I would be able to finish it. O God, the actual day was something else!</p>

<p>About ten minutes before the race, my Cleveland friend all of a sudden came up to me. He didn't say hello or anything; he just grabbed my hand and started shaking my hand.</p>
<p>He is a far better runner; I was so honoured.</p>
<p>Then he started giving me advice. He said, "You have to drink a lot, drink a lot."</p>
<p>It was so hot — really very, very hot. Everybody had told me that the weather would be very cold. But no, it was really hot.</p>
<p>So my Cleveland friend said, "Drink a lot, drink a lot; otherwise, you won't be able to make it."</p>
<p>My Philadelphia friend — God knows where he was! But he would appear very soon.</p>

<p>They started the race at least two minutes early. Believe me, my New York time I always keep perfect, and I had got the New York time transferred into Greek time. But they started at least two minutes early.</p>
<p>Many people were surprised. They were just chatting and all of a sudden they heard a sound: "Boom!" Many people were murmuring, "It is not time, it is not time." But we ran.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The loop</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The loop" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>After two miles there was a loop that brought you back again to the main road. Look at their divine stupidity! Instead of making the loop cross the main road further up, they brought it back so it overlapped the first part of the route.</p>
<p>Some were running at a five-minute pace, and others were running at a 13-minute pace. So the fast runners who were finishing the loop were blocked by the slow runners who hadn't reached the loop. They could not go fast because we were blocking the way. I felt sorry for them.</p>
<p>After two miles I saw my Cleveland friend. I was only 200 or 300 metres inside the loop, and he was completing it. He was practically 1,200 metres ahead of me. He had made the loop, but he was being blocked by the slow runners. He was almost furious. I don't know, but his face was not normal at that time. Even then, when he saw me he waved. I was so grateful to him.</p>
<p>Now the fool in me — I don't know how or why — also started running fast. When it was three miles, my time was under 21 minutes. I said, "Is it possible?"</p>
<p>When I completed the loop, I looked back and, O God, there were so many people behind me — hundreds of people. At that time all my pride came to the fore! "I am a great runner, because so many people are behind me." I thought some had not even come to the loop. "I am completing three miles and, God knows, still they haven't completed two miles." And at least 300 or 400 were way ahead; God knows where they were.</p>
<p>But I felt sorry for the excellent runners, because they had to cross through the bad runners like us. We were disturbing them on the way.</p>

<p>As soon as I reached five and a half miles, I saw the first hill. For at least 1,200 metres it went up. It was not yet six miles, so still I had strength.</p>
<p>The next 200 metres were not downhill but flat, and then again it went up for practically half a mile. Next it went down — this time not even for 100 metres — and again up.</p>
<p>Like this, when I came to nine miles, I felt miserable. I said, "What am I going to do?" Luckily, at that time it went downhill for about 800 metres. I was so delighted, so happy; at last there was an oasis in the desert.</p>
<p>O God, after 800 metres it went up again.</p>
<p>From five and a half it started, and for the next fourteen miles it was only hills. And you won't believe me, but there were no downhills. At most it would be flat for 100 or 200 metres and then it went up, up, up. There were three hills that were at least, <em>at least</em>, one mile long.</p>
<p>People were cursing and dying.</p>
<p>One young man was lying right on the street — not on the sidewalk but right on the street — massaging his knee and saying, "Never in this lifetime will I run again." Terrible! Terrible!</p>

<p>Some were running fifty metres and walking fifty metres. You won't believe it, but three elderly men walked faster than I could run. I was running — "Huh, huh!" — and they were walking, but my running was not as good as their walking.</p>
<p>One of them was mischievous enough to laugh at me. He was laughing at me because I was running and he was beating me while walking. But after two miles I saw him; he had become so tired that he went to drink ERG or water, and he did not appear for a long time.</p>

<p>There were runners poorer than me. I felt sorry for them. And the people who were going ahead of me, I was admiring like anything. No jealousy, absolutely none! I was adoring them. It was an impossible task they were performing.</p>
<p>Sometimes old people — at least ten or fifteen years older than me — were going ahead of me. There was no competitive spirit on my part; only my admiration was coming forward. "These people are older than me and look how they are doing." They had such short strides — about half the length of my strides — but quick, quick, quick.</p>

<p>One man was running with his wife. Every fifty metres she stopped and twisted herself. She bent down, touched her toes and did all kinds of stretching exercises. Then for fifty metres she would run again. Each time I would pass her while she was stretching, but when they ran they caught up with me. When they ran, they ran fast. This went on. Finally they stopped or fell behind me.</p>

<p>I didn't have the capacity to go ahead of him, and I didn't want to decrease the little speed that I had. So I said, "No, let me go at my own pace."</p>
<p>For about three miles, he went on making that noise. Then afterwards he disappeared. He didn't go ahead of me; perhaps he stopped running.</p>

<p>At about eleven miles, I heard somebody screaming my name. It was my Philadelphia friend. He knew my name, Ghose, and had remembered it. He was inside the bus that was carrying the dying soldiers, and he was waving at me. He had won his "victory".</p>
<p>After eighteen miles there was another bus. All together, there were two or three buses carrying those who had dropped out. Another bus invited me to enter, but I said, "No! It is better to die."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The chorus</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The chorus" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>At eighteen miles my first attack came: my hamstring revolted.</p>
<p>When it was twenty-one miles, out of the blue, five songs I heard all at once. It was absolutely a chorus; the music was on! How can I get five cramps at a time? The pain was excruciating. I was helpless, flat, dead! Some of the disciples were helping me. One of them was seated and, with a sponge, was pressing my leg with cold water, while another was pushing my toes forward. How hard, how quickly, the first one was massaging me! And afterwards, four or five times he did it again. Even now it frightens me when I think of the pain — excruciating!</p>
<p>After that experience I started walking. Slower than the slowest, a quarter mile I walked. Again the pain, so again I walked.</p>
<p>Running is forbidden now. Just walk, walk as slowly as possible. When it was twenty-three miles, another new friend came — right here in the neck. I couldn't breathe in; neither nostril was functioning.</p>
<p>O God, this was really unbearable! With the previous pain, at least I was able to breathe in, so I felt that there was something going on. But when it started in this muscle, I was not able to breathe even. Too much, too much!</p>
<p>Some people — I think, nurses — came up, but we didn't take their help. I said, "I have got my help."</p>
<p>When it was twenty-five miles, a strong desire arose: "Oh, let me run at least the last mile." It was a desire, nothing else. As soon as I tried, all the cramps said to me, "Where are you going? We are still alive." Such pain!</p>
<p>I thought 800 metres, 400 metres, 100 metres I would run. Finally, when it was only twenty metres, the officials were asking me to run. I tried, but I knew if I had run, I would have dropped right there and fainted, so I just dragged myself. I wasn't even walking — just dragging my body. Anyway, I managed to finish.</p>

<p>The management of the race was far from perfection. Sometimes the water stations were on the right side of the street, sometimes they were on the left side. It didn't bother me, because my disciples were supplying me with ERG. But others I saw. Sometimes they were running on this side of the street and they had to cross to the other side.</p>
<p>And a horrible thing! They allowed the vehicles to run along the same route. After eleven miles it was so difficult to run. When we had only six miles left, we had to run in the city of Athens. There it was infinitely worse.</p>
<p>You are running this way when, all of a sudden, from the side street cars will enter. Policemen hold the runners and let the cars pass. Here we are dying to reach the destination one minute sooner, and the policeman will say: "Stop!"</p>

<p>After I finished, I waited around for practically an hour. I was enjoying watching the people coming in after me. I thought that I was one of the most unfortunate runners, but people kept coming in.</p>
<p>One man who came in was a rogue. He was about sixty. He came in quite fresh and did three somersaults. He was so happy.</p>
<p>He was jumping — one, two, three. Most of the people didn't believe that he had run the whole course. His number was missing, but he said that he had the number. God knows!</p>

<p>This morning I left about a quarter to four to go running. I ran a few blocks without gloves or a hat. After 500 or 600 metres, I was absolutely frozen to death. I went back home and got my gloves and hat, and then I went out again to run. How difficult to run in such cold!</p>
