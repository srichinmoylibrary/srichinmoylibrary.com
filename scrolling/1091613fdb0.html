  <h2 id="page-title">The Spiritual Overdose</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Spiritual Overdose" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A Hindu family and a Muslim family were very close to each other. A daughter from the Hindu family was in love with a son from the Muslim family. Usually it is frowned upon for Hindus and Muslims to marry. But some broad-minded people allow this. World-famous leaders who are Hindu or Muslim often say that the two faiths are one, but when their dearest ones want to marry someone from the other religion, usually they are one hundred per cent against it.</p>
<p>The members of the Hindu family came forward with an excellent suggestion: "Because our children are such close friends, our daughter can study the Koran and your son can study the Bhagavad Gita. In this way each will become familiar with the other's religion, and they will be able to live together peacefully."</p>
<p>The Hindu daughter began to study the Koran, but without actually paying any attention. The Muslim son began to study the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads and other Hindu scriptures. He was studying very sincerely and this was giving him tremendous joy. While reading the spiritual books and thinking of the Vedic seers, he was deeply moved. He said to himself, "I want to be a spiritual person. I do not want to get married. I do not want to be entangled by earthly affairs and family life."</p>
<p>One morning, the Hindu daughter was crying and crying. Her father asked, "What is wrong? Did you quarrel with your future husband?"</p>
<p>"No, no, no!" she replied.</p>
<p>"Then why are you crying?"</p>
<p>"Father, you have given him an overdose!" she said. "At your suggestion, he studied our Hindu scriptures so seriously that now he says he does not want to marry me. He has decided to dedicate his life to God." She was crying inconsolably and added, "In my case, I was not paying any attention while studying the Muslim sacred books. I was only interested in having him as my husband."</p>
<p>We have no idea at what point God's Hour will strike for someone to turn towards God. Sometimes we start with curiosity. But God may want us to go beyond curiosity. Here is the proof. At first the Muslim son was curious to see what the Hindu scriptures had to offer him. He got so much inspiration from the sacred books that he wanted only to be absorbed in prayer and meditation. He went farther and deeper, and found, in the Hindu religion, the message of renunciation. He renounced his future wife and he renounced the world. He said, "I want to give my life to God."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Useless Yoga Teacher And The Useless Priest</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Useless Yoga Teacher And The Useless Priest" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day a yoga teacher came to a priest and said, "Father, Father, forgive me."</p>
<p>The priest said, "What have you done? What kind of sin have you committed?"</p>
<p>The lady said, "Father, I am a yoga teacher. I studied yoga in the Hindu way, and then I also started teaching people yoga, and joined a Hindu Master. This Master had students from all faiths — Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Can you imagine! We were always taught that there is only one God. For this Master, there are so many gods. I had to pray to the founders of all faiths."</p>
<p>The priest asked, "Did the Master tell you to pray to the founders of all faiths?"</p>
<p>"He did not say that directly but implied it, because he has students from all faiths. Yet Christ said, 'I am the Way. I am the Goal.' I have made such a serious blunder and committed such a terrible sin by leaving Christianity."</p>
<p>The priest said, "All right. I forgive you, but do not commit this kind of sin again."</p>
<p>How useless both the yoga teacher and the priest were! The priest was telling the teacher to stick to her Christianity and not to commit this sin again. Is it a sin to have a universal heart that sees truth and goodness at the core of all faiths?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Devoured By His Own Message</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Devoured By His Own Message" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Ten thousand years ago, there was a church that had not been painted for many years. It did not look nice at all. The priest decided to have the church painted, so he asked the painter, "How much will it cost to paint the entire church?"</p>
<p>The painter answered, "It will take me quite a few hours, practically all day to paint the whole church. Father, I would like to have only seventy dollars."</p>
<p>The priest said, "All right. Seventy dollars I am giving you, but you have to buy the paint also."</p>
<p>"I have to buy the paint also?" asked the painter.</p>
<p>"Yes. But the next time I give a sermon, I will pay very special attention to you. You will easily be able to go to Heaven because I will clear your path."</p>
<p>The painter was very pleased. He bought a very small quantity of paint, diluted it with lots of water, and started painting the church.</p>
<p>After half an hour, there was a thunderstorm, and it rained very heavily. The rain washed away everything. Then the priest got mad. He said to the painter, "Why did you have to paint now? Did you not know that there would be a storm?"</p>
<p>The painter answered, "How could I know? I am only a painter."</p>
<p>The priest said, "I am not going to give you any more money. With the money that I already gave you, you have to paint the entire church."</p>
<p>The poor fellow said, "All right. What can I do?"</p>
<p>The priest answered, "I am reminding you again that if you do a very good job, I will bring you very special blessings from Heaven. You will become prosperous."</p>
<p>The painter said, "All right! I am so happy that I will become prosperous."</p>
<p>The man bought new paint, but this time he did not dilute it. He was doing a very good job of painting the church. Unfortunately, the church was so big that he could not cover even one-eighth of the church with the paint he had bought.</p>
<p>The priest saw what was happening and exclaimed, "You are such a rogue! I gave you seventy dollars. Perhaps you are planning on telling me that you could not finish your work, so that tomorrow again you will have to paint. In this way, you will take several days to paint. Then every day I will have to give you seventy dollars. I know that is what you are planning. But I am not going to give you any more money. With the seventy dollars that I already gave you, you have to paint the whole church! Otherwise, I will not pay any attention to you. I will not bring anything from Heaven for you."</p>
<p>The poor man had already spent all the money on paint. This paint was only enough to cover a small part of the church. The painter said, "What am I going to do? I have no money. To please the priest, I have worked so hard for one full day. Tomorrow will be my second day, and the priest will not give me any more money."</p>
<p>That night the painter was praying to God. He said, "God, save me! Save me!"</p>
<p>God said, "I will save you. Do not worry."</p>
<p>The following day, the painter was returning to paint the church. While walking to the church, he saw a bundle of money. He picked up the bundle and counted three thousand dollars in cash. The painter looked around here and there to see if he could spot the person who had lost the money. He said to himself, "I must not take so much cash. Somebody has lost this money. Let me go to the police station."</p>
<p>Before he reached the police station, he thought, "Let me go first and give the priest the very good news. The church is near the police station, and the priest will be so happy that I have found so much money. I will tell the priest that I am going to hand over all the money to the police and let them take care of it."</p>
<p>The painter went to the priest and told him what had happened. The priest said, "You fool! Last night you prayed to God. That is why God gave you the money. Why do you have to give the money to the police?"</p>
<p>He said, "I prayed to God to save me, but then God gave me so much money! How can I keep this money? It is not mine. If it had been a few dollars, I could have taken it. But three thousand dollars I cannot keep. The person who has lost this money will feel miserable."</p>
<p>"That may be true, but how can you trust the police?" the priest replied. "How do you know that the police will give the money back to the person who lost it? If you go to the police station, the policemen can easily keep it for themselves."</p>
<p>The priest added, "The best thing to do is to put the money on the altar. Tomorrow God will illumine us. God will tell us what to do with the money."</p>
<p>The painter agreed and put all the money on the altar. Then he asked, "But what about painting the church?"</p>
<p>The priest said, "You do not need to paint today. Please come back tomorrow to paint." Then the painter and the priest both went home.</p>
<p>The following day, the painter came to the church and saw that the priest was not there. Alas, there was no money on the altar! The painter was telling everyone, "The priest has stolen the three thousand dollars that he told me to put on the altar!"</p>
<p>The priest was not to be found anywhere. Several days later, he appeared. Everyone asked him what had happened to the money. The priest said, "I have not taken the money! I left the money on the altar while the painter was watching. The following morning when I came back to the church, the money was gone! That is why I was so shocked and miserable! How can people come to God's House and steal money? No, I have not taken the money. This money has been stolen by someone else!"</p>
<p>The painter felt so sad and mad at what the priest was doing. Not only did he steal the money, but now he was very nicely trying to cover everything up.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the priest's nephew came in and whispered something to his uncle.</p>
<p>"What are you whispering?" asked the painter. "Can you not tell me?"</p>
<p>The innocent boy said, "My uncle, the priest, is so kind to me. He has given me so much money! I am telling him how grateful I am to him."</p>
<p>The painter said, "I am going to tell the police everything that has happened. I am definitely not going to paint the church. People say that God is inside everybody's heart. I will have to find God inside my heart and not inside this church!"</p>
<p>Many people steal money. But they are usually ordinary people, not priests. Priests are supposed to save us from our sins. We go to priests to talk about forgiveness, about truth and about God. Ordinary people can do anything, but we do not expect priests to act like that. Perhaps the priest spoke so much about sin, that he became a victim to it. The priest was devoured by his own message of sin!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Many Ways To Pray</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Many Ways To Pray" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There are so many ways to pray to God.</p>
<p>One day three spiritual seekers were chatting together. One seeker said, "I pray to God with folded hands. When I fold my hands, I feel that God is really listening to me."</p>
<p>The second seeker said, "That does not work for me. In my case, my prayer works only when I kneel down. When I kneel down and pray with folded hands, then God listens. Otherwise, when I pray standing, or seated with folded hands, God does not pay any attention."</p>
<p>The third seeker added, "The way you two are praying may be correct for you, but it is definitely not right for me. God listens to my prayers only when I lie down and prostrate myself in front of the altar with my hands folded and my face flat on the ground."</p>
<p>While the spiritual seekers were chatting, a man from the phone company came to fix the telephone. The repairman overheard their conversation and said, "You people are praying in your own way, but my way is far better."</p>
<p>The seekers laughed at the man. They thought to themselves, "What does a silly repairman know?"</p>
<p>The man began explaining how he liked to pray. "One day I climbed up a telephone pole. All of a sudden, my neck got entangled and I was hanging with my legs up in the air and my head facing downwards. It was only a matter of seconds before I would fall and break my head and back. At that time, I screamed, 'Lord! Lord! Save me! Save me!' Immediately someone from above pulled me up, I got my balance and then came down. So my way of praying is the best way."</p>
<p>An old man who was the grandfather of one of the seekers had been listening to everything. He came forward and said, "You people are all well-educated. You are fighting over which way is the best way to pray: with folded hands, kneeling down, lying down prostrated before the altar or even hanging by your feet. You people are all useless! Do you not know the true meaning of prayer?"</p>
<p>One of the seekers said with much sarcasm, "Yes, we do know. If you want, we can teach you how to pray. You are so old that by now you have forgotten how to pray!"</p>
<p>The old man became furious. He said, "Listen to me! All of you are praying to God, 'Give me this! Give me that!' You are judging how effective your prayer is by how much you get from God after you pray. That prayer is not true prayer. From now on, when you pray, only search for God — for God's Truth, God's Light, God's Peace and God's Grace. Real prayer is to search for God, and not to beg from God."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Be Careful Whom You Make Fun Of</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Be Careful Whom You Make Fun Of" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A little boy was a student in primary school. One day he arrived at school just a little bit late. When he reached his classroom, his teacher said to him, "Tommy, Tommy, why do you come to class without combing your hair? You look so untidy. I could say many other things, but untidy is the only thing I will say right now."</p>
<p>The students all started laughing. The teacher asked the little boy, "Do you not have a comb?"</p>
<p>He said, "No! I do not."</p>
<p>"Then why did you not borrow one from your father?" she asked.</p>
<p>He answered, "No hair!"</p>
<p>Immediately, all the children in the classroom burst out laughing, because the boy's father had no hair. They all started taunting the boy because his father was bald. They were repeating over and over, "You have a bald-headed father! You have a bald-headed father! Your father is bald, bald, bald!"</p>
<p>The teacher was saying, "Keep quiet! Keep quiet!" But the children were not listening to her at all. It took fifteen minutes for the teacher to bring the students under control. They were all laughing very loudly, and she could not teach them a thing.</p>
<p>Tommy went home. He was very sad and disturbed that his classmates had all made such fun of him because his father was bald. Tommy told his mother everything, and she got furious. That night, Tommy's father came home late from work. When he heard what had happened, he also got furious. Both Tommy's mother and father wanted to go to the school and insult the teacher together.</p>
<p>Then the father said to his wife, "Let me go alone. I will go and badly insult the teacher myself. It is better for you to remain at home, as you may complicate everything. "</p>
<p>The mother asked, "If she does not allow you to come into the room, what will you do?"</p>
<p>He replied, "Do I care? I am so strong!"</p>
<p>The father went to the classroom, and he started screaming at the teacher for having insulted his son so badly the previous day. The teacher immediately phoned the main office to send the guard to her classroom. The guard, who was very large and strong, came and locked the father's arms behind his back.</p>
<p>The father continued screaming at the teacher, "Yesterday my son was ridiculed by his classmates because of you. I hold you fully responsible!"</p>
<p>The teacher responded, "It is all your fault. You parents do not teach your son the proper way to dress or to take care of himself. I can see that it is all your wife's fault that he does not even comb his hair."</p>
<p>The father became even more furious. "Now you are insulting my wife!" he fumed. When Tommy saw how angry at the teacher his father was, he went up and started pinching her. Then all of the students joined Tommy. The children all started pinching the teacher and making fun of her.</p>
<p>The teacher was shocked! She said, "Children, how is it possible that just yesterday you were making fun of this boy? You were teasing him because his father has no hair. Now you have joined him and his father in harassing me!"</p>
<p>How easily children can change! That day, all the children fully sympathised with the little boy and took his side, even though they had ridiculed him the previous day. That is why they pinched the teacher and made fun of her. The children said to the teacher, "You are the culprit! Why did you ask him to comb his hair? If you had not asked him to comb his hair, nothing would have happened!"</p>
<p>The teacher came to learn that she must not allow the children to make fun of anyone; otherwise, she might be the one to be made fun of next. One must be very careful when dealing with children.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">God Came Thrice</h2><span property="dc:title" content="God Came Thrice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once there was a tailor who was very, very old. One day he was praying and speaking to God. He said, "Some people say You are in Heaven. Some people say You are on earth. Some people say You are both in Heaven and on earth. In my case, I believe that You are both in Heaven and on earth. Because I will die soon, I wish to see You in both places. I am afraid I will depart from this earth without seeing You. I also have no idea whether or not I will even be able to see You in Heaven. I am praying for You to come and visit me just once while I am here on earth."</p>
<p>The tailor continued, "Lord, I have been an honest tailor. I have always charged people less than the actual price, and they are very grateful to me. I have done many good things. Lord, I beg of You, will you not come and see me, only once, before I die?"</p>
<p>The tailor heard an Inner Voice telling him, "Tomorrow I shall come and visit you."</p>
<p>The old man was thrilled. He continued praying and praying to God. Early the next morning, the man went to his shop. He was tailoring many things. The whole time, he was hoping that God would come to visit him.</p>
<p>An hour later, an old lady came to the tailor. She was very sad. She said, "The children are all stealing the mangoes from my tree. I cannot do anything by myself to stop them. Will you please come and help me?"</p>
<p>The tailor said, "I am an old man. Will the children listen to me?"</p>
<p>The old lady answered, "You are a man. Whether you are old or not, it will really help if you come."</p>
<p>The tailor said, "All right. I will go. But I will not be able to scold the children. They will laugh at me. I will advise them that stealing is not a good thing.'"</p>
<p>The tailor accompanied the old lady and spoke to the children. There were five or six boys. He said, "Stealing is not good. If you steal, one day you will be caught. Then you will be punished. It is better not to steal. If you want to have a few mangoes, I am sure the owner will give you a few. Please do not steal."</p>
<p>There was some magic touch in the tailor's voice. The children said, "We will not steal any more." They even returned to the old lady all the mangoes that they had stolen earlier.</p>
<p>The old lady was very pleased and gave back a few mangoes to each boy. She said to the tailor, "Now you should get a mango!"</p>
<p>He replied, "Oh, no, I should not receive a mango for such a little help. Furthermore, I do not care for mangoes."</p>
<p>The old lady was very grateful to the tailor. He was very happy.</p>
<p>The old man went back to his shop and started tailoring again. Then a young girl came into his shop and said, "My father is very, very sick. He has got fever and he is vomiting. I am just a little girl, and I do not know what to do for my father. I do not even know where the doctor is. Can you help me?"</p>
<p>The old man said, "Yes, I know where the doctor is. I will make sure that he comes to take care of your father." The old man went to the doctor's office and brought something for the daughter to give to her father. The tailor saw that the father was, indeed, very sick. He could also see that the father was very poor. So the old man gave the father some money to pay for the doctor's fees.</p>
<p>Then the tailor came back and started doing his work once again. Most devotedly, he was tailoring. A very, very old lady came and said to the tailor, "I will soon die."</p>
<p>The tailor replied, "Why do you have to worry? We will all die one day. You will see God in Heaven."</p>
<p>"I will see God in Heaven?" moaned the old lady, with total disbelief in her voice.</p>
<p>The tailor immediately said, "You do not believe in God? Go away from my shop if you do not believe in God!"</p>
<p>"I will believe in God only when someone gives me the money to buy my coffin before I die."</p>
<p>The old man said, "You want to buy your coffin? All right. I will take you to the place where you can select the coffin; I will buy it for you. Then will you believe in God?"</p>
<p>The old lady answered, "Certainly! I will believe in God if you buy me the coffin I select. Once I die, my relatives will use the coffin that I have chosen."</p>
<p>The tailor went with the old lady to the shop and bought the coffin she selected. Then he returned to his shop once again. He said, "What have I done? What have I done? First I went out to help the lady whose mangoes were being stolen. Then I went to help the little girl find a doctor for her father. Finally, I went to buy a coffin for the old lady. Since You always keep Your promise, I am sure you came here while I was gone."</p>
<p>The old man's Inner Voice said, "I am so grateful to you and so proud of you. I came to you in the form of the lady whose mangoes were being stolen. I came to you in the form of the little girl whose father was dying. I came to you in the form of the old lady who was desperately in need of a coffin. I told you that I would come and see you once today. Instead, I came to you three times, and three times you have pleased Me far beyond your imagination."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Short-Lived Matrimony</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Short-Lived Matrimony" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A wedding was taking place between a groom who was 45 years old and his bride who was only 20 years old. The relatives on the groom's side were extremely happy that he was getting such a young and beautiful bride. But the relatives on the bride's side were miserable, because there was such a large difference in their ages.</p>
<p>The bride loved her husband-to-be very, very much. She said, "Who cares for age? I am 20 years old and he is 45. But I love him dearly and he loves me dearly."</p>
<p>The marriage ceremony had just begun. Soon the priest would pronounce the groom and his bride to be husband and wife. A very close friend of the groom was also present at the wedding. He was an excellent humorist; everyone enjoyed this man's humour.</p>
<p>Just as the wedding ceremony was over, the humorist-friend whispered something into his friend's ear. He said, "You are so lucky that when you are 90, twice your current age, your wife will only be 40, which is double her present age. At age 90, you will have such a young and beautiful wife!" The groom smiled broadly.</p>
<p>The bride was very curious and anxious to know what the humorist was whispering. She thought, "Perhaps my husband's humorist-friend is whispering something very nice!"</p>
<p>The friend said, "If you do not mind, I can tell you what I just whispered to your husband. I said to him that he is now 45 years old. If you double his age, he will be 90; and if you double your age, you will be 40. This is a very large difference — 50 years. People will wonder how a 40-year-old woman can have a 90-year-old man as her husband!"</p>
<p>"What? What are you saying?" the girl exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I am just saying that if you double your ages, your husband will be 90 years old when you are only 40."</p>
<p>"He will be 90 years old and I will only be 40? At that age, he will not be able to help me in the slightest! I will have to take care of him when he is 90 years old? Now he is 45 and has money, property and so many valuable things. When he is much older, he will not be able to earn anything, and I will have to support him all by myself! Oh, no, I am not going to do that! Let us cancel the marriage immediately."</p>
<p>So the marriage ended because the young bride did not want to take care of her husband when he was 90 years old! The marriage lasted only for a few hours!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Heart And Life Of Mother Teresa</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Heart And Life Of Mother Teresa" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One time when Mother Teresa was in America, she went to visit Mayor Koch of New York City. Mayor Koch was unwell, so she went to inquire about his health. It was a very hot day. Mayor Koch offered Mother Teresa lemonade and a few cookies. He drank and ate his share very quickly and then noticed that Mother Teresa had not even touched her drink or her cookies. He invited her to start eating.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa said, "I cannot eat. I cannot drink."</p>
<p>Mayor Koch asked, "Why?"</p>
<p>She replied, "In my poor Calcutta, there are many people who would have to pay their whole week's salary just to buy lemonade and cookies."</p>
<p>"But these cookies are the best in the whole world!" exclaimed Mayor Koch.</p>
<p>She replied, "All right, because they are the best, please wrap them up, and I will take them to Calcutta."</p>
<p>The Mayor said, "I shall definitely wrap them for you, but you do not have to take them to Calcutta. It is quite far and when you reach Calcutta, the cookies will no longer be in good condition. There are so many poor people in Harlem. Would you instead like to go to Harlem with the cookies?"</p>
<p>She answered, "That is a splendid idea. I am taking the cookies to Harlem. On principle, I do not eat at others' places. When I am about to eat, I see the faces of the hungry children of Calcutta. I am their Mother. How can I enjoy a delicious meal when my poor children are starving?"</p>
<p>This is, indeed, the heart and life of Mother Teresa.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A Great Pianist Performs On Short Notice</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A Great Pianist Performs On Short Notice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a great pianist. Everybody appreciated and admired his soul-stirring performances. One day, the leaders of a well-known cultural society met to plan their fiftieth anniversary celebration. They decided to invite the pianist to give a concert for the occasion. Unfortunately, they decided too late. As it was just one day before the anniversary, they were afraid of asking him. He was such a great pianist. How could he possibly accept their invitation on such short notice? They felt miserable at the idea of inviting him at the eleventh hour. A friend of theirs, who was also a friend of the pianist, took up the challenge. He said, "Although it is so late, I will be able to arrange for him to perform for us. He is my dear friend."</p>
<p>The leaders of the society said, "We will be so grateful if you can bring your pianist-friend. We are all afraid of inviting him at the eleventh hour."</p>
<p>The friend said, "Do not worry. I will be able to bring the pianist."</p>
<p>This friend went to the great pianist and asked, "Will you do me a great favour?"</p>
<p>The pianist said, "You are my true friend, and you need a favour. Is there anything I will not do for you? If it is within my capacity, I will definitely do it."</p>
<p>The friend said, "I do not know if it is within your capacity or not, but I am a little embarrassed and quite hesitant to ask you for this special favour."</p>
<p>The pianist replied, "Please ask me. I will definitely grant you this favour."</p>
<p>He said, "My friends and I at our society would be extremely grateful if you could give a performance tomorrow. I took up the challenge to bring you to our event, at extremely short notice, and now I do not know whether I will be successful or not."</p>
<p>The pianist started laughing and laughing. "You are my dear friend. Will I not do you this favour? When it comes to friends, there is no 'short notice.' I will play any time. For others, I am not going to perform on such short notice. In your case, my friend, you can ask me to go anywhere, anytime. I have been practising for nine hours a day every day for the past 35 years, so I am always ready."</p>
<p>The friend said, "How I wish I had your determination!"</p>
<p>The pianist laughed and laughed. He said, "Determination is not my monopoly. God has given everyone the same determination. Only, in my case, I practise my determination. You do not practise your determination. If you practise every day, determination becomes natural. Because I have used my determination for so many years, it has become second nature to me. By using our determination regularly, we make it totally natural and spontaneous.</p>
<p>"Kindly tell your society that I am definitely accepting their invitation to perform tomorrow. I value my friends more than anything else in my life."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Form Letter</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Form Letter" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a king who was very proud of the ministers, advisers and other top-ranking leaders in his kingdom. In his view, each individual was blessed with a unique and most significant role to play. When one of his ministers or other top leaders had achieved something most extraordinary, the king wrote them a letter to express his appreciation for their great accomplishments.</p>
<p>One day the Minister of Transportation received such a letter of appreciation from the king. This young and promising minister was overjoyed. He had spent three full years working with his staff to construct a new and very strong bridge across a wide and raging river. The people in the kingdom were all admiration for his supreme achievement. He read and re-read his letter, getting more and more joy. He showed it to all his friends, and they were so happy for him.</p>
<p>Only one friend of the minister became jealous and said, "You have done a very good job, no doubt. I am glad you are happy, but I must tell you something important for your own sake. Many other ministers, and even some ordinary citizens, get letters like this from the king. So please, do not gloat over this and do not brag about this to anyone. After all, what you have received is not unique. It is actually just a form letter."</p>
<p>An old and trusted adviser to the king happened to overhear the minister's friend. Immediately, the adviser said to the so-called friend, "You fool, how many people have received such letters? You say that the king sends such letters to everybody. Have you ever received such a letter?"</p>
<p>The king's adviser then said to the minister, "You have done something most extraordinary! The king is extremely, extremely proud of you, and that is why he has written you such a glowing letter of appreciation. Not only the king but every citizen of the kingdom who cares for our progress-life is extremely proud of you.</p>
<p>"I am sure you know that our kingdom is very vast and has many, many people. Even if the king has written similar letters of appreciation to two hundred other people, your achievement is still most significant! You are one of a small number of human beings to have received such a letter from the king. It is like a team of volleyball players who have all played well and won their match. Every one of the players is thrilled to have won.</p>
<p>"Suppose you were in the army and you and your friends got the same promotion and got the same stripes to wear. Each of the soldiers takes pride in becoming a lieutenant, because each has made so much progress and has gone up one level. Jealous people will say, 'O so many people got the same thing. Therefore, it is of no value.'</p>
<p>"Similarly, when students get their university degrees, the students and their families are all delighted. Tens of thousands of people get a bachelor's degree every year, but all of those who graduate feel that they have done something truly great to earn a college degree.</p>
<p>"A third person who has not gone to college might say, 'What is so special about getting a bachelor's degree when so many people get degrees every year?' In fact, millions of people in the world are not getting a university degree. If you feel that your achievement is not unique, it is simply not true. For you, it is unique. For each and every person who receives a letter from the king, his achievement is unique. Again, for every individual who earns a university degree or wins a sports victory, his achievement is also unique."</p>
<p>The king's adviser continued, "In our annual soccer tournament, there is always one team that triumphs. Usually one or two players on the team are extremely good, and they contribute the most to the victory of the entire team. All the teammates are thrilled to win. Each and every player is appreciated and admired by everyone in the kingdom. The medal given to the best players on the winning team is exactly the same as the medal presented to all the other players on the team. Just because someone is the best player, does he get a larger medal? No! Does he get a diamond? No. The best player is so proud and so happy that his team won the title match. In fact, he is delighted to share the victory with his teammates, and they are all proud to be on the winning team. They are all amongst the top athletes of the entire kingdom.</p>
<p>"My dear minister-friend, even if you did receive a form letter from the king, I see that he has used the word commitment in his letter to you. Only if someone has achieved something really outstanding, will the king use the word commitment. For people who have not done anything extraordinary, but whom the king simply wants to encourage for one reason or another, there will perhaps be another form letter. Even if hundreds of people are getting a letter similar to yours, in no way does this diminish your stellar achievement.</p>
<p>"How can someone say, 'Because hundreds of players have won the national soccer medal over the years, mine is not valuable,' or, 'Because thousands of people are getting a university degree, mine is useless'?</p>
<p>"Again, in the small town where I grew up, some of the old ladies might hear that you have built a bridge across the river. One of them might casually brag, 'Oh, I could have easily done the same thing if I wanted to!' Then, long before the time came for her to submit the first set of plans for the bridge, she would die of worries and anxieties that something might go wrong!"</p>
<p>The minister was overjoyed. He said to the adviser, "You have wisdom in boundless measure. I must admit that I was saddened and upset by what my friend was saying. I was even starting to doubt the value of my own achievement. What you are telling me now has given me so much joy and pride in what together we have been able to achieve for the kingdom."</p>
<p>The king's adviser said, "I am so happy to be of dedicated service to you. After all, in every field there are people who are coming to the fore. To say that because you received a form letter, it is somehow not valuable, is not correct. Even if two thousand people received the same letter, it is still very significant. After all, there are countless people in the kingdom.</p>
<p>"Let us look at it in another way. I am the head of my family. All of my sons and daughters, plus their own children, come together and eat dinner at our house once a month. My wife and I, our sons and daughters, and all our grandchildren are eating the same food. One of the grandchildren could say, 'If you give my sister the same food as you give me, then I will not eat it.' They do not do this, because they are happy to be together and to be part of our family. Again, there will be millions of people who are not in our family who will not have the same delicious meal as we do.</p>
<p>"In any group, if everyone gets the same thing, in what way does each person's prestige and honour disappear? Your bridge project proved that the secret to success in any endeavour is teamwork. If someone on a sports team does very well, then everyone on the team gets the glory. When a soccer team wins, are the players lined up by how many points each one has scored? No! Because all eleven individuals were playing together as a team, one person was able to score many goals, and the entire team was able to win the game. Alone, will any player be able to fight against eleven players on the other team? When there is teamwork, everyone wins the victory.</p>
<p>"The real glory and the real joy are in belonging to a group. The team that wins the national medal is appreciated, as a group, by the entire kingdom. Why should only one player be appreciated, when the whole team worked together? Yes, the captain receives the prize, but he does so on behalf of all his teammates. All the players proudly stand together when the game is over and happily receive the same award.</p>
<p>"In all of our activities, life is teamwork. I am happy because I am a team member. If one individual says, 'I deserve much more and much better recognition than the rest of my teammates,' then that person must form a group all by himself. Nobody will be there to accompany that individual or to support him. When we are associated with others and part and parcel of a group, we get joy.</p>
<p>"You have just seen from your own experience how people who are jealous and mean-minded try to take away the joy of people who have gained something special. Indeed, you are not the only person to win something, and I am not the only person to win something; but we do deserve what we have won and, therefore, we have every reason to be happy.</p>
<p>"If someone else claims to have achieved the same as I have achieved, what right do I have to belittle that person's accomplishment? Because others have also worked towards the same goal as I have, they also won the prize. Unfortunately, very often the people who have done nothing are the ones who try to take away the joy of the people who have worked very hard. On the strength of our oneness, we have all worked together to achieve something. Together we have worked. Together we will gain the same merit.</p>
<p>"Every achievement is always a group effort. Like you, every minister or top citizen in the kingdom who does something truly outstanding receives a letter from the king. To try to belittle someone's accomplishment by saying that others also have done the same thing is the height of jealousy, meanness and stupidity. When people speak that way, they do not realise they are only creating division. It is only the division-creating mind that is speaking in and through these people. Your friend could not possibly do what you have done, so he tried to take away all your joy. He, and others who act like him, are actually very jealous.</p>
<p>"These jealous people behave as if they are trying to reveal the truth to you by saying that you are not the only one. But the truth is not like that. Truth is not the monopoly of one individual. The real truth is this: You have served the king and all the king's subjects most sincerely, most devotedly and most successfully. You are now part of an elite group of people who have received a wonderful message of appreciation from the king. You can be extremely happy with and extremely proud of your glorious achievement."</p>
<p>The minister said to the king's most trusted adviser, "I am so grateful to you for having illumined me. I shall always aspire to deserve the precious letter offered to me by the king. I shall always work to serve the king and each of his subjects with every breath of my heart."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Distance Between Man And God</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Distance Between Man And God" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a great spiritual Master who was totally genuine. He had a spiritual community or ashram of his own, with about 4000 disciples in total. Every evening, he used to give talks on spirituality which were limited to a few select disciples.</p>
<p>One evening, one of the Master's favourite disciples came late. He was standing at the door, waiting for the Master to grant him permission to enter. As soon as the Master saw him, the Master said, "Come in! You have to answer my question. If you answer correctly, I shall allow you to stay inside. Otherwise, you will have to go out immediately."</p>
<p>The Master was quite serious. He said to the disciple, "Tell me the distance between man and God."</p>
<p>The disciple answered, "Master, why do you have to ask me such a simple question?"</p>
<p>The Master's face became very grave. He said, "What do you mean? If you are so wise, then tell me at once."</p>
<p>The disciple said, "Master, I am telling you now." The disciple came very close to the Master — only one or two inches away from the Master — and said to him, "This is the distance between man and God."</p>
<p>The Master laughed and laughed. All the students also laughed most heartily. The Master said to that disciple, "You are so devoted to me, but you are also the number one humorist in my ashram. I always try to defeat you in humour, but I never succeed. Therefore, I am extremely proud of you."</p>
<p>Everybody was so moved, and everybody was so proud of the disciple for giving him the correct answer immediately.</p>
