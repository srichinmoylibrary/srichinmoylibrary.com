<p>God is my personal experience. In Him is my life's confidence. With me is His assurance in life and death, and beyond time and space. I live for God.

He lives to present me with His all-transcending Vision, to transform my existence into His heavenly Reality.</p>
<p>When I look up into the skies, He is unchangeable. When I look into the world, He is all changing. Backward I look, He is veiled. Forward I look, He is revealed. When I look within, He is never new. When I look without, He is never old.</p>

<p>I have seven eyes. My two normal eyes tell me what I should see around me. My eye in between the eyebrows — a little above — tells me that what I see in the highest region of consciousness I can eventually become. My eye in my heart tells me that mere seeing the Truth is not enough; I have to feel the Truth as my own and I have to feel myself as its very own. My eyes inside my feet tell me that to see is to believe the past, my past, my backward race. My eye inside the crown of my head tells me that to believe is to see the future, my future, my forward race and my Golden All.</p>
