<p>When I was in Madras, I ran twelve miles in the Madras heat. Afterwards, I went to a store to get some soda.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four, five, six sodas I drank one by one. The owner laughed and laughed.</p>
<p>I said to him, "Why are you laughing? You go and run twelve miles!"</p>
<p>He said, "I won't be able to run even half a mile."</p>

<p>Yesterday, around five o'clock, I ran three miles. Two out of the three miles were hill work. After the hill work, I wanted to run one more mile to make three miles.</p>
<p>An old man waiting for the bus saw me and said, "Oh, you look like my friend Harry, only he is taller than you. But you are not running; you are jogging. My friend Harry runs, but you are not running."</p>

<p>The more I practise the slower I become. So I decided to cut down on my distance and only practise speed work.</p>
<p>Today I started my speed work. This morning I was running a very short distance, and in front of C.'s house I saw someone who looked exactly like T.</p>
<p>I said, "T., T., T." three times. Then I said to myself, "It can't be T. If I call him three times, how is it that he won't answer? The strange thing is that he didn't even nod. I came near him and, O God, it was a different person.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My puddle experience</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My puddle experience" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Last winter I ran fourteen miles with four members of my road crew. After four or five miles I said to two of them, "You go ahead and clear the snow." After one hundred metres, one of the two could not keep up with the other, so like a gentleman he slowed down and ran with us.</p>
<p>After five miles, one of the boys running with me became tired and didn't want to run any farther. While I was barking at him, I ran into a puddle. For five or six steps it was so cold! Such agony!</p>
<p>When we completed seven miles, that same disciple said, "Now can we go?" I said to him, "We will take a taxi," but in the back of my mind I knew we would run another seven miles.</p>
<p>Now, one of the boys was wise. He saw a diner. So he said, "I wonder if they have hot chocolate." Three of them stopped and had a hot chocolate, and then we started running again. The disciple who had said he was tired was running behind us. All of a sudden he became inspired and started going ahead. So I barked at him. "Either run fifty metres behind me or ahead." Again, I ran into the same puddle going back the other way.</p>
<p>Two or three miles later I saw that disciple and another of the disciples. They had taken off their jackets and left them on the street. People didn't care for their jackets, so they picked them up on the way back.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Editor&#039;s preface to the first edition</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Editor&#039;s preface to the first edition" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Sri Chinmoy's interest in running dates back to his youth. At the ashram, or spiritual community, where he lived from the ages of 12 to 32, he was the top-ranked sprinter and, for two consecutive years, decathlon champion. It wasn't until the fall of 1978, however, that he first became interested in long-distance running. Since then, he has pursued the sport with the same one-pointed intensity that he has brought to his various literary, artistic and musical pursuits. For Sri Chinmoy, running — like writing, painting and composing — is nothing but an expression of his inner cry for ever-greater perfection: perfection in the inner world and perfection in the outer world. "Our goal is always to go beyond, beyond, beyond," he says. "There are no limits to our capacity, because we have the infinite Divine within us, and the Supreme is always transcending His own Reality."</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy regards running as a perfect spiritual metaphor. "Try to be a runner and go beyond all that is bothering you and standing in your way," he tells his students. "Be a real runner so that ignorance, limitations and imperfections will all drop far behind you in the race." In this spirit he has inspired countless individuals to "run" — both literally and figuratively.</p>
<p>"Who is the winner?" he writes in one of his aphorisms. "Not he who wins the race, but he who loves to run sleeplessly and breathlessly with God the Supreme Runner." As a fully God-realised spiritual Master, Sri Chinmoy has consecrated his life to this divinely soulful and supremely fruitful task. At the same time, on an entirely different level, he has made some significant contributions to the sport of running. He was the inspiration behind several long-distance relays, including a recent 300-mile run in Connecticut and the 9,000-mile "Liberty-Torch" run through all the states held during the 1976 Bicentennial. He has composed several running songs, which his students have performed at a number of races. His students have sponsored Sri Chinmoy Runs throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia as an offering to the running community. Moreover, Sri Chinmoy has encouraged his followers around the world to take up running as a means of overcoming lethargy and increasing their spiritual aspiration on the physical plane. Two hundred of his disciples, for example — most of whom were novice runners — completed last years's New York City Marathon.</p>
<p>In the year he has been running, Sri Chinmoy himself has completed seven marathons. He averages about seventy to ninety miles a week, with most of his running done late at night or in the early hours of the morning. During his runs he has been chased by dogs, accosted by hooligans, greeted by admirers and cheered on by children. Sometimes he has had significant inner experiences; other times he has suffered deplorable outer experiences. As a spiritual Master of the highest order, Sri Chinmoy views these experiences — both the divine ones and the undivine ones — with a unique perspective. The running world is nothing but the human world in microcosm, and Sri Chinmoy's reminiscences stand as a remarkable commentary on the whimsical, poignant, funny, outrageous and, above all, supremely significant experience we call life.</p>
