<p>Most of the stories in this and other books in this series are Sri Chinmoy's retelling of traditional Indian tales. On rare occasions the Master has modified a story to make it more acceptable to the Western palate. And a few of the stories are Sri Chinmoy's own.</p>
<p>These tales are not only delicious and nourishing, but also encouraging and illumining. Some are quite entertaining. Others are surcharged with morality-flames and spirituality-fire, which easily enlighten the Western mind, strengthen the vital and quicken the journey of the body-consciousness. Together they represent two trees standing side by side: entertainment-tree and enlightenment-tree. Both trees are at your disposal. Appreciate their flowers and fruits to your heart's content.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Rammohun keeps his prestige</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Rammohun keeps his prestige" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The Governor-General of India was an Englishman named Lord Bentik. He was very strict and everybody was frightened to death at the very mention of his name.</p>
<p>Raj Rammohun Ray at this time was very well known as a man of knowledge and a great patriot. He was also a linguist who knew many languages.</p>
<p>One day, the Governor-General sent a messenger to Rammohun with the message: "The Governor-General wants to see you immediately."</p>
<p>Rammohun said to the messenger: "I know he is the Governor-General of India, but that does not mean that I have to listen to him and come immediately."</p>
<p>The messenger was shocked. "What do you mean?" he said.</p>
<p>"I will come if I have to, but in my own time," said Rammohun.</p>
<p>"I cannot believe this," said the messenger. "Even in my dreams I would not be able to believe this kind of thing. You Indians are at our feet, and yet you are acting so proud and haughty. You will see what kind of punishment you will get from Lord Bentik."</p>
<p>Rammohun only said, "I am fully prepared. I know what kind of punishment I shall get, but also I know what I have to do with a foreign boss."</p>
<p>On hearing the story, Lord Bentik became furious. But he said to himself, "By becoming furious, what am I going to accomplish. I need some help from Raj Rammohun Ray, so let me be wise. Since I am the needy one, I have to be very careful."</p>
<p>He wrote a very polite letter to Rammohun: "I am ready to see you at any time that is convenient for you. I will send my car to bring you here. Please let me know when you can come. I will be extremely happy and honoured to receive you."</p>
<p>The messenger came with the letter, and as soon as Rammohun read it, he said, "I am ready to see the Governor-General."</p>
<p>Rammohun explained to Bentik when he saw him, "My skin may be dark, but I do have my own sense of prestige. You asked for me to come to see you immediately, but I did not come because my pride and prestige were hurt. When you wrote me a polite letter, then I felt sympathy for you. You may feel that the Indians are inferior, but you cannot treat us in that way."</p>
<p>The Governor-General shook hands with Rammohun and agreed, "I know it is absolutely necessary to preserve one's prestige. It was wrong on my part to address you in that way."</p>
<p>Rammohun said, "Your nobility has touched the very depths of my heart."</p>
<p>Wherever Rammohun went, he played the role of a leader most successfully. Everybody admired and adored him. The great poet Tagore wrote of him, "He is the traveller of India."</p>
<p>Indeed, Rammohun was the traveller who spread India's love-message, wisdom-message and oneness-message all over the world.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Surya Sen of Chittagong</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Surya Sen of Chittagong" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Surya Sen was a great patriot, a great revolutionary and a great martyr. Far beyond human imagination were the number of hours he worked to liberate his Mother India. The people of Chittagong adored this great hero. His very name used to give them tremendous joy, tremendous inspiration, tremendous encouragement and a tremendous sense of fulfilment. They called him "Master-da." "Master means teacher; "da" is the elder brother. He was everybody's elder brother; even people who weren't much younger than he called him "Master-da."</p>
<p>He was a teacher. To him belonged the duty of transforming the British schools into Indian national schools. He used to teach in one of these national schools, and he conquered his students' hearts with his affection, love and concern.</p>
<p>He was not rich, nor handsome, nor striking in any way, but his inner strength was indomitable. His eyes used to shine brighter than the brightest. His inner personality conquered everybody's heart. "Bande Mataram" — Mother, I bow to Thee — was his sole mantra.</p>
<p>On February 18, 1930, the revolutionaries of Chittagong, led by Surya Sen, broke into the British armoury and stole a large quantity of guns and ammunition. Chittagong was thrown into the vortex of revolution. Previously, the military used to torture any revolutionaries whom they caught. Torture is an understatement! But after the armoury was robbed, the British Government resolved to put an end to their problems by capturing Surya Sen. So they offered a 10,000-rupee reward to anyone who could tell them about Surya Sen. Whether he was brought to them alive or dead, the British Government would pay 10,000 rupees.</p>
<p>But who among the people would do this kind of thing? Everybody loved Surya Sen dearly and adored him highly. But alas, God's creation is very peculiar. One of Surya Sen's relatives became jealous of this great hero and reached the height of meanness and treachery. His name was Netra Sen.</p>
<p>Surya Sen was always in hiding, moving from one place to another. Sometimes he used to take a job as a workman; sometimes he would take a job as a farmer, or milkman, or priest, or houseworker. This is how he used to avoid being captured.</p>
<p>Either because of money, or out of jealousy, or because of both, Netra Sen told the British Government that Surya Sen was at his house. As a result, the police came and captured him. This is how India's supreme hero was arrested. But before Netra Sen was able to get his 10,000-rupee reward, he was sent to God.</p>
<p>This is how it happened. Netra Sen's wife was all for Surya Sen, and she was horrified by her husband's deed. She felt mortified by her husband's betrayal of Surya Sen. She couldn't believe her eyes; she couldn't believe her ears.</p>
<p>One evening she was serving her husband food when a great admirer of Surya Sen came into the house. He was carrying a very big knife, which is called a dal. With one stroke of the dal he chopped off the head of Netra Sen in the presence of his wife. Then slowly and stealthily he went away.</p>
<p>When the police arrived to investigate, they asked Netra Sen's wife if she had seen who the murderer was. She said, "I saw with my own eyes, but my heart will not permit me to tell you his name. I am sorry. I feel miserable that I was the wife of such a treacherous man, such an undivine man as Netra Sen. My husband betrayed the greatest hero of Chittagong. My husband betrayed a great son of Mother India. My husband cast a slur on the face of India. Therefore, I cannot tell the name of the person who took his life. He has definitely done the right thing.</p>
<p>"You can do anything with me. You can punish me, you can even kill me, but I shall never tell the name of the person who killed my husband. Our Master-da will be hanged, I know, but his name will forever be synonymous with India's immortal freedom-cry. Everybody loves him. Everybody adores him. I, too, love him and adore him, for he is the brightest sun in the firmament of Chittagong. Surya means sun and he is truly our sun."</p>
<p>On January 12, 1934, before the sun rose, Chittagong's sun, India's sun, was hanged. Before he was hanged, this great lover of India, this supreme lover of India, uttered his heart's mantra once: "Bande Mataram" — Mother, I bow to Thee.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Khudhiram</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Khudhiram" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In 1905 Bengal was divided in two by Lord Curzon. Bengal's great political leaders were dead against it, but they were helpless. So there was a great revolt in Bengal. The political leaders and the adorers of Mother India were all fighting against the British. But the British were ruthless. Whenever they heard people chanting "Bande Mataram," they used to arrest them. For the Indian patriots, "Bande Mataram" was the slogan. "Bande Mataram" was their mantra; "Bande Mataram" was their life-breath. By uttering "Bande Mataram," thousands and thousands of people embraced death.</p>
<p>Of all the English, Judge Kingsford was the worst. He used to torture the revolutionaries mercilessly; his activities were atrocious. This led the revolutionaries to decide that Kingsford must be killed.</p>
<p>Two young men, two great revolutionaries, were chosen to execute this task. One was Peraphulla Chaki, the other was Khudhiram. They were young, they were spirited, they were devoted and they were sincere. They were two jewels of Mother Bengal. Their leaders were all appreciation for them and their friends were all admiration for them. So they took up the challenge; they would kill Kingsford.</p>
<p>Every evening, it was Kingsford's custom to go out in his carriage for a short ride. One evening, they hid near Kingsford's bungalow and when the carriage pulled away from the bungalow, the two young men attacked it. They threw a bomb into the vehicle and completely destroyed it. Alas, on that particular day Kingsford was not inside. Instead, his friend, Mrs. Kennedy, and her daughter were in the carriage, and both of them were killed.</p>
<p>Peraphulla Chaki was arrested but Khudhiram somehow managed to escape. Before the British Government could punish Peraphulla Chaki, this hero of heroes committed suicide. In a few days' time Khudhiram was also arrested. He was caught in a railway station.</p>
<p>There was only one way in which the British Government dealt with such cases: on August 11,1908, Khudhiram was hanged. But before he was hanged he sang a particular line from a song with all his heart's soulfulness:</p>
<p>"Mother, farewell! I am going out just for a short while. Mother, farewell! Do give me the permission to go out and come back."</p>
<p>This particular line he sang a few times, and then he was hanged.</p>
<p>Yes, Khudhiram did come back to Mother Bengal. He came back in different bodies, in different names, in different shapes — with new determination, new boldness and a heart of supreme sacrifice from Heaven.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The child Narendranath</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The child Narendranath" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Swami Vivekananda's earlier name was Narendranath and his nickname was Bile. During his childhood and even in his adolescent years, he was extremely mischievous. This did not diminish his divinity. But his parents, especially his mother, sometimes would get puzzled and worry about him.</p>
<p>She used to say, "O Lord Shiva, I prayed to you to grant me a son like you. But instead of coming into my life, you have sent me your ghost. He is nothing but a ghost, my Bile, always breaking things and creating problems for me. How long can I tolerate his endless mischief?"</p>
<p>But there were quite a few good qualities that his mother also saw in him, so inwardly she was satisfied. But outwardly she always told everyone, "My Bile is so notorious!"</p>
<p>One day, when he was only five years old, Vivekananda saw in the living room a few Indian hookahs or smoking pipes. One was for the Brahmins, one for the Kshatriyas and one for the Muslims. He tasted each one, and to his surprise discovered that all the hookahs tasted the same.</p>
<p>Alas, he was caught by his own father. "What are you doing, Bile?" he asked.</p>
<p>Vivekananda replied, "Father, I was just examining the smoking pipes. I thought that the one for Brahmins would be better than the one for Kshatriyas, because Brahmins are so great. And the Muslims are so heroic and spirited, so I thought that the Muslim pipe would be special. But they are all the same. I wish to tell you, Father, that they are all the same. No one pipe is superior to another."</p>
<p>Vivekananda's parents were simply shocked. "How is it that you have started smoking at such a tender age?" they asked. "And what kind of things is a small boy like you saying?"</p>
<p>Then his mother said, "My son, you are too spoiled. You have become too smart. Come here." The child came to the mother and she took him upstairs to his room and closed the door from outside.</p>
<p>In two hours' time the maid came running to the mother, screaming: "Bile is throwing away all his clothes. Everything he has in his room he is throwing out through the window! There are a few beggars below who are grabbing his garments as they fall. And he himself is so happy!"</p>
<p>At this the mother ran upstairs and demanded, "What is the matter with you, Bile? Such expensive clothes you are throwing away!"</p>
<p>Vivekananda replied, "Mother, we are so rich. We can have whatever we want, whenever we want. But these are poor people. They have nothing, nothing. If we do not give to them, then who will give to them? We have enough, more than enough; so my heart wants to give these things away. They need them more than I do."</p>
<p>His mother's heart was full of joy and delight. She embraced her son and shed tears of delight that his heart was so sympathetic, so vast and so all-giving, and that he had so much oneness with the poor and with the Supreme Pilot in all.</p>

<p>Swami Vivekananda enjoyed smoking. In the days of his pilgrimage, when he used to walk along the streets of India, here, there and elsewhere, smoking was his great avocation.</p>
<p>One evening, as Vivekananda was walking along a village street in northern India, he came to a small cottage where an old man was smoking an Indian hookah. Vivekananda had a tremendous desire to smoke, and he asked the old man if he would give him his pipe.</p>
<p>The man said, "Oh, Swami, I am a scavenger, I am an untouchable. How can I give you my hookah? How will you smoke from the hookah of an untouchable? I am so happy to see you. You are so handsome, so spirited. I am so fortunate to see you. But, alas, I come from an untouchable family."</p>
<p>Vivekananda felt sorry that the old man was an untouchable. He said to him, "I am sorry, I am sorry. Alas, I won't be able to smoke." Vivekananda left him and continued walking.</p>
<p>In a few minutes he felt miserable. He said to himself, "What am I doing? What am I doing? What have I done? What have I done? Did not Thakur teach me that wherever there is a human being, there also is Lord Shiva? Each human being embodies God. This is what I have learned from my Master, Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>"I have given up everything; I am a sannyasin. So I am one with the rest of the world by virtue of my renunciation. Yet although I have renounced everything, still I have preserved this sense of discrimination. Here is a cobbler, here is a scavenger, here is a Brahmin, here is a Shudra. Low caste, high caste! How can I have the heart to distinguish? Are they not all God's children? The sense of separativity, the sense of superiority and inferiority: How can I have that kind of feeling?"</p>
<p>Vivekananda then went running back to the old man and said, "Please, please, give me your hookah. Each man is God Himself."</p>
<p>The old man fearfully and, at the same time, happily gave the hookah to Swami Vivekananda. Swami Vivekananda smoked to his heart's content and then said to the old man, "I am divinely happy, supremely happy, for two reasons. My human desire is fulfilled; I am able to smoke. And my divine desire is fulfilled, because I have been able to realise my inner vision of universal oneness. My Supreme Lord abides in all. This vision of mine I have been able to manifest today by smoking here from your hookah at your house.</p>
<p>"God is for all. He is not only for me, but He is for all. In each individual Him to see, Him to please unconditionally, is my only goal. I shall remain ever grateful to you, for it is through you that my Lord has taught me the supreme lesson: that we are all one, we are all equal, we are all children of our Absolute Lord Supreme."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Vidyasagar: the ocean of compassion</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Vidyasagar: the ocean of compassion" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Vidyasagar was the ocean of knowledge and also the ocean of compassion. There were people who used to think of him early in the morning and pray to God to make them as kind and as great as Vidyasagar. He was loved by everyone and adored by everyone.</p>
<p>Vidyasagar was one of those who helped to elevate the consciousness of the Bengalis tremendously, and in hundreds of ways he served the people of Bengal. He helped the Bengalis infinitely more than anyone can imagine in social activities and in fighting for the education of women and the early remarriage of widows. He also helped the poor and the needy, not only unreservedly, but also unconditionally.</p>
<p>Once he went to a particular district that was not well-known and where the people were not well-educated. He happened to be sitting at a railway station, watching the trains coming and going. In a short while a particular train stopped and a few passengers began to step down from it.</p>
<p>It was a very small railway station and there were very few coolies, so the passengers had to carry their own luggage. One young man began shouting, "Coolie! Coolie! Coolie!" He had only a small briefcase, but he was shouting for a coolie and nobody was there to come.</p>
<p>Vidyasagar stood up and went over to the young man. "I will carry it," he said. The young man did not know that Vidyasagar was a great man. He always wore the most modest clothes. And perhaps the young man had never even heard of Vidyasagar. God knows. Anyway, Vidyasagar took his briefcase and pretended to be a coolie because he was so modest and humble.</p>
<p>Carrying the briefcase, Vidyasagar followed the gentleman to the house of his parents-in-law. It was to be their first meeting since he had married their daughter. Vidyasagar and the young man arrived at their house and the hosts came out to greet them. Although they were simply delighted to see their new son-in-law, they were shocked to death to see Vidyasagar carrying his briefcase.</p>
<p>They fell at Vidyasagar's feet and said, "How can you do this? How can you do this? Will God not curse us? In knowledge, in compassion and in love, you are the greatest man in Bengal, and yet you carry this briefcase for our son-in-law! He is such a stupid fellow. He did not know who you are. Even now there is no remorse on his part!"</p>
<p>All the members of the household were so shocked, and they begged Vidyasagar to forgive the young man. Gradually, gradually, the son-in-law began to realise what he had unconsciously done.</p>
<p>Then Vidyasagar said to him, "It is because of you that Bengal is not progressing. You will never do your duty. It is such a tiny briefcase, and so light, but still you cannot carry it yourself. You have to wait for a coolie. Yes, when it is heavy, I understand; but when it is something that you can do yourself, that is incomprehensible to me. I am desperately trying to encourage people to be active, dynamic and self-sufficient. It is because people like you don't do your duty, which is so easy to do, that today Mother Bengal is so inferior to other parts of the world. You are all a disgrace to our country."</p>
<p>In this way Vidyasagar scolded them. The members of the family gladly accepted his scolding. "We deserve it. We deserve it. But we are very glad and grateful that you have come to our house. We could not have brought you to our house otherwise."</p>
<p>Vidyasagar replied, "No, you are wrong. I go to everybody's house. You people have made me great. You people have made me good. But I want everybody to be great and good. Then only my sister and brother Bengalis will really make progress. If you are not self-sufficient, if you are not active, if you are not dynamic, then you can never become good instruments for God and good instruments to achieve something great for Mother Bengal."</p>
<p>At this point the young man also fell at Vidyasagar's feet and said, "Vidyasagar, in addition to being the ocean of knowledge, you are also the ocean of compassion. Forgive me. From now on I will be a totally different person."</p>
<p>Vidyasagar blessed him, saying, "I need young people like you who will really work very hard, who will offer their heart and soul to raise the standard of Mother Bengal. I offer you my blessings unreservedly."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Love is love</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Love is love" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a Muslim King who had a most beautiful daughter. Unfortunately or fortunately, his daughter had tremendous admiration for a Hindu King. This Hindu King was unmarried and the Muslim King's daughter wanted to marry him. But the Muslim King said, "Impossible! I will not allow you to marry a Hindu!"</p>
<p>The Muslim princess protested in the strongest terms. She said, "No, you have to allow me to marry him, because love is love. I admire him and love him. I must have him."</p>
<p>What could the Muslim King do? His daughter's happiness was dear to his heart. So he sent a messenger to the Hindu King seeking his views on the matter. As it happened, the Hindu King also loved this Muslim princess. So he replied, "If she loves me and I love her, then I don't see why we can't get married."</p>
<p>In due time, the two were married. The Muslim King tolerated the fact, whereas the parents of the Hindu King were very agreeable to the union. They said, "To please you, son, is our only desire." As this old couple had advanced in years, they had made their son the King and now, in their support of his marriage, they once more showed their tremendous love for him.</p>
<p>Over the years the Muslim King became terribly jealous of his son-in-law. Everybody appreciated and admired the Hindu King because of his courage, wisdom and sense of charity. Even the Muslim King's own subjects had tremendous appreciation for the Hindu King. The Muslim King could not tolerate this. He wanted to conquer his son-in-law's kingdom, especially the capital, and throw his son-in-law in jail.</p>
<p>So, quite unexpectedly, he and his army attacked the Hindu King's palace. There was a terrible fight, but after a few days the palace was captured and the Hindu King was arrested. The Muslim King brought him to his palace and would not allow him to go back to his kingdom. He said, "You have to stay here in exile. Only on one condition shall I allow you to go back: if you send my daughter back to me and say that she is no longer your wife."</p>
<p>The Hindu King said, "I love your daughter; your daughter loves me. Our love for each other is tremendous. What will she think of me if I do this?"</p>
<p>The Muslim King said, "If you won't divorce my daughter, then I shall kill you."</p>
<p>What could the Hindu King do? He was helpless.</p>
<p>The wife of the Hindu King was furious that her father had attacked her husband without any advance warning. She put on her husband's uniform and started fighting against the Muslim King's army. Some of the soldiers laughed at her because she was so weak, although she was determined to fight and kill them. Some ran away out of fear that while defending themselves from her blows they might kill her, and they were extremely fond of her. Only a few completely took their King's side. "If you come near us," they said, "we will kill you."</p>
<p>In the meantime, a messenger came to the Hindu Queen with a letter from her captured husband. When she read the message, she could not believe her eyes: "If I don't divorce you, your father will kill me. Therefore, I am divorcing you and returning you to your father. You go back to your father and let me come back to my Kingdom. All I want to do is rule there peacefully."</p>
<p>The wife cried out, "Is this a Hindu heart? I loved a Hindu heart and against my father's will I married this man. I gave my all to him, I sacrificed everything for him. Now he has divorced me. And I am fighting to bring him back! I love my husband so dearly, but he loves his kingdom more than he loves me. His kingdom is more precious to him than my life's own sacrifice."</p>
<p>The wife grabbed a dagger. "You will get your kingdom back, but my father will not get his daughter back!" she said, and then she killed herself.</p>
<p>In a few days the Hindu King returned. At first he shed sincere tears over the loss of his wife, but then he became involved in ruling his kingdom peacefully and he began to forget her.</p>
<p>The Muslim King was struck with grief for what he had done. Instead of getting back his daughter, he lost her for good. The Muslim Queen became mad at her husband and she said, "You should be hanged! Because of you we lost our dearest daughter. She loved her husband and he loved her. Is not love more important, infinitely more important, than your religion? Who is Hindu, who is Muslim? The dear ones will always remain dear. There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim; there is only oneness. Because of your stupidity, today I have lost my dearest daughter. Had I been in your place, I would have destroyed my life."</p>
<p>The Muslim King said, "Stop your philosophy! If I die, it is you who will be the sufferer. Already you have lost your daughter, and now you want to lose your husband as well? You will not be able to bear your suffering!"</p>
<p>The Queen said, "No, I will be able to bear my suffering because I love justice. Because of you, I have lost my dearest daughter. If you die, I will feel that this is real justice."</p>
<p>The King said, "You may love justice, but I also have some sense of justice with regard to my subjects. If I die, they will be fatherless. I have made one serious blunder. So what? If I stay on earth I can still do many good things for my subjects. I want to stay on earth."</p>
<p>"Yes, stay on earth," the Queen cried, "and I shall also stay on earth with a broken heart. But the whole world will hate you, and I will be the one to hate you most. I will stay on earth, not because I am needed, but in order to treasure the memory of my dearest, sweetest daughter. If I die, I do not know what will happen or where I will go, but if I stay on earth I will be able to repent. And my repentance is my consolation, my repentance is my illumination. For that purpose I will stay, whereas you can stay to lead a shameless life!"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The tragedy of Dasharatha</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The tragedy of Dasharatha" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a great king named Dasharatha. He was the father of the great Ramachandra, one of India's Avatars. King Dasharatha was an expert in the art of archery and his teacher, Bhargava, was extremely pleased with his student. There was only one particular knowledge which Bhargava did not impart to his student. It was a special type of archery in which it is not necessary to even see the prey. By just hearing the sound of the animal, no matter where it is, the archer can shoot it. This secret knowledge Bhargava did not want to give Dasharatha because he was a Kshatriya. Although Kshatriyas are very spirited, courageous and determined, they have one weakness: they lack a disciplined life and sometimes they become a victim of restlessness. Therefore, Bhargava was unwilling to give Dasharatha the necessary skill.</p>
<p>But Dasharatha begged and begged his teacher. Repeatedly he declared, "I will not misuse it, I will not misuse it. I promise you."</p>
<p>Finally, Bhargava acceded to the King's entreaty. "All right," he said, "I will give it to you, since you are begging me. But I am afraid that one day you will bring a serious calamity to yourself and to the members of your family and also to some innocent victims through your unfortunate use of this knowledge. However, as you are begging me so earnestly, how can I displease you, my son?" So Bhargava gave the secret knowledge and secret capacity to his dearest student, Dasharatha.</p>
<p>Dasharatha was now extremely happy and delighted, for he knew that he had mastered all the strategies of archery.</p>
<p>A few years passed and one day a strong desire entered into Dasharatha's mind. He said, "Let me go into the deep forest and test the secret capacity that Bhargava has given me. Then I shall be able to discover whether I actually have learnt how to aim at animals without seeing them."</p>
<p>So Dasharatha went into the forest. When evening came, a sound reached his ears, which he was sure was the trumpeting of an elephant. Dasharatha immediately pulled back his bow and let the arrow fly. Then lo and behold, this time a human sound came back to him in the night: "Mother, Mother, I am finished."</p>
<p>Dasharatha followed the sound to its source and what did he see? He saw a little boy of nine who had come to fetch water from a pond. The little boy's father, a great sage, was blind. His mother was all affection and love for her only child, her darling son. Because his parents were old, the son helped them in many ways, even at this early age. This particular evening his parents had been thirsty, so he had come to draw water from a pond near their cottage. As he was approaching the pond, the arrow came flying towards his heart and struck him down.</p>
<p>When Dasharatha came and saw the scene, he felt intensely miserable at what he had done. He cried out piteously, "Oh, Guru Bhargava, you were right, you were right! I was not meant for this sacred, sacred knowledge, these extraordinary capacities."</p>
<p>The little boy turned his eyes to Dasharatha and said to him, "I am dying. No harm, I shall die. But do me a favour, will you? Will you go and carry this pitcher to my parents? My parents are thirsty and they are expecting me at any moment. Please, please do me this last favour. Don't you worry about me. This is my fate, but please go and give water to my parents. They are thirsty, extremely thirsty." Then the little boy, Sindhu, turned his face to Heaven and died.</p>
<p>Dasharatha burst into tears. With one hand he took up the dead body of the little boy and with the other he carried the pitcher, full to the brim. Slowly, and with a heavy heart, he made his way to the cottage of Sindhu's parents.</p>
<p>When Sindhu's father heard the sound of footsteps he said, "Sindhu, Sindhu, my Sindhu, you have come! We are waiting for you. What happened to make you so late today, my child? Both your mother and I are pinched with thirst, and you have come to quench our thirst. You are our dearest child, our only darling. Please, please, always try to be on time. Do not waste any time when you go on errands that take you away from us. We need you badly at every moment."</p>
<p>Dasharatha could remain silent no longer. He said, "Oh sage, I am the wretched Dasharatha. Forgive me, forgive me. Your dearest, sweetest child, Sindhu, is no more. I have come and brought your son. But, alas, he is without life. Now, although I am the King, I am at your mercy entirely. Do anything you want with my life."</p>
<p>The father and mother could not believe their ears. As soon as the mother saw her son lying dead in Dasharatha's arms, she fainted and immediately her husband followed her. In an hour's time, when they had both recovered, they said to Dasharatha, "O King, please do us the kindness of arranging for a pyre to be made straight away. Our last request of you is this: As soon as the pyre is lit, we wish to join our son on it. As soon as the fire starts blazing, we shall place our son on it first and then we shall also enter into the climbing flames."</p>
<p>In great distress, the King said, "No, no, no! That cannot be done. One soul has died. Already I am responsible for one human being's losing his life, and at such a tender age! Now must I be responsible for two more? Oh no, no! Please forgive me, I am the King. I will do everything that is within my limited human capacity to console you, but this thing I cannot do."</p>
<p>With one voice the parents answered him. "No, King, stay we cannot. We cannot be dissuaded from joining our son. He was dearer than the dearest to us. Without him our life is meaningless and will always remain meaningless. Therefore, let us go with him."</p>
<p>"Then," Dasharatha said, "what will be my punishment?"</p>
<p>"No punishment," the mother replied. "Why should we blame you? This is our fate. We forgive you. Our son forgave you and we also forgive you."</p>
<p>Her husband, the sage, said, "Wait! My son has forgiven him, you can forgive him, but I cannot. Although I have done yoga and practised austerities all my life — infinitely more than my son and you — I cannot forgive him. I simply cannot!</p>
<p>"Dasharatha, you are responsible, totally responsible, for our son's death and I am compelled to curse you. You too, will one day miss your son the way I am missing mine. You will be obliged to send your son into the forest because of your foolish fondness for one of your wives and, through this unthinkable behaviour, you will lose your dearest, eldest son."</p>
<p>At the time of these events, Dasharatha didn't have a son. But when he heard the curse he cried out, "O God, O God, don't give me a son, don't give me a son. I don't need one, I don't need one. It is better not to have a son and not to miss the son than to send the son into the forest to be killed. But I cannot conceive how this death could take place. How could it happen? Why would it happen? Who among my wives would be so unkind as to compel me to send my son into the forest? Impossible, impossible! Yet the curse of the sage may come true. O God, I beg You either to give me a son who will escape this curse or to give me no son at all. For to lose a son and enjoy the kingdom would be simply impossible for me. O Lord Supreme, forgive me, forgive my misdeed. Let this curse remain unfulfilled, I pray."</p>
<p>But, alas, how can the curse of a great sage pass unfulfilled? There came a time when Dasharatha was indeed compelled by his second wife, Kaikeyi, to send his son, who was dearer than the dearest to him, into the forest and there the inevitable happened. It was simply impossible for Dasharatha to bear the shock of his son's death and, lamenting the loss, he died.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The defeat of Britrasur</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The defeat of Britrasur" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God alone knows when this particular story took place. As you know, the gods and asuras always fight. They fight over Heaven, since they both want to possess it. Sometimes the asuras possess Heaven, and sometimes the gods do.</p>
<p>Why does it happen so? The gods lose Heaven when they misuse their freedom and enter into the enjoyment-life. At that time they are driven out by the asuras, or undivine forces. Then, when the asuras misuse their capacities and become extremely wicked, they are driven out by the cosmic gods. While we can expect this kind of undivine behaviour from the asuras, it is really painful when the cosmic gods also enter into the life of undivine enjoyment and are compelled to lose Heaven.</p>
<p>Now, each time the gods are driven from Heaven, they pray like anything in order to win back Heaven. They pray and pray and meditate and meditate, and gradually they regain their power. Then they drive out the asuras, who have been losing their capacities because of the undivine life they have been leading in Heaven. Then everything is reversed. The asuras pray and meditate and become stronger, while the gods become weaker because they have entered into the enjoyment life. Then finally the asuras drive out the cosmic gods. It has been going on like this from time immemorial.</p>
<p>Thousands of years ago there was a most powerful asura named Britrasur, who was the King of the asuras. Britrasur was able to drive the gods out of Heaven, and then he ruled Heaven mercilessly. Gradually, his subjects became very undivine and cruel, and they lived a very undivine life.</p>
<p>It happened that the King's wife developed a strong desire. She wanted to bring Indra's wife, Sachi, to her palace and make Sachi her maid. Indra was the King of the cosmic gods, but he had been driven away by Britrasur along with the other gods.</p>
<p>Britrasur said to his wife, "It is an excellent idea, my dear. I am sending my soldiers to arrest Sachi, and she will definitely become your maid. Your happiness is my happiness."</p>
<p>When news of this reached Indra, he became furious. He said, "What an insult! My wife, my Queen to become the maid of Britrasur's wife! True, I have been driven away by him. True, he is stronger than I am right now; he is stronger than any of the cosmic gods. But how does he dare to even think of taking my wife away from me? Such an insult I will not brook!"</p>
<p>So saying, Indra went to Brahma, the Creator. "O Brahma," he pleaded, "save me, save me. Look at the audacity of Britrasur! He wants to take my wife away from me and make her his own wife's slave."</p>
<p>Brahma replied, "Indra, when you suffer from a disease, you need medicine to cure yourself. You have all enjoyed life in a way that was beyond all proportion. Now you have to pay the penalty."</p>
<p>"That is true," Indra admitted. "But Lord Brahma, how long can they torture us? And this kind of audacity — to take my wife, of all people! How can I tolerate it?"</p>
<p>Brahma said, "When you suffer, you come to realise others' suffering. I am not saying that your wife should be taken away by Britrasur; far from it. But I am telling you, you must not enter and remain in the world of restless, base enjoyment. I tell you, Indra, you can get back Heaven only if a great sage offers you his boon."</p>
<p>"Who will do this kind of thing?" Indra asked. "Is there anyone who can offer me such a boon?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, there is such a person," said Brahma. "Dadichi, the son of Chyaban, can and will do it. This great son of Chyaban will offer you his boon. Your wife and your friends should go and take shelter at Dadichi's and Chyaban's house."</p>
<p>So Indra immediately went with his wife and army to their house and related all that had passed to Dadichi. Dadichi assured him, "Do not worry, I shall do the needful."</p>
<p>Upon hearing that Indra and his wife had taken shelter at Dadichi's house, Britrasur sent his soldiers there to arrest Indra's wife. If necessity demanded, they would arrest Indra too. But it was not so easy to arrest Indra's wife. Since the task was proving so difficult, Britrasur himself, the leader and King of the asuras, decided to personally come to seize her. Dadichi was waiting for Britrasur when he came and said to him, "Let us see whether you can take Indra's wife away from here. Let us see whether you can contend with my occult and spiritual power. Let us see who can destroy whom. I warn you, Britrasur, if you don't give up this foul and base desire of yours, I shall destroy you and all your friends and soldiers with my third eye — completely and utterly."</p>
<p>Britrasur remained silent but his wife said, "Oh no, I have come to take Sachi. She will massage my feet; she will become my slave, my perfect slave. What a perfect slave she will make!"</p>
<p>Calmly and quietly and with a broad smile, the sage Dadichi said to them, "All right, I am going to bathe in the lake and then I will return. But I tell you, before I come back if you take away Indra's wife, then I shall destroy you all immediately. Yonder is the lake in which I shall bathe. When I return, I shall do the needful."</p>
<p>So Dadichi went to the lake. An hour, two hours, a day, two days went by, and still Dadichi did not return from the lake. The days ran into weeks, with still no sign of him. Finally, Indra and his army went to the lake to see what was going on. When he did not find Dadichi, he jumped into the lake to see whether Dadichi had given up his life and was at the bottom. It was true. Dadichi had taken away his life-breath while in trance. Indra found the body of Dadichi and brought it to the surface. But although it was dead, it was full of power; it emanated power. On seeing the dead body, Britrasur took fright and ran away. Indra at first chased him. But then Brahma himself intervened and asked Indra to take a particular bone from Dadichi's body and make a special mace, which was then known as Vajra. After the mace was completed, it flew up high into the air and from there it descended upon Britrasur's head, destroying him at the spot where he was standing.</p>
<p>This is how the cosmic gods regained Heaven and were spared the loss of Indra's wife, Sachi Devi. Indra and his soldiers and Sachi Devi all bowed down to Brahma, the Creator, with gratitude-hearts everlasting.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Arjuna inspires Ekalavya</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Arjuna inspires Ekalavya" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The young Pandavas and the young Kauravas used to learn archery from Dronacharya. Dronacharya was the supreme archer and everybody admired him not only for his skill but also for his lofty spiritual height. He taught the young Pandavas and the young Kauravas with utmost concern and love and instilled into them character, strength and manly vigour.</p>
<p>There came a time when the young Pandavas and Kauravas had to sit for an examination. In actuality, it was more a display of prowess than an examination and everybody was given the opportunity to show his capacity.</p>
<p>The grand winner was the third Pandava, Arjuna. All the people who had come to watch the events appreciated and admired Arjuna's matchless precision and expertise. Among the spectators were an old man and his son. The son was so deeply moved by Arjuna's capacity that he said to his father, "Father, I want to become an archer like Arjuna. I admire him so much."</p>
<p>His father answered, "Ekalavya, there is nothing wrong in that, my son. You practise hard and you will also be a fine archer."</p>
<p>"But how can I practise archery? I have to learn it first," reasoned the son.</p>
<p>"Agreed. You have to learn."</p>
<p>"But who will be my teacher? I wish to have Dronacharya as my teacher!"</p>
<p>"No son," the father said. "He will not become your teacher. We come of a low caste, so how will he become your teacher?"</p>
<p>But his son insisted, "What is low caste, what is high caste? I see he is a very kindhearted man."</p>
<p>The father said, "Yes, he is kind-hearted, but when it is a matter of teaching low caste people, he won't do it. He will only teach the Brahmins and Kshatriyas. I tell you, we are Sudras, so he cannot teach you."</p>
<p>The young man was very sad that he would not get Dronacharya as his teacher. On the way back home, he suddenly said to his father, "No, I am going to ask Dronacharya all the same. Who knows, perhaps he will teach me. So Father, you go home. I will come back alone."</p>
<p>His father said, "All right, you go if you must, but let me wait for you here. You go and see."</p>
<p>After his son had left, the father said, "How inspired my dear Ekalavya has been by the matchless Arjuna! I can clearly see that because of his aspiration and determination, my son is destined to become a great archer, whether Dronacharya agrees to teach him or not. It is only a matter of time."</p>

<p>Inspired by Arjuna's peerless archery skill at a royal competition, Ekalavya approached Arjuna's archery teacher, Dronacharya. "Sir, sir, venerable sir, will you please teach me archery? I want to become just like Arjuna. I have such tremendous admiration for Arjuna. Will you teach me archery?"</p>
<p>Dronacharya replied, "Yes, I will teach you. But please tell me who you are."</p>
<p>The young man said, "My name is Ekalavya and my father is the chief caretaker."</p>
<p>Dronacharya looked disturbed. "Oh, you come of a very low family. I am sorry, but you have to forgive me, I cannot teach you."</p>
<p>The young man protested, "High caste, low caste! You are such a learned man, such a man of wisdom, and yet you are saying things like this. I was born in a low family, but if I do good things — great and mighty things — will it not compensate my birth?"</p>
<p>"You are speaking like a true philosopher, and let me say that I admire your philosophy. It is not your fault that you came into a low caste family. And if you have aspiration and determination, then naturally you are bound to succeed."</p>
<p>The young man said, "That is what I am saying. It was my fate. What can I do if I was destined to take birth in a low caste family? But if, with my aspiration and determination, I do something great and good, will it not please the world? Will it not please God?"</p>
<p>"Yes, certainly it will. I appreciate your philosophy. I see eye to eye with you. But I cannot fulfil your desire. I cannot teach you. You try! With your heart's aspiration and your unfaltering determination, you try. You will succeed one day, my boy. Of that, I assure you. If I do it, the Brahmins and my friends will all hate me. They will throw me out of society. I am an old man. At this age I don't want to be thrown out of society. So, make no mistake, I fully agree with your philosophy, but I am telling you that I am unable to fulfil your desire. You can call it my weakness or anything you want, but society is made like that. It has its own way of thinking. I do not want to be the one to justify it. I don't want to go into the reasons why the Kshatriyas and the Brahmins should not and must not mix with lower caste people. That will be a very long story, and it will be a painful one for you. So I don't want to tell it. You please go, and with your own aspiration and determination you will succeed."</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, the young man turned towards home. When he came upon his father, who had been waiting for him, he said, "Father, you were right. This old man will not teach me. Caste, caste, caste! Father, why were you born in a low caste?"</p>
<p>"What could I do," his father said. "My parents brought me into the world as I brought you into the world. Did I know I was going to take birth in a low caste family? Son, if we love God, then God will always please us and fulfil us. So if you want to learn the skills of archery, pray to God. God Himself will teach you."</p>
<p>"Yes, Father," Ekalavya said, "You are right. I have faith that because of my devotion to Dronacharya, God will definitely teach me."</p>

<p>The young Ekalavya was determined to become a great archer. Although the master-archer Dronacharya could not teach him because he was of a low caste, the young man was adamant.</p>
<p>"I will pray to God," he said to his father. "Day and night I will pray. Drona's heart is good, but his mind was not good when I approached him. His heart sympathised with me, but his mind was afraid of what society would say if he taught a Sudra. But I want to have him as my teacher.</p>
<p>"So I have resolved to make a statue of Drona out of mud and clay, and I shall worship that statue as my teacher, my only teacher. From this statue I will get inspiration and be able to learn."</p>
<p>His father said, "That is a wonderful idea. If you retain that kind of faith in your teacher, my son, I am sure you will succeed."</p>
<p>So the young man made a statue that looked exactly like Drona. Constantly he used to pray to Drona and receive inspiration from him through the statue. In this way the young man was able not only to acquire the skills of archery, but to so master them that he became absolutely unique. He even learned how to stop the barking of dogs in such a way that his arrow pierced the dog's mouth and stuck there. He had that kind of capacity. He was an unparalleled archer and the feat that he could perform with dogs not even Arjuna himself could dream of doing.</p>
<p>One day Ekalavya was meditating in the forest. A dog started barking and it was disturbing his meditation. So he picked up his bow and shot some arrows into the dog's mouth. The dog, silenced, but not bleeding, ran away.</p>
<p>It so happened that Arjuna and the Pandava brothers were also in the forest, amusing themselves. When they saw the dog passing by, no one paid any attention to it. But Arjuna noticed to his astonishment that the dog had arrows inside its mouth but was not bleeding. He said, "Who can be such a great archer?" Overcome by curiosity, he followed the dog, which took him directly to Ekalavya, who was in a meditative consciousness.</p>
<p>Arjuna approached Ekalavya and, pointing at the dog, inquired, "Who has done this?"</p>
<p>"I have done it," Ekalavya said.</p>
<p>"You! You have such capacity? Who taught you?"</p>
<p>"My Guru."</p>
<p>"Who is your Guru?"</p>
<p>"My Guru is Drona," said Ekalavya.</p>
<p>"Drona is your Guru in archery!" Arjuna exclaimed. "He is my Guru!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Drona is also my Guru."</p>
<p>"When did he teach you, then? He is always with us in the kingdom."</p>
<p>"Oh no," said Ekalavya. "Here he is. Look, I have made a statue of him and I worship him in this statue. It was he who gave me the inspiration and the capacity to do this." Arjuna said quickly, "Thank you. I am very happy, very happy. I am very proud of you."</p>
<p>Although Arjuna felt sad that Ekalavya had far surpassed him in skill, he was very moved by the devotion and faith that the young man had for Dronacharya.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">For his dearest disciple the Master will do everything</h2><span property="dc:title" content="For his dearest disciple the Master will do everything" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When Prince Arjuna discovered that the untouchable, Ekalavya, who lived in the forest, was more skilled in archery than he was, he was very disturbed. He left the forest and ran home, furious. He went straight to Dronacharya and said to him, "You have deceived me."</p>
<p>"Remain calm and quiet, my son," said Dronacharya. "Why are you shouting and screaming?"</p>
<p>"You have deceived me! I have just seen someone who knows archery far better than I do. You told me that I was the best archer and now, look, you have deceived me, you have fooled me!"</p>
<p>Dronacharya affirmed, "No, I can never deceive you; I can never fool you."</p>
<p>"But you have done it," declared Arjuna. "In the forest there is a young man by the name of Ekalavya. He has made a statue of you which he worships. From the statue he has derived such a unique capacity. With his arrows he can stop the barking of a dog, which I can't do. And then, something else! He is able to shoot arrows through the mouth of a dog without making the dog bleed. Look at his capacity! I don't have that capacity. You told me I was the best! Now what can I do? I feel miserable, miserable."</p>
<p>Then Drona said, "Come with me, my son." And he took Arjuna into the forest to where Ekalavya lived. Drona went up to Ekalavya and said, "You have such capacity in archery. Who taught you? I have heard from Arjuna that you have stopped the barking of a dog."</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Ekalavya. "I was meditating most soulfully on you and the dog was bothering me. Therefore, I got annoyed with the dog and punished it so that it could not bark. But, in all sincerity, I did not know that the dog would not bleed. I was also surprised when I saw that there was no blood. So, this is all your grace, Dronacharya. I give all credit to you."</p>
<p>Drona said, "I am so proud of you, my boy. Now tell me, if it is true that I have done everything for you, then will you not give me a sacerdotal fee? You know that when you learn from a teacher, the teacher gives everything to the student. So it is customary for the student to give the teacher a reward."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I will give, I will give," Ekalavya replied earnestly. "Anything you want you may have. I am so grateful to you, so grateful to you."</p>
<p>"Are you sure that you will give me anything I want?"</p>
<p>"Yes, without any difficulty whatsoever. Unreservedly and unconditionally I shall give."</p>
<p>"Then give me, my son, your right thumb," said Dronacharya.</p>
<p>"My right thumb!" cried Ekalavya. "If I give you my right thumb, then what am I going to do? Will I remain an archer anymore? No, I must keep my promise. You take my right thumb. You be happy. I am so grateful to you. You gave me the capacity to become an excellent archer and I will be so proud that I am able to fulfil your desire. So please, please, take my right thumb. I am giving you my right thumb."</p>
<p>With these words he cut off his right thumb and gave it to Dronacharya. Then he said, "As an archer I could have been known the world over. Everybody would have come to know of me. But now I will be known as a devotee of yours. I am sure that to be a devotee is infinitely more meaningful and fruitful in my life than to be an archer."</p>
<p>Arjuna felt miserable that this took place because of him. He said to Ekalavya, "Please forgive me, I am the culprit, I am the culprit."</p>
<p>But Drona interrupted him, "No, you are not the culprit. I want to tell you one thing, I want to tell both of you. Arjuna, my son, today I wanted to show you that you have always been my dearest disciple — dearer to me than my own soul. In order to prove to the world that I can do everything to please my dearest disciple, I transformed you into an archer without equal in this land. But here also I wish to say that, in the inner worlds, Ekalavya will forever remain immortal because of his supreme sacrifice. No other human being could have made this kind of sacrifice."</p>
