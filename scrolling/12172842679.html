<p><em>Karma Yoga</em> is desireless action undertaken for the sake of the Supreme. <em>Karma Yoga</em> is man's genuine acceptance of his earthly existence. <em>Karma Yoga</em> is man's dauntless march across the battlefield of life.</p>
<p><em>Karma Yoga</em> does not see eye to eye with those who hold that the activities of human life are of no importance. <em>Karma Yoga</em> claims that life is a divine opportunity for serving God. This particular Yoga is not only the Yoga of physical action; it includes the aspirant's moral and inner life as well.</p>
<p>Those who follow this path pray for a strong and perfect body. They also pray for a long life. This long life is not a mere prolongation of life in terms of years. It is a life that longs for the descent of the divine Truth, Light and Power into the material plane. The Karma yogins are the real heroes on the earthly scene, and theirs is the divinely triumphant victory.</p>
<p>A Karma yogin is a perfect stranger to the waves of disappointment and despair in human life. What he sees in life and its activities is a divine purpose. He feels himself to be the hyphen between earthly duties and heavenly responsibilities. He has many weapons to conquer the world, but his detachment is the most powerful. His detachment defies both the crushing blows of failure and the ego-gratifying surges of success. His detachment is far beyond both the snares of the world's excruciating pangs and the embrace of the world's throbbing joy.</p>
<p>Many sincere aspirants feel that the devotional feelings of a Bhakta and the penetrating eye of a Jnani have no place in <em>Karma Yoga.</em> Here they are quite mistaken. A true Karma yogin is he whose heart has implicit faith in God, whose mind has a constant awareness of God and whose body has a genuine love for God in humanity.</p>
<p>It is easy for a Bhakta to forget the world, and for a Jnani to ignore the world. But a Karma yogin's destiny is otherwise. God wants him to live in the world, live with the world and live for the world.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Jnana Yoga</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Jnana Yoga" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God has three eyes. Their names are <em>Bhakti, Karma</em> and <em>Jnana. Bhakti</em> wants to live in its Father's most intimate Truth. <em>Karma</em> wants to live in its Father's all-pervading universal Truth. <em>Jnana</em> wants to live in its Father's transcendental Truth.</p>
<p>The man of devotion needs God's protection. The man of action needs God's guidance. The man of knowledge needs God's instruction.</p>
<p>The Bhakta's faith in God and the Karma yogin's love for humanity do not interest a Jnana yogin, much less inspire him. He wants nothing but the mind. With his mental power he strives for the personal experience of the highest Truth. He thinks of God as the Fount of Knowledge. He feels that it is through his mind that he will attain his Goal. At the beginning of his path, he feels that nothing is as important as the fulfilment of the mind. Eventually he comes to realise that he must transcend the mind if he wishes to live in the Supreme Knowledge.</p>
<p>Life is a mystery. So is death. A Jnana yogin wants to fathom these two apparently insoluble mysteries of God's creation. He also wants to transcend both life and death and abide in the Heart of the Supreme Reality.</p>
<p>Man lives in the sense world. He does not know whether this world is real or unreal. An ordinary man is satisfied with his own existence. He has neither the thinking capacity nor the sincere interest to enter into the deeper meaning of life. He wants to escape the problems of life and death. Unfortunately, there is no escape. He has to swim in the sea of ignorance. A Jnana yogin alone can teach him how to swim across the sea of ignorance and enter the Sea of Knowledge and Light.</p>
<p>A Jnana yogin declares: <em>Neti, neti.</em> "Not this, not this." What does he mean? He means that there is a higher world than this sense-world, a higher truth than this earthbound truth. He says, in a sense, that there are two opposing parties. One party consists of falsehood, ignorance and death. The other party consists of Truth, Knowledge and Immortality. While uttering "<em>Neti, neti</em>" he asks man to reject falsehood and accept Truth, reject ignorance and accept Knowledge, reject death and accept Immortality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">What is God&#039;s plan?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="What is God&#039;s plan?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>What is God's plan? This question is often raised and discussed. Strangely enough, the very idea of God's plan attracts the attention, not only of those who believe in God, but also of those who deny God's existence.</p>
<p>Has God a plan? No, never! Making a plan means drawing up an estimate of work to be done in the future. It is the temptation of success that often inspires us to throw ourselves into activities. We want to grow into the success of the future. Hence, plans do help us to some extent. But God needs no plan. To Him, the vision of the Future is not a thing to be fulfilled, but a thing that already abides, nay, looms large in the giant breast of the present.</p>
<p>The world has ever been charmed by movement, here, there and everywhere The waning of enthusiastic movement is the downfall of human life. Each movement has to undergo ups and downs before it reaches its goal. Movement is the outer expression of an inner urge. This inner urge is the representative of God's Will in a human body seeking to play with the Beyond and to awaken the Infinite in the finite.</p>
<p>God has no plan. Neither does He need one. He is not a mental being who cannot think of the future without a plan. What God is, is Delight. What God wants us to have is Delight. We can have it only by turning all that we have and all that we are towards the Supreme Reality.</p>
<p>We must think of God's existence first, and then, if we must, we may think of God's plan. Does God exist? Where is the proof? Our very heart is the proof. Constantly our heart demands or begs of us to see God everywhere and in everything. With the aspiration of our heart, God's existence can be felt. With the aspiration of our heart we can see that God's Heaven, which is Silence, and God's earth, which is Power, are not only interdependent, but also complementary smiles of God's eternal Reality.</p>
<p>Some people say that the world has come into existence from a plan made by God. They see that the world is full of suffering and imperfection and feel that they could have made a better world if they had been given a chance. To them I say, "Who prevents you? It is you who have to cultivate the soil in order to grow a bumper crop of perfection and satisfaction."</p>
<p>Much have we learned from suffering and imperfection. What we need now is Delight and Perfection. We cannot have these two divine qualities by finding fault with a plan that we have thrust upon God. We can have Delight and Perfection only by living in God's Consciousness. There is no other way.</p>
<p>Man's interpretation of suffering and imperfection is based on his preconceived mental ideas and notions. God's interpretation is founded on His direct Vision in its absolute and ultimate Reality. Man's interpretation needs justification. But God's interpretation does not need any justification, for He is at once the Truth embodied and the Truth revealed.</p>
<p>Similarly, a spiritual man looks at God from a different angle than does an ordinary man. He feels that God has and is everything, manifest and unmanifest. His God is in the eternal process of ever-progressing Perfection. An ordinary man, however, feels that God has yet to achieve something to transform the world.</p>
<p>God is a child, an eternal divine Child. How can a child have a plan? Impossible! Just as a human child plays with his dolls, dressing and fondling them, so God, the divine Child, does the same with His dolls, the human instruments. But being the divine Child, God, whatever He does, He does consciously, significantly and divinely.</p>
<p>Man's unconscious, semi-conscious, conscious and spiritually conscious plans and God's self-revealing manifestations are inseparable. The Supreme Secret is that man's plans are always united with the Breath of the Supreme. Man has to know this. Nothing further is there to know. Man has to feel this. Nothing deeper is there to feel. Man has to realise this. Nothing higher is there to realise.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part Two: Questions and answers on the inner life</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part Two: Questions and answers on the inner life" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>How can one reconcile America's inner decay and crassness with her evolving spiritual awareness?</h2>

<p>Your question is at once extremely interesting and thought-provoking. It is a question about which one could say much. I wish to reflect on it, not from the sociological viewpoint, but from the spiritual viewpoint, which is not so well understood.</p>
<p>America's inner decay is, to me, not so grave nor so vital as you feel it to be. I take it to be a battle between darkness and Light. When we consciously open ourselves to the Light, inevitably all our unconscious weaknesses and limitations come forward to bar the way. The more the Light beckons us, the stronger become our unruly, undivine and unconscious parts. This is an inescapable spiritual law, which we can see operating in the individual as well as in the collectivity. Before proceeding to your question about America, let me explain why this law exists.</p>
<p>Ignorance has always ruled the earth, and even now it continues to dominate the earth-consciousness. The material world has not consciously aspired for its own inner fulfilment, which is part of a destined integral spiritual fulfilment of humanity. Darkness has always been the master. It does not want a higher force to take its place, so it fights with all its power to perpetuate its rule. And so, when the divine force succeeds in making an opening in a certain area of the earth-consciousness and is rewarded with a renewed aspiration, the undivine forces also intensify their efforts, creating values and ideas which are utterly empty of any higher truth. This eternal battle between darkness and Light becomes even more intense when a new and higher cycle is about to begin in the evolution of mankind, which is the case today.</p>
<p>These are the primary reasons for your feeling that a yawning chasm exists between America's high aspiration and ideals on the one hand, and some of her unlit actions and values on the other. Her evolving spiritual awareness and her hasty outer movements are not quite in collaboration with each other; they are not helping one another. Until the Light dawns fully, the true seeking cannot come forward wholeheartedly; hence, the values leading to integral spiritual progress are not much in evidence.</p>
<p>America, moreover, is a young nation. It does not want to walk; it wants to run as fast as possible in order to breast the tape first. You know that while running at top speed there is every possibility of stumbling or running off the track. Nevertheless, with America's sincere and dynamic urge for progress, her present gropings and wanderings will pale into insignificance as we vision the promise and possibilities of her future fulfilment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Do you not feel that national boundaries, economic disparity and religious dogma divide human beings into different camps, creating unspiritual environments and making peace, for an individual as well as for a nation, a distant star?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Do you not feel that national boundaries, economic disparity and religious dogma divide human beings into different camps, creating unspiritual environments and making peace, for an individual as well as for a nation, a distant star?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I do strongly feel that these national boundaries and so forth are really impairing the growth of our evolving human consciousness. But it is the clarification of the individual's mind and spirit that must precede the awakening of our social institutions such as churches and governments. It is the spiritual and mental elite who can infuse the general mass with their illumining light. As we know, the policies of institutions and nations are usually embodiments of the general consciousness. These policies can be influenced considerably by enlightened individuals. Mother India in particular has not lacked in such enlightened souls, nor does she lack them now.</p>
<p>It is only a matter of time until time itself will create an opening so the spiritual consciousness may permeate the individual and his society. On our part, a conscious spiritual effort has to be made so that the higher forces from above can come down and touch the very depths of our seeking hearts. When this occurs, the gap that we now see between our aspiration and its fulfilment in society will no longer exist.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">I would frankly like to know what India&#039;s spirituality has ever done for her. How is it that in spite of her yogis and saints, she is still a poor and backward country?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="I would frankly like to know what India&#039;s spirituality has ever done for her. How is it that in spite of her yogis and saints, she is still a poor and backward country?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>First, we must understand what has brought this situation about. In ancient India, the material life was not renounced. People in those days aspired for a synthesis of Matter and Spirit, and to some extent they were successful in achieving it. But there is a great gulf between that hoary past and the present.</p>
<p>In the later periods of India's history, the saints and seers came to feel that the material life and the spiritual life could never go together, that they had to renounce the outer life in order to attain to God. Hence, the external life was neglected. This led to foreign conquests and many other troubles. Even today, the attitude that material prosperity and beauty should be negated is very common in India. This accounts for much of her continued poverty.</p>
<p>But at present there are spiritual giants in India who feel that God should be realised in His totality, that Creator and creation are one and inseparable. They advocate the acceptance of life, the real need for both progress and perfection in all spheres of human existence. This new approach is widely accepted in modern India.</p>
<p>India may be poverty-stricken today, but she will progress quickly by virtue of her new awareness and her new aspiration. She has not only magnanimity of heart but also the power to bring her soul's strength to the fore and use it to solve all her problems.</p>

<p>Could you please tell me why you worship the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost and so many angels and saints? We in India have many gods and goddesses. As a matter of fact, we feel that each individual must have a god of his own, that each man must have his own process of realising God.</p>
<p>Indeed, these gods and goddesses are simply different manifestations of the Sole Absolute. Each deity embodies a particular aspect or quality of the Supreme. Our inability to recognise the all-embracing universal Harmony in all these different aspects gives rise to our misunderstandings and disputes. The moment we realise the universal Spirit, the impersonal One, we can be in perfect harmony with all the different beliefs. Then we can see the truth behind the conception of the various gods and goddesses.</p>

<p>Well, I must take exception to your comment and tell you that in this world there is nothing absolutely bad. The caste system has served and even now continues to serve a certain purpose. In spite of all its degenerations, it has been a system that has united the different parts of society. If we try to see it as a system uniting people instead of dividing them, we will better understand the value that it has had for thousands of years. Society was conceived as a great family. Each group worked to make it function harmoniously. In a family, one brother may be a spiritual teacher, another an executive, a third a merchant and the fourth a farmer. Each one helps the family in his own way at the time of need. It is their combined knowledge and harmonious co-operation which create a real unity in their family life. So was it originally with the caste system. Each group had responsibilities and duties. Each group worked for the good of the whole. The important thing is how this system was utilised. In its ideal form the caste system has much truth and value, but the wrong attitudes which have entered into it through human ignorance require that the present system be supplanted with something more suited to a modern and advanced society.</p>

<p>It depends entirely on the parents. If they are orthodox and conservative, they may not accept them. But if the parents are liberal in their ideas and cherish broad ideals, if they value the link between East and West, then they will gladly accept their son and daughter-in-law. From the spiritual point of view, in God's Light, it is not race or religion, but the true fulfilment of two human souls in union that is of supreme importance.</p>

<p>I have twice had the opportunity to witness such a performance. I was not afraid because fortunately I was not one of the performers. And I was not astonished because I was aware of the power of faith. They had a tremendous faith in Govinda (Lord Krishna). Chanting the name of Govinda with intense devotion, they walked unscathed over the fire.</p>

<p>I hope that you know the meaning of surrender. In real surrender, we do not lose our individuality. On the contrary, we enlarge it. For example, when we surrender ourselves absolutely to God, we become one with God in our adoration for Him. His Power is then added to ours. Surrender is entirely voluntary. Submitting out of fear, to someone more powerful than ourselves, is not surrender. True surrender is a great strength which fulfils itself when it becomes one with the object of its adoration. In India, women cheerfully and unreservedly surrender their very existence to their husbands and get the real joy of true union.</p>

<p>My young friend, it gives me great pleasure to hear your question. The supreme sacrifice is self-sacrifice for a noble cause. To fulfil God, if necessity demands, you may have to embrace death. To uplift humanity, if necessity demands, you may have to forego your own Immortality. The supreme sacrifice is this. Let us try. It is worth aspiring for.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">If man, when dissatisfied with the world, escapes the world and seeks out higher planes of existence, how will humanity ever be able to establish peace and happiness on earth?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="If man, when dissatisfied with the world, escapes the world and seeks out higher planes of existence, how will humanity ever be able to establish peace and happiness on earth?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Your question shows a remarkable sense of spiritual values. Granted, the world is all imperfection. Life stands as a huge question. Evil is seen everywhere. These are the problems that we face every day. Moreover, the more spiritually advanced a man is, the greater is his suffering; due to the present conditions of the world He sees the disease, he feels the disease, but he has no proper medicine. Even if he has a remedy, it is not enough to cure all earthly ailments. So he often feels that his fight will be of no avail and therefore takes the easier path, the path of escape into the Bliss of the higher planes.</p>
<p>But this can never be the case with a divine warrior. He will fight until the victory is won. Now what do we mean by his "victory"? it is the establishment of the Kingdom of God here on earth and not in some higher world. As he knows that the Divine is omnipresent, he seeks to reveal Him in everyday life. If we are not satisfied with the world as it is, that is no reason for leaving it. On the contrary, we should try to change it — physically or intellectually or spiritually, depending on our own development and capacities.</p>
<p>God is perfect Perfection. This Perfection can be achieved only when there is an inseparable union between Matter and Spirit, between the outer and the inner Life.</p>

It is an old theory, which I realise can neither be proved or disproved at an intellectual level." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The ultimate truth concerning life and death can never be adequately explained or expressed. It can only be felt by the aspirant and known by the realised soul. I concur fully with you that this idea, as well as that expressed by your wife, cannot be verified intellectually. However, what your wife feels about life and death cannot be proven to be any more true than what you feel about them.</p>
<p>Human memory is not the first and last word in reality. If, at the age of eighty, I fail to recollect any incidents in my life that took place before I reached the age of four, it does not mean that I did not exist before that. Just as a series of years passes by as we go from the age of four to eighty, so is there a series of lives which connects the present with the distant past and projects itself into the imminent future.</p>
<p>Then, too, there is something beyond the comprehension of our limited body-consciousness. Even while a man is grossly involved in the most ordinary physical activities, he may feel within himself, at times, some strange truths. These are usually unfamiliar and greatly elevating. These truths come from a higher or deeper world, from a different plane of consciousness, and they knock at his mental door. Thus he possesses and is possessed by forces beyond his ordinary awareness.</p>
<p>It is when we put ourselves in tune with these higher forces — indeed, with the universal harmony — that life ceases to be unbearable. I entirely agree with your wife's view that when a person sees no meaning in life, no goal or purpose, this attitude, nay the life itself, becomes intolerable. However, regarding religious beliefs, I wish to place before her an analogy:</p>
<p>I am now living in a Brooklyn apartment. If a child calls on me and asks, "Is there a place called Cologne?" I shall reply, "Certainly, my child, it is in West Germany." Suppose he says, "You must prove it to me!" Now how can I prove it to him, apart from showing him maps and photos? I can only tell him that I have personally visited Cologne and that there are millions of others who have also done so. His doubt cannot negate the existence of the city.</p>
<p>Similarly, those who have realised God fully have every right to tell us that there is a God. Just because we have not realised Him ourselves, we cannot deny His existence. Just as the child has to satisfy his physical eyes by going to Cologne, we can only prove to ourselves the reality of God by seeing Him. And this quest for God gives to an otherwise purposeless life an unparalleled meaning and direction.</p>

<p>No, my young friend, human love and divine Love are two completely different things. If I give you fifteen cents and you give me a piece of candy, that is called human love. In divine Love, you don't wait for my fifteen cents. You give me the piece of candy cheerfully of your own accord. Divine Love is sacrifice, and in this sacrifice we are fulfilling God's Will, consciously or unconsciously. In human love, we display the buyer's and the seller's love, which is synonymous with self-interest. Mind you, I am not saying that human beings cannot express divine Love. They can and sometimes do. But consistent divine Love is, at present, rare in human beings.</p>
