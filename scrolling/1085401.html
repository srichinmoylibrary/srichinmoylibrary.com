<h2>Question: If all Gurus are one instrument of God, why is it so important to have exclusive devotion to only one Guru?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not a question of exclusive devotion. Only you have to know in whom you have implicit faith. All are one, true. But you have all love for your father and for your mother and not for somebody else's father and mother. A real Guru is like a parent. He personally guides you on your spiritual journey and takes you back home safely. Others, like your uncle, can take you, but you have more faith in your father because you know that your father has more concern, more love for you than your uncle does. All Gurus are one, but you have to know that some are like uncles, some are like cousins and some are like nephews. So naturally you have to pay more attention to your father.</p>
<p>One particular Guru has taken utmost responsibility for you, and has promised to take you to your destined goal. So he deserves your exclusive devotion. He is taking the full responsibility to show you the Face of God. Others are only inspiring you, giving you a little help. But in his case, he takes it as his own responsibility. Unless and until he can show you the Face of God, he will not be satisfied.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: It seems that the Supreme loves you more than He loves Himself.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: It seems that the Supreme loves you more than He loves Himself." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you consider God on the physical plane or vital plane or mental plane or psychic plane or any plane except His own highest plane, then He will have more love for me than for Himself. Where there is a sense of separativity between God and me and I am one inch lower than He is, then He will have more love for me, because I am His descendent. The mother knows that her son is one step lower. From the mother, the son came. Therefore, the mother has more love for the son than for herself.</p>
<p>The Creator has more love for the creation than He has for Himself. If the Creator feels that He and His creation are of the same standard, then they are one and inseparable. In that case, if you call someone the Creator, then the creation is also the Creator. If you call something the creation, then the Creator is also that thing. If they are of the same standard, then you cannot separate them. At that time, who is loving whom more? The Supreme is loving me more when I pray to my highest Consciousness. But when I actually enter into my highest Consciousness, at that time there is no difference between the Supreme and me; my lowest consciousness and my highest Consciousness are totally one. That is why sometimes I ask my disciples to try to realise the Supreme in me. Then a day will come when the disciples will have to realise the Supreme in themselves. But there is no difference. From the highest point of view, the Supreme in the disciples and the Supreme in the Master are one.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it necessary to have any particular background before following your path?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it necessary to have any particular background before following your path?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In our path, one does not need a background. If one has gone to various spiritual groups and then comes to our path, it can create problems for that person. If one is sincere, that is more than enough. If one is ready to reach the highest goal at God's choice Hour, then that is more than enough.</p>
<p>If you have meditated for five or six or ten years at home or under some spiritual Master, or if you have read a few books, this background may help, true. Again, if many people have thrust knowledge or wisdom upon you, then it may only create confusion. Each Master has his own way of teaching. Each one is right, absolutely right, in his own way, but if a particular Master is not the Master who is meant for you, then some confusion may arise. This has happened in many cases. So if you get your own Master right at the beginning, if you are very fresh in the beginning and have not been influenced by other seekers or Masters, then it is much easier for you.</p>
<p>So I say that the only background you need is sincerity, your feeling that you want to follow our path. We start with a cry, an inner cry. A child is not taught by the mother how to cry. The mother does not tell the child that he has to cry. She does not teach the little baby, "If you cry, then I will give you candy. If you cry, I will give you milk." No, it comes spontaneously. When he needs a piece of candy or milk or something, he cries. In the spiritual life also, when the seeker enters onto a path, if he cries most sincerely and soulfully, then that is more than enough. At that time, the Inner Pilot, the Supreme, who is my Guru, your Guru and everybody's Guru, listens to this cry. Then He illumines the seeker in His own way. At every moment, the Inner Pilot will guide you if you follow a specific path most sincerely and devotedly.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I practised pranayama before I met you. Now you are offering a different technique. I was wondering if meditating on you is the same as delving within myself?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I practised pranayama before I met you. Now you are offering a different technique. I was wondering if meditating on you is the same as delving within myself?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is an interesting question. The answer is: it entirely depends on the individual. Suppose you are a disciple of mine. You have become my disciple precisely because you feel something in me — Peace, Light, Bliss or Power. Some divine quality you have felt in me, and you feel that this divine quality can easily enter into you or has already entered into you.</p>
<p>I have all kinds of disciples — first class, second class, third class, fourth class and fifth class disciples. The fifth class disciple naturally cannot be as good as the first class disciple. But no matter which category one belongs to, if a disciple of mine can meditate on my Transcendental picture, then he is bound to enter into my inner divine consciousness.</p>
<p>Suppose you have not received any specific meditation from me, but you feel that you are inwardly drawn toward me. What you should do is concentrate on my picture and try to enter into the consciousness that you see there. If you have already seen something or felt something inside me, if you have seen around me a blue light or some other colour light, then you have faith and it becomes really easy for you to enter into me. The best way to enter into me is through my forehead, through my third eye, which is the eye of vision. If you find that difficult, then try to breathe in slowly and steadily and imagine that I am also breathing with you rhythmically at the same time. You can be as close as possible to my picture, and when you breathe in, try to imagine that I am also breathing in with you. If you feel that we are breathing simultaneously, then it will be extremely easy for you to enter into me consciously.</p>
<p>But if purification has not taken place in your outer nature, then it may be difficult for you to enter into me. Your own impurity prevents you. But don't think that you are the only impure person, and that all the other disciples are very pure. Far from it. You have asked me a sincere question, so I am answering you. Impurity can be in the physical, in the vital, in the mind, or in the heart. Only when you develop purity does it become very easy to enter into the consciousness of a spiritual person. When you have meditated for some time, a day will come when you will feel that there is no difference between your highest consciousness and the consciousness of your spiritual Master. You will feel that the spiritual Master is only your own highest part, the most developed part of your own self. When one realises God, one does not realise God as a third person or a second person or in somebody else. No! One realises one's own highest consciousness, and this consciousness one sees is really one and inseparable with the highest consciousness of the Master.</p>
<p>On our path you don't have to practice pranayama or any other spiritual techniques. I do not give importance to these things. I only give importance to aspiration. To practice pranayama without real guidance is very dangerous. I know of three persons who have died from it — a father and two sons. If you really want to practise pranayama, then you should do it under the guidance of a spiritual Master. But I tell you, there are other ways, other paths to the same goal. There are many ways to go to Rome, but one road may bring you there half an hour earlier or even one second earlier than the other roads. As all religions are true in their essence, so all spiritual paths are true; but one path is bound to be a shortcut. We call this shortcut the sunlit path.</p>
<p>The sunlit path is the path of aspiration. There can be nothing more fulfilling than aspiration. Through aspiration the seeker becomes part and parcel of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. As freedom is your birthright, God-realisation is also your birthright. You have to realise that at one time you knew God most intimately. But ignorance has entered into your consciousness, into your nature, and now you have forgotten Him. If you really want to get Him back in your life, then aspiration is the only answer. Inside the heart of aspiration, three things must loom large: love, devotion and surrender. They are the keys that can open the doors of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. Love, devotion and surrender make up our path, which we feel is the true sunlit path.</p>

We have heard that you are very strict in accepting disciples and that you do not accept everyone that comes to you.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I would like to know what you demand from your disciples and what your relationship is with them. We have heard that you are very strict in accepting disciples and that you do not accept everyone that comes to you." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are absolutely right when you say that I am strict in accepting disciples. Some disciples may think that this strictness is a weakness on my part. I can say only that I am helpless; I can't help being strict. You ask what I demand from my disciples. As a matter of fact, I have no right to demand anything. But I sincerely expect from them certain things, which you can call my fee. All spiritual Masters demand a fee, according to their own inner light. My fee is aspiration, my fee is regularity. If an individual has genuine aspiration, then he has given me my fee. And if he has regularity in his spiritual practice, then he has paid me my dues.</p>
<p>When an individual is regular, he must also feel the necessity of punctuality. In the spiritual life everything has to be disciplined. So if you meditate at the same time early every morning, it will help you considerably. It is at that hour that God will knock at your heart's door, or you will knock at the door to God's Heart. So aspiration, regularity and punctuality are all necessary.</p>
<p>There is something more that I expect from my disciples and that is love, divine love. Human love fails; we have heard from other people and we have seen ourselves in our own life how human love is bound to fail. Human love binds, and that is why it fails. Divine love expands, and that is why it excels and succeeds. So I tell my disciples, if you have to love an individual or a spiritual path, always try to offer your divine love.</p>
<p>When you offer your love, you have to offer it through your devoted feeling to God. I tell my disciples that I am not their Guru. There is only one Guru. Their Guru and everybody's Guru is the Supreme. No human being can be a Guru because only the Supreme, the Almighty, the Absolute, is the real Guru. Spiritual Masters are mere instruments. We are like elder brothers of the family. Younger brothers do not consciously know right now where the Father is. So the elder brother says, "Look, our Father is seated on a throne. Come here and see." Then the role of the spiritual Master is over. But first of all, before love, before regularity and punctuality, I need from my disciples the inner cry of aspiration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is your relationship with your disciples based upon?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is your relationship with your disciples based upon?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My relationship with my disciples is based upon love, concern and compassion. Each spiritual Master has the same relationship with his disciples. There is no spiritual Master who does not have concern for his spiritual children. He is like a father. Sometimes a father is strict and sometimes he is not. Some parents feel that it is through strictness that their children will make fast progress. Other parents may feel that it is through love that their children can make good progress. As a spiritual father, I have come to realise that love is undoubtedly the most powerful force, but that love and divine authority must go together.</p>
<p>There is a great difference between divine authority and human authority. Human authority is autocracy and dictatorship. Divine authority is based on the strength of inseparable oneness with the disciples. Because the Master has taken responsibility for bringing each disciple to God, he knows what is best for the disciple. An ordinary dictator or autocrat gets tremendous pleasure in lording his power over others. But the spiritual Master does not get any pleasure from his divine authority. It is only with deepest concern that he is acting for the disciples' own good. If he tells a disciple to do something, he knows that it is for the disciple's own progress. He says, "I will be one with you in your ignorance in order to take you to the Goal." Then the Master's divine authority encourages the disciple not to exploit his own soul's patience, or the patience of the Supreme, whom the Master represents.</p>
<p>So my relationship with my disciples is one of constant concern and love, and also divine authority. If you really follow my path, you will do as I tell you. If you don't like my path, you are at liberty to leave my path today. I will not compel you to stay with me. But if you follow my path and if you really want to make good progress, then along with my love and concern, I will also use my divine authority. If I see that you are wallowing in the meshes of ignorance, I will use my divine authority to compel you either to come out of ignorance or to leave my path.</p>
<p>My strictness is also a form of my divine concern. When I am strict with someone, at that time it is not punishment. I am only trying to bring to the fore the roaring lion inside the disciple, so that his ignorance will be destroyed. Because it is used in many forms, people may misunderstand it; but my disciples, my sincere and devoted disciples, know that when I use my divine authority, it is not my dictatorship; it is only my inseparable oneness with them.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> After you have chosen the path, once you are sure of your path, it is the Master's responsibility to tell you what you should do and what you should not do. But the choice lies with you in the beginning. You have to decide whether that path or that Master is meant for you. Once you have chosen a path, then it is the responsibility of the Master to give you a specific meditation, or to inspire you inwardly. He may not speak to you, he may not be physically in front of you, but he will have an inner communion with you. He will have a free access to your soul and your soul will have a free access to his soul. He will be able to tell your soul how to guide you and mould you in both your outer and your inner life. The Master is fully responsible for you only when a mutual commitment has been made by your soul and by the Master. But the Master is not fully responsible for someone who has joined his path on a trial basis. If the Master makes a commitment at that time, he will be misunderstood. Immediately the seeker will find some motive behind the Master's acceptance. He will say, "Oh, I am a great singer," or "I come from a very rich family; that is why the Master needs me." This kind of wrong idea will enter into the mind of the seeker.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I don't want to take the credit. Your consciousness is like a bird. You have the bird and you have the tree. The bird is flying up to sit on a higher branch; later it may come down. But it is true that every day I meditate on you. Very often I get vibrations from you and others and then spiritually I project my consciousness into your physical consciousness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, on the contrary, I will be very happy if my spiritual child is thinking of me. If he is cursing me, then I will feel miserable; but even if someone spends his time cursing me, it is a blessing for him. There was one particular individual who hated the Buddha. But the Buddha said that one day this person would attain Nirvana because at least he was thinking of the Buddha twenty-four hours a day. He was thinking all the time how to capture the Buddha or how to destroy him. That was a negative approach. But at least he had focused his whole consciousness on the Buddha. Of course, it is always better to approach the Master in a positive way.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it a good idea to discuss your spiritual experiences with your brothers and sisters?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it a good idea to discuss your spiritual experiences with your brothers and sisters?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not advisable to discuss inner experiences with your spiritual brothers and sisters. Although they belong to the same family as you do, they have not yet conquered jealousy. Outwardly they will act happy and extol you to the skies. But inwardly their hearts will burn and they will try to take away the essence of your experience through jealousy and other low forces. There is no hard and fast rule, but even if a disciple is extremely close to you — let us say your husband or wife — still jealousy can arise.</p>
<p>Sometimes when people have an experience and tell their friends about it, their friends doubt it. At that time, immediately the strength, power and light of the experience disappears. Doubt has the power to immediately take your experience away. In the outer life, if you tell others that you are suffering or in a low consciousness, then you will get some sympathy from them and they will try to elevate your consciousness. But when it is a matter of very high, sublime experiences, there is every possibility of being misunderstood or creating jealousy or being assailed by others' doubts. So please keep these things to yourself. Your experiences will eventually turn into realisation, which is like broad daylight. You cannot hide the daylight, but you have to hide the flame because there are people who can blow out the flame with jealousy or doubt.</p>
<p>You should, however, let your Master know. Your spiritual Master alone is not jealous of you, because he has had infinitely higher experiences. Also, he knows that no disciple will have a major experience without his personal inspiration, knowledge and conscious or indirect help. If you tell the Master about an experience that you have, it will only add to your conviction. Or if it was only a mental hallucination, the Master can tell you so. Some people do get false experiences. They read a few books dealing with higher experiences and then these experiences unconsciously enter into their minds; unconsciously they are trying to assimilate the sublime experiences of the person who has written a book. But sometimes even that person has not had the experiences. He has only borrowed them from somebody else's book. At that time the Master will be able to tell the seeker whether or not his experiences are genuine and really the result of his inner aspiration.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Master to tell your experiences to, then what can you do? You have to try to observe where the result of the experience leads you and what you are getting from it. If you get peace, light and bliss in abundant measure, then you will know that the experience is genuine. If it is a real, genuine experience, your mind will become calm and quiet and your heart will enter into perfect poise. Only in perfect poise does one get the highest type of experience. But if the experience is false, it will create excitement in you and it will compel you to tell your friends about it so you will get their appreciation and admiration. But this will only create jealousy in them. You have no right either consciously or unconsciously to increase their jealousy. So the best thing is to keep your inner experiences to yourself.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Please tell me what to do when I feel rejection from my spiritual brothers and sisters.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Please tell me what to do when I feel rejection from my spiritual brothers and sisters." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you feel rejected by your spiritual brothers and sisters, the human in you will be sad, frustrated and furious. But the divine within you will immediately pray to the Supreme for forgiveness for your brothers and sisters. The only way they will get illumination is if the Supreme forgives them.</p>
<p>Suppose I am your spiritual brother and I have rejected you. The human in you will immediately become furious and try to take revenge, or it may withdraw. You will want to have nothing to do with me because I have rejected you or insulted you. But at that time the divine in you will try to come forward with compassion because it knows that I have made a serious mistake in rejecting you. If you also reject me, tit for tat, then in what way are you superior to me? What I have done is wrong. It is very bad, true, but if you do not want to do the same wrong thing, then you have to forgive me and you have to ask God to forgive me as well.</p>
<p>The Christ prayed "Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do." Similarly, you should pray to God on behalf of your brother or sister, who is the real culprit at that time. This is the first thing required. Secondly, you should pray to God for his illumination, so that he does not reject you or anyone else in the future. If he is really forgiven and illumined by the Supreme, then he will not reject you again.</p>
<p>But if you also play the same role, and reject someone who has rejected you, then both of you are going to be swimming in the sea of ignorance. He has done something wrong, and you are doing the same thing. Paying him back in his own coin does not serve any purpose. What you want, after all, is the illumination of your spiritual brothers and sisters.</p>

Isn&#039;t it also true that man meditated and created God&#039;s Divinity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God created man's divinity. Again, when man meditates, man realises God's Divinity and becomes one with God's Divinity. When man consciously becomes inseparably one with God's Divinity, his own divinity and God's Divinity become absolutely one at that point. And at that time man feels that he and God have always been inseparably one.</p>
<p>Everything started with God's own Unity. He was One, but He felt that He wanted to be fulfilled in and through the many. God was One, but He wanted to hear the message of multiplicity in Unity. So He meditated and created man's divinity. Man wants to grow into the very image of God and hear the message of unity in multiplicity. So man meditates on God's Divinity. This is how man meditates on God's Divinity and how God meditates on man's divinity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you go high up, then you will see. Spiritual Masters often say that the cosmic gods and goddesses try to prevent them from going beyond their domain. In the beginning parents teach their children to pray to God. They take them to churches and spiritual places. And then, when the same children want to follow the spiritual path strictly, the parents stand in their way. When the children grow up and take spirituality seriously, the parents feel jealous of the spiritual path. They are afraid that they will lose their children, or that their children are going to surpass them in their love for God. Either with a sense of jealousy or a sense of insufficiency, they feel that the children will transcend them. Here also, the cosmic gods and goddesses try to help spiritual seekers, but when they see that we are transcending them, they try to stop us. When we go into their realm, we will see that the power they have is not unlimited. So they are afraid that we will surpass them.</p>
