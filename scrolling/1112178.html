  <h2 id="page-title">Protection, protection, protection!</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Protection, protection, protection!" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Around 7:35 this morning, if not for Divine protection, I would have gone to God! I was jogging very slowly on 150th Street, near my 300-metre mark. I was on the sidewalk, going towards the Grand Central Service Road, when I saw a car approaching from the side street on my right to cross 150th Street. It was coming at about 50 miles per hour. Another car was approaching on 150th Street. It was going towards the 150th Street hill at about 30 miles per hour. All of a sudden, both cars saw each other and tried to stop. But the car that was coming at 50 miles per hour from the side street lost control of the steering and smashed into a telephone pole less than 10 metres away from me. The car went up onto the sidewalk. It finally stopped when it hit the fire hydrant which was right in front of me. The whole thing was over in a matter of seconds. If that car had gone a little more to the left, I would definitely have gone to the other world. But at the moment before the car hit the fire hydrant, my whole body was lifted up over a little hedge and a part of the lawn belonging to the house on the corner, and I landed on the first step of that house.</p>
<p>You all know the story about the time in India when I jumped from a moving train and landed quite safely far away in a paddyfield. This time there was no jumping on my part. My body was just lifted up and I landed in a standing position on the first step of the house, about five or six metres away. What a crash there was! You have no idea what a loud noise it made. The sound was so terrifying. But the man who lived in that house did not come out to see what was happening. I was the only witness and I was also almost the victim. The car that had been travelling on 150th Street collided with the one that hit the fire hydrant, but not seriously, and it stopped about five feet away. It was driven by a gentle, old lady. Her car was slightly damaged but, fortunately, she was not injured. The old lady got out of her car in an absolutely panicky way and started screaming at the Puerto Rican lady who had been driving the other car, "What made you drive so fast?" Alas, the Puerto Rican lady could not come out of her car. The lower part of her face was covered with blood. While the accident was taking place, these ladies did not see me standing there. But afterwards, the old lady was looking at me. I would have been another victim, like them. There was broken glass everywhere and parts of the first car had also flown all over the area. The first car was totally smashed. I prayed in silence for a few moments. Then I said to myself, "What am I doing here?" So I started jogging again. I went to my 800-metre mark and started coming back. Usually I never talk to anybody while I am running, but when I came to the accident place I saw Pragati. I asked her, "What happened?"</p>
<p>Pragati said, "O Guru, there was a terrible crash!"</p>
<p>Then I told her the whole story. She was so horrified. When I was talking to her, my physical body was shaking. If not for God's Protection I would have been in Heaven. Then I also saw A, H and Sulochana at the place where the accident was. By that time, quite a large crowd had gathered. You cannot imagine how many people had come in five minutes' time. They were all discussing the accident. I saw an ambulance, but there were no policemen. They took the Puerto Rican lady out of her car and put her in the ambulance. They did not put her on a stretcher, but they carried her into the ambulance. One man was holding her head. Perhaps her neck was broken. There were two or three more people in her car, but they were all right. Afterwards, I took Databir, Radha and Nilima to see the place where the accident happened. The owner of the house was sweeping up the glass. I could still see pieces of glass near the step where I landed. Another old man said that he has been living there for thirty-five years, and he has been trying to get the city to put a red light on that corner. So many accidents take place there, according to him. So I always say to meditate for one minute before you drive or before you do anything. The old man who was fighting to have a red light installed said to me, "You should pray to God and thank God that you are still alive."</p>

<p>This evening, at about 5:30, I went out for a run. When I crossed my 800-metre mark, I saw a tall, black girl wearing an absolutely flamboyant outfit. She was running quite fast towards me. She started screaming, "Hi!" When she screamed, "Hi!" to me, I asked myself, "Who is she? She is not one of my disciples, but she is speaking to me as if she knows me quite well." I was guarded because I did not know her at all. Perhaps she was happy to see another runner.</p>

<p>A few days ago, while I was running, I noticed that some flowers had been placed on my 300-metre mark where there was a terrible car accident two weeks ago. I have been praying that the Puerto Rican lady will recover from her injuries, but usually flowers signify that someone has died at that place.</p>

<p>I ran six and a half miles altogether today. Early in the morning, while I was running on 150th Street, I am sure I saw Snigdha. She was behind me on the other side of the street. Then she went ahead of me so fast. Such long strides she was taking! I will give her a special prize. She is injured and cannot run the marathon, but she is very good over short distances. Later I went to watch our marathon in Flushing Meadow Park. There they were playing the tape of me singing "Nayan nehari." I was admiring my soulful performance.</p>

<p>I was running on my course near Jones Beach. There were five cyclists in a single line, all perhaps in their thirties, wearing uniforms. One by one, as they passed by me, they said, "Hi, Sri!" Each one said exactly the same thing. I was on my third mile and they were going quite fast when they saw me. How did they recognise me?</p>

<p>I went out to run at five o'clock and around five-thirty I was returning home. I saw a middle-aged man with a small dog that looked like Kanu, but it was even smaller than Kanu. The dog was on the sidewalk. I said to myself, "I do not want to be bothered by the dog." So I came down from the sidewalk and entered into the street. The man said, "Why are you afraid of this puppy?" I said, "I am not afraid. I was smiling at the dog and I came very near it." I asked the man, "What is his name?" He replied, "Billy." I smiled at Billy and at the owner. Then I continued on my way.</p>

<p>Yesterday, as soon as I started the very first step of my run, rain had to come and bless me. Before that, there was absolutely no rain. But, as soon as I came out of the front door, my very first step was blessed by rain. I said, "O God!" Then I felt something very thick and heavy on the neck of my jacket. I said, "That means there is a hood there." So I opened it and found a hood to protect me from the rain. Even that little jacket had something!</p>

I understand that you do not run nowadays because you have injuries and also you have taken up weightlifting. I saw in the newspaper that you have lifted 600 pounds."

<p>One man came up to me and asked, "How come I see you at different places along the course?" I told him that I watch the marathon from many different points along the way. This time I received so much inspiration from the New York City Marathon. I have decided to start practising 30 miles a week. Every Monday I will run 13 miles. Then next year I will run marathons. I will start with the Chico Marathon. In a marathon, no matter what speed you go, something becomes tired. If you go fast, your legs become tired, and if you go slowly, your mind becomes tired.</p>
