 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Many say that we are entering into the end of this age, and that the world is going to end quite soon. I was wondering what you had to say about it.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Since your childhood I am sure you have been hearing that the world is coming to an end. And our grandfathers were also told the same story. The world is not just a tiny spot. It will not be destroyed totally. A portion of the world may be destroyed by an earthquake or some cataclysm, but the whole world as such is not going to be destroyed. Human aspiration is not going to come to an end.</p>
<p>Human aspiration is like an upward movement. It goes up, then it bends a little and then again it goes up. Human aspiration may go up and down, ascend and descend, but ultimately it just goes up. If somebody becomes tired while he is climbing, then in his time of relaxation perhaps he comes down a little. But when he is again inspired, he will go up again and finally he will reach the Highest. The world is not going to come to an end because human aspiration is not going to come to an end. Human aspiration may one day be very hot and another day it may be lukewarm, but when it once starts in us, it will carry us to the highest Absolute. Before it reaches that Goal, it will not be satisfied. So long as human aspiration exists in the earth atmosphere, this world will never be totally destroyed.</p>

What are they looking for?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know that among these young people there are some sincere seekers, as among all men there are some who are sincere and some who are insincere. If these seekers are really sincere, then they are looking for some light. If they are insincere, then they are only moving around out of curiosity, like vagabonds.</p>
<p>Today, out of curiosity, they come here; tomorrow out of curiosity they will go elsewhere. On the other hand, if they are sincere seekers who are looking for light, then if they do not find light in one place, at that time they will go and look for it somewhere else.</p>

If people leave their houses untidy, does it affect their own consciousness?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I never approve of this. The inner world is your right hand and the outer world is your left hand. If somebody keeps his room unclean, if he then takes a shower and goes to the Centre, still that person is only half clean. That person will carry the uncleanliness of his house with him. So the best thing is to do both: to keep the house clean and also to observe personal cleanliness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We need not give up anything; only we must see our capacity — that is, how much poison we can digest right now. Radio and newspapers have good things also; but the difficulty is that in order to get five minutes' worth of good, we spend perhaps three hours. In order to get something nice on television, we spend hours and hours watching bad things.</p>
<p>We do not have to hear everything, see everything and read everything. We have to discriminate. Radio, television and newspapers are easy to misuse. We are over-indulging; we are enjoying beyond our capacity to assimilate.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, no, not in the proper proportion. If you just hear the news in the morning, or watch something instructive on TV, then there is nothing wrong in it. But if you listen to rock and roll for hours, or watch all kinds of silly things on television, then you are just squandering the little light that you have been able to receive during your meditation.</p>

If you burn all your novels, are you really overcoming what may be a genuine need at that time?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one enters into the spiritual life and feels that the spiritual life comes first and foremost, then let him gain some strength in the spiritual life before he begins to indulge in this kind of entertainment. When a seeker enters into the spiritual life, his first and foremost concern is to pay all attention to his meditation, to his aspiration. If he wants to have a large view of human life — the emotional life and all that — then he should first establish some purity, some confidence, some light inside his system. When he is strong enough in his own aspiration and meditation, then let him read. But if he is not well-established in his spiritual life, then everything he reads or sees will affect him. So why should he put an unnecessary burden on his shoulders? True, it will not ultimately prevent him from reaching the goal, but it will definitely delay his progress.</p>

I was wondering what kind of attitude we should have toward our cars?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have an automobile, take it as part of your physical body. Whatever attitude you have toward your body, take the same attitude toward your car. If you neglect the body, you will die. Then you cannot realise or manifest God. The body is of paramount importance, but it is not for luxury. My disciples are not millionaires, and they are not using their cars to enjoy themselves or to wallow in the pleasures of ignorance. But in this modern age, especially in America, a car is a necessity.</p>
<p>In America we are fighting against time. If we live in an Indian village, then we can make friends with eternal time. But here every second counts. If we can do two things in one second, then why should we do only one thing? If we have a car, it does not mean that we will not walk or run or take exercise. But if our office is in Manhattan and we are living in Connecticut, then what will we do?</p>
<p>Since it is a necessity, we must keep the vehicle in good shape. It helps us considerably in fighting against time and achieving things sooner than at once. In this case, we have to give due importance to a vehicle that is more than ready to help us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are in the subway, when you are dealing with wrong forces, undivine forces, you can do two things. The occult process is to imagine the sound of the subway and then to think of all the bad people on the subway put together. Then try to imagine a sound from those people and also the sound of the subway. After you do this, with your creative imagination you will try to create another sound which is infinitely more powerful than the sound of the subway and all the bad people on it. Your sound can easily drown or destroy the first sound. The sound of the subway and the vibration of the bad people have created a negative power all around. So you create a positive power which will either engulf, destroy or illumine that power. This is the occult process. The occult life means always to be a warrior, always to fight.</p>
<p>The spiritual way is different. Before you enter into the subway, meditate on the Supreme for Protection and for Compassion. As soon as you leave your house, pray to Him. If the Protection and Compassion of the Supreme work together inside you, then naturally they will be infinitely more powerful than all the dangerous and undivine forces in the subway.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you think of the Supreme or repeat His name, then you will have protection. If you are walking along the street, just repeat "Supreme" over and over again. The problem is that after you meditate in the morning you forget about the Supreme. But the moment you go out of your house, you have to feel that you are exposing yourself to world-ignorance. When you are in the midst of an undivine atmosphere, you have to be very careful. At that time there is only one remedy: repeat the name of the Supreme most soulfully. Then you will have protection.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have time and space to measure our capacity: what we were, what we are and what we shall become. We do not want to remain forever at the same level. If we stay all the time in one particular consciousness, then we are acting like a stagnant pool. We have to be like a running river. A river has to flow towards the sea. A pool does not flow. We can decorate it, we can make it beautiful, but since there is no movement, no constant progress, it will not give us the ever-transcending joy. When we enter into the world of progress, we get the greatest joy because we are all the time transcending. Time and space inspire us to transcend ourselves.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has to create. While He is creating, He has to have a place of His own. When you go out and pitch a tent, that is your place. The world is very vast, but you feel that in this tent you will work, you will play, you will eat, you will sleep, you will do everything.</p>
<p>When you go to a workshop, what do you see? The workshop has walls, it has a floor and a ceiling. But inside the workshop people are working and making things. The boundaries mark their field of creation.</p>
