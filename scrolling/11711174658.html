<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are levels of the mind: higher mind, upper mind, divine mind and so on. Then comes the Supermind. After the Supermind there is another level which is called <em>sat-chit-ananda</em> (Existence-Consciousness-Bliss). But the Supermind itself is far beyond the ordinary mind. It is not in the mind proper.</p>
<p>Intuition is something totally different. Intuition comes from the third eye, the vision-eye. The level of the Supermind is infinitely higher than the plane of intuitive consciousness which you call intuition.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the spiritual point of view, angelic consciousness cannot transform human nature. Angels are like flowers or beautiful children. A flower as such is not going to make me beautiful or fragrant. But it can give me the inspiration to pray to God to make my heart as beautiful and as fragrant as the flower. So angels can be a source of inspiration, but they cannot actually transform our consciousness.</p>
<p>If you sit in front of an ocean, you can see and appreciate the vastness, but your consciousness will not automatically become as vast as the ocean. The consciousness of the ocean, the vastness of the ocean, we will get only by praying to God. So, the angelic consciousness is a source of inspiration, but it cannot help us to realise our goal.</p>
<p>Angels have a sweet, childlike consciousness, but for you to get rid of your forty-year-old consciousness and come back to your four-year-old childlike consciousness, you have to pray and pray. Angels do give us inspiration and joy, but to become what they are, a childlike, sweet consciousness, you have to pray and meditate.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I have read in one of your books that you said one of your disciples was from the angelic world. Did I understand that correctly?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I have read in one of your books that you said one of your disciples was from the angelic world. Did I understand that correctly?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Why would an angel take incarnation in the human world?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Usually angels do not come to earth in a physical body. But they like to have different experiences. I am a foreigner; I come from India. I could have remained in India because India is a vast subcontinent. But I got the inspiration to come to America. It is exactly the same in the case of the angels. Angels usually do not want to come to earth because they are so subtle, beautiful and delicate. This world of ours is full of suffering and our human bodies are composed of gross matter, whereas theirs is angelic. Angels are so subtle, so beautiful, so ethereal, that they do not want to take on the solid mass of a human body. But again, some angels say, “No, we want to have the experience of earthly life.” So on principle they do not come, but every rule admits of exception.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Something in them draws them to human life?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They want something new. They want to go somewhere. Similarly, I could have been satisfied in India, but I wanted to have something new from America.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If they enter into human consciousness, then they become more reliable, dependable and efficient instruments of God. Let us say you have a small ferry. If you want to keep that ferry, you can carry me and a few other people across the river. But if you have an ocean liner, you can take hundreds of people. Why do spiritual Masters come into this world? They could have remained in the soul’s world. They come into this world to carry millions of people in their big ocean liners. So it depends on the individual. Either you want to help one or two individuals to become good, or you want to inspire countless people to become good, illumining and fulfilling. From where they were in Heaven, the angels can deal with only one or two individuals. But if they take human incarnation and inspire countless people, then they are doing greater service, infinitely greater service to God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What do you mean when you talk about a mental path versus the path of the heart?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What do you mean when you talk about a mental path versus the path of the heart?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The difference is quite noticeable. When we live in the heart, with the heart and for the heart, we always feel we can accept the world and become part and parcel of the suffering world. But when we are in the mind, we start criticising others and thinking that we are perfect. If I remain in the mind, I will see you as imperfect and myself as perfect. But if I live in the heart, then I will feel that what you have and what you are I have to claim as my own, very own. If we remain in the heart, we become one. Your imperfections I must accept as my own imperfections. And if you also live in the heart, you will take my imperfections as your own imperfections. Then if you are happy because you have done something great, I will feel that it is I who have done it and vice-versa.</p>
<p>But when we are in the mind, we are constantly doubting others. We cannot accept others’ joy as our own. Immediately, jealousy, insecurity and impurity attack us. If I am in the heart, then immediately I feel that you are God’s creation. We have to love each other, we have to become one, inseparably one. In this way we can solve all our problems. Otherwise, if I start doubting you, whether you are a good person or not, then this mental argument never ends.</p>
<p>The feeling of oneness inside the heart, once it starts, never ends. Once we enter into the river, we see that the river is flowing into the ocean and finally it becomes the ocean itself. But if the river does not flow, it becomes a stagnant pool. The mind is always trying to see the negative qualities of others. Whose mind is happy when it sees somebody else achieving something glorious? Nobody’s. But if you live in the heart, you will act like a child. A child is so happy when his father achieves something and the father is so happy when his child achieves something. So the simple way is to follow the path of the heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Thank you. That’s a useful distinction to make.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind needs illumination. There are two rooms. One is the heart-room; one is the mind-room. The heart-room already has light in it. So we have to enter into the heart-room and then take the light from there to the mind-room. But if we enter into the mind-room first and find that the mind-room is unlit, how are we going to bring light into it? We have to be wise. If we enter into the mind and stay there, we will never come to the heart-room. But if we enter into the heart-room, we will get illumination in abundant measure and then finally in measureless measure. Then only shall we enter into the mind-room. We are not going to neglect the mind-room. Only we have to be wise. For the time being, we have to remain inside the heart-room in order to collect light and bliss. Then there shall come a time when we shall enter into the mind-room. Nothing on earth will remain imperfect. But we have to be very wise. Only the things that are inspiring, aspiring and illumining we have to accept in the beginning.</p>
