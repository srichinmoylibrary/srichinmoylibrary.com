  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What if the soul is really very good, very spiritual, and the rest of the being is creating problems for the soul?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What if the soul is really very good, very spiritual, and the rest of the being is creating problems for the soul?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that time the soul will do something! If the soul is trying to manifest the Supreme at every second, but the rest of the being is not listening to the soul, at that time the soul will definitely do something. The soul may not have the power of a great spiritual Master, and the soul cannot have the power of the Supreme, but it has infinitely more power than the heart, vital, mind and body. So if these members are really interfering with its progress, the soul will punish them before it becomes a hopeless case. The soul will mercilessly punish the body, vital, mind and even the heart. It will give them an absolutely unthinkable punishment so that they will be forced to surrender to the soul.</p>
<p>It is like this. The father is begging the son to come home, but the son is delaying, delaying, delaying. Perhaps the heart is trying to come, but the vital or mind want to play football or something else. After waiting and waiting, finally the father will give the son a smart slap. At that time the son listens to his father and comes home.</p>
<p>So if the soul is very developed, and if it is desperately trying to please the Supreme, but the body, vital and mind are not, then the soul will use its divine strength. The soul does not want to accept defeat. It took human incarnation with this body, this vital and this mind in order to do something for the Supreme. If it cannot fulfil its purpose, then the soul feels miserable. But it all depends on the soul's connection with the Highest. Not all souls have the same connection.</p>
<p>I know of one case where the soul punished an individual by not allowing him to speak for fifteen years. Just before this happened, that individual was talking with his Master, and the Master was crying inwardly because he could see that this punishment was about to begin. Sometimes ignorance is bliss. If you do not know anything about the soul, you can say the punishment was an accident, or you can blame it on natural causes or karmic reasons. But sometimes the soul is the real reason you have this problem and that problem, or why you have contracted a serious disease.</p>
<p>The soul is such a tiny thing — tinier than the tiniest. But it is also mightier than the mightiest. One of our most famous Indian mantras says: "Tinier than the tiniest, yet larger than the largest, the soul dwells in the secret heart of man." Like a magician, at this moment it is tinier than the tiniest inside the heart. But when it becomes absolutely huge, like twenty lions right in front of you, at that time, how are you going to ignore it?</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You do not have to pray to the soul to come to me. Your souls are praying to <em>you</em> to come to me. Your souls are dying to be with me and to please the Supreme in me at every moment. To think that the body, vital and mind are going to bring the soul to God is a real joke! It is the other way around. The soul is constantly crying for the body, vital, mind and heart to come to the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, many have come. They have come from Sri Ramakrishna, Buddha, Sri Krishna, the Christ, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi and others. A few have also come who had been with me in my own previous incarnations. In Japan, when one of these souls recognised me, how he cried! In front of so many people he was crying and crying. Others also have recognised me, but they did not create such a scene. A few brothers and sisters of mine from previous incarnations have also joined our path. I even gave one disciple the same spiritual name that he had when he was with me before.</p>
<p>In my last incarnation, some seekers came to me in the evening of my life. I said, "Soon I will leave the body, but I will take another incarnation. Come back to me at the beginning of my journey in my next incarnation, when I shall be on earth for a long time." When I started my journey in America, some of them did come back.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It has happened in many, many cases that for months, even years — and not just a few years but ten or twenty years — somebody has been miserable. People who were once aspiring, after they lose their aspiration, suffer unbearably. Then, all of a sudden the Grace descends at the moment when they are receptive, and their suffering is gone. It is like taking medicine. Sometimes it takes years and years before the medicine works. Then all of a sudden you are cured, and you think it is a miracle.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some spiritual Masters declared the date of their realisation, whereas others did not. Sri Aurobindo declared a specific date when the Krishna Consciousness fully descended into him, and he recognised that day as the day of his God-realisation. Buddha also declared his realisation on a specific day. Sri Ramakrishna, on the other hand, did not observe any date for his realisation. In my case, I do not want to declare it. Also, I achieved realisation in previous incarnations. Again, there is no end to our realisation, since God Himself is all the time transcending His own Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. So God-realisation, after it has been attained, can eternally be transcended, expanded and perfected.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If you develop occult or other spiritual powers in one incarnation, do you keep them in future incarnations?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If you develop occult or other spiritual powers in one incarnation, do you keep them in future incarnations?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Most of the time you accumulate these powers. If you become spiritually rich in one incarnation, then you become richer in your next incarnation — unless you misuse your powers. If you misuse your powers, then they go. My maternal uncle had tremendous occult power. People used to come and touch his feet, begging him to help them. "Oh, please cure my wife," they would say. "She is dying and I cannot live without her." Or, "My cow has been stolen, please help me to get it back." So he would use his occult power without consulting God's Will, and gradually he would lose it. Then he would cry to Mother Kali, begging her not to give him occult power again because he was always misusing it and did not have time to think of her. But Mother Kali always used to give it back to him. She wanted him to learn how to use her gifts properly.</p>
<p>At first my maternal uncle thought that he was being compassionate by helping these people. Later he saw that by using his human compassion he was only creating more problems, because usually it was God's Will that these people suffer the karma that they had earned.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can a spiritual Master use occult power to destroy wrong forces and expedite a seeker&#039;s progress?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can a spiritual Master use occult power to destroy wrong forces and expedite a seeker&#039;s progress?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the past the Masters used occult power not so much to elevate the seekers' consciousness as to destroy wrong forces. Destruction is very easy. It takes just a few minutes to destroy a building. But if you want to rebuild the building and make it better, it takes a very long time. This body, vital and mind we have built over many years. If there is some dislocation inside the body, inside the vital, inside the mind, we try to cure it. We try to repair the house and make it into a good, strong house.</p>
<p>This is what the spiritual Masters are trying to do today. In the past they did not have this kind of compassion or patience. They would tell the seeker once or twice what he had to do, and if he did not listen, they would just destroy! In the twentieth century we are a little wiser. We give someone many chances, and if he does not do the needful, we just let him linger and linger without making much spiritual progress. The destruction part does not come from the spiritual Masters. People sometimes have seen me looking very powerful during meditation. You may have seen how powerfully I have meditated on someone. But you have no idea what kind of power you would have seen if I had opened my third eye!</p>
<p>Many years ago when I was a teenager living in the Ashram, I showed this power to the Ashram's strongest boy. He was a close friend of mine, very fond of me, but he did not believe in occult power. He felt all swamis and sadhus were fakes. I insisted that some people do have occult power, but he did not believe me; he challenged me to show him. So I was caught. I told him to come the next morning to a small room where I used to work in the library. When he arrived, I asked him to stand against the wall, and then I used my occult power to take away all his strength. I thought he would just fall against the wall and nothing serious would happen. But after three or four seconds he collapsed at my feet, absolutely unconscious. When he woke up, he was terrified, and he ran away. He told people that I had tried to kill him with my eyes. After that he was always afraid of me. If he saw me walking on the sidewalk, he would cross to the other side of the street. So I lost a good friend because I misused my occult power.</p>
<p>Because of my love for mankind, I do not use my occult power much in this incarnation. But occult power does exist. Just because you do not have a million dollars you cannot say that millionaires do not exist on earth. The power I use to help my disciples is not occult power but spiritual power. Spiritual power is infinitely stronger than occult power, but it does not destroy, and usually it takes more time to act. Occult power is like a ferocious wave, whereas spiritual power is like the ocean itself. So you can see the difference between a powerful, tumultuous wave and the entire ocean.</p>
<p>Spiritual power has only one task: to raise the consciousness of humanity. Occult power does not do that; it mainly destroys. If occult power is properly used, and if the seeker is ready, in the twinkling of an eye it can destroy the wrong forces in the seeker. But if it is used improperly, it can be very destructive in an uncontrollable way. Spiritual power is slower, but slow and steady wins the race.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the soul's world, our faces are very beautiful. But when we enter into the earth-consciousness, we lose much of that beauty. When we are in the soul's world, or when the soul's consciousness permeates our entire body, we become so beautiful, so ethereal — with absolutely unimaginable beauty. But when we are in the vital consciousness or physical consciousness, there is such a difference!</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, you do not have to be on the verge of realisation to be consciously aware of the soul. Far from it. If you have real devotion, your devotion can easily make you consciously aware of the soul. So many of my disciples have experienced this. Not only have they felt their souls, but also they have exhibited the soul's consciousness for a day or a month or even a few years because of their sincere devotion. Sincere devotion can perform miracles at every moment. It is like a sharp knife. It will just cut into pieces anything that is unclean, impure or unwilling in you. Even unreadiness it will not allow.</p>
<p>Someone may fold his hands, but his devotion may be totally false or superficial. The hands are folded, but the mind is roaming somewhere else. When you fold your hands, you have to feel that your very heartbeat is entering into the nerves of your fingers. If there is real devotion, how can a disciple do anything wrong? Devotion has a very powerful magnetic pull that immediately draws the Master's compassion and affection. Even if you are lost in a dark cave, immediately the Master's compassion will pull you out. If someone has pure devotion even for a minute, he will make real inner progress. With your devotion if you have caught someone who is affectionate, powerful and illumining, or if that person has caught you, will he not give you what he has and what he is?</p>
<p>When the Master receives the disciple's devotion, he responds, not only with compassion and affection, but also with divine pride. Divine pride is not like human pride. It does not say, "Oh, that person is so devoted to <em>me</em>." No, divine pride says, "How wonderful that the disciple is pleasing and manifesting the divine in himself." It is the kind of pride that the parent feels when the child does the right thing. Since the disciple is the Master's spiritual son or daughter, the Master feels divine pride when the disciple does the right thing, the spiritual thing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have real devotion, you immediately feel that something is going out of you and entering into your Master and that something is coming out of your Master and entering into you. When there is real devotion, there is always a link between Master and disciple; the disciple's highest divinity and the Master's highest divinity remain all the time together.</p>
<p>Inside devotion there will always be surrender — not the surrender of a slave to his master, but rather the surrender of the lower part in you to your own highest self, which is what your spiritual Master represents. Also, inside devotion there will always be gratitude — first surrender and then gratitude.</p>
<p>Genuine devotion the Master will definitely see inside your eyes. When you have real devotion, your eyes will look like beautiful flowers. They will be filled with beautiful light; absolutely divine beauty the Master will see in them. Human beauty we can describe with words, but divine beauty can never be described. Anything divine we cannot describe adequately with human language.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If we are trying to give up something undivine and want to make a promise to our soul to lead a better life, are there certain auspicious times when we should do it?

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day is not the same. When I am meditating on a disciple on his birthday, let us say, this is his golden opportunity to renew the inner promises he has made to the Supreme or to his own soul. If someone made a promise ten or fifteen years ago that he will try to be a most devoted, surrendered disciple, his birthday is his golden opportunity to renew that promise. Even if the disciple has not pleased the Master for ten years, he gets the opportunity to please the Master on that special day.</p>
<p>You cannot make a promise every day; otherwise, it becomes mechanical. But if you do it on certain auspicious days, then the force behind the promise lasts for a long time. A special day surcharges your inner promise with extra strength.</p>
<p>My father and my maternal uncle were very close. When my maternal uncle was alive, he used to beg my father not to smoke. Still my father used to smoke two or three times a day. He could not give up this bad habit. When my maternal uncle died, my father shed bitter tears and made a vow never to smoke again. He said, "When you were alive I could not listen to you. But now I give you my solemn oath that I will never smoke again." My father lived for four or five years after that, but he never smoked. So that kind of thing can happen when you take a solemn oath on a special day.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why does the soul come forward most powerfully only on our birthdays?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why does the soul come forward most powerfully only on our birthdays?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Who is keeping the door closed? Instead of putting beautiful and divine flowers in your mind, you are putting garbage there. When the soul wants to come forward, do you think it will be inspired to come if it sees only garbage? Instead of a beautiful garden, if the soul sees doubt, fear, suspicion, lack of faith and other undivine things right in your mind or in other parts of your being, why should it take the trouble to come forward? But if you have flowers or beautiful and pure thoughts there, then the soul will definitely come. So you have to see what kind of readiness you have to bring the soul forward.</p>
<p>Some people's souls may not be as developed as others'. But even if the soul is not as mature, sometimes the vital or mind — according to their capacity — may be more obedient to the soul. These people have more simplicity because they do not utilise the mind. They did not develop the mind from the beginning, so that is a great advantage for them, spiritually.</p>
<p>The level of spiritual development is not the most important thing when it is a question of bringing the soul forward, or allowing the soul to come forward. People may be developed enough, but out of laziness or carelessness they do not do the needful. I know that milk will give me better nourishment than water and lemon juice. But out of laziness or callousness, I do not want to take the trouble of going to the supermarket to buy milk. Because I have lemon juice inside the house, I do not take the trouble of going to the store. But laziness is not the only problem. Even if you are not lazy, readiness, eagerness and willingness must also be there.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Inside the Universal Consciousness there are millions and billions of faces. In their outer form, all these faces are different, but they all have the same divinity. The divinity I see in your face I will also see in his face and her face. When I see many individual faces flooded with light in the Universal Consciousness, I see only one Face. If you want to count the number, they are countless. From a physical point of view, I can see many, many faces. But in terms of radiating divinity, I see only one Face.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a higher world where poetry originates?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a higher world where poetry originates?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. When your consciousness awakens or somehow you enter into those higher worlds, you find that everything is already written. You do not have to be God-realised to go to these worlds. The great poet Rabindranath Tagore, for example, did it. So did Sri Aurobindo, although of course he was God-realised. I started doing it when I was thirteen or fourteen years old. Some of my poems I really did not write; I just saw the words on the wall and copied them down. Quite a few poems that I wrote in 1944 came to me like that. I was seeing the exact words, punctuation, everything. These poems came from that world.</p>
<p>It is not that I have stolen somebody else's words. They were all prepared in some other world, but not yet manifested in this world. When you get inspiration, it comes from your heart and your mind, and it also comes from another world. You are just the messenger who is conveying it. But what I am talking about is more than that. In the poetry world the words are written — absolutely written.</p>
<p>Sometimes a being will come and dictate. Sri Aurobindo said that one of his books was not written by him at all, although it had his name on it when it was published. According to Sri Aurobindo, a particular being dictated it from beginning to end.</p>
