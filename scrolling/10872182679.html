<p>Some Indian shopkeepers show me such devotion! In one store I gave an Indian man $10, and he was supposed to give me $5 change. But I said, "I don't need the change. You keep it."</p>
<p>He followed me outside to the car with folded hands to give me back the money. He wanted to give me the full $10 back. I wouldn't take it, but later we found that he had slipped the $10 bill inside the car.</p>

<p>In my room I keep a book that contains difficult English words. Many times I have looked at that book, marking words here and there.</p>
<p>Today I went to a bookstore and bought another copy of the same book. I thought it would give me inspiration.</p>
<p>I didn't see any other book in the bookstore that I wanted, so just because I wanted to buy something, I bought a book I knew was in my room!</p>

<p>The day before yesterday I was in a boutique in Woodstock, which is my most favourite town. As soon as I entered the store, the young girl in charge said with wide eyes, "Sri Chinmoy? Sri Chinmoy? I know you! I saw you for the first time when I was three years old in Flatbush. My mother lives in Brooklyn, and she has come to your meditations many times."</p>
<p>She gave me the store card and asked me to autograph it.</p>
<p>I said, "What is your name?"</p>
<p>She said, "You don't have to write down my name. Just write your name."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, but I would like to know your name."</p>
<p>She said, "Ayesha."</p>
<p>So I wrote, "Dear Ayesha, with my good wishes," and I signed it. She was so happy.</p>
<p>This world is so small. She used to live in the Flatbush area. I also used to live there. Now she is 16 or 17 years old and lives in Woodstock, which I have visited so many times over the past 24 years.</p>

<p>Today I went shopping in a Chinese store where the lady likes me. As I was paying, her husband came up to me and grabbed my shoulder. He was smiling.</p>
<p>He said, "7,000!" and raised his arm. On his wall was the picture of my 7,000-pound lift.</p>
<p>He has a 16-year-old son named Nick. He said, "Nicholas looks at your picture every day. He is your best admirer!"</p>

<p>I said, "It will take such a long time?"</p>
<p>He corrected my English and said, "It is not too far, not too far."</p>
<p>I was thinking, "What will happen if I fall asleep? Let me see how much time it will take."</p>

<p>In Korea, I bought a beautiful swan pin for Tanima. As I was paying, right behind me I saw an Indian man and woman. The man was dressed in Indian dress and the lady was wearing a sari.</p>
<p>They were speaking in Bengali, so I asked if they were Bengali, and we started talking in Bengali.</p>
<p>The man asked me, "Do you live here?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, I come from America."</p>
<p>He told me that he had been living in Korea for six years. He said he was a famous engineer.</p>
<p>Then he asked me what part of Bangladesh I came from.</p>
<p>I said, "I come from Chittagong."</p>
<p>He said, "I come from a place you do not know."</p>
<p>When he told me the name, I said, "It is a very famous place. So many great Bengali writers were born there."</p>
<p>The man did not know the names of the writers that I mentioned.</p>
<p>Then his wife said, "Please come to our house to give us the dust of your feet."</p>
<p>That is the Bengali way of saying, "Just come and eat."</p>
<p>I said, "I am here with so many people. I will not be able to come."</p>
<p>She said, "Just come for a few minutes. You are such a wise man." But the husband did not want me to come and got very mad. He and his wife started fighting. The man said, "He will come on my deathbed!"</p>
<p>I said, "I don't want you to die." Then I disappeared.</p>

<p>In another store in Korea, I saw something I liked and asked the elderly lady at the counter how much it cost.</p>
<p>The lady said, "$13." I had bought a few things already from her, so I said, "No, $10!" and gave her $10.</p>
<p>She said, "No, you have to give me three more." Since I was bargaining, I told the lady I had no more money.</p>
<p>I thought that all my money was in my left pocket and that only some papers were in my right pocket. To show the lady that I had no more money, I pulled all the papers out of my right pocket. O God, so much money came out!</p>
<p>The shopkeeper said, "You have money."</p>
<p>What was I going to do? I smiled at her very soulfully and offered her the other three dollars, but she didn't take it. She gave me the item for $10.</p>
<p>When I said I had no money, I was not telling a lie. I was just bargaining in my Indian manner. But after she saw all my money, I smiled at her and she became so nice!</p>

<p>He was an American, so he did not bargain. I did not have the heart to tell him what I was paying. I didn't want to get into a fight with the shopkeeper.</p>

<p>In Greece everything had a fixed price. On the street they were selling very cheap things, but all for a fixed price. The items they were selling were so bad-worse than useless.</p>
<p>I wanted to enter into a shop to see if they had anything different. At the entrance to the shop were two English-speaking ladies. One of them touched my hand to stop me from going in.</p>

<p>She said, "200."</p>
<p>I said, "No, 160." She didn't say anything, so I went up to 170. But there was still no sign that she would give it to me. After I said 180, I was about to go away.</p>
<p>Then she said, "Yes, you can have it."</p>
<p>I gave her 200 bahts, and she returned 30 to me. I said, "Why are you giving me 30? The price was 180."</p>
<p>She said, "No, I decided in my mind to sell when you said 170."</p>
<p>I said, "No, I agreed to pay 180," and I returned 10. She started jumping with joy and giggling. She was so happy that I gave her back 10 bahts.</p>

<p>I wanted to buy two small garlands for R. I thought that the little girl who was selling them said that they were five bahts, but then she said, "No, that is for the shorter ones."</p>
<p>Then Savyasachi helped her by saying, "These are a little larger."</p>
<p>I wanted to buy two for five bahts, but she said, "No, five for each."</p>
<p>Finally I said to myself, "I have to buy them. " So I gave her 10 bahts. Then she started giggling because she had gotten such a high price.</p>
