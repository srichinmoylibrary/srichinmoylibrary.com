<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here you have to know that you are not trying to surrender to me. Kindly try to surrender to the Supreme in me. It is by offering gratitude daily to the Supreme that you can increase your surrender to the Supreme. This is the fastest and most effective way. Every seeker has to give to the Supreme what is best in him. Gratitude is by far the best quality that you and others have as seekers. So if you give to the Supreme your best quality, your best possession, naturally He will give you something which will expedite your journey, increase your speed towards God-realisation, towards your own self-discovery. If you give what is best in you, He will offer you something which will immediately help you to run the fastest to achieve your ultimate Goal, and that is surrender. The Supreme will increase your surrender provided you give Him your best quality, which is gratitude.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When a child stands in front of his father and the father starts counting his money, the father tells the child, "This is all your money, only if you get it now, you won't be able to use it for any proper purpose." But the child is satisfied with one cent, or a nickel, which he gets from his father. Demand comes only when we feel that we will not get the thing that we want or need, that it will go to somebody else. A child knows that his father will eventually give him all his possessions when the proper time comes. When the father holds on to his money, the child does not make any demands. When he comes to hear that it is all his money, he is satisfied with the nickel that he has.</p>
<p>I am your spiritual father, and I am giving you boundless Peace, Light and Bliss. You make demands because you feel that everything is going to somebody else, that somebody else will grab my spiritual wealth. But a spiritual Master, if he is really a spiritual Master, will have Peace, Light and Bliss in boundless measure. These things can never decrease no matter how much he gives to somebody else. You have to feel that the very spiritual qualities that you want, you will definitely get when the time comes.</p>
<p>If you try to pull and push, you are making a serious mistake. By pulling and pushing you cannot expedite God's Hour. You will do your best; you will aspire as sincerely as you can, but the hour of your fulfilment will be fixed by God and not by you or me. We cannot fix the hour. If God wants to give you realisation tomorrow, then you will get it tomorrow. But if He wants you to have realisation four years later, then you have to wait for it. Just because somebody else has attained God-realisation does not mean that you can get it immediately. You will definitely get everything eventually, but if you demand from God, this only delays your progress. You can have perfect trust in the Supreme that when the time comes, you will get everything. If you want to expedite the hour with your personal vital demands, I am sorry to say, that will be total failure. At that time you will become responsible for your life. When you do not make demands, God is responsible for your life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I know whether I am doing my will or your will?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I know whether I am doing my will or your will?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People are under the impression that if they are exercising their own will, everything is all right, and if they do not use their will, then they are useless people. But spiritual surrender is not like that. A spiritual Master is not like a boss; he is the highest part of yourself. Your head and your feet are both part of you, but you know that your mind is more developed than your feet, so you follow the dictates of your mind, not your feet. But in the spiritual life you are going far beyond the domain of the mind. Your existence comes from the highest triple Consciousness. This finite existence comes from <em>sat-chid-ananda,</em> infinite Truth, infinite Consciousness and infinite Delight. You are part and parcel of that. You have to feel that I am your highest part, and not a separate individual. I am a human being, agreed, but if you want to be totally merged into my divine consciousness then you have to make yourself feel as empty as possible. If you can leave your vessel empty, then only can my will enter and fill you to the brim. If you are already filled with your individual dispositions, propensities, etc., then I am lost.</p>
<p>So every day make it a point to have no will of your own. Consciously try to feel that my will is your will. When the Christ said, "Let Thy Will be done," this was the highest realisation expressed by a human tongue. You can also feel the necessity for your will to be totally and indivisibly one with my will. Early in the morning, the first thing you must do is to pray to the Supreme like this: "I offer my will to my Guru. Let his light flow in and through me." My will represents the Will of the Supreme.</p>
<p>I wish to tell you that it is infinitely easier to go to the Highest through me than to enter into the Supreme directly. You may feel that there is no necessity for a spiritual Master, but how are you going to reach the Goal? There are many rungs on the spiritual ladder, and if you do not climb up them, then how are you going to get to the top? So early in the morning, every day, try to surrender your will and, at the same time, try to feel that my will is your will in a divinised form. Then you will see that there can be no problem in your life of aspiration and realisation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are in my physical presence, please try to feel one thing: that the divine within me, not the human in me, is all love for you. Feel that there is nothing that the divine within me will not do for you. You have to feel that you have a free access to my soul. If you have to go from your living room to your bedroom, there may be some obstruction in between the two rooms. But if you want to go from your existence and enter into my divine existence, there will be no resistance. If you want to enter into my spiritual heart, the heart which has been serving the Supreme in you and in everyone, then you will find no difficulty in entering there. There will be no obstruction whatsoever between your aspiration and my illumination. If you can remember this, then you will be able to remember my presence.</p>
<p>If you try to run from one room to another room in your house, you may bump into something and break your leg. But in the case of the divine in me, the faster you run to it, the sooner you will get it. And the sooner you get it, the better for you, for me and for everyone.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you consider God on the physical plane, vital plane, mental plane or psychic plane — on any plane except His own highest plane — then He will have more love for me than for Himself. Where there is a sense of separativity between God and me, and I am one inch lower than Him, then He will have more love for me, because I am His child. A mother has more love for her son than for herself. He is her own creation; therefore, the mother has more love for the son than for herself. The creator has more love for the creation than for himself.</p>
<p>But if the Creator feels that there is no difference between His creation and Himself, that they are one and inseparable, at that time who is loving whom more? The Supreme loves me more than Himself when I pray to my highest Consciousness. But when I enter into my highest Consciousness, at that time there is no difference between the Supreme and me. We are totally one.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, try to remain near the tree, then try to remain always at the foot of the tree and not at a distance. Once you are at the foot of the tree, try to look up and see how far your vision can go. If I see that you are really trying to heighten your vision, then Grace will descend from the Supreme, who is your Guru, my Guru, everybody's Guru. This Grace is like a magnet; but, the magnet will operate only when it sees that you are anxious to be pulled by it. So, if you go to the foot of the tree and then look up towards the top of the tree, the Grace-magnet will come and pull you up. This is the only way a disciple can reach the height of the Master. Grace will only descend after you have made your own contribution by coming and touching the foot of the aspiration-tree.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Why do you ask your disciples to meditate on your picture?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not require it. My disciples can meditate on the sky or the sea. Our path is the path of love. I tell my disciples to meditate on anything that they love, as long as it is something vast. So since they love my vast consciousness, I tell them to meditate on me. The spiritual life is nothing but the expansion of love. I do not say that the disciples have to look at me. I only want people to realise God, whether they meditate on my picture or on something else. But I see clearly that my disciples see and feel something in me. Naturally if they see something in me and feel something in me, then it is best for them to meditate on me. The power of their meditation is entering into the Supreme in me. I am not deceiving them.</p>
<p>The real object of love, who is God, is inside my heart and inside your heart equally. The only thing is that you do not have enough faith in yourselves. Otherwise I would have told each person to meditate on himself. But if I tell my disciples to meditate on themselves, only their egos will be fed. Their egos will come forward; they will say, "I am Brahma, I am God." Then, when their mind comes forward with a little doubt, they will simply be engulfed in a sea of doubt and frustration.</p>
<p>That is why I do not advise my disciples to meditate on themselves. I tell them, "Be humble. Concentrate on a flower or a flame and inspire yourself." In India I have seen many people who say, "I am Shiva, I am Brahma, I am Krishna." And eventually they just became insane.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Should we look at you with our hands folded while we meditate?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Should we look at you with our hands folded while we meditate?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You do not have to look at me. If your eyes are hurting from tension, then keep them closed for a minute or two, but not indefinitely. If you keep your eyes half or a quarter open, I will be very grateful. Otherwise in most of the cases, the disciple just enters into a relaxed consciousness. He enters into the world of sleep and he is unaware of it. He thinks he has meditated but he has only slept. Unconscious is the right word.</p>
<p>When you keep your eyes open, it is called the lion's meditation. On the one hand you are aware of what is happening around you and, at the same time, you are in touch with the inner worlds. You are keeping full mastery of both the inner world and the outer world. But don't strain your eyes. If necessity demands, close your eyes for a moment.</p>
<p>If you look at me with folded hands, you will receive much more than otherwise. When you fold your hands, the Supreme in me receives devotion from you. At that time your entire body becomes a burning flame of aspiration and prayer. The entire body-consciousness aspires. If you fold your hands and you are in a cheerful frame of mind, your prayer will be infinitely more soulful than otherwise. At that time, even the gross physical tries to offer itself to God, and it receives what God wants to give in a most soulful manner.</p>
<p>So if you can look at me in a very cheerful and soulful mood when you fold your hands, you will be able to increase your humility, devotion and other divine qualities. The significance of folding one's hands is to bow down to the Inner Pilot who is guiding me and who is guiding you. With folded hands you show devotion to the Supreme in you and to the Supreme in me.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are afraid of me because you feel that you will be exposed. Unconsciously you may think, "In the morning I was jealous, I doubted my spiritual life or I did something else wrong." Immediately the mind thinks of something, and you become afraid. But if you feel at that moment, "No, I am not the mind, I am the heart," then you will not be afraid. When a child sees his mother or his father coming close to him, if he knows that he has done something wrong, he will be afraid. If he has not done anything wrong, then he will not be afraid. But if he has a very kind and loving father, then even if the child has done something wrong, he will not be afraid, because he knows that his father will not give him a slap or scold him. It is his father's concern to perfect him that he sees.</p>
<p>The moment you have faith in your Master, you feel, "It is my concern to be good, and it is his concern to make me good." Then you will have no fear. The moment you think that you have done something wrong, either in your mind or in your actions, feel that my concern to make you perfect is infinitely greater than your concern to perfect yourself. Then there will be no fear. Fear comes because you feel that you will be exposed by my light. Instead, if you can feel that it is not with your effort but with my power, with my compassion that you will be able to change, then you will not be afraid. First you have to feel that ninety-nine per cent will be done by my concern and compassion, and one per cent will be done by your own power. Later, you will feel that that one per cent was also my effort. In this way, there can be no fear, no matter how close or penetrating the light is.</p>
<p>Feel that you are the heart. If you feel that your heart has the capacity to identify with my compassion, forgiveness, concern, love and blessing, if you can identify yourself with my positive qualities, then your negative qualities — fear, doubt, anxiety and worries — will automatically go away.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Do you meditate every day?</p>
<p><em>Disciple:</em> About fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very strange. You meditate for only fifteen minutes a day and you find it difficult to meditate regularly. Please pray to the Supreme to give you more capacity, because I will not be able to tell you that you are losing your joy because you are pulling beyond your capacity. A seeker has to meditate at least an hour daily — a half hour in the morning and in the evening — no matter what his standard is. Those who have accepted our path must make it a point to meditate for at least an hour, even if you meditate sincerely for only five minutes, and then your mind starts roaming. I feel that this is something absolutely necessary. One hour of meditation is expected from all those who are following our path.</p>
<p>You may say that you cannot meditate daily, or you do not meditate well, but please try. Every day you do not eat the most delicious food, but you do eat something, because you feel the necessity of food to keep the body going. In the spiritual life also, please feel the necessity of the soul's nourishment, the inner being's nourishment. If you do not have a profound meditation every day, that does not mean that you will not meditate anymore. In the inner life please try to feel the inner necessity of your soul. Please meditate every day even if you feel a desert inside your heart on certain days. All seekers on our path should meditate at least an hour a day. It can be divided into fifteen minutes four times a day or half an hour in the morning and in the evening. Otherwise one cannot make much progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, should we meditate while driving?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, should we meditate while driving?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I used to run the one hundred metre dash, in a matter of ten or eleven seconds, God knows how many times I meditated on Him. I stood first in the running race, yet while standing first my mind was on God. You may say, "How could you be thinking of God so devotedly? If your mind is on God, you will change lanes on the track and be disqualified." But no, I did it. So if you have developed the power of meditation and you are an expert in meditation, then you are in a position to do meditation while driving. Everything depends on the development. If you are in a position to meditate while driving, you are not doing anything wrong. But if a beginner in the spiritual life tries to meditate while driving, then he will have an accident.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What is your personal definition of God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Before I give my personal definition of God I wish to say that everybody's definition of God is always correct. It is not that a spiritual Master alone will be able to give a definition of God. No, even a child can give an adequate definition of God. He will give it according to his understanding, his capacity, his inner awakening. Each individual, irrespective of age, irrespective of standard, can give an answer to this question according to his inner awakening and inner illumination. Some spiritual Masters say that God is Light. Others say that God is Consciousness. Still others say that God is Power. A fourth group will say that God is a personal Being. Everybody's definition of God is right in its own way, because in that particular way God has come to them: as Love, as Consciousness, as Power, as Delight, as a Being with personal attributes, and so forth. When we criticise others, saying, "No, your definition is wrong; mine is right," this is absurd. He is right because he speaks on the strength of his inner realisation. What you are saying is right on the strength of your realisation. I am right on the strength of my realisation.</p>
<p>According to my realisation, my personal definition of God is Love. God is all Love. He is dearest to me because in Him I see infinite Love. I see that He is both the eternal Lover and the eternal Beloved. In the individual seeker before he realises the Highest, God is the lover. To the seeker who is aspiring for the Highest, God is the Beloved Himself. Eventually the lover and the Beloved become totally one. Man and God are eternally one. Man is God yet to be realised fully, consciously and integrally. And God is man yet to be manifested on earth totally.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have seen the Supreme in many forms, but the form I appreciate or admire the most, and the form He Himself likes best for me, is a very brilliant one, all golden, shining and very, very tall. In just a second, like pressing a button, I can see Him in this form, so high that you cannot conceive of it, infinitely immense and brilliant. That is the form I enjoy the most.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do you also take different forms?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do you also take different forms?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day we wear different clothes and assume different duties in our lives, but we are still the same person. For us there are many different things to do; for God there is all Delight. God is constantly playing a game of hide-and-seek with us. It is His divine, Cosmic Game. Sometimes He takes the form of a great-grandfather and just plays with His great-grandchildren. If He takes the form of a child, what else can you expect? He is eternally playing. God knows that we will win the Game, so He can always enjoy Himself. If you know that you will lose at a game, then you become lazy; you will not participate wholeheartedly. But in the Supreme's case, He gets tremendous joy in the Game itself, not in the result. He does not feel any different when He wins or loses the race.</p>
<p>I have taken many hundreds and thousands of forms, but my disciples have never caught me. Sometimes if I want to show my inner capacities, I show them in dreams or meditation. A Yogi can take any form in the subtle planes. When I show you my capacity in a dream, you get joy. But the following morning, your mind comes forward and doubts it. If I advise you in a dream, you will be thrilled, overjoyed. Then, after a few hours, you say, "He has given me such bad advice!" First you get joy from my advice, then the mind comes forward and the joy is lost. I become a stranger to you. If a stranger gives you advice, naturally you will be furious. But if I can enter into your heart and make you feel it is your own discovery, your own realisation, the following morning you will say that you have discovered something divine. When this discovery remains inside you, for days and months you will cherish it.</p>
<p>So real spiritual Masters try to do everything like a thief. They let the disciple feel that he himself has discovered something very special. Likewise, God is always playing the Cosmic Game of hide-and-seek with us, becoming whatever is necessary in order to offer us Peace, Light, Bliss and Power.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From a spiritual person people have to get all the things that he has to offer. To the disciples I wish to offer one thing. During my talks I offer something different. I should be given the opportunity to offer what I want to offer. Here I am sociable, but at other times, when I am supposed to remain in my highest, if I have to come down to an ordinary person's level, it will be a mistake. I want to lift them up to my level.</p>
<p>When I meditate at the Centre, you have to come upstairs and be in a meditative mood. Only then will you be able to receive. If you stay downstairs and talk or eat, thinking that just because you are in the church, it is enough, that will be a mistake. You have to go upstairs, raise your consciousness and meditate. When I mix with you people on your own level, it is not that I am coming down. When somebody is drowning, I offer my hand to save him: but he also has to offer his hand and hold on to mine. If I remain always on the distant shore, how am I going to lift him? At that time I have to come near him, and he has to stretch out his hand so that I can save him.</p>
