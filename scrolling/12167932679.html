<p>Twice yesterday a taxi driver took advantage of me. In the first incident, the ride was supposed to cost 400 yen, but the man kept driving around until the meter said 1,600.</p>
<p>In the evening another taxi driver took me to the wrong street. I was showing the driver the map, but even then he brought me to the wrong place. He told me in Japanese, "I don't know." What a rogue! I was so furious! In Japanese he apologised.</p>
<p>In Queens some taxi drivers charge $100 for a $10 ride. Such corruption!</p>

<p>Tagore wrote that the Japanese don't show emotion, and before I came to Japan I believed him. But now I see that perhaps Tagore touched the Japanese mind, whereas I am touching the Japanese heart.</p>
<p>When we were leaving, three Japanese women disciples were crying and crying at the airport. Psychically it was their souls that were crying. So Tagore was wrong. If you touch the heart, even if it is a stone heart, it will show emotion.</p>

<p>Comparing the Okinawa consciousness to the ordinary Japanese consciousness is like comparing the village consciousness to the city consciousness. The city consciousness feels it is superior because it has the mind, whereas the village consciousness feels it is superior because it has the heart.</p>
<p>The village consciousness says, "You say we are uncivilised. But what has your civilisation taught you? To be indifferent!"</p>
<p>If one village person needs money or assistance, others will give it to him. In the city, a rich man will not come to your aid even if you are the poorest man!</p>

<p>On the way to the Taj Mahal I was reading a cute Taj Mahal story. I have read that kind of story before. Many wives are more than eager to die if their husbands are ready to build another Taj Mahal for them. The wives are ready to be immortalised, but the husbands are not ready with the money-power or heart-power.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A Chance Encounter At The Taj Mahal</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A Chance Encounter At The Taj Mahal" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I was inside the main gate, about a hundred metres from the Taj Mahal, taking nice pictures with my Indian camera. I didn't take my American camera, but instead I bought the most expensive Indian camera. It was most expensive in Indian terms, but for me it was most inexpensive — less than fifty dollars.</p>
<p>All of a sudden Ranjana called out to me. She was standing with a woman who was wearing Western dress, and she said, "Guru, look who is here!"</p>
<p>Then immediately a young Western woman came over to greet me, and told me that her sister Susan was my disciple. We have quite a few Susans on our path, so I asked, "Susan who?"</p>
<p>The answer came: "Susan Elliott."</p>
<p>I know my disciples' first names, but their surnames only God knows! "Who is Susan Elliott?" I asked myself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the young woman added, "She is from Canada." Something within me said perhaps it was Susan and Vince. In the meantime Ranjana came over to me with the other woman. It turned out I was right, and this woman was Susan's mother.</p>
<p>I told her mother, "Susan is very dear and close to me."</p>
<p>Her mother corrected me, "You mean Susan and Vince!"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, both Susan and Vince are very dear to me."</p>
<p>She was thrilled and excited to have met me there, and I too was very happy.</p>
<p>Over the years the disciples have given me thousands of gifts — good or bad, beautiful or ugly. But I remembered that a few years ago Susan's mother had sent Susan a shawl from India, which she had asked Susan to give me. I was blessing myself for remembering this! So I thanked her for the gift she had sent through her daughter. She was very happy.</p>
<p>Then she introduced me to her husband. While she was introducing me, she was so happy, thrilled and excited, but the husband — I have to be very frank — was stiff and uneasy; he was a little scared. Susan's younger sister, Amy, was so happy and excited because she was the one who had been able to recognise me. How? Susan had sent her my picture. If she had sent the transcendental picture, perhaps her sister would not have recognised me. But Susan had sent a picture of me with my dogs, and Amy immediately recognised me from that picture. So you see, my transcendental picture is not the only one to send people. If you send more ordinary pictures, then immediately people can recognise me.</p>
<p>Can you imagine? Susan's family happened to be there on the same day and at the same hour as we were. Credit goes to my dogs, to Susan for sending the picture and to her sister, Amy.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Ranjana took a group picture of us, and then we all shook hands. Then Susan's father wanted to take a picture. While he was taking the picture, his consciousness started changing. He started to relax. After he took the picture, he was a totally different man — smiling and beaming with joy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Visa Broker</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Visa Broker" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>While I was in Calcutta, I was getting such joy that Chittagong was only an hour and a half away by plane. I was so eager to go there, so I went to try to get a visa.</p>
<p>Many, many stories I have heard about how difficult it is to get a visa to Bangladesh if you are not a big shot. But my taxi driver, who was from Bangladesh, said, "Those days are gone. You can easily go there now."</p>
<p>At the visa office there was a big line. Somebody came up to me and asked, "Do you need my help?"</p>
<p>I said, "Who are you?"</p>
<p>He said, "I am a broker. Here it will take you three days to get a visa. But if you give me 200 rupees, I will be able to get it for you by three o'clock this afternoon."</p>
<p>While I was talking to him, a young man standing nearby heard me mention Chittagong. He came up to me and said he also comes from Chittagong, so we started talking in our Chittagong dialect.</p>
<p>He said, "You can trust this broker. He is trustworthy." So I gave the man my passport. Then he brought me to a place that was darker than the darkest to have my picture taken. It was so dirty that I wanted to take the picture with my eyes closed.</p>
<p>The broker was a Muslim. He said that he had never told a lie. He said that he had a big family and that the only way he could support them was by doing this kind of work. So we invoked Allah and all the Hindu gods and goddesses. At that moment, Hindus and Muslims were all one family.</p>
<p>At three o'clock I went to the place where I was supposed to meet him. He said, "I am sorry. You mentioned in your passport that you are a teacher. When you say that, everything becomes very complicated. So I could not get your visa. Tomorrow I will get it."</p>
<p>I said, "Please give me my passport."</p>
<p>He said, "I can't give it to you now. It is in the office, which is closed."</p>
<p>I scrutinised him inwardly and outwardly. Then I said, "Now bring my passport! Otherwise, I am going to the police station. I will keep my word and give you 200 rupees, but I want my passport." He said, "Please go two blocks to a Punjabi coffee shop. I will come there with the passport."</p>
<p>I waited inside the coffee shop until I saw the Muslim standing outside a block away. He signalled for me to come to where he was standing. It seemed that we were in secret collusion. Either he was in trouble or I was in trouble.</p>
<p>He said, "Please write down that you have received the passport from me."</p>
<p>I said, "I have not received it yet, so why should I write down that I have?"</p>
<p>He said, "How can I be sure that you will give me the money? If I give you your passport and you don't give me the money, what can I do?"</p>
<p>This time I said, "I am ready to give you the money, but if you don't give me the passport immediately, I am going to the police!" Then from his pocket he took out the passport. Before I took the passport, I threw 200 rupees at him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Registering For The Asiatic Games</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Registering For The Asiatic Games" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>While I was in Delhi, they were having the Asiatic Veterans Athletics Competition for athletes over 40. I read in the newspaper that athletes who wanted to participate had to be invited. Otherwise, they had to register for two rupees, the equivalent of ten or twenty cents.</p>
<p>I was not feeling well, but I thought that by the time the competitions started in two days I would be all right. So I went to register. Unfortunately, registration was closed. I said, "Fine! It is a hopeless case."</p>
<p>India has no money; that is absolutely true. But when it is a matter of a stadium, the new stadium in Delhi can compete with any stadium in the West.</p>
<p>Always I carry with me my five-cents-worth <em>Galaxy of Luminaries,</em> the tinier-than-the-tiniest book that shows pictures of me with many big shots. I showed <em>Galaxy</em> to someone at the Asiatic Veterans Competition office. He said, "Oh, you are a great man!" Then he told one of the officials how great I am.</p>
<p>Immediately everything changed. Five minutes earlier registration was out of the question. Now they were telling me only that I needed three pictures.</p>
<p>I said, "Where am I going to get three pictures?"</p>
<p>Then the official said, "He does not need pictures."</p>
<p>I entered my name for the 100, 200 and 400-metre dashes, as well as for the shot-put, discus and javelin.</p>
<p>The registration fee was twenty rupees if you joined one item and thirty rupees if you joined more than one. By mistake it came out in the newspaper that the registration was two rupees. So I paid thirty rupees, a little more than three dollars.</p>

<p>I was all ready for the competition. I was feeling better by the next day, which was practise for the opening march-past. I took my place in line and practised with the others. Everything was excellent.</p>
<p>But the hostile forces are always ready to show me their capacities. After the march-past was over, the officials had to give instructions. Suddenly it started raining cats and dogs. I wasn't wearing a hat, but people would have thought it was bad manners if I had left. So I had to stand in the rain with my bald head.</p>
<p>If I get even two or three drops of rain on my head, I start to sneeze, and there I had to stand in a downpour. By the following day I had such a high fever that I was practically blind, so I didn't go for the competition.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Trying To Get My T-Shirt</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Trying To Get My T-Shirt" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Instead of competing at the stadium, I just stayed at the hotel all day, suffering from fever. The day after that I decided to go to the Veterans Games office to get my T-shirt.</p>
<p>I said, "I could not join in the competition, but can I get my T-shirt?"</p>
<p>The man in the office said, "Yes, but not now. Come back after an hour."</p>
<p>An hour later again I went there to get this precious thing — a T-shirt! This time they said, "You don't get the T-shirt here. You get it somewhere else. Go there in two or three hours."</p>
<p>A third time I went for my T-shirt. This time the place was closed.</p>
<p>The following day I went there at 9:30. Outside the stadium the race-walking competition was going on. Four different groups started together, but each was covering a different distance.</p>
<p>When I went inside the office, I noticed that quite a few Sikhs were there. If you call them Sardar-ji — which means leader — immediately their hearts melt. But this time they all started telling lies.</p>
<p>One of them said, "Yes, you will get your T-shirt, but first let me introduce you to the manager. His name is Ghuli."</p>
<p>So Ghuli and I chatted. Then Ghuli told me, "Yes, we will give you the T-shirt, but come at twelve o'clock. Now I am very busy."</p>
<p>I asked Ghuli if I could speak to Milka Singh. Once upon a time I was his great admirer. He used to be called India's 'flying Sikh'. In one Olympics he stood among the top finishers in a photo-finish race. He did not stand first, but for an Indian to even be in a photo-finish with three Americans was really something.</p>
<p>When I asked for Milka Singh, Ghuli said, "Who is Milka Singh?" He meant it was beneath his dignity to introduce me to him. Then he said, "You come at twelve o'clock. You don't have to see Milka Singh."</p>
