<p>Luckily my fate changed and quite a few people came to my second talk in Minneapolis. On the third evening I gave another talk which was attended by many college students. A lawyer who was in the audience was so moved. He said he had a church and he wanted to give it to me in my name so that we could inaugurate it as a centre. He even told me the name of the church.</p>
<p>The following day, Ida contacted the authorities of that particular church and they informed her that this lawyer was not even a member of the congregation. He had no connection with their church.</p>
<p>So that is the story of the lawyer who became so devoted that he wanted to give me a church!</p>

<p>Another incident happened during this third lecture. At one point I chanted Aum. As usual, I was chanting in my own way. At the end of the meeting, instead of asking me a question, a lady stood up and said that my way of chanting Aum was absolutely wrong. She had learned the correct way from Sanskrit scholars.</p>
<p>I said, “Here is the proof that I am not a scholar! Definitely mine is wrong.” Then, twenty minutes later, she asked me to chant it again and again so that she could learn it my way.</p>
<p>Such funny, funny incidents happened in Minneapolis, right from the very first night. But I liked the place. It became our second or third centre. I am offering Ida Patterson my heart’s most soulful affection and love.</p>

<p>One day I went out sight-seeing with my hostess, Ida Patterson. On the trolley, a husband was asking his wife to sit in front of me. They were talking in Bengali. I asked the husband where they came from. He said, “My wife comes from Chittagong. I come from Dhaka, but I was brought up in Chittagong.” And he started talking with me in proper Bengali.</p>
<p>They lived in Saudi Arabia. On the same day, at the same hour, we had to catch a trolley in Minneapolis! This world is so small. There were many, many passengers on that trolley, but he had to sit near us.</p>

<p>Thirty-four years ago, in 1962, Ida Patterson was absolutely the first human being or truth-seeker or God-lover to see something in my eyes. She told my boss Nolini-da. One afternoon I entered into Nolini-da’s room where I used to work and Nolini-da said to me, “Look what this American lady, Ida Patterson, saw in you. This morning when she came here to speak to me, you told her that I was not available, and she saw such things in your eyes. Your eyes mesmerised her.”</p>
<p>I said to Nolini-da, “Ida Patterson? I do not know who she is.”</p>
<p>Then I became friends with her. So thirty-four years ago she saw something inside your Guru’s eyes. Thirty-four years ago she told Nolini-da her experience, and still I cherish it.</p>

<p>She replied, “You were just a young man. You said you came into the lion’s mouth when you came to America.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My beloved Woodstock</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My beloved Woodstock" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Since 1964 I have had the greatest fondness for Woodstock. I started going there in May 1964 and every time I go there, I strengthen my desire to have a very soulful and peaceful place there where many, many seekers can come and meditate. But, alas, my desire has still not been fulfilled.</p>
<p>On Friday evenings, after finishing work at the Consulate, I used to catch the Greyhound bus to Woodstock from Grand Central Station. A few times I got lost. In front of the bus, it said Woodstock, but for some reason I would enter into another bus by mistake.</p>
<p>One Friday it was snowing. Even in that weather I went to catch the bus to Woodstock after work. When I got off the bus, I had to walk half a mile. There was no light, nothing, and it was snowing so heavily.</p>
<p>I had many, many spiritual experiences in Woodstock. I used to meditate on the top of a particular hill. I had a special spot—a dry, arid piece of woods. I was very fond of that place and I used to go there early in the morning to meditate. I felt such joy meditating there on the top of the hill.</p>
<p>Then one of my sponsors, Mrs. Ann Harrison, would come and ask me a volley of questions about spirituality. I answered endless questions of hers. If all the questions and answers had been recorded, I would have had at least twenty extra books. Luckily or unluckily she was not a stenographer.</p>

<p>When I went to Woodstock for the first time, Ann Harrison wanted to have a cake to honour me. She took me to a bakery and asked me to kindly stay inside the car so that the police would not tow her car away or give her a ticket. The car was parked right outside the bakery in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>Poor me! As soon as she went inside the bakery, a policeman came up to the car and demanded that I move it. I said, “I do not know how to move the car.”</p>
<p>“You have to!” ordered the policeman. “Do it right now!”</p>
<p>What could I do? I looked at the letters on the gear shift—D, R, N and so forth. The policeman was still insisting. I thought to myself: R means right, so I will put it in R and go right.</p>
<p>When I shifted the gears to R, the car all of a sudden went backwards and dashed against the car belonging to the police officer. He was parked right behind us. What a noise!</p>
<p>He began to shout at me. But I told him, “You forced me. I explained to you that I did not know how to move the car, but you forced me. I thought R meant right.”</p>
<p>The policeman admired my stupid innocence and he did not fine me.</p>

<p>In 1964 I visited a small gallery in Woodstock with my friends, Sam and Eric. Very near to it was a restaurant where we went to eat. A man came up to our table. He was very fat and he was heavily drunk. His name was Rudy and he had been Dulal’s sister’s guru. My sponsor introduced me to Rudy and we shook hands. As soon as he shook my hand, it began burning because everything entered into me. Then I had to go and wash my hand. Anyway, life is but an experience!</p>
<p>My friends and I sat down to eat and a sudden wave of inspiration flashed across my mind. I asked the waiter if I could borrow a pencil or ballpoint pen. None of us had a piece of paper, so I started writing on the paper napkin. I wrote two poems: “Father, I Am” and “Father, You Are the Child of Your Dream.” Those two immortal poems appear in My Flute.</p>
<p>Rudy had an antique shop in New York that contained many beautiful statues of the Lord Buddha. He was a great admirer of Lord Buddha. Samie had a statue of the Lord Buddha in his apartment that was absolutely living. He had bought it at Rudy’s place. I wanted to go and see the shop, but I hoped that the owner would not be there. One day I did go and luckily the owner was not available. I appreciated some of his statues very much.</p>

<p>One time, Ann Harrison went to California to visit a friend. Before she left, she gave me her friend’s telephone number. So early one morning I placed a call to that number. I did not know it was only three o’clock in the morning in California. I thought the time was the same all over America.</p>
<p>Her friend answered the phone, and I said, “Is Ann Harrison there?”</p>
<p>Her friend answered, “What! Do you know what time it is?” She was so mad. She happened to be the spiritual leader of that community.</p>
<p>Afterwards I told Ann that her friend had blessed me and Ann felt miserable.</p>
<p>Many years later, this friend came to our meditation. She was from the Self-Realization Fellowship. She bowed down to me and said, “Swami, I am so happy that you hold meditations.” Immediately I remembered that she was the one who insulted me on the telephone, but I did not have the heart to tell her.</p>

<p>In 1965 Ann Harrison showed me the ABC’s of driving. I would drive 200 metres and brake. Then she would drive us back to the starting point because I did not know how to go in reverse.</p>
<p>In the car she had a very cute kind of doll hanging. When the doll moved a little to the right, my sponsor thought this meant that she could go against the red light. O God! How many times God saved us from a serious accident! Her inner voice, this little doll, was telling her to go and I was shouting, “Stop! Stop!”</p>
<p>Then we would come to a green light and the little doll would tell her to stop. The drivers in the cars behind her would all be cursing us, but her inner voice would not permit her to go.</p>

<p>Here in America I saw the Supreme once as a Golden Purusha. Do you know where? In Woodstock. Near the end of 1964 I was meditating at Cherry Hill. There, with my naked human eyes, I saw my Supreme as the Golden Purusha. In the Vedas it is described. How beautiful and tall my Supreme was. He was running with me and holding a golden wand — like a magic wand. I was overwhelmed with light and delight. This kind of experience can never, never be forgotten.</p>

<p><em>A talk given at the Inauguration of the Woodstock Peace Mile</em><br /><em>3 June 1988</em></p>
<p>A long twenty-four years ago, I came to Woodstock for the first time. Since then I have come to Woodstock many, many times. I loved the soul of Woodstock, I still love the soul of Woodstock and I shall forever and forever love the soul of Woodstock. Now I am extremely grateful to the heart and soul of Woodstock for having given me the golden opportunity to be of dedicated service to the soul, heart, mind, vital and body of Woodstock.</p>
<p>Peace is the only thing that we need, that the world needs desperately. Here, our devoted, dedicated and soulful service to this great community will be our act of self-offering. Fruitful is Woodstock. And we are trying to add our soulful qualities with our devoted service to this great and good community.</p>
<p>I have had here teeming experiences, soulful experiences, spiritual exper-iences, illumining experiences, fulfilling experiences. I still have very, very good friends here in Woodstock. They have been extremely kind over the years and my heart of gratitude I am offering to them.</p>
<p>I cannot express adequately my inner feelings. I can only say this much: O heart of Woodstock, I was extremely fond of you, I am still fond of you, and I shall always and always remain fond of you. It is here that I had the dream, the golden dream, to do something in our way of manifestation here on earth. It has taken us twenty-four years to sow the seeds of my dream-beauty. Now we shall be offering our oneness-dream, oneness-home, oneness-family, not only in Woodstock but all over the world.</p>

She took me to the visitors’ area and very lovingly showed me how to step on the escalator. In India I never had the experience of riding an escalator. When we came near the end, I did not know what to do, so I jumped. In spite of her wise and compassionate instructions, I did a semi-somersault and fell down very nicely. Luckily I did not get hurt. At that time my athletic heart was strong enough to brave the experience. Samie’s mother was so shocked to see me fall down, and she was cursing herself for not telling me what to do at the end.</p>
<p>Then she took me to a young lady who was talking about the UN. At one point, Samie’s mother said to the guide, “Hey, young lady, why do you have to speak so fast? My Indian son cannot understand a thing. For God’s sake, speak slowly so that he can understand you. What is the use of bringing foreign visitors here if they cannot understand you?” Everywhere we went, she corrected people and told them how to behave towards me.</p>
<p>Even now it happens that I get confused and take the wrong escalator. Quite often I go to Kennedy Airport to walk. Sometimes I am in another world and I do not see which escalator is going down and which one is going up. I enter into the wrong one and fall down.</p>

<p>Once I went with Eric Hughes, my sponsor’s friend, to visit his parents in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was on the occasion of Thanksgiving. Just before we began our Thanksgiving meal, Eric’s mother asked me to say Grace. I did not know what the term ‘Grace’ meant. Then she said, “Just say a prayer.” So my prayer came. Unfortunately, my prayer never ended! They were all waiting to eat and my prayer was going on and on. But Eric’s mother was so kind to me. I used to call her my mother. She said, “Only say Grace for a minute. Do not say it for so long!”</p>
<p>The second time I visited Eric’s parents, I was there for three or four days. Again she begged me to say Grace. “No, I do not want to say it,” I said.</p>
<p>“Only for a minute, please say it,” she asked. So I said Grace for even less than a minute. That was how I learned to say Grace.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">I cannot eat meat</h2><span property="dc:title" content="I cannot eat meat" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I went with Eric for the first time to visit his parents, it was Thanks-giving and so they were all eating turkey. His mother was begging me to eat it, but I politely refused.</p>
<p>Then she said, “Had I been your mother, would you not have listened to my request?”</p>
<p>I replied, “Even if you had been my mother, I would not have listened to you. Your other requests I shall definitely fulfil, but I cannot eat meat.”</p>
<p>The second time I went with Eric to see her, she did not beg me to eat meat. Eric’s mother was like a real mother to me. I used to call her my mother. She was so kind to me. Her name was Caroline Hughes. She took me to quite a few stores. Some of her friends asked her, “Who is this?” Very bravely she said, “This is my Indian son.”</p>
<p>Eric’s father was practically lame. He had a television set and from his chair he pressed something and the television worked. I said, “How can it be?”</p>
<p>Now I have the same kind of remote control.</p>
