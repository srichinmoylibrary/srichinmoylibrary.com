<p>I gave my book of talks at the United Nations to one family. That family was very close to us. There are three sisters and one brother. When I left the Ashram in 1964, Nolini made this young boy his assistant to take care of his mail and so on. I studied with him and we did sports together. His older sisters were extremely nice to me from the very beginning. Their names are Priti, Tapati and Arati. Arati is a professor at the Ashram university. She is older than I am by two years, I think. Once when I was going to the nursing home, I saw her. She said, "Tomorrow I am going to take the book to show my students and tell them all about you."</p>

<p>One day I was supposed to go and visit the Head of the Physical Education Department at nine o'clock. I was at the nursing home, and my sister was not doing well, so I decided to go the following day.</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock they called me to say that Pranab-da was waiting for me. I said, "I am so sorry. It is eleven o'clock. Please forgive me. I will come tomorrow."</p>
<p>Pranab-da came on the line and said, "No, you have to come today."</p>
<p>I said, "Why?"</p>
<p>He said, "You have so many foreign admirers. In their own countries they cannot approach you. When they came to know that you would visit me, they asked if they could be present. They have been waiting here since 8:30 to see you."</p>
<p>I said, "O my God, O my God!"</p>
<p>So I went to visit my friend. One foreign admirer was from Africa. God knows how he heard about me! One was from Manchester, and somebody else was from New Zealand. There were these three non-Indians, plus a few Indians. I was supposed to go there at nine o'clock, so from 8:30 they had been waiting with the hope of seeing me.</p>
<p>When I arrived, the visitor from Manchester approached me with folded hands. He begged me to have a photo taken with them. He said, "We know so much about you in England, but we can never come near you. Now that you are here, and people said you are accessible, we wanted to see you. Please allow us to have a picture taken with you." Unfortunately, my friend Pranab-da is now confined to his chair. When the visitors saw that we could not all be in the picture together, they said, "Let us at least have a picture of you and Dada together."</p>
<p>They took two very nice pictures of Pranab-da and me sitting side by side.</p>

<p>I always ate out, but my brothers would never eat out. Chitta would cook something for Mantu, and they would eat at home. Our two cousins are so close to us, but Chitta will not take food prepared by them, and Mantu eats whatever Chitta cooks. Lily is seventy-two or seventy-three and Chitta is nearing his eighties. God knows what he cooks-potatoes and other things! Many, many years ago Chitta used to cook when he was working at our bank. Whatever food the Ashram gives, they eat, plus Chitta's food, and they buy fruits, such as bananas and papayas.</p>
<p>My cousins brought prepared food for me. But I did not take it. I said, "It is very sentimental. My sister is not here. That is why I do not feel like eating at home. I am so happy to go out to eat." They were very sad. I said "When my sister is not here, it is too much for me."</p>
<p>I went to a restaurant once or twice a day to eat masala dosa, rose milk, sambhar and tea.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The sari store owner&#039;s false devotion</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The sari store owner&#039;s false devotion" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Early one morning, around seven o'clock, I went to a restaurant. They gave me three idlis and sambhar. They did not have rose milk, so I asked them to give me lemonade. The prices were cheaper at this restaurant and they were very nice.</p>
<p>After breakfast, I told the rickshaw-wallah, "Take me to the bazaar."</p>
<p>He said, "It is not open. At eight o'clock nothing is open. It opens at nine or nine-thirty."</p>
<p>I said, "Take me slowly, and I will just see nature's beauty. In the afternoon I will come back."</p>
<p>I saw one particular sari store. The owner had opened the door a little, and he was praying so devotedly with folded hands. He was not paying any attention to people passing by. All the other stores were closed. I did not want to buy anything. I did not even have money; only a small amount I had taken with me. I said, "He is such a nice man. Let me see the name of the store, and I may come back." This was my stupidity.</p>
<p>O God, the man happened to see me and said, "Oh no, no, no, do not drive away! I was praying to God, and God has listened to my prayer. You have come!"</p>
<p>I said, "This is not the right time. Your store is not yet open."</p>
<p>The owner said, "No, God has listened to my prayers. Please, please, come inside."</p>
<p>I said, "I have no money."</p>
<p>He said, "You do not have to give me money now."</p>
<p>I said, "I have very limited money. I cannot buy anything." Hostile forces always make fun of me! I chose a few saris, mostly to please him. I had only 120 rupees with me. He said, "You give me 100. Afterwards when you come back, you will give me the rest."</p>
<p>The man put the saris in a bundle, and packed them very, very nicely. I said, "All right. I trust you, and you trust me. You have got 100 rupees. I trust you to such an extent, I do not need a receipt from you. You are such a nice man. In the morning you are praying. God knows when I will be back, but during the day I will come. Now I am going to see my sister."</p>
<p>His whole forehead was besmeared with ashes and white paste. He looked like the greatest devotee. I said, "He is such a nice man."</p>
<p>Late afternoon came. Already I had gone to see my sister three times. I said, "Let me go back to that store." My sister was so happy that I was going shopping. She had begged me to go and get saris, but I had said, "This time I am not interested." When I told her I had bought some, she was very happy.</p>
<p>I went back to the store and got the package. I gave him the money. He was very happy to find such a sincere person. As I was carrying the package out of the shop, all of a sudden, some divine forces acted through me. I said to myself, "The best thing is to count again to see if all the saris are there or not." To me, the package looked exactly the same; in the morning we had counted everything. But I said to him, "Can you open it?"</p>
<p>The man said, "Why? Can you not see it is the same?"</p>
<p>I said, "Something is telling me. Just open it. I am absolutely sure all are there." He had given me the receipt and everything.</p>
<p>Reluctantly he opened the package and I counted the saris.</p>
<p>Four saris were missing! I got so furious. I said, "I am calling the police!"</p>
<p>The owner said, "No, no!" He ran into a corner of the store. Those four missing saris he had kept at one particular place. He grabbed them from the corner and brought them to me.</p>
<p>I said, "How could you do this? Police, police!" He deceived me shamelessly. The package looked exactly the same the way he had re-packed it. If you take away only four light saris, how will somebody know? He had tied the cord around the bundle in exactly the same way.</p>
<p>When I was about to come out of the store with the package, the owner, his son and perhaps his grandson were blocking the door with their arms. They said, "You have to drink some soda." They were afraid that I would tell the police.</p>
<p>I said, "I promise I will not go to the police. You have given me my saris back, so I am not going to the police."</p>
<p>The owner said, "I know you will not go to the police, but you have to drink some soda."</p>
<p>I had to wait there for five minutes because they had sent for soda for me. Otherwise, they would not allow me to leave. This is called emotional demand. It was all fear, fear.</p>
<p>For this kind of deception there is something called the law of karma, but the law of karma does not operate immediately. God waits for us to pray to Him for forgiveness; God gives us the scope to pray for forgiveness. Unfortunately, instead of using this time to become better, many people become worse.</p>

<p>When I came outside with the bundle of saris, my rickshaw was missing. The driver was supposed to be right across the street. Where had he gone? It is my eternal rickshaw fate. There I saw only twenty or thirty bicycles. I was looking this side and that side, but there was no trace of my driver. I said, "What is happening?"</p>
<p>He did not tell me that he would be going somewhere. I had to stay in the store for another ten minutes until the driver came back.</p>
<p>I asked him, "Where did you go?"</p>
<p>He said, "I was hungry." He had gone to eat. At last, he brought me back home safely. This is India!</p>

<p>While I was in India, magazines, newspapers and radio were telling about statues of Ganesha drinking milk. This miracle happened in many places around the world. But in one case it was not true. About forty metres away from my house there is a Ganesha Mandir. Always I heard the music. It was one house away from our house. Unfortunately, that Ganesha was not thirsty. At every hour of the day and night, women were sleeping in front of the temple and outside on the street, but this particular statue did not accept the milk that they offered.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Avoiding the Florida lady once again</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Avoiding the Florida lady once again" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In four days how many sad experiences you can get! I have forgotten to tell you about the Florida lady. She had bothered me so much on my previous trip. I was very happy that she did not come to see me when I arrived.</p>
<p>One day I went to my dearest boss Amrita's centenary exhibit. The 19th of September was his birthday, so they had an exhibition. It was smaller than the smallest. I was extremely happy that they observed his centenary, but I was so unhappy and sad that it was such a small exhibit. The exhibit was prepared by his youngest niece, Kumuda. If she had not insisted, there would have been nothing.</p>
<p>The exhibit was at the Ashram school. As I came out of the building, the Florida lady screamed: "Ah, Chinmoy, when did you come?"</p>
<p>She greeted me at the Ashram school gate. I said, "Enough, enough, enough!" Then I told the rickshaw-wallah, "Go away from here as fast as possible."</p>
<p>We drove to the nursing home, and I came home after two hours at least. The Florida lady was waiting in front of my house. I begged her, "I have come here only to see my sister, my dearest sister. Do not bother me."</p>
<p>This time I hoped she would listen to my prayer.</p>

<p>Every day I would walk two miles early in the morning. Then in the evening at ten o'clock or ten-thirty I would go out again and walk two miles. On my fourth day, I went walking at three-thirty in the morning. After 400 metres, all of a sudden my right foot was aching like anything. The pain was so bad. I said, "How could it be?" Then I said, "All right, God does not want me to walk today."</p>
<p>I sat down. It was still quite dark; the sun had not risen. I was meditating very powerfully facing the sea. I meditated for about forty-five minutes. I was so happy. Now that I had meditated for forty-five minutes, I could go home.</p>
<p>I stood up. The sun was still not visible. I said, "The best thing is to imagine the sun. Let me take a few stretching exercises." I was taking stretching exercises, moving my arms and so on. At one point I turned around. Just thirty metres away, the Florida lady was doing the same exercise. I had not seen her before. I was so embarrassed. I said to myself, "Where could she come from?" O God, O God, she was there. I had not seen her when I went there to meditate. Can you imagine?</p>
<p>Then she followed me home. I was walking slowly because I was being cautious. My foot was still aching. I said to her, "I am begging you. Please do not bother me. This time my sister is dying. I am all the time thinking of her. Please, please, please."</p>
<p>But she would not listen.</p>

<p>On my last day in India, I went to the <em>Samadhi.</em> The man who was in charge of Sri Aurobindo's room was there. He said to me, "You are not planning to come to Sri Aurobindo's room this time? You must come."</p>
<p>I gave him a very sorrowful face. I had been coming to the <em>Samadhi</em> every day. But for Sri Aurobindo's room there is a fixed hour; only at eleven o'clock can you go there. That was the hour I was more interested in spending with my sister. I could not say anything. The man gave me some flowers. He said, "All right, if you cannot go, I understand."</p>
<p>I put the flowers on the <em>Samadhi,</em> and I was very, very happy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Aging Ashramites</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Aging Ashramites" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I see the Ashramites who are older than I am, how pitifully they walk! They take four inch-long strides and their whole body bends in different directions. Their faces are completely changed. While walking along the street, out of fifty people I would only see perhaps only one Ashramite that I knew from before. So many people who are older than I am by five or ten years have passed away. Wherever I went, there were all new faces. The old ones have all gone. When I went to the <em>Samadhi,</em> I could not recognise anybody. At the meditation hall, I could not recognise anybody. They are all new.</p>
<p>I think there are practically the same number of Ashramites — 2,000 or so — but most of them are new. People with whom I was brought up have all gone. Even many who were younger than I am have passed away.</p>
<p>My aunt is an exception. She is 95 years old. She is blind; she cannot see at all. She wants to live another five years, and then celebrate her centenary. There are three people who are one hundred years old in the Ashram. Let us see how many years more they can cover.</p>
<p>In India so many people die after the age of fifty years. It is from our Indian heat. If I had stayed more than two months there, I too would have gone to the other world! I suffered so much from the heat. The fan was emitting only hot air. When you stand in front of the Bay of Bengal, it is unbearable. The hot countries that we visit at Christmas are nothing in comparison to Indian heat.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Greatness versus peace</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Greatness versus peace" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Before I left, one of my friends came to see me. I said to him, "God has given me a few things and God has made me great, but God has given you something which He has not given me."</p>
<p>My friend asked, "What has He given me?"</p>
<p>I said, "Look at your eyes, look at your face, look at yourself. How peaceful you are! What am I doing? I have thousands of students here, there and everywhere, but I have only worries and anxieties. I am ready to give up all the name and fame that I have and all my disciples. Everything that I have in my possession I am ready to give up if God would give me just a fraction of the peace that you have."</p>
<p>Then I said to him, "Which one do you want? Name and fame like me or peace?"</p>
<p>He said, "Name and fame I do not want."</p>
<p>I said, "Do you not feel that you are leading a peaceful life?"</p>
<p>He said, "It is true. I know it and I feel it."</p>
<p>I said, "I have got name and fame, everything, but I have not got peace."</p>
<p>My friend looked at me so pathetically. He is of my age. He leads a very simple life. He has such peace inside him. I can see it in his face and in his eyes. I have name and fame; everything I have got. But peace I find only in my meditation. There I go beyond, beyond. In my outer, daily life, I have only worries and anxieties.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">No refuge from the Florida lady</h2><span property="dc:title" content="No refuge from the Florida lady" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>On the last day, I went to my sister's place for an hour. We were talking, talking, talking. My sister was cutting jokes with me and I was cutting jokes with her. She was saying, "Take care of your health. I can see how fat you have become."</p>
<p>I said, "I have lost weight."</p>
<p>On the last day, my sister was giving me absolutely so much joy. Alas, the Florida lady! How could she come into my sister's room at the nursing home? When I saw her, I said, "O my God!" My sister was so sad and upset. Of all people, that lady was coming with some flowers, standing ten metres behind us, near the other patients. I said, "O God, this is too much, too much!"</p>
<p>Then I looked at my sister and I meditated very powerfully for four or five minutes. I said, "I may come once or twice more, but today is the last day. We have cut so many jokes. Now let me meditate. I am not going to pay any attention to that lady. You also do not pay any attention to her. Let us meditate."</p>
<p>When I was about to leave, the Florida lady said, "Please wait, wait. These flowers are from Sri Aurobindo's room."</p>
<p>I was so surprised. I said, "How, how could you get flowers from Sri Aurobindo's room?"</p>
<p>Then she said, "Oh, they are not actually from Sri Aurobindo's room, but while I was plucking them, I thought of Sri Aurobindo's room. So I brought these flowers."</p>
<p>First she said they were from Sri Aurobindo's room. Then she said she thought of Sri Aurobindo's room while plucking them. The last time I went to Sri Aurobindo's room in January, she was there to bother me. This time I did not go. Perhaps she knew somehow. Perhaps she had been observing me. When I challenged her about the flowers, she said, "No, but I was thinking of Sri Aurobindo's room when I picked them."</p>
<p>She brought the flowers near my sister to give them to her, but I got disgusted and I started to move away. Instead of giving the flowers to my sister, that lady had to follow me! Look how sincere her compassion for my sister was!</p>

<p>When I was leaving, the main doctor happened to be there. I said, "I have to talk to you."</p>
<p>The doctor said, "Please, please come."</p>
<p>I went to the doctor's room, and we talked and talked. The doctor was very, very nice. With his compassion he melted my heart. I have no complaint against either of the doctors. While we were talking, I was praying to the Supreme that the Florida lady would leave. When I came out, she was not there. I was so happy.</p>

<p>I was supposed to leave at five o'clock in the afternoon. By three o'clock I had been to see my sister four times. Around five o'clock I was upstairs putting everything in my suitcase. Since my sister was not there, I had to do everything myself. I had no help. Somebody knocked at the door downstairs. At that hour, the Florida lady had to come!</p>
<p>My brothers opened the door and she came in and sat down. Then my two brothers came to talk to me upstairs. In such a hurry I was getting ready.</p>
<p>My saviour was the driver, who is a very close friend of mine. He dislikes the Florida lady like anything. He opened the front door to take my suitcase from the staircase. He called out, "Chinmoy, why are you so late?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am late because I have no sister here."</p>
<p>He was shouting from downstairs; I was shouting from upstairs. In Bengali we were shouting at each other. It was all friendship. When the lady saw him, she went out of the house because she knew that he would insult her. She was standing outside. On my previous visit, when she came, I finally gave her some money. This time also she came with the expectation of getting some money.</p>
<p>Last time my friend saw that I was forced to give her something because she was not coming out of our house. At the door, I had given the Florida lady two hundred dollars. This time my friend was my bodyguard. He would not allow me to give any money to her. I came down with some money in my hand, but he ordered me to enter into the car, and I obeyed him. The Florida lady was across the street, so she did not get a chance to get the money. My two brothers came out. I was very affectionately saying goodbye to them, and the lady was so miserable that I could not give her money. Perhaps she cursed me and that is why everything went wrong at Madras Airport.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Reconfirmation precaution</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Reconfirmation precaution" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>For my trip back to New York, I had to reconfirm my flights. I do not blame Ashrita, but I blame his fate. His sincerity, his eagerness to do the right thing I appreciate, but the fate that he has is unbearable, and I suffer.</p>
<p>Last time when I went to India from Myanmar, instead of listing my name with a G, it became C: Chose instead of Ghose. This time Ashrita gave me the itinerary. From India I was supposed to come directly via Air India to London. From Madras to Bombay and from Bombay to London, it would be the same plane. The flight number was 101. To reconfirm my flight, I went to a travel agency in the Ashram that is very reliable. The name of it is Auro Travel, and the owner is my very good friend. They are so expert. For twenty-five years they have been in that line.</p>
<p>My friend's assistant said that no reconfirmation was needed since I was in executive class. He said that reconfirmation is usually only needed if you stay longer than a week, but for executive class it is not needed at all. In my case, it was not necessary. But my friend, the boss, disagreed. He said, "It is necessary. This gentleman is my friend. You have to reconfirm it. If anything goes wrong, it will be our fault."</p>
<p>My friend, Gautam, has so many assistants. I was sitting right in front of him, and one of his assistants phoned up Madras, telling my name, this and that. Everything was reconfirmed. My flight number was 101.</p>
