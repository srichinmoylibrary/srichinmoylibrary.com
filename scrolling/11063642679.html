  <h2 id="page-title">A charming lift</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A charming lift" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>How sick I was last night! My stomach was on fire, my head was on fire. At three o’clock I slept for twenty minutes. Then I felt better. All the morning lifts I did as usual but I did not use the video. I know that if the camera is on, I will be tempted to try my best.</p>
<p>Later in the morning, I went to Connecticut to lift up the heaviest plane. It was 13,040 pounds. When I arrived, it was raining quite heavily and it was very cold. I was wearing my pilot’s costume that Savita and Anjali gave me. Unfortunately, the boys forgot my weightlifting belt. Also, the plane was towed onto my machine before I had the chance to warm up. What can you do?</p>
<p>The first time I lifted the plane, the gauge went to two inches. When it was at the highest point, I released my right leg. Immediately afterwards, I went inside Dhanu’s van to get warm. A television reporter arrived and begged me to lift the plane again because he had missed it. So I came out of the van and lifted the plane a second time. This time also I released my right leg.</p>
<p>An elephant is such a heavy, frightening thing, but a plane is charming. All our fear goes away when something is charming.</p>
<p>In a few hours I shall leave for Finland to inaugurate it as a Sri Chinmoy Peace-Blossom-Nation. So you can see how spiritual, cultural and physical things all go together.</p>

<p>Today I wanted to do 367 pounds on my stomach to equal my record but I could not go over 200 pounds. It takes two boys to place the weight on my stomach and I saw that one of the boys was weak. His hand was trembling and I became afraid that he would drop it.</p>

<p>Today I did two workouts — one in the morning and one in the evening. During the evening workout, I lifted 300 pounds and also 200 pounds with one arm. It was not my full effort. I do not think it was more than 80 per cent. Every day to do 100 per cent is not good. You become injured, plus the mind becomes stale. But when I lift up 145 pounds in each arm simultaneously, I am killing myself. There I am in the real battlefield. If I say that I am not giving 100 per cent effort for my double dumbbell lift, I will be lying. It is 110 per cent!</p>
<p>Today I did 145 pounds double dumbbell for the first time. It is 290 pounds total. My personal record is 150 pounds in each arm, which I did many years ago. So I am coming closer to breaking my record.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Enough for this incarnation!</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Enough for this incarnation!" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Today I lifted up a Lear jet weighing over 22,000 pounds. Before I went there, I weighed myself. I was 144½ pounds. I was so delighted and excited. But my brother Chitta immediately appeared before my inner vision. He was so sad. He said to me, “I really want you to be between 150 and 155. Do not go under 150.” So I promised him that I will stay between 145 and 150. Then he was to some extent happy. I do not think that under 143 I will be able to maintain strength. Today I feel very strong.</p>
<p>Before I lifted the plane, I walked around it three times invoking Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva — God the Creator, God the Preserver and God the Transformer. I was asking for their Blessings.</p>
<p>There is a great difference between 13,000 pounds and 22,000 pounds. It took so much of my concentration to make the plane feel light. Beyond the mind, everything is possible.</p>
<p>The owner told me that when he was sitting in the pilot’s seat, he saw the lift and he also felt it. He said it was very clear, very vivid. When I went inside the plane and sat in the pilot’s seat, I could not believe how small it was. It is so difficult to sit there. It is so close, so tight.</p>
<p>When we print a book, we can put this big plane in the middle and all the little ones around it.</p>
<p>Now I can say it is enough for this incarnation!</p>

<p>I wore my pilot’s costume again to lift the jet. These clothes are cute and they give me joy, but I do not get immediate strength from them the way I do when I wear my regular pants and top. When I wear these pilot’s trousers, I feel they are so weak, almost feminine. They are not adding to my strength at all. As a matter of fact, I feel I am giving strength to them. And when I put on the shirt, the colour is weak, everything is weak. When I use my natural clothes, I get so much strength. My regular clothes blend with my body.</p>

<p>Today I lifted 145 pounds with both arms simultaneously. I could have gone higher if I had given another push, but I was satisfied. Then I just dropped the dumbbells. I am killing myself to lift up these weights, but when I go to a certain height, it is enough for me to pass my examination. Otherwise, an inch or two more I could go.</p>
<p>Today I also lifted 145 pounds with one arm 100 times. My timing was two minutes 6.36 seconds. I tried breathing out through the mouth to see if I can take a shorter time to recover.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My jet plane lift</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My jet plane lift" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Today, on Thanksgiving Day, my humble service I placed at the Feet of God. I went back to MacArthur Airport to lift a much bigger jet plane. I lifted it twice. The second time there were twenty-one passengers inside, including the owner. The weight was 31,000 and the owner told me that he felt the plane shake. He said, “I am not even going to try to understand this.”</p>
<p>The plane started making such a noise when I was lifting. Last time I said, “Enough in this incarnation.” But this time, enough is really enough. I do not want to go higher than 31,000 pounds.</p>
<p>When I breathe in three times before I lift, at that time I try to make my mind feel that the plane is light. I try to convince the mind that it is very light. Otherwise, immediately the weight of the entire plane comes to mind and fear can destroy everything.</p>
<p>When you look at a huge person, you may only be seeing his eyes or his nose, but as soon as you see any portion of his being you get frightened. The enormity registers in your brain.</p>
<p>Similarly, even if you look at the trunk of an elephant, you get frightened because the elephant’s trunk has become part and parcel of the entire body.</p>
<p>In the same way, when you look at the nose or the very back of the plane, the weight of the entire plane comes into your mind to destroy your confidence.</p>
<p>I am so happy that the rain could not prevent us from lifting. The authorities were kind enough to allow us to lift inside the hangar.</p>
<p>When I returned home, I immediately called my sister. She was in a very good mood, so I told her all about my lift. Then I also told her that Nepal has become a Peace-Blossom-Nation.</p>

<p>A few days ago, we had a stomach competition. Alas, the more I work out my stomach muscles, the more they are invisible! All the fat is accumulated on the stomach.</p>

<p>Greed never ends! Today, after lifting 120 pounds with both arms simultaneously from a standing position, I went to 130 pounds. Savyasachi’s bodyweight is 132. His bodyweight I can lift with both arms.</p>
<p>With this machine made by Sumadhur and Bishwas I have never attempted 140 pounds. One hundred and forty pounds with each arm simultaneously using this machine is equivalent to 160 pounds on my machine at home because there the weight is on the side. Here it is behind my head.</p>
<p>If you are not noticing my progress, then please go to the eye specialist and get special lenses for your glasses! My mind does not believe it sometimes. If metal plates can identify themselves with me, what is wrong with you?</p>
<p>Sincere sympathisers sympathise with me no matter what I do. I want to make progress in every sphere of my life. Here what you are seeing is my oneness with the Will of the Supreme in my oneness with these metal plates.</p>

<p>It was so stupid of me to think of lifting heavy weights today after just coming back from India. I was trying to lift 400 pounds after not doing it for four or five days. I did not think of telling Unmilan to lower the weight.</p>
<p>Then, when I came to Sumadhur and Bishwas’ machine, the cautious man in me was telling me not to go over 70 pounds, but I did 100, then 110 with both arms and up to 130 pounds with one arm. At every moment self-doubt came, but again I was so happy and satisfied to do it.</p>
<p>Now I am lifting 400 pounds as high as I did 300. Next year I will be 68. I have to show some progress. In April I would like to show some progress and again in August.</p>

<p>The good news is that from 154 pounds my bodyweight has come down to 149½. The Indian heat made me very, very weak. Plus, instead of helping my knees, for some reason the heat made them more painful. In Honolulu I was walking 3½ miles every day, but today I could only manage five minutes.</p>

<p>There are scales in my hotel room. Today the scales said that my bodyweight is 120 pounds! How can it be? Yesterday I was 149½. There must be some mistake. So Savyasachi and I went out to buy a new pair of scales. We went to so many places, but all the scales said something different.

<p>When I do many repetitions, I count in Bengali. English I forget. Today I lifted my 400 pounds with one arm 200 times. Look at the bottom of the plate; you will see that it goes up. I can see it very clearly. Today I am admiring myself! I cannot see the lift while I am doing it. Only while watching the video I see it.</p>

<p>Today is my light workout day, not my heavy day. On Sumadhur and Bishwas’ machine I only went up to 90 pounds with both arms. Now 90 is so easy for me. It is almost like drinking water. But when it comes to 110 pounds, it kills me.</p>
<p>I do one day light, one day heavy.</p>
