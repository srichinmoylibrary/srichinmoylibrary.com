SCA 1057-1065. Questions asked at the Hotel Pedro de Valdivia, Chile, on 6 January 1987.</p>
<h2>Question: How can I always be happy?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can always be happy by doing two things. First, do not expect anything from anybody, including your Guru and the Supreme. Only give and give and give. Scientists have invented quite a few things. Now feel that you are going to invent something good, something absolutely new which nobody else has invented. What you will invent is this: you will give and give and give to humanity, to your Guru and to God, but you will not ask for anything in return. This is one way to be always happy.</p>
<p>The second way is to think of what you were before you accepted the spiritual life and what you are now. Even in your worst moments, you are not as bad as you were when you were not a seeker and had millions of desires. If you think of how much progress you have made, then you will be happy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I always do the right thing?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I always do the right thing?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can always do the right thing if you meditate and meditate. While you are meditating, feel that both your eyes are inside your heart, they are swimming in your heart-river. Feel that each eye is a swimmer — one is a human swimmer, and the other is a divine swimmer. These two swimmers are swimming inside your heart-river with tremendous inner joy, and this river is flowing into the sea. If you can see and feel this, then you will have inner happiness. If you have true inner happiness — not pleasure but inner happiness — you will never make a mistake.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I always have enthusiasm?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I always have enthusiasm?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can always have enthusiasm by feeling that you are at the foot of a tree. When you look at the tree, you see that the most delicious mangoes, the ripest mangoes, are at the top, so naturally you will start climbing up with enthusiasm. But if you do not see the tree, and if you do not look up and see the flowers and fruits, then you will not have any enthusiasm to climb up.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I never have any fear?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I never have any fear?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Through oneness, oneness, oneness. If you throw a tennis ball, does the tennis ball have any fear? If you are on the third floor and you throw the tennis ball down to the street, it is you who may have fear. You may be afraid that the tennis ball will hurt someone or that it may get lost or that something will happen to it. But the tennis ball has no fear.</p>
<p>We have to feel that God is playing with us like a tennis ball, throwing us here and there. But, in God's case, He does it consciously. You are His instrument. He knows that He will be able to trace you, no matter where He throws you. He also knows that you are not going to break. If He knew that you would break, would He throw you?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What does God really think of me?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What does God really think of me?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God always thinks of you as His dream — not an old dream but a new dream. Every day He thinks of you as a new dream, specially on your birthday. On that day He thinks of you as an unprecedented dream of His. On every individual's birthday, God thinks of that particular individual as His unprecedented dream, that is unlike any other dream.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I have more gratitude?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I have more gratitude?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Gratitude comes from devotion. Without devotion, there is no gratitude. Choose one of my pictures — it need not be my Transcendental Picture — and meditate on it. That will give you more devotion.</p>
<p>In India we have our tulsi leaf. The spiritual significance of that leaf is devotion. One of my Indian 'mothers' used to worry that I did not have any devotion. Her name was Mridu-di. Every day she used to run after me only to place that leaf inside my mouth.</p>
<p>For gratitude, devotion is absolutely necessary. When devotion-magnet goes away, one cannot maintain gratitude. If you are devoted to someone, then you can show him gratitude, you can show him love, you can show him concern, you can show him sympathy. But if devotion-magnet is missing, what are you going to do?</p>
<p>Devotion is the sweetest thing in our lives. It is the magnet that draws all the divine qualities. But false devotion is useless. Do not destroy the muscle-power of your palms by sitting with folded hands if there is no devotion inside your heart!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I have more energy?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I have more energy?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can have more energy by challenging something or someone. That does not mean you will fight against another human being. You are not fighting with anything outside. The one whom you are going to challenge is inside you — inside your body, inside your vital, inside your mind. If anything in your own life is dissatisfying you, that is the thing you have to challenge. Challenge your mind or your vital if they are not satisfying you. As soon as you challenge them, you will muster all your courage and energy. Otherwise your energy remains dormant.</p>
<p>Anything in your life that dissatisfies you, you have to challenge and fight like a hero. A hero will stand in front of you and say, "Either you listen to me and change your way of life or I will destroy you!" Then you will say, "No, I do not want to be destroyed! I want to be illumined." Anything that has to be illumined, you will challenge and illumine. Anything that has to be discarded, you will discard. And anything that has to be accepted into your life, you will accept. In order to get a large supply of energy, any dissatisfaction has to be challenged. Dissatisfaction takes away all our joy and energy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it possible or is it necessary to like everyone?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it possible or is it necessary to like everyone?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to be wise. A tree has countless leaves. It is necessary to have the consciousness that you love all the leaves of the tree, but is it possible to go and touch all the leaves one by one and say, "I love you, I love you, I love you"?</p>
<p>Again, you have to know that the tree has a root, and that root is God. We can tell God, "I love You and all that You have and all that You are." Like a tree, God is dealing with countless people.</p>
<p>You should have goodwill towards everybody, but that does not mean you should go and talk to everybody and show your sympathy and concern. If you try to do that, then you will have no time to think of your own prayer and meditation. Some people have no time to think of their inner life, and God-realisation is still a far cry for them. But they go to this side and that side to help everybody and make themselves feel that they are philanthropists. In most cases, they are only fooling themselves.</p>
<p>Goodwill we shall have for everybody, but we cannot mix with everybody. If I see a snake, I shall offer it my goodwill, I shall try to see God inside it, but that does not mean that I shall go and stand in front of it and be bitten. I will pray that the snake will change its nature, but to do more than that will be unwise.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does my soul have any special message for me today?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does my soul have any special message for me today?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your soul does have a special message: With respect to your health, forget the past, specially in your mind and in your body. Sincerely you have to feel that you have sound health, good health. Your soul wants you to convince your mind that you are not sick, you are not weak, you are not tired, you are not exhausted. Your soul is not fooling you. Your soul is dying to give you its soul-capacities and soul-potentialities. But instead of receiving these things, you always identify with your body, which is suffering, let us say.</p>
<p>You have to feel, as often as possible, that you are not the body but the soul. The difficulty is that the soul is a vague idea to us, a word. We know how to spell it, but most of the time we do not experience it. Just because we do not see it or feel it, we feel that perhaps it is a mental hallucination or superstition. But the soul is a reality. It is the divinity inside us.</p>
<p>You have to feel that the soul inside you is sacred. You may not be able to see it, but you can open your heart at every moment and feel it. It is like love. You cannot see your love, but you know you have love.</p>
<p>Believe in the existence of your soul. If you do not feed the soul, then the soul cannot manifest. The soul is birthless and deathless, true, but if you do not pray and meditate, then the soul does not get the opportunity to manifest God.</p>

 <p>
SCA 1066-1071. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 6 January 1988 at the Ambarrukmo Palace Hotel in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, during a television interview.</p>
<h2>Question: What brings you and your students to Indonesia, especially to Yogyakarta?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have come here to see the beautiful scenery of Yogyakarta, and also I have a very special feeling for Borobudur. Lord Buddha comes from India, and I have a very special admiration and adoration for him. He is for all mankind. So I would like to go and pay my homage to the Lord Buddha at Borobudur.</p>

I would like to ask you the purpose of your travels." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The purpose is very simple. We feel that this world is all one family. You and I are brothers. And there is only one God. That God you call Allah, and I call Him something else. But it is the same God. Similarly, Mohammed, Lord Krishna and the Saviour Christ all came from the Highest. When you pray to Allah and a Hindu or a Christian prays to God, we feel that it is the same God with different Names.</p>
<p>I go to so many countries to feel my oneness with God's children, with Allah's children, and to offer my love. Everybody cannot live in the same house. I have come to see your place. One day you may come to see my place. The human family is so big. That is why we live here, there and everywhere. But we are all brothers and sisters, so when we travel, we go to visit our relatives.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, my philosophy is love, good wishes and brotherhood. As I said before, we are all children of God, and we all belong to one family, even though we come from different countries. I am Indian, you are Indonesian, and somebody else may be another nationality. And we all have different names — that is how we recognise one another and distinguish one from the other. But we are all members of the same family.</p>

They believe that God does not exist — that is the negative side. But in the end, they will reach a particular place that is another extension of God. It is like electricity. There is a positive and a negative aspect. We need both positive and negative to get the light.</p>
<p>Right now we are caring only for the positive aspect of God, but if some people are caring for darkness, we shall not mind because we know that eventually they will come to the same light. A day will come, after a few years or a few centuries, when they will realise that something is missing in their lives. They will be miserable because they have no satisfaction. God is light. How long can one deny light? Those who do not believe in God feel that there is no light. But one day they will be sick of staying in a dark room. They will say, "How long can we remain in this place? Let us open the door and see the daylight. Then only will we be satisfied."</p>
<p>Having known the absence of light, these non-believers will sincerely love and adore the light. Once upon a time, perhaps we too were non-believers. That is why I always say that those who believe in God should show the non-believers utmost concern. If we speak ill of them or criticise them, it will only delay their progress.</p>
<p>In your family, when your children do not listen to you, you know that if you insult them, then they may take much longer to listen to you. But if you show them your concern, compassion and affection, then they will develop goodwill towards you, and they will listen to you long before they would have done otherwise.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My philosophy is oneness. The life-tree has so many branches. I am a bird, seated on one branch of the life-tree, and you are another bird, seated on another branch. Like that, we are all seated on different branches, but we all claim the life-tree as our own. It is your tree, and it is also my tree. You and I are seated on different branches, but these branches cannot be separated from the tree.</p>
