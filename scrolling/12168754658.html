<p>While travelling from Canada to New York, our bus stopped at the Canadian border. As I was coming out of the washroom, two customs officers came up to me very suspiciously. One said, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>Just a few minutes before that they had caught a man trying to smuggle a lady in under his car seat. So now they thought they were catching me.</p>
<p>But the other officer said, "He was on the bus."</p>
<p>At that hour of the night they hadn't expected so many people. Our crowded bus was disturbing their sleep.</p>

<p>Last year when I was in Australia, I rode on a train that went only seven or ten miles per hour. Yesterday, while travelling between Paris and Lyon, I rode on the world's fastest train. It goes 180 miles per hour!</p>
<p>When you are in the passenger compartment you feel that the train is going only 40 or 50 miles an hour. But if you are up front with the engineer, you can see how fast it is going.</p>
<p>For more than an hour I was with the engineer. I was sitting in the same seat that the French President sat in four years ago when he inaugurated the train. It is right alongside the engineer.</p>
<p>So now I have gone from the slowest to the fastest. This train broke the world record and defeated the Japanese bullet train. The French say they are going to stay ahead of the Japanese. They are working very hard to maintain their supremacy.</p>
<p>When I was young I wanted to follow in my father's footsteps and be a train conductor. That was my earliest desire. But instead, God has given me a far more difficult job.</p>

<p>In Japan they bow even when they open the elevator door for you. Yesterday after the Peace Concert, I bowed at least 200 times during the walk-past for seekers.</p>
<p>As each person passed in front of me, he would bow. So I also bowed. Then I would have to bow a second time to show that the meditation for that particular individual was over.</p>
<p>For me to bow so many times and then look up is very difficult for my neck. So yesterday I had very good neck exercises!</p>
<p>I thought that they would keep their hands at their sides, according to the Japanese tradition, but most of them walked by with folded hands.</p>

<p>There are very few disciples of mine who do not like Japan. The Japanese love the beauty of the East in their inner life and they love the power of the West in their outer life.</p>
<p>When I come to Japan, at every moment I am inspired to compose songs. Yesterday I composed a song about Japan in the sports store. Today I composed a song on the bus. The last time I visited the Kamakura Buddha, I composed "Namo namo" in front of the statue. The first time we visited it, I composed "Jaya jaya."</p>

<p>This morning I woke up with a 105-degree fever. With greatest difficulty I opened my eyes, but then I couldn't see anything.</p>
<p>So instead of running the race we were holding, I walked to the 24-hour eating place and ate coffee and eggs.</p>
<p>Then Vijali came in and I had a long talk with her about Trinidad and Tobago and other countries.</p>
<p>While walking back to the hotel, again everything seemed to be turning white. My fever and back pain were killing me, and I couldn't see anything!</p>
<p>It is very difficult to climb up the aspiration-tree, but the fever-tree one can climb up very easily. The aspiration-flame-tree is difficult to climb up, but the temperature-fire-tree is easy.</p>

<p>This morning I went into a restaurant in Kyoto. After I went out and had gone two blocks, I realised that I had left my gloves there. But I said, "I am not going to go back."</p>
<p>Then I saw Kodanda running. I wanted to give him the job of going to the restaurant to get my gloves, although I was a little bit afraid that he would go to the wrong restaurant and fight with the people there. But to my great surprise and joy, he went running to the right restaurant and brought back my gloves. He received my most powerful and blessingful smile.</p>

<p>This time Japan has responded most powerfully to the Supreme's Light. Throughout the length and breadth of Japan the Light of the Supreme has been really manifested. There have been over 40 articles about our activities in Japanese and English newspapers.</p>
<p>Kirit's soul has proved that it can be of true service to the manifestation of the Supreme. I am very, very proud of Kirit and very proud of Japan.</p>
<p>Kirit represents his country. He represents the life of humility. If you run up the steps two at a time, you might fall and break your leg. But if you go very humbly step by step, there is no chance for you to break your leg.</p>

<p>The <em>Japan Times</em> had a very nice article about me, but it had a few mistakes. They showed a picture of me playing the cello, but they said I was playing the viola. They also said that I came to the West at the age of 13. When the facts are wrong but the writer means well, their loving concern touches my heart.</p>

<p>When Vajra went to Yannick Noah's restaurant in New York, Noah's wife came and greeted him with folded hands, saying, "Sri Chinmoy is here." She thought it was me, and she was showing him utmost respect and veneration.</p>
<p>A similar thing has happened many times during our parades. I am on the sidewalk running alongside the marchers, and Vajra is marching in the parade. So they think he is the Guru, the chief.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sri Chinmoy himself paid a visit to Noah's restaurant. But since Noah's wife didn't feel the same kind of divinity in me, the treatment could not be the same.</p>
<p>So if you want to see my divinity more revealed and manifested, then Vajra is the answer!</p>
