<p>I am sure you do not watch television at four o’clock in the morning, but had you been watching Channel 5 last night at four o’clock, you would have seen me lifting 200 pounds with one arm! Dhanu went to the store of the man who sold us the video camera that takes the weightlifting pictures and he said that he saw me on television. His little child was crying, so he had to get up at four in the morning. Then he turned on the television and saw me lifting. He was so happy and proud because he sold us the video camera which takes pictures of my weightlifting.</p>

<p>When I take exercise in my main room, I put the tape recorder in another room so that I do not become totally absorbed in the music. Usually I take exercise for about 40 minutes. Every day I take a new tape and listen to it. I specially like the tapes of some famous Bengali singers singing songs by Rabindranath Tagore. Indian tapes are so unique! Sometimes there is talking during the singing, sometimes they cough. Everything is there, and then they sell these tapes!</p>

<p>In the airport in Buenos Aires, we met some little children who were tennis players. Among them were the number one and number two tennis players in Chile in the under 10-year old category. On the plane Agraha showed them some pictures of me lifting 2,000 pounds with one arm. Immediately a few of them ran to me all excited and asked, “Is this you?” Then they went back to show the other children.</p>

<p>Ernie Franz, the man who certified my 2,000-pound lift, is so frustrated with his own lifting. He keeps the book of my lifts next to his bed for inspiration. He has such faith in my lifting. Then when he tries to lift up heavy weights, he has problems and becomes frustrated. That is how people give up. I should have said in my book that I failed 213 times before I lifted my 300 pounds.</p>

<p>I spoke to Mahasamrat on the telephone and I was encouraging him about the New Year. Then Mahasamrat said, “Guru, I am telling you, I promised you I shall not fail you and I shall not fail you. I shall not fail you.” His mantra was only, “I shall not fail you.” His wife Judy was so happy. She has sent me a Christmas card and gifts.</p>

<p>He said, “We went out for breakfast.”</p>
<p>Mahasamrat’s whole gymnasium is flooded with my pictures. All the different lifts that I have done he has collected. As you know, he has given most beautiful and inspiring comments about each one. Now he says that there is nothing more in the outer world that he will be able to tell me. In the outer world, everything he has said. Only he will be able to tell me things in the inner world.</p>

<p>Even in India, when I was an athlete, my friends used to laugh at the size of my wrists. Now, just before I am about to lift, I concentrate on my right wrist because I know it will hold ninety per cent of the weight. After I lifted 3,000 pounds, I looked at my wrist and I could not believe it.</p>

<p>Among the spiritual qualities that I have, my inner poise is first and foremost. And this is the quality you can see in one of the pictures when I am lifting 3,000 pounds. There is no tension in this picture.</p>
<p>When people believe that by spiritual power I have lifted 3,000 pounds, when it is all settled in the mind-world, then only I shall show this picture. Otherwise, people will not believe that I am lifting that much weight. Once they believe it, I will show the picture.</p>
