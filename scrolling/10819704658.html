<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, it is possible. Look at the Christ, for example. Great Masters such as the Christ, Krishna, the Buddha, Ramakrishna and others can and do guide their followers: they have a free access to the earth-consciousness no matter where they are. But ordinary spiritual Masters — there are so many teachers, swamis and so on — cannot do it. There are some who cannot even guide their disciples when they are on earth. They have millions of disciples and they do not even have the power to guide them even when they are right in front of their noses. So how can they hope to guide them when they are in Heaven?</p>
<p>Also, it depends on the disciple. If it is a real first-class disciple who is always thinking of the Master, and meditating on the Master, then it is much easier for the Master to guide that disciple. But if it is a fourth-class disciple, who is all the time occupied with worldly thoughts and ideas, then how can the Master make him conscious of his guidance? So it depends upon the calibre of the Master, and the receptivity of the disciple.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we tell if we have met our Master?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we tell if we have met our Master?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have answered this particular question millions of times. Now, I am a spiritual Master and today we have all come here to pray and meditate and create a spiritual atmosphere. When I called my disciples up to meditate, I saw that everyone else in the audience was meditating in his or her own way, which is absolutely the right thing. Now each individual has to become like a teacher and give marks for whatever he sees in me, Peace, Light, Bliss or any spiritual quality and also the spiritual atmosphere that he finds here. He should give ten out of a hundred or twenty out of a hundred and so on. If he gives zero out a hundred, it may be absolutely correct according to him. He will know it is his real Master when he can give at least eighty out of a hundred.</p>
<p>Also it depends upon the seeker’s own development and preparation. He must prepare himself to be ready for the Master. Otherwise if he is not ready, he can see the Master face-to-face, but he won’t recognise him. The Master knows that that seeker is meant for his path but he can’t tell him.</p>
<p>“You are my disciple.” The seeker will think, “Oh, I’m so rich or I am very influential, that is why he wants me to be his disciple.” This is the way the Master is suspected. Also, if the Master says, “No, you are not my disciple,” then the seeker will feel, “Oh, it is because I have nothing to offer him, I am hopeless and helpless,” and so on. Whatever the Master says will be open to question. So it is the seeker who must choose, and then it is up to the Master to accept him or else to tell him that there is another Master waiting for him. He cannot tell him the name even of the other Master, because perhaps the seeker is not yet ready.</p>
<p>After the seeker has chosen and is accepted by a Master, he must not feel that he automatically has become a dear, close disciple of the Master. The seeker must see how sincere he is. If he feels, “I need Truth, I need Light,” then he is ready for the true spiritual life. The seeker has to know if he is ready to give the Master everything that he has and everything that he is. What the seeker has is aspiration, inner cry, and what he is, right now, is ignorance. When he is fully prepared to give the Master all that he has and all that he is, then the Master can work most effectively to transform his entire life. The seeker surrenders his existence to the Master, and then it becomes the Master’s responsibility to illumine and perfect him.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. Some other Masters do not have the capacity to take the disciples either to themselves or the Supreme. In my case, I can do both. I will never send anybody to any other Guru.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the relationship that the teacher and the student have established. Suppose your teacher has passed away and you didn’t have any close connection with him. You can say that your teacher was very great, but what kind of connection did you have with him? If the teacher has ten thousand disciples and you are not one of the intimate disciples, then you cannot expect anything from him just because he is very great. You have to know what kind of connection you had with him. Was he close to you? Did you ever have any personal contact with him, or any serious conversation with him? Did you have any inner contact with him when he was on earth? These are the things that you have to take into account. Otherwise, just because he is great does not provide any assurance that you can maintain any inner connection with him, if he did not make any solemn promise to you that he would take responsibility for your inner life. Let us say, your father was a very great doctor, and now he is not on earth. If you are suffering from some ailment, will you think of your father in Heaven to cure you? No. Somebody may be infinitely inferior to your father in the medical profession, but you will go to him for immediate cure. He will cure you because he is still on earth.</p>
<p>But if you have a Master like Sri Krishna, the Buddha or the Christ — a Master who is fully identified with God-Consciousness — then when you meditate on them, you are offering your very existence to the Ultimate, to the Almighty Father. Otherwise, there are many spiritual Masters on earth who have realised God, but if you have not established any strong inner connection with them while on earth, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to maintain any connection once they leave the body.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part V: Saints and madmen</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part V: Saints and madmen" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: If any human being can so transform his consciousness as to identify with the Universal Consciousness, certainly this human being deserves to be revered. At the same time, you have madmen who go around posing as elevated beings. What then are the distinguishing marks between a saint and a madman?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Saints are intoxicated with the divine ecstasy. Great spiritual saints, when they attain their spiritual perfection are drinking ambrosial nectar. They are living in that delightful consciousness in which they feel that the world itself is holding the spiritual ocean of bliss. Some of them try to bring down that highest Delight, Ananda, from a very high plane where they have received it, and sometimes they find it difficult. When they find it difficult to touch the material plane carrying this Bliss, they may lose their inner balance and for a short time become forgetful of the physical consciousness. At that time they may not be able to function normally on the physical plane. A seeker may forget his name, for example, and others may say he is acting like a madman.</p>
<p>But an ordinary madman is mentally, vitally or physically dislocated. He never knows what he should do or what he should say or how he should act. He has permanently lost the connection between the physical world and his own existence on earth. So whenever he says or does something, there is no harmony with the Universal Consciousness. That is to say, he cannot project himself into the Universal Consciousness in which we are all abiding. All of us are living in the Universal Consciousness, although we may not be conscious of it. At the same time, we are not violating the rules of the Universal Consciousness. A madman is also unaware of the Universal Consciousness, but at the same time, he is violating the laws of the universe, the Universal Consciousness, owing to his ignorance.</p>
<p>As we have preconceived ideas, the madman too has preconceived ideas, but he cannot formulate his ideas as we formulate ours. We have got a brain; we know our mind. We know how one thought can follow another thought. In a madman’s case, it is not like that. All the thoughts and ideas of the higher and lower worlds come into him in a flash, and he loses all his inner and outer balance. The forces and the pressures of the other worlds enter into him and get a free channel in him to express themselves.</p>
<p>An ordinary madman will never open to the Light or the Truth or that which can save him, his life, his very existence on earth; whereas the God-intoxicated madman, who is the true saint, is mad with the divine Beauty, the divine Light, the divine Purity and all that is divine. He wants to possess and to be possessed by Divinity itself. This is the difference between an ordinary madman and a God-intoxicated saint.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do false Masters believe that they are true Masters?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do false Masters believe that they are true Masters?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ninety percent of the false Masters believe that they are true Masters. But again, there are ten percent who know that they are false yet continue deceiving others because it has become a habit. When their sincerity comes forward, they feel how they have deceived the world. But by then, it is too late because they are seventy or eighty years old and for their whole life they have deceived the world. So what can they do? In their next incarnation they shall have to start from the very beginning praying and meditating and trying to be sincere.</p>
<p>Again, there are some spiritual teachers who accept disciples and have an ashram for a few years. Then they come to realise that they are not realised, so they give up teaching and they become spiritual seekers. In India it has happened that a few Masters said that they had realised God and then got quite a few disciples; but when they saw some disciples sincerely praying and meditating, they saw with their own eyes that these disciples were going far beyond them. These Masters were sincere enough to again start praying and meditating most soulfully. But false Masters are not sincere. They tell many lies. If you tell a lie twenty times, then you can convince your physical mind that that very thing is the truth. If you tell the same lie over and over again, then you totally forget that it is a lie. In your conscious mind it becomes a reality.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have told you people many times that God-realisation is a very complicated matter. Suppose right in front of you is the realisation-tree. There are many, many people on earth who have not even seen the tree. You have touched the tree, but you do not know how to climb up it. Somebody else may know how to climb up a few feet. A few will go and climb up to the highest, topmost branch, pluck fruit, and from there come down to offer it to aspiring mankind. These seekers are the most advanced.</p>
<p>So the question here is a matter of the degree of realisation. Jealousy does not depart unless one can go very, very high on the realisation-tree or unless one gets the experience of Nirvikalpa Samadhi quite a few times. Then jealousy stops.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why does God allow antagonism between different spiritual Masters?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why does God allow antagonism between different spiritual Masters?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why does God allow those souls to be undivine and hostile? The only answer I can give you is that His Compassion right now is infinitely more powerful than His Justice. God allows everything, but the only thing is that the individual has to know what he should do. We exist only because God allows us to exist on earth. You may say that other people are worse than us, that some people quarrel and fight or doubt God more than we do. But we have to ask ourselves whether we sometimes do quarrel and fight, whether we at times cherish doubt. The answer will be, “Yes, we do, although perhaps a little less than others.” If God allows us to do something, then we cannot blame God if He allows somebody else to do the same thing. It is only a matter of degree. We may doubt God, say, once in six months; someone else may doubt Him at every second. But if we say, “In this incarnation I have never doubted God,” then that will be a mistake. Again, if we do something wrong and another person also does it to an infinitely greater degree, that is still no excuse to criticise and attack that other person. Let us worry about perfecting our own nature. God will take care of others.</p>
<p>So we always have to be careful. If we ask, “Why does God allow others?”, then we must also ask, “Why does He allow me?” The day I can say that I am perfect, then I can say that God has made a mistake with others. But this day is a far cry for us.</p>

No one can go to the Father except through me.”" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The conflict is in the seeker’s mind, not in the seeker’s heart. The Christ was saying that only aspiration will lead you to realisation. If you think of the Christ as just someone who stayed on earth for thirty-three years, you will be mistaken. Think of the Christ as the representative of the One who is birthless and deathless. Again, if you think that he was the first God-realised soul, then you are again mistaken. Krishna and Buddha lived before that. We have to know that the Christ-Consciousness, the Buddha-Con-sciousness and the Krishna-Consciousness are all part and parcel of the same Supreme Reality. If you have a Master in whom you have faith, he will help you realise the Christ-Consciousness, Buddha-Consciousness and Krishna-Consciousness. On the one hand, these great spiritual Masters represent the Absolute; on the other hand, they are the Absolute. If you want to follow our path, we will take you closer to Christ, the all-pervading, all-illumining and all-fulfilling Consciousness, but not to Jesus, son of Joseph the carpenter. No matter what path you follow, it will lead you to one destination. You may call it Christ-Consciousness, another will call it Krishna-Consciousness or Buddha-Consciousness. But there can be no conflict, since truth is one. Any path you follow will help you realise the truth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If a disciple gets help from his Master, he is not bound to help others. The relationship between a Master and a disciple is mutual and reciprocal. Because I give you compassion, you are giving me dedication. In the outer world, if I am the teacher and you learn something from me, then you become a teacher. If you learn the alphabet, then you can teach it. But in the spiritual life, it is not like that. Unless you have solid knowledge, you cannot teach. You will be able to teach Hatha Yoga, but if you want to teach real meditation, it is impossible because you won’t be able to elevate the consciousness of seekers.</p>
