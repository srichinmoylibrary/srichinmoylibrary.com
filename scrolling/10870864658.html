<p>It took two hours for me to buy twenty dolls for X's and Y's groups. I lost in bargaining to a lady in one store, so I had to go back to the first store and pay the higher price. But all together there were only twenty dolls, and I needed twenty-two. What could I do? I said, "For the leaders, let me buy something else."</p>
<p>So X and Y got stuffed animals instead of dolls.</p>

<p>The day we had our first concert in Caracas we went to a restaurant to eat afterwards. The music was so loud! After an hour and forty minutes, it still went on. When we were about to get dessert, I got the inspiration to play on the flute. For just a minute or so I played. The noise in the restaurant was unbearable, so no one heard me, but they saw me playing my flute and they showed me such respect! All the musicians stopped playing and they were asking me to play. So I started again. All the musicians remained silent while I played. God knows for how many hours they had been playing. So probably they needed rest!</p>

<p>In Puerto la Cruz we went to buy a chair. We saw a chair like the one I have in New York, but I didn't like the price. I wanted to bargain the price down, but the lady in the store wouldn't bargain, so we went to another store. There I liked a chair which was from Italy.</p>
<p>Shubhra said to the saleslady, "Can you lower the price?" Then Shubhra said, "This morning we were with President Lusinchi in Caracas."</p>
<p>The lady immediately lowered the price. She told us that when Saraswati and Savyasachi had been in another store they showed a pamphlet of me with some big shots. She happened to have been in that other store at that time. So she lowered the price even lower than Shubhra asked because I was a big shot.</p>

<p>I am fond of bargaining. Whether I am an expert or not is a different matter.I have all kinds of belts to liberate me from my back pain-white, blue, black, green-it is endless. Two days ago I saw a belt in a store window. I was about to enter into the store when a middle-aged lady came rushing up to me and said in English, "I see you will have trouble. Let me help you."</p>
<p>How did she know that I didn't speak Spanish? All right, very good! Then both of us entered into the store and she started talking to the lady there in English. She was so excited about trying to help me that instead of speaking Spanish, she started speaking English.</p>
<p>I said, "What are you doing? You are speaking in English!"</p>
<p>Then she started speaking Spanish, and she really helped me.</p>

<p>I went to the store in our hotel in Puerto La Cruz to buy a small notebook. The owner said, "The price is forty bolivars, but that is too much. You give me twenty. It is not even worth twenty, but I have to charge you twenty."</p>
<p>I said, "Fine," since I liked the cute notebook.</p>
<p>Then he said, "Are you the same gentleman that I see on the ring the ladies wear?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He said, "Oh, I saw you in the newspaper with the President."</p>
<p>I said, "I have seen all three presidents-the present one, the future one and the previous one."</p>
<p>The man said, "I am so happy and so honoured to meet you. Please tell me how your people support themselves if they always go around with you."</p>
<p>I said, "No, only for one month they have come here."</p>
<p>Then he asked me the significance of the sari. He said, "It is very beautiful. Where does it come from?"</p>
<p>I said, "India. I am Indian, and I like this Indian form of dress."</p>
<p>He said, "You have Indian skin, but your face is not Indian. You don't look like an Indian."</p>
<p>He was so happy, and he was shaking my hand. I wanted to buy two T-shirts for some disciples who had stayed home, so he said, "My hands are dirty. You please take them yourself."</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to an Italian restaurant with Pahar and Tejiyan. The owner recognised me from the newspapers and showed me such respect. He didn't speak English, and Pahar's Spanish was really something! So we could not understand each other.</p>
<p>I asked for coffee with milk. He could not understand, and gave me coffee without milk. So Pahar and Tejiyan went outside and bought milk from a store. They said, "Leche," but their pronunciation! When the owner saw our milk he grabbed it and said, "No good!" Then he brought warm milk for the coffee.The music was so loud! We said, "Can you not turn it down?" Then his worker went and turned it down. The owner came to our table two or three times to ask if the food was good. Then he kept staring at me; he was so curious! He couldn't speak to us and we couldn't speak to him, but he was so happy to have us in his restaurant.</p>

<p>Savyasachi and I went to a sports store in Florida. Right at the counter were some 15-pound dumbbells. The man said they cost $36.</p>
<p>I asked, "Don't you have 25 pounds?"</p>
<p>The man said, "I don't now, but tomorrow I will be able to get them." He said they would cost $56.</p>
<p>The next day we did not go, but the day after that we went to see if they had gotten the 25-pound dumbbells. The man who had previously waited on me was not there. Another man came and said, "I will see if we have 25 pounds in stock." When he brought them, we asked the price. The man said, "It is $36 for 25 pounds." We thought it was a mistake.</p>
<p>Then the other man came and said, "No, $56!" Then they had a serious argument. The nice man said, "I will take the responsibility." Luckily he was in charge, so we paid only $36 for the 25-pound dumbbells.</p>

<p>While I was shopping in Ft. Lauderdale, I saw a bookmark. It was a most ordinary-looking card that only said, "Dear God, I like you," but it cost $1.25. Then I saw another card that cost $2.25. It said, "Dear God, do You really care for me?"</p>
<p>I don't think even sincere God-seekers who believe in God will spend so much money for a bookmark, unless they live in the depression-world.</p>

<p>In the bookstore I read and read quite a few pages. Unfortunately, I was not able to agree with God's recommendations, so I could not buy the book. Otherwise, I really wanted to buy the book by God telling how to live for 100 years.</p>

<p>Kodanda took me to a music store to buy a cello. The owner of the store was an old man. He was very nice, but he was so old that I was afraid his soul had actually left the body. He looked as if his soul was in Heaven but his body was still here on earth.</p>
<p>I played on ten or twelve different cellos-cellos for $3,000, $4,000, $8,000, $10,000 and $16,000. First the man said one particular cello was $6,000; then he said it was $8,000. So he was saying anything he wanted to say. I played on the $16,000 cello secretly. Otherwise, I thought that perhaps it might not be allowed.</p>
<p>There were four or five that were not as good as the one that I have. Three or four were good. There was a little difference between the ones for $8,000 and $16,000. You could hear that the higher-priced ones were sweeter.</p>
<p>Kodanda said later that to be in a room with me without any disciples made it the happiest day in his life. He was giving me the different instruments to try. He was the only boss.</p>

<p>I went to a fabric store this afternoon. As soon as I entered into the store, the owner showed me that he had "Silence Speaks," my daily meditations, in his store. He said he was so happy to have "Silence Speaks" in his store, and I also was so happy.</p>
<p>He told Pahar that in one "Silence Speaks" picture-where I am feeding the lamb-I am more visible, while in the other pictures I am not at all visible. He showed me two pictures and said, "Here I recognise you, but there you are barely visible." For me it was all the same, but fortunately the right person was hearing it, since Pahar is the printer.</p>

<p>So Baoul and I looked for Pohari. Finally Baoul found one called Prahari. 'Prahari' means 'guard.'</p>
<p>I said to the man, "This is not your mother tongue, so it is easy to make a mistake."</p>
<p>He said, "I asked a Bengali about it."</p>
<p>I said, "I am sure he said 'Prahari,' but perhaps he did not pronounce it carefully."</p>
<p>Then he was counting things in Tamil. I was amused, and I also started counting in that language. He looked at me, surprised. Then I told him that I had stayed in South India for 20 years.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to the Lotus Inn to eat. On the counter they have my "Silence Speaks." The people recognised me immediately, and they came up to talk to me. They were extremely nice and respectful. Plus, they served us very quickly.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">I care a lot</h2><span property="dc:title" content="I care a lot" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Yesterday I went to a stationery store. I saw a cute duck and I thought I would buy it for Chandika. I asked the man, "Is it a pin?"</p>
<p>The man said, "No, it is a magnet." Then he said, "This one is $2.45 and the other one is $4.47."</p>
<p>I looked at him. He was a joker. I said, "Which one do you want me to buy?"</p>
<p>He said, "It depends on how much you care for the person. Do you care a lot?"</p>
<p>I said, "I care a lot."</p>
<p>He said, "Then buy the one for $4.47!" and he put it in my bag.Both were cute. The bigger one was just a little bigger, but it was $2 more. To me it looked like a pin, but it was a magnet.</p>
