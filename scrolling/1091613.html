  <h2 id="page-title">The Priest Gets A Lesson From The Train Officer</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Priest Gets A Lesson From The Train Officer" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A priest and a businessman were taking a train journey in the first class compartment. The priest came to one of the officers on the train and said, "Can you imagine how such a bad person can be in the same compartment as I am! He is so ugly, so undivine and so unaspiring! What kind of fate do I have? I cannot trust this fellow in the slightest! My wrist watch is very expensive, plus I have with me $700. Can you keep these for me? Tomorrow morning I will take them back from you."</p>
<p>The officer agreed and immediately took the watch and money from the priest. Then the officer said, "I see you two are in the same boat. The businessman also left all his belongings with me before you came."</p>
<p>The priest was simply shocked! "How can he do this? How can he not trust me? After all, I am a priest!"</p>
<p>The officer said, "Tit for tat. Tomorrow morning you both come and I will return your belongings."</p>
<p>The priest was so annoyed. His pride was deeply hurt. "For sixty years I have been a priest. I have given sermons and led prayers. I was right! The businessman is a very bad person."</p>
<p>The following morning, both the priest and the businessman came at the same time. When the priest saw the businessman, he started going away, saying, "Now you have ruined my day!"</p>
<p>Then the officer gave back all the valuables which the businessman had deposited with him. The businessman thanked him profusely and wanted to give him a tip. But the officer said, "No, this is my duty," and he did not accept any money.</p>
<p>Next the priest came to collect his things. Very haughtily, he said to the officer, "It seems that this is my fate — to have to put up with such an unthinkable person! Now can you please give me back my wrist watch and my $700?"</p>
<p>The officer said, "Sorry, I have thrown them away!"</p>
<p>The priest got furious. "You have thrown away my precious valuables? I am calling the police immediately!"</p>
<p>"Do anything you like," replied the train officer. "You are supposed to have faith in human beings, but instead you are seeing the darkness inside human beings. If you call the police, I will simply tell lies. I will say that you have given me nothing. It will be my word against your word, and you will have no case. None whatsoever! I have thrown everything away."</p>
<p>The priest was disgusted, so he went to the police and told his whole story. The policeman simply said, "I have known this officer for many, many years. If he told you he would return your things, I am sure he would do exactly that. I trust this man. He has always been very honest."</p>
<p>The priest cursed the officer. He started shouting, "I have lost my watch! I have lost my money! Now I will sue you!"</p>
<p>The officer said very calmly, "Do anything you like. I am sorry, but you are not playing your role properly. You are a priest. You should show compassion. But, instead, you are acting like an ordinary person. We appreciate priests because we have faith in you. We feel that you will take us to God. Instead, you are taking us to hell!"</p>
<p>The priest was humiliated. He was grumbling and fumbling. Exasperated, he said, "This is my fate when I deal with ordinary human beings!"</p>
<p>Then the officer said, "Please listen to me! God is speaking in and through me. Never distrust people. With your suspicion, you are taking people to hell. Now I am returning everything to you, but you must have faith in people. Only in this way will they be able to go to Heaven. The very nature of businessmen is to distrust; but you are preaching all the time how we can become good human beings. You are a man of God. If you want to stay in the priesthood, you must trust people and help bring them to God."</p>
<p>On the one hand, this story is funny, but it is also very instructive. God wanted the priest to be illumined. A good person has to see good things in others. If a good person starts to see only bad things in others, then how will he be of any service to others?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Philosopher Is Illumined By The Taxi Driver</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Philosopher Is Illumined By The Taxi Driver" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A philosopher who taught at a prestigious university came out of his house hurriedly and was shouting at the top of his lungs, "Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!"</p>
<p>The taxi came over very quickly to him, and the philosopher jumped inside. "Hurry up! Hurry up!" screamed the philosopher to the taxi driver. "Drive as fast as you can!"</p>
<p>The taxi driver started driving as fast as possible. After about 20 minutes, the philosopher said, "Am I reaching my destination?"</p>
<p>The taxi driver said, "What destination? Did you tell me? I am driving just as fast as I possibly can."</p>
<p>The philosopher screamed, "Is it not your duty to ask me where I want to go?"</p>
<p>"If it is my duty to ask you, then it is also your duty to tell me," replied the taxi driver. "You should have told me your destination. It is your mistake equally."</p>
<p>"Look here! I am a great philosopher."</p>
<p>"Yes, you are a philosopher," replied the taxi driver. "But you also live in this world. God wants me to bring you from the moon world to this world. God wants me to teach you to live in this world and to behave like a human being."</p>
<p>The philosopher immediately replied, "I have been a philosopher for so many years, but never have I come across such wisdom! Will you be my Guru?"</p>
<p>The taxi driver said, "Yes, I will be your Guru, but only if you will try to live the life of a practical person. I will tell you to get up at 7 in the morning to be on time for your class. Then, when you hire a taxi, you must always tell the driver where to take you. I am giving you another piece of advice: Never hurry. When you hurry, you miss everything and you lose everything."</p>
<p>The philosopher said, "I am touching your feet!"</p>
<p>After a short time, the philosopher's students were so surprised that the philosopher was always coming on time and that he himself was practising what he was teaching them. Before, they were seeing that he was saying the right thing, but setting a poor example. After accepting the taxi driver as his Guru, the philosopher put his own philosophy into practice.</p>
<p>Nobody knows who can instruct whom and from whom we can receive a lesson. We must live a practical life. Otherwise, people will feel that we are worse than useless. In this way, the philosopher got the golden opportunity to learn from the taxi driver.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Fighting To Die For Each Other</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Fighting To Die For Each Other" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a man who was an honest businessman and a seeker who was a true God-seeker. From their childhood, they were very close friends. Now they did not live in the same country, but they would correspond regularly. Unfortunately, their two countries were very, very hostile to each other.</p>
<p>One day the businessman came to visit his friend and also to do some business. The first night, when the seeker went to church to pray, the businessman took a walk along the street. He was soon stopped by the police, who thought he was a spy.</p>
<p>One policeman demanded, "Where do you live? What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>The businessman replied, "Out of curiosity, I am looking here and there. I am a businessman, and I come from another country."</p>
<p>The police sent a message to the king about the businessman in order to check up on him. The king sent the message back that the man was a spy and ordered him to be hanged.</p>
<p>When the businessman heard the king's order, he said, "Please, please! Let me go home for a short time. I promise I will come back. I have to make provisions for my children. Please let me go. All my papers are at home. I will definitely come back. I am even telling you the time — in 15 days I will return."</p>
<p>The police replied, "The king does not trust you. You will go to some other country to hide."</p>
<p>The businessman said, "No, no! I will definitely come back." "Where is the proof?" demanded the policeman.</p>
<p>"I have a friend here and that friend will be responsible for my coming back."</p>
<p>Then the police brought the seeker friend. "Yes," said the seeker, "I will be fully responsible if my friend does not come back. We are childhood friends, and we are very close to each other. Because he has so many duties, he has to settle all his affairs before he is hanged."</p>
<p>Fifteen days passed, and the seeker's friend did not come back. All the people around the seeker were so miserable. They said, "Why do you believe a businessman?"</p>
<p>The God-lover answered, "Our friendship is so strong. I am sure he will come back."</p>
<p>On that day, the businessman was scheduled to be hanged at 3 in the afternoon. At 2:30 the seeker said, "I value our friendship so much. If my friend does not come, then I am ready to be hanged."</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the friend came back. He was feverishly rushing and running. The seeker said to his friend, "No, no, no! Let me be hanged. You have a big family. I have only God and God is my all."</p>
<p>The businessman exclaimed, "For me you will give your life? No, why should you give your life? You are such a kind man, and you are all the time praying to God. You will do so much good in the world in the future. My life is all business. Your life is only for God. I am the one who should be hanged."</p>
<p>"No," said the seeker. "You have a big family. In my case, I am unmarried. If you die at this moment, all of your family will miss you terribly. But in my case, if I die, nobody else will feel miserable. I can die peacefully."</p>
<p>Like this, both the friends were arguing and arguing about who should die. Each one wanted to die and to have his friend live.</p>
<p>The king could not believe his ears! "My God!" he declared. "I have never seen such friendship in my life! Usually it is all jealousy. Look at the seeker. He is only thinking of the businessman's family, and the businessman is only thinking of making the world better. Please, please, both of you, make me your friend."</p>
<p>The two friends said, "Fine, we will accept you as a friend. It is, indeed, an honour for us!"</p>
<p>The king added, "I want both of you to be ministers in my kingdom." To the seeker, he said, "I will take care of all your needs." And to the businessman, the king said, "You can bring your family here. I will take care of them."</p>
<p>The seeker replied, "I have to pray to God. That is my life's work."</p>
<p>The businessman said, "No, no! I love my country so much. My children are studying and are very happy where they are. This would be such a new place for them. If you would kindly allow me to return home, I promise you that I will not come back here."</p>
<p>To both the men, the king pleaded, "You are going to be my lifelong friends. Why will you not become my ministers?"</p>
<p>The seeker said, "I am a seeker. I am so happy with my life."</p>
<p>The businessman responded, "I am so happy with my family. If I become a minister, so many people will be jealous of me. Other ministers will make complaints against us and poison your ears. We must try very hard to keep our friendship. That is what is most important. You love us and we love you. But once we become ministers, there will be so many complaints against us from the other ministers. Then you will become angry. You will either think only of our incapacities or get disgusted with those who are jealous of us. You will suffer and we will suffer. The best thing is for us to keep our friendship."</p>
<p>Then the king said, "You two are not only my inseparable friends. You are my mentors. Here I rule the country. But today you have shown me the light. You have shown me how to rule my country. I am trying to give light to my country and both of you are illumining me. You two are not only my inseparable friends, you are my mentors."</p>
<p>The seeker said, "Let us all be happy. Let us do our respective jobs. I will pray; he will do business; and you will rule your kingdom."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Young Boy Sees God</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Young Boy Sees God" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a spiritual Master who had many, many disciples. One day, a young disciple came up to the Master and said, "Master, if I ask you a question, will you be offended?"</p>
<p>The Master said, "Never! I will never be offended, no matter what kind of question you ask me."</p>
<p>The disciple said, "Long ago, people used to see God face to face. But nowadays, how is it that nobody sees God face to face? Nobody talks to God on a daily basis."</p>
<p>The Master said, "You also can realise God and talk to Him face to face if you do the same thing that they did."</p>
<p>"Master, what did they do?"</p>
<p>"In those days, people who realised God used to bend their heads low. Nowadays, people do not bend low."</p>
<p>The boy said, "Master, I can do it easily. Every day I can even touch my feet with my head by bending my head down very low. If I do this, will I be able to realise God?"</p>
<p>The Master answered, "Yes, if you do this for six months, then you will definitely be able to see and realise God."</p>
<p>The boy did this very, very faithfully for six months. But, alas, he did not see God. He said, "Master, you told me that I would be able to see God and talk to Him, but nothing happened."</p>
<p>The Master said, "Something else is absolutely necessary."</p>
<p>"What else do I need?"</p>
<p>The Master replied, "You have to be very sincere. You must never tell a lie."</p>
<p>"If I don't tell lies for six months — not even one — will I be able to realise God?"</p>
<p>The Master said, "Yes!"</p>
<p>"Do I have to do anything more?"</p>
<p>The Master said, "No! Just bend your head low and do not tell a lie for six months."</p>
<p>After six months, the boy came back to see the Master. He had not told a single lie and he had bent his head right down to his feet every day. Alas, still he did not see or talk to God.</p>
<p>Just then, another spiritual Master came up to this Master and asked, "What is happening?"</p>
<p>The first Master said, "This boy asked me why nowadays people cannot see or speak to God face to face; whereas, in the olden days people were able to. I told him that he also could do the same. In those days people used to bend their heads low. Nowadays we do not do it. The boy agreed and he told me he could even touch his feet with his head. I told him that if he could do this for six months, he would realise God. Unfortunately, although he followed my advice faithfully, he said he still could not see God. Then I told him that he must also be very sincere and not tell even one lie for six months. Again he followed my instructions most devotedly, but he has still not seen God. Now I am in trouble."</p>
<p>In front of the boy, the other spiritual Master said to the first Master, "No, you are not in trouble. I will be able to help you."</p>
<p>He then said to the boy, "I tell you, if you do what I say, you are bound to speak to God face to face!"</p>
<p>The boy was thrilled. The new Master continued, "Now you are bending your head very low; you are even able to touch your feet with your head. Plus, you have not told any lies. For the next six months you must continue as before and also do one thing more. Every day, after bending your head low, you will please say, 'God, I want to see You face to face, if so is Your Will.'"</p>
<p>The boy said, "I am dying to see God. How can I say that?"</p>
<p>The Master replied, "This is the problem. When you die to see God, you usually do not see Him. But if you say to God, 'I am dying to see You, if such is Your Will,' and if you say this sincerely, in six months you will be able to realise God."</p>
<p>The following day, the boy did not tell a single lie. After bending down his head in his house, he said to God, "I am dying to see You. If it is Your Will, then please appear before me and allow me to speak with You. But if it is not Your Will, then I fully accept it."</p>
<p>Immediately after the boy said this, he saw an effulgence of golden Light right in front of him and from there, a most beautiful Person came out. He said to the boy, "My child, I am God. Ask Me for any boon."</p>
<p>The boy exclaimed, "I can see God!"</p>
<p>God said, "Yes. Now please go and tell your teachers that you have seen Me."</p>
<p>The boy asked, "But how will they believe me?"</p>
<p>God answered, "They will believe you. You go there and tell them."</p>
<p>The boy went. His Master and the other Master were there. As soon as they saw him, they saw a beautiful halo around him. His whole body was literally flooded with light. They were so surprised.</p>
<p>The boy's own Master started crying. He said, "I have been praying and praying for sixty years of my life. You have done this in such a short time!"</p>
<p>The second Master said to the young boy, "I am extremely, extremely proud of you. We have been praying and praying to God for sixty years, but God has not come to us. In your case, after only one day of unconditional prayer, God has appeared before you. From your face and your eyes, I can clearly see that you have spoken to God. I am so proud of you. Again, I am proud of myself that I gave you the advice to say, 'I am dying to see You, God. If it is Your Will for me to see You, then I will be very happy. But if it is not Your Will, I shall wait.'"</p>
<p>Both spiritual Masters' eyes were full of tears. The boy's own Master embraced his spiritual son and said, "You have shown me the Light. You have become the Light." The second Master also embraced the boy and said, "You have shown me the Light. You are the Light."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Gratitude-Heart Of A Child</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Gratitude-Heart Of A Child" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A child had been sick for a long time. From time to time, his mother had to take him to the hospital for treatment. One day he was supposed to go to the hospital, but his mother had something very urgent to do. The mother was saying, "O God! How can I send my son to the hospital today?"</p>
<p>Then the mother thought of a young man who was their neighbour. The mother went to him and said, "My child has to go to the hospital today, but I have such an important thing to do. Will you be able to take him for me?"</p>
<p>The young man answered, "Of course! Of course!"</p>
<p>Then she said, "Will you be able to drive him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, certainly!"</p>
<p>The mother said, "I will give you some money."</p>
<p>The young man replied, "No, please do not. I love your son very much. I will not take any money from you."</p>
<p>The mother was very moved. She brought her child to the young man, and he started driving the child to the hospital.</p>
<p>On the way, the child folded his hands and said to the young man, "Are you not God?"</p>
<p>"I am God?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes! My mother was praying to God. 'Who will take my child to the hospital?' Then Mother brought me to you and now you are taking me. I am sure you are God!"</p>
<p>The young man said, "I am not God! I am not God!"</p>
<p>"But my mother prayed to God."</p>
<p>He said, "Yes, your mother prayed to God and God listened to your mother's prayer. I was free, and I am so glad that I am able to take you."</p>
<p>The boy said, "When I grow older, I will never forget you. I will also try to do you some favour. Please remember, I will never forget your kindness."</p>
<p>The young man patted the boy on his shoulder and said, "I am doing you a favour. When you reach my age, God alone knows where I will be! I may not be in the same house. You may not be here."</p>
<p>The little boy said, "I know. But my heart is saying that we shall be together. Somehow we shall be together."</p>
<p>The young man said, "All right! All right! Because of you I have to become a good person. Your mother prayed to God and so I became God's instrument. I am not a good person, but I have to become good."</p>
<p>The little boy said, "No! You are so good and so kind to me."</p>
<p>Then the young man said, "This is my promise to you. When I start working, I will give you a job in my office. In case I cannot get a good job, if you become a big shot, will you give me a job?"</p>
<p>The boy said, "Of course! Of course! I will give you a very good job! I will even make you my partner!"</p>
<p>Then the older boy laughed and laughed. "I am ready to be your partner!"</p>
<p>Twenty years passed. This little boy was very brilliant. He did very, very well and became an executive officer. But he never forgot his older friend. He always remembered that his friend had helped him when he had to go to the hospital.</p>
<p>The executive found out that his friend was working as an ordinary postal clerk, so he went to see him. The executive said, "You were my God. Now please come with me. I am now an executive, and I want you to be my partner. I have a very large office." He made his friend his partner, giving him a half share of everything.</p>
<p>This is how good people act! After he saw the little boy, the older boy said, "I have to become a good person. I want to become good." The little boy changed his older friend's fate.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Balzac&#039;s Handwriting Analysis</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Balzac&#039;s Handwriting Analysis" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The great French author Balzac used to write novels all the time. They became very popular, and Balzac was acclaimed by all the people. His hobby was to look at people's handwriting. In this way, he used to scrutinise the character of the person. He could see what kind of person the individual was and whether he would become a great man or a good man.</p>
<p>Many, many people used to come to Balzac during his free time. They used to come to see him, not because he was a handwriting expert, but to chat with him while he was examining their handwriting. They were so clever! They were killing two birds with one stone. They wanted to be with such a great writer and, at the same time, they wanted to have their handwriting analyzed. Balzac would say something nice or sometimes criticise this or that. Even though he would criticise something about their handwriting and see that their character was not good, they used to get tremendous joy that they were able to be in his company for some time. It went on like this for many years.</p>
<p>One day an elderly woman came to see Balzac with a little boy's handwriting. He said, "Are you the mother of the little boy who wrote this?"</p>
<p>"No," she said.</p>
<p>"Are you the grandmother?"</p>
<p>"No, I am not the grandmother."</p>
<p>"Are you a friend of this little boy's family?"</p>
<p>She said, "No, I am not."</p>
<p>"Good! Since you are not a relative or a family friend of this boy, I can tell you frankly about his character," exclaimed Balzac. "You have brought me such horrible handwriting! I am sorry to tell you, he will be a useless fellow! But do not tell his relatives that he is totally useless. I can clearly see it from his handwriting."</p>
<p>The old lady smiled at him and said, "I am not his relative, but I was the teacher of this boy before he became a most famous writer. Now this is your own handwriting and I was your teacher! I immediately recognised you. Now that you have become famous, you do not know who I am. I was your primary school teacher."</p>
<p>Balzac got a shock! He said to himself, "What have I done?" Then he realised, "This is what I need. Either I give up this handwriting analysis or I have to study it thoroughly."</p>
<p>Balzac asked the old lady to stay. He was so moved she had come to see him, especially at her age. She told him, "I took a page from your school notebook and I saved it. I saw and felt that you would become a great person, so I kept your handwriting and I treasured it."</p>
<p>Balzac said, "I treasure you. I treasure you infinitely more."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">God Never Sleeps</h2><span property="dc:title" content="God Never Sleeps" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a little girl who was living with her mother. Her father had passed away, and they were very poor. The mother was a very, very kind-hearted woman, and her six-year-old child was extremely beautiful and extremely sweet.</p>
<p>The little girl was always afraid of darkness. Every night the little girl would become very afraid. Unfortunately, the mother would also get frightened at night. The mother would say, "There is no lock on the door. We do not even have a nail in the house to close the door." She was so afraid that hooligans would come and rob them. Although the mother was also afraid, she tried to hide it from her daughter.</p>
<p>One night it was extremely hot, and the child kept the window wide open. There was moonlight streaming into the house, and she was thrilled. The little girl asked her mother, "Who has given this light to the moon?"</p>
<p>The mother answered, "God has given this light to the moon."</p>
<p>The little girl said, "The moon is so beautiful. How I wish I could be as beautiful as the moon!"</p>
<p>"My darling, you are much more beautiful than the moon."</p>
<p>"Mother, I cannot believe that. No, no, you are just telling me lies."</p>
<p>"I am telling you, my darling, that you are much more beautiful in my heart. You are infinitely more precious to me."</p>
<p>"Does the moon sleep?" asked the child.</p>
<p>"No, the moon does not sleep at night and the sun does not sleep during the day."</p>
<p>Then the little girl said, "The moon does not sleep during the night and the sun does not sleep during the day. Is there anybody who does not sleep during the day and also does not sleep at night?"</p>
<p>The mother said, "Yes, there is someone."</p>
<p>"Who is this person?"</p>
<p>"God," replied the mother.</p>
<p>The little girl exclaimed, "God! So God does not sleep either during the day or at night. The moon sleeps during the day and the sun sleeps at night, but God never sleeps."</p>
<p>Then the little girl asked, "You take care of me, but who takes care of the moon?"</p>
<p>"God takes care of the moon."</p>
<p>"Who takes care of the sun?"</p>
<p>"God takes care of the sun," answered the mother.</p>
<p>The little child was so moved. She said, "So God does not sleep. He takes care of the moon and He takes care of the sun. God will also take care of you. God will take care of me. We do not have to worry, mother. God will definitely take care of us."</p>
<p>The mother was so happy. She was shedding tears of love, pride and joy. She said, "Now you will never again be afraid of night. God will take care of you, my darling. God will take care of us both. Before I was also afraid. Now we will never again be afraid of the darkness."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Three Friends In The Land Of Freedom</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Three Friends In The Land Of Freedom" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There were three friends living in America. One friend, an old man, felt that his religion was faulty, so he changed to another religion. The other two friends were very, very upset, because their friend of many years had left their religion.</p>
<p>One day on their way, the two friends saw the old man. They caught him and scolded him ruthlessly: "How can you leave such a great religion as ours? Now we have lost you. You were our friend and you betrayed us. It hurts us very much!"</p>
<p>The friend who had changed religions said to the other two, "God will one day take care of you."</p>
<p>The two friends screamed, "Traitor, traitor!" and they beat him up.</p>
<p>A few days later, the two friends learned that someone else had converted to their religion from another religion. Their old friend who left their religion was a traitor, and so they beat him up. But for the other man who had just joined their religion, they gave a banquet, and extolled him to the skies.</p>
<p>A spiritual man happened to be there. He said to the two friends, "Now tell me. When somebody leaves you, what happens? He is a traitor. When somebody joins you, he is your instant friend."</p>
<p>The spiritual man added, "Where are you living? You are living in America, the land of freedom. We all need freedom. Freedom gives us joy. You have the freedom to reject something that is wrong for you and to accept something you like. If you have the right to accept and reject at your sweet will, then how is it you cannot give others that very same freedom?"</p>
<p>The men kept quiet. Then they said, "You are right. America is the land of freedom. We want to exercise our freedom and to get joy, so how can we not allow others to exercise their freedom? Freedom means we each get joy in our own way."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">President Woodrow Wilson And The Triple Honorary Degrees</h2><span property="dc:title" content="President Woodrow Wilson And The Triple Honorary Degrees" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When President Woodrow Wilson became the President of Princeton University, he saw that many people were getting honorary degrees. One man had received three honorary degrees from Princeton alone. So many people were being given honorary degrees! They were receiving them not on the basis of real merit, but only because they had a reputation of having done something great. According to President Wilson, the people did not really earn their honorary degrees.</p>
<p>He was so amused and a little sad and upset that one individual had received so many honorary degrees from Princeton. He asked, "How can we give triple honorary degrees to one person? He can receive these honours from different universities, but how can it be from the same university?"</p>
<p>The authorities said, "We gave him the third, because he had two already."</p>
<p>President Wilson asked, "Then why did you give him two honorary degrees?"</p>
<p>They said, "He already had one honorary degree, so we did not have any problem giving him the second one."</p>
<p>"How did he get the first one?"</p>
<p>"Ah, anybody can have an honorary degree."</p>
<p>There is something instructive in all this. If some people are appreciating a given individual, then many others also are ready to appreciate that person. When one is already great, then other people all follow, follow, follow. But how does the person become great in the first place? In the beginning, someone shows him compassion, and then he becomes great.</p>
<p>It is a similar story with rich people — they are always getting more presents and more money from people. At first, some people show compassion and the person becomes great or rich. Then, in a very clever way, people show adoration. When a man is already considered great by others, then there is no difficulty in appreciating the person. But in the beginning, people find it so difficult to appreciate others. After one person shows compassion, this opens the door for others to show adoration, and before long everyone is showing adoration.</p>

<p>One day an old man and his grandson were walking together. They walked a very long distance on a village road. All of a sudden, the little boy saw a turtle. He grabbed the turtle and wanted the turtle's head to come out so that he could watch it and play with it. But while the boy was playing, the turtle drew its head entirely inside its shell.</p>
<p>The little boy said to his grandfather, "I cannot play with the turtle now. His head is inside somewhere." The boy was miserable.</p>
<p>The grandfather said, "My child, let us take it home."</p>
<p>"Why do we have to take it home?" asked the boy. "I cannot play with it. When the head is out, then I will enjoy it. Now I will not enjoy it."</p>
<p>The grandfather simply said, "All right. Let me take it home." He held the turtle and brought it home. Inside the house, the grandfather placed it near a warm oven.</p>
<p>When the turtle became warm, it automatically raised its head out of the shell. The grandfather said to his dear grandson, "Now you can play with the turtle!"</p>
<p>"How did you do it? How did you do it?" exclaimed the little boy.</p>
<p>Lovingly, the grandfather answered, "Earlier the turtle was so cold, he was shivering. That is why, when the turtle saw you, he got frightened and put his head inside his shell. Then I warmed up the turtle and now he is ready to play with you."</p>
<p>In life, if we want to play with someone, we have to warm them up first. Then they become our friends and are very happy to play with us.</p>

<p>"Only on Saturdays will I open up the box and pick up a few worries. I see that by then most of my worries have gone away. Only one or two are left. Then I put them back into the box and say to myself, 'These couple of worries I can deal with next week.'</p>
<p>"In the meantime, during the following week, when new worries are coming, again I put them into the box. Then the following Saturday, once again, most of the ones I pick up are no longer worries!</p>
<p>"Always keep a fixed day to deal with worries. You will see that by that day so many worries have disappeared. You will pick them up on that day, and the one or two that remain, you simply put back. When the following week comes, you find that the few old worries have also gone away."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Listening To Earthly Parents And To Heavenly Parents</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Listening To Earthly Parents And To Heavenly Parents" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once a boy wanted to accept the spiritual life, and the boy's mother did not want this at all. She was protesting and protesting. But the son was not listening at all to his mother. The boy came to a very good and very sincere seeker with the hope that the seeker would give him some advice. The seeker said, "You must keep your mother happy." This seeker had himself displeased his own mother by entering into the spiritual life.</p>
<p>Then the boy's mother came to the seeker and said to him, "You are such a good man. I am seeing you and I am getting such joy. But my son is so bad! He is not listening to me at all. Can you not give him some advice and tell him that it is good to listen to his mother and father?"</p>
<p>The seeker said, "I am the wrong person."</p>
<p>"Why?" the mother asked.</p>
<p>"I am following the spiritual life against the wishes of my father and mother. How can I give your son the advice you wish when I am doing just the opposite?"</p>
<p>The mother asked, "Is there anybody who can help me?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the seeker. "Please come to my teacher. He will be able to help you."</p>
<p>The seeker brought the mother and her son to his spiritual Master. He told the Master what she had requested and added that she was suffering very much.</p>
<p>The Master said, "I am the wrong person to advise your son. My parents were against my accepting the spiritual life, and I did not listen to them. What can I do? How can I tell your son, 'You must listen to your parents,' when I did not listen to my own parents?"</p>
<p>This spiritual Master had an old lady as a disciple. She was about ninety years old. She said, "I am the right person to help you."</p>
<p>The mother asked, "How can you think that you are the right person?"</p>
<p>"At the age of seventy, I joined the spiritual life, so then I did not need my parents' permission."</p>
<p>Everybody started laughing. She was such an old lady! Why would she need the permission of her parents to join the spiritual life?</p>
<p>She said, "I am so lucky that I did not need my parents' permission. In fact, they were not even alive."</p>
<p>Then the spiritual Master said, "All right. I am telling you that we have earthly parents and we also have Heavenly Parents. Often we have to make a choice between the earthly parents and the Heavenly Parents.</p>
<p>"Father can say, 'Do this!' Mother can say, 'Do not do this!' Then you have to make a choice. You cannot please both at the same time. Similarly, our inner Father is telling us to do something. But here on earth, our mother may be saying just the opposite. Then, unfortunately, we will not be able to please both at the same time.</p>
<p>"The inner Father is your son's inner voice telling him to accept the spiritual life. You, his outer mother, are telling him, 'No! You must not accept the spiritual life!'</p>
<p>"Your son is definitely pleasing his inner voice, which is God the Father. You have to give him the freedom to choose. He is helplessly lost between you and his inner Father."</p>
<p>The spiritual Master added, "When I accepted spirituality, I consciously chose the divine Father within me. My disciple who brought you here today did the same. His parents also did not want him to accept the spiritual life. But inwardly he was constantly getting messages from the divine Father within him, so he disobeyed his parents, and chose his inner voice, God.</p>
<p>"Your complaint is that your son is not listening to you. This is true. If you feel you are right, then you must pray to God and let God change your son's mind. This is the only way. After praying to God, you will see that your son's disobedience is no disobedience. Your son has been all along listening to his inner voice, which is God Himself. Believe me, one day you will be extremely proud of your son."</p>

<p>A grandfather brought his grandchild to a spiritual man. The child was taking too many sweets, and they were ruining his health. The grandfather had tried in so many ways to help the child eat fewer sweets, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Earlier the grandfather had taken the little boy to a few doctors. The grandfather told the doctors, "My grandson does not listen to me when I ask him not to take so many sweets. Can you give him some medicine?"</p>
<p>The stupid doctors gave the boy some medicine so he would take fewer sweets, but it did not work at all. In fact, after taking the medicine, the little boy ate even more sweets!</p>
<p>The grandfather cried, "What can be done?"</p>
<p>The old man was helpless. He took his grandson to a spiritual Master. "Too many sweets are ruining my grandson's health," said the old man to the spiritual Master. "Every day he takes so many sweets. He even steals money from here, there and everywhere in order to buy sweets. He is our dearest, our only grandchild, so we cannot strike him. Only we are trying to advise him that too many sweets are bad for him. Alas, he will not listen to us."</p>
<p>The spiritual Master said, "Wait, wait! Please wait. Today I am very busy. Please come back in two weeks."</p>
<p>The grandfather said, "You are so busy that you cannot give me any advice?"</p>
<p>"No I cannot. I am sorry. I will take care of your grandson, I assure you. I will ask God to take care of him."</p>
<p>After two weeks had passed, the grandfather asked the spiritual Master when he could return. The spiritual Master said, "Please come to me today with your grandson. I will be able to help him."</p>
<p>When the grandfather brought his grandson to the spiritual Master, the Master spoke most lovingly and most affectionately to the little boy. He was showing his light to the grandson, and the little boy was so moved. He was absolutely wonder-struck at how much kindness, love, affection and light was coming from the spiritual Master. The grandson's heart was absorbing everything.</p>
<p>Then the little boy said, "I will stop. I promise I will take only very few sweets, but not many at all." The little boy was deeply moved by the beauty, compassion and concern that were emanating from the spiritual Master's eyes and face.</p>
<p>The grandfather said to the spiritual Master, "You are showing my grandson so much love. You have cured him and I am so grateful to you. But please tell me, why did you not do this two weeks ago? You are a spiritual man. If you were so busy at that moment, could you not have told us to come back later that day? Or you could have asked us to wait. We would have waited for hours. Please tell me what was wrong with you two weeks ago."</p>
<p>The spiritual Master answered, "For such a long time, I had the same problem that your grandson has. I was taking too many sweets! I saw that you were so miserable and I sincerely felt sorry for you. I said to myself, 'How stupid I am! I happen to be a spiritual man and yet I enjoy eating too many sweets. I am also doing the wrong thing.'</p>
<p>"You are an ordinary man, a simple man. You know that taking too many sweets is the wrong thing. That is why you were so worried about your grandson. I teach my students to take good care of their health. At the same time, I was not practising what I was preaching.</p>
<p>"When you brought this little boy to me, all of a sudden wisdom dawned on me — I saw that I was doing the same wrong thing as your grandson. I sympathised with you because he was not listening to you and I sympathised with him because he was ruining his health. I came to realise that only when I practise the right thing, will others be inspired to practise the right thing themselves.</p>
<p>"I had been fooling myself. You and your grandson gave me the golden opportunity to be sincere. I said to myself, 'Now let me take care of my health. Let me not take too many sweets.' On that day I told you to come back in two weeks, because I knew that in two weeks I would be able to conquer this problem of mine. Now that I have solved my problem, I am able to be of dedicated service to you and your dearest grandson."</p>
