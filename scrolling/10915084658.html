<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Any problem, if it is solved spiritually, will be completely solved. But if you solve a problem psychologically, the solution is all in the mind, which is a very limited sphere. When we answer a question from the highest spiritual Truth, then we can feel that the answer is true and complete. We will get the ultimate satisfaction only when the question is answered from the spiritual point of view.</p>
<p>Although we have the body, the vital and the mind, if we solve problems from these different perspectives with the different capacities of the mind, the vital or the body, the answers will not completely satisfy our needs. With the mind we can solve the immediate problem. But that solution will not be permanent. The problem will simply take another form and come to us as another difficulty. We think, "I have solved that problem with my analytical mind," but unfortunately, if we go deep within, we will see that that very problem has now taken another shape and has come back to torment us. But once we solve the problem spiritually, we will see that that problem is really gone. And how do we solve a problem spiritually? We solve it through our inner progress, our soul's experience and our soul's light.</p>
<p>Once we begin to have true inner experiences, there will be no necessity to solve any problem with psychology or philosophy. Psychology and philosophy and all other mental ways to explain things are simply hopeless and useless. When we have our own inner experiences, we can see the truth with the light of spirituality, which is the Breath of God. Before that, if we live in the human world, we have to use the mind, we have to use psychology, or we will never attain even partial satisfaction. For temporary relief we can take shelter in the mind. But for permanent solutions we must get spiritual illumination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You should aspire for the light that will transform your nature. When you bring down light, it will automatically enter into the subconscious. Only by bringing light into your entire system can you illumine your inner darkness. By stirring up the mud and saying that you are this and you did that, you are only making yourself dirtier. No matter how many hours I dwell in a dark room, the dark room will not be changed into an illumined room. But if, just for a second, I can enter into an illumined room, then I may be able to bring light into the dark room and illumine it. When you meditate, you drink the light which permeates the atmosphere. This light will be able to illumine and purify the dark and impure things that you have inside you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we recognise our guilt and use it for our self-improvement?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we recognise our guilt and use it for our self-improvement?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, we should not try to recognise our guilt. If we try to recognise guilt, there will be no end to this guilt. Thinking about guilt is the negative approach. If we constantly examine what is inside a dustbin, then all we will ever see is rubbish. Guilt is like that. The very thought of guilt takes us away from light. Immediately, obscurity comes and covers our whole existence. If we want to be aware of guilt, if we try to discover where guilt comes from and what its function is, then we are destroying the divine part in ourselves. Guilt has come from wrong action. This wrong action we negate, not by thinking about it, but by doing something right. Only this kind of action will help us nullify its power.</p>
<p>We do not have to enter into darkness in order to see light or appreciate light. Let us enter directly into light itself, and what light has to offer we shall accept and use to fulfil our life. If we stay in a dark room for twenty-four hours of the day, we will not get light. Even if we stay there for hundreds of days, we will not get light because light is not available there. What we must do is go where there is light.</p>
<p>We are trying, in the spiritual world, to go beyond the mind. With the mind and through the mind we have not been able to achieve anything significant in the inner plane. So it is better not to think of guilt at all, but to think only of the divine possibilities that we have. Each human being has infinite divine possibilities. These possibilities have to be manifested in the form of realities. We started our soul's journey many thousands of years ago. We have gone from the mineral life to the plant life to the animal life; and we are now in the human life. What we want is the Goal and not the beginning of the road. We want to be transformed and illumined. Already we have covered a great distance. Now we should run, for the Goal is ahead. If we look backward or sideways we will stumble and fall. We should try, instead, to see only our divine qualities, and to manifest them in our lives. In order to do this we must see the light inside us and around us. Only then will we reach the Goal, which is all Light.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us not use the term analysis; let us use the term awareness. Whenever the followers of the Gurdjieff method do something, they always try to draw their attention to their action. When they touch something, they try to be aware that they are touching something. Always they try to be conscious of what they are doing. This does not create any kind of doubt.</p>
<p>You have to know that when you meditate soulfully, you become more aware automatically, without the need for analysing. When you see a mango right in front of you, with your inner vision, automatically its taste will come to the fore. You will not have to feel it, smell it, peel it, cut it and taste it. That process will give you the result step by step. But your spiritual consciousness will offer you the actual essence immediately. If you prefer to get the result step by step, there is nothing wrong in that. Only it will bring the mind to the fore constantly. But the spontaneous consciousness of the heart and soul will give you a better and more fulfilling result.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Doubt can certainly be overcome by any individual, provided he has inner aspiration. There is nothing on earth that cannot be conquered by aspiration. Let us take doubt as our inner enemy, as poison. Right in front of us there is both poison and nectar. It is we who have to make the choice. If we choose nectar, which is Immortality, naturally doubt can be overcome. But instead, we give all importance to doubt, which is nothing but ignorance, and the doubting mind. Every day we doubt ourselves and we doubt others and gradually we come to feel that we can never escape from the meshes of doubt. But it <em>is</em> possible to free ourselves from doubt. It is not only possible and practicable but it is also inevitable, because deep within us is the inner Divinity, and this inner Divinity is trying and crying to come to the fore.</p>
<p>Our physical mind is always in darkness because of its limitations. But if we can focus the physical mind on Truth, Light and our inner Divinity, then each of us has the capacity to conquer doubt. If we are consciously aware of this urge of the inner being to push forward and if we allow it to happen, then doubt is bound to leave us. When the flame of aspiration within us grows into a volcanic fire, all our doubts will be burned to ashes.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: To develop faith, do you need a Guru?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: To develop faith, do you need a Guru?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes a Guru helps; sometimes automatically we have faith. Some people, especially those who do not have a very developed intellect or sophisticated mind, spontaneously have faith. When the mind is very powerful and predominant, it is difficult to have faith in God, because the mind sees thousands of doors which lead into God's Palace, whereas the heart sees only one. When the mind starts to enter into God's Palace, it tries to see whether this door is good or that other one. It comes near one door and then it thinks that perhaps the other door is better. So it goes here and there, trying all the doors, and it takes a long time to enter into God's Palace. But the wise heart knows only one door, and that door is faith, absolute faith. Through this door it immediately enters into God's Palace.</p>
<p>Again, if one is intellectually developed it does not mean that one cannot also have faith in God. If his heart is also developed, the conviction of the heart is reflected in the mind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As long as we remain in the mind, we will always have problems of the ego. Only our aspiration can take us beyond the ego, to where our mind becomes quiet and our deeper and higher feelings may come forth. There is no end to the thoughts and measurements that the mind can contrive. But if you wish to get a mango from the mango tree, you need not first count the leaves on the tree and determine how far down the roots go and how much rain the tree has had. You simply pick the mango from the tree and eat it. All the mental figuring in the world will not give you the fruit. You must take it directly.</p>
<p>The mind is an obstacle that keeps us from getting the fruits of fulfilment. We become so involved with the mind, the ego, that we do not know how to get what we want. If a child wants something, he runs to his father for it. He does not stop to question if his father has a Master's degree or if he is qualified to give him what he needs. The child, fortunately, does not use his mind to such an extent. He simply runs to his father, the source, without doubt and without mental hesitation, and gets what he wants.</p>
<p>As long as we remain in the mind we will have problems getting along with other people. The mind gets joy from doubting and suspecting others. It will criticise the entire world and try to make us feel that we are either superior or inferior to everyone. But the heart gets joy from identification. The heart will feel its oneness with all people — their weaknesses and their strengths. So if we can remain in the heart and not in the mind, we will easily be able to get along with others.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we understand others better?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we understand others better?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we want to understand others, we shall fail if we use our mind as the basic means. I am using the mind to express my thoughts, and you are using the mind to express your thoughts. But the very nature of the mind is so limited, its capacity is so limited, that it cannot understand others' thoughts in the way others want them to be understood. Also, we very often cannot express our ideas the way they should be expressed so that others can understand us.</p>
<p>In order to understand others properly we must use our intuitive faculties, our feeling of oneness. We must aspire and pray to God to give us the Mind that He uses. God does not think like we do. He uses Willpower and His all-pervading Consciousness. When we say God's Mind, we mean God's Consciousness. If we pray to God to give us His Consciousness, then we can easily understand others. We do not understand each other because we use our physical mind. God understands us very easily because He is intuitive. There is no other way to understand others properly. If we can use God's Consciousness, automatically we can enter into others and bring out their thoughts, or we can simply become one with them and understand them as we understand ourselves.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What are hostile forces in the form of thoughts? How can we know that we are being attached by these hostile forces?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What are hostile forces in the form of thoughts? How can we know that we are being attached by these hostile forces?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Hostile forces are constantly trying to attack human beings. Suppose I am looking at someone with all my love and affection and you are looking at me. If jealousy attacks you and enters into your mind, you will think, "How is it that he is not looking at me like that?" Immediately your attention is caught by this wrong thought, which we call jealousy. What is jealousy? It is nothing other than a hostile force in the form of a thought. Your senses allow these hostile forces to enter. With your eyes you see that I am looking at him. Immediately your mind opens its door to the thought that I am partial, that I am fond of him and not of you. Once you allow this hostile force to enter into you, your meditation will be ruined. What can you do about that hostile force? Try to feel your oneness with the other person. He is your spiritual brother. His goal and your goal are the same.</p>
<p>There are various kinds of hostile forces that have the form of evil thoughts. If you want something from somebody and he does not give you what you want, what do you do? You allow undivine thoughts to enter into your mind and you tell them, "Go and fight." These thoughts are like soldiers. They go out and attack the person from whom you expected something.</p>
<p>Your mind is your door. You have the authority to open the door or keep it closed. In your house you allow only your friends to enter, and not your enemies. So when thoughts come to your mental door, allow only good thoughts, divine thoughts, to enter. If you allow bad thoughts to enter your mind, they will destroy your aspiration and ruin your spiritual life. When a thought enters into you, either it is from a divine world or it is from an undivine world. If your thoughts are in any way disturbing your meditation, that means they are undivine thoughts. These can be either subtle or obvious hostile forces. Or when a thought comes and tries to possess you or make you possess it, that is a hostile force. But when a thought enters into your mind and you feel that you are expanding, you can know that it is a divine thought.</p>
<p>If you see a garden, you are consciously delighted with its outer beauty and inner beauty. But you are not bound by the garden. It is not capturing you and you are not trying to bind it. While you are looking at the garden you are feeling that the fragrance of the flowers is spreading all around you. That is what a divine thought is like. So whenever a thought wants to enter into you, first see whether that thought is going to bind you or whether it is going to enlarge you or be enlarged by you. The thought that can bind you or be bound by you is an undivine thought, a hostile force. The thought that can expand you, and that you can expand with your aspiring consciousness, is a divine thought.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the best way to prevent wrong thoughts from attacking us?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the best way to prevent wrong thoughts from attacking us?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The thoughts that we have to control are the thoughts that are not productive, the thoughts that are damaging, the thoughts that are destructive, the thoughts that are silly, the thoughts that are negative. These thoughts can come from outside and enter into us; or they may already be inside us and merely come forward. The thoughts that come from outside are easier to control than the thoughts that are already inside. If an undivine thought comes from outside, we have to feel that we have a shield all around us or right in front of us as a protection, especially in front of the forehead. If we feel that our forehead is something vulnerable, delicate, exposed, then we will always be a victim to wrong thoughts. But the moment we consciously make ourselves feel that this forehead is a shield, a solid wall, then wrong thoughts cannot come in. We have to make ourselves feel consciously that we are protected by a solid wall or a fort with many soldiers inside. We have to be constantly vigilant and, when an attack of wrong forces comes, we have to know that we have stronger soldiers inside us. The strongest soldiers are our purity and sincerity, our aspiration, our eagerness for God. These divine soldiers inside us will be on their guard the moment a wrong thought comes and will serve as bodyguards to us.</p>
<p>The thoughts that are already inside us creating problems are more difficult to throw out, but we can do it. We can do it through extension of our consciousness. We have a body and inside this body are wrong forces that have taken the form of thoughts. What we have to do is extend our physical consciousness through conscious effort and aspiration, as we extend an elastic band, until we feel that our whole body is extended to Infinity and has become just a white sheet of infinitely extended consciousness. If we can do this, we will see that our consciousness is all purity. Each pure thought, each pure drop of consciousness, is like poison to impurity or to wrong thoughts in us. We are afraid of impure thoughts, but impure thoughts are more afraid of our purity. What often happens to us is that we identify ourselves with our impure thoughts and not with our pure thoughts. But the moment our physical existence can identify with purity, when we can say, "This pure thought represents me," then impurity inside us immediately dies. Wrong thoughts are inside us just because we identify ourselves with these thoughts. If we identify with something else, immediately they have to leave us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all let us try to know what is the ultimate effect of one bad thought. If we only use the term bad thoughts, undivine thoughts, impure thoughts, that is not enough. What we must remember is that each of these words signifies one idea, and that is 'bondage'. Bad thoughts, undivine thoughts, ultimately are going to do only one thing: they are going to bind us. But divine thoughts will expand us.</p>
<p>You all know what purity is. If you can repeat the word 'purity' soulfully just a hundred times daily, even before you get out of bed, purity will begin to dawn in your life and in your mind. When you repeat the word 'purity', try to feel that your mouth is pure, your eyes are pure, your forehead is pure, every part of your body is pure. Each time you utter the word 'purity', concentrate on a part of the body and feel that it is pure. When you have done this a hundred times, you will feel that you are nothing other than purity. You can go one step farther. When you look at a flower, immediately you feel that the flower is very pure. Once you have purified your whole existence, try to feel that you are nothing but the tiniest flower. When you feel that you have become that flower, if you are an aspirant, place it on your altar as an offering to God. You have been crying for purity, and God has given it to you, so in gratitude you will place yourself at the Feet of God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I would like to know how to overcome negative thinking, both during meditation and during my ordinary daily activities.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I would like to know how to overcome negative thinking, both during meditation and during my ordinary daily activities." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The very nature of negative thoughts is to steal, consciously and deliberately, the wealth that we have, our divine Joy, divine Peace, divine Light and divine Love. These are our treasures, but doubt, fear and negativity are real thieves. Sometimes a thief will enter into our apartment and steal things, but only because we are neglectful and allow this to happen. In the spiritual life, when we have a kind of relaxation and are not constantly vigilant, this happens. We may be vigilant for ten minutes a day during our meditation, but the rest of the day we are totally careless. When we enter into our daily activities we do not remember to guard our thoughts. At that time we are no different from the ordinary people all around us who never meditate.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> throw doubts and negative thoughts aside if you can constantly remember your meditation. After you have stopped meditating you must try to remember these few minutes with utmost joy, affection and concern. You must cherish them as an object of adoration. During all of your ordinary activities try to remember your soulful meditation and do not forget the necessity of retaining a spiritual consciousness or spiritual thoughts. Do not allow your mind to sink to a low level. If you can maintain pure thoughts, divine thoughts, when you are not meditating, you will have additional strength when you do meditate.</p>
<p>Any time doubt and negative thoughts come, you have to stop them immediately with your divine thoughts. In this way you will be able to conquer your negative thoughts. If your thoughts are pure during the entire day, then when you meditate, your mind will already be pure. But if you allow your thoughts to roam in the world of ignorance and impurity for fourteen or sixteen hours a day, how can you expect your thoughts to be pure at the time of your meditation?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What part does the mind play in transcending desires and passions?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What part does the mind play in transcending desires and passions?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To be absolutely frank, the mind never wants to conquer desires or transcend desires. The mind is already the storehouse of all kinds of desires and the door of the mind is always wide open to new desires. If you want to conquer desires, you have to use your aspiration and enter into your soul. If you feel that the mind is going to aspire, then you are mistaken. Concentrate on your heart and from the heart try to enter into the soul. Try to identify yourself with your heart first and your heart will take you to your soul. Then the abundant, effulgent light that abounds in the soul will spontaneously flow from the soul to the heart and from the heart to the mind.</p>
<p>When the mind is illumined by this light, the mind will lose all interest in earthly desires. Only by bringing the light of the soul through the heart into the mind will you be able to free the mind from desires.</p>
<p>You need to go beyond the mind, which is most difficult, or to pay all attention to your aspiring heart. The aspiring heart is not the heart which is close to the vital region. The vital is near the navel. The aspiring heart is located higher up, in the centre of the chest. If you cannot raise your consciousness from there to the real heart, you will constantly be a victim of desires.</p>
