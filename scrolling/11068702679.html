<p><em>It was a memorable day!</em></p>
<p>What a truly pleasant day when the disciples' mothers were invited to a luncheon and informally met with the Guru.</p>
<p>We were seated at tables with our sons, and to begin with, a most delectable cheese mound covered with chopped nuts was placed in the center of each table to appease our appetites before meeting with Guru.</p>
<p>Then at last, Guru entered the restaurant — not in his usual Indian garb — but there he was beautifully clad as a handsome American young man. His meticulously clean blue shirt with his beautiful white sweater and his smiling countenance immediately gave me a feeling of complete rapport. I felt he was meeting with us on our level of consciousness to make us feel closer to him as an individual, and to my way of thinking it did.</p>
<p>Guru started with a short synopsis of his life. We learned he lost his mother at the age of eleven years old and now has one sister left who is very close to him, not only as a sister but as a mother. I liked the little jest he made, after he told us he calls his sister once a month, when he said, "It only costs $12.00."</p>
<p>Guru went on to say he is just taking over where we left off. He knows all we want for our sons is to be happy and that money is not the most important thing.</p>
<p>The way he spoke to us I'm sure every mother felt very much like I did: happy our sons crossed his path and thankful God sent Guru to us.</p>
<p>We were given the opportunity to ask questions, which some of the mothers did. I did want to get up and say something which was in my heart, but like most times when it comes to speaking in public, I was the silent one.</p>
<p>I was thankful that another mother got up and said most of the things I wanted to say. It was almost like she received the message from me. So I see I am not alone in my feelings for the Guru and the path he leads. I have a feeling of complete acceptance and would like him for my "Indian son."</p>
<p>I believe God will guide Guru on his path and I have complete faith we parents, along with our sons and daughters, will be better people for it.</p>
<p>To top it off Guru presented every mother individually with a beautiful corsage and a box of lovely gifts. At that time we were able to express our thanks to Guru, which gave me great pleasure. I was then able to verbally tell him how thankful I was someone else spoke for me, but then — I'm sure Guru knew all along.</p>
<p>I was blessed by Guru!</p>
<p>I was blessed by Guru!</p>
<p>We were then served a delicious salad which, if I'm lucky, I will get the recipe of.</p>
<p>Guru then left us, and we enjoyed the rest of the luncheon prepared for us.</p>
<p>What a beautiful day it was!</p>
<p>Thank you, Guru, for inviting me.</p>

<p>My dear Sri Chinmoy,</p>
<p>I thought that I would take time to extend my gratitude to you for a pleasant lunch and the lovely gifts and flowers. I felt you were offering so much more in your generous gesture; and from that feeling comes my deepest gratitude for your presence and spiritual sharing.</p>
<p>I do hope that my words were appropriate in public context. <em>Many of the mothers indicated to me that they shared the same positive feelings about you and your work but did not find the opportunity to express their sentiments.</em></p>
<p>Your influence on my sons has manifested itself in a return to God and the "core values" which have maintained the hope and integrity of humanity through the ages.</p>
<p>The ladies and gentlemen of your group are gracious ambassadors. They are happy looking people and seem to retain their youth.</p>
<p>Thank you again.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>

<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>I want to thank you and your Guru for having me at the luncheon for the mothers and sons. I enjoyed very much being there with all the other mothers.</p>
<p>The talk by Sri Chinmoy was very inspiring.</p>
<p>One thing makes me extremely happy: that you are in good company; with good people, especially in the world of today.</p>
<p>I appreciated Sri Chinmoy's gift, but it is not the gift but the atmosphere in which it was given: the girls — everyone was nice.</p>
<p>I must say I missed A.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Premananda&#039;s mother</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Premananda&#039;s mother" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>December 12, 1975</p>
<p>As the mother of Premananda (or Chick, as he will always be in <em>my</em> heart), I would like to express some of my impressions of the Guru's luncheon on December 7th for the mothers of his male disciples.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to thank Guru for remembering us as these young men's mothers in his invitation and for his remarks to us. I was impressed by his sincerity and his desire to include us in his spiritual community.</p>
<p>Frankly, I have had my doubts over the last seven years because Chick was seemingly taking on a new family. Somehow I felt I had failed in some way as a parent. Then I began to examine the good effects of Chick's relationship with the Guru... his acquiring a much needed self-discipline, his willingness to work hard for something he believed in, and — most important, I believe — his personal attainment of an inner serenity and strength.</p>
<p>Some things still trouble me. At the luncheon one mother questioned the times disciples spent meditating or attending Yoga center functions on holidays or family days rather than spending some of that time with their physical families. This preoccupation with the Guru's activities is somewhat contradictory to the Guru's assurance that his disciples should stay in physical contact with their families.</p>
<p>The Guru says that our minds are troubled by this lack of closeness but that our hearts are glad because we want our sons to be happy. True. . . to a point. Christmas particularly is a family time. Should these sons (or daughters) travel to Puerto Rico, away from their families, at Christmas time to participate in the same activities they do in their daily lives all the rest of the year? Does this mean their spiritual family is more important to them than their physical one? If this is the case, I feel the Guru — if he is as sincere as I have come to believe he is — should underline to these young people the importance of their relationship with their physical family while they are on this Earth. Their souls will follow Guru to his "true home" and their belief will influence the future of the young people of this country.</p>
<p>If your children are geographically removed from you, you plan on visits to compensate for this; they come or you go to them to be together as a family. But, once again, isn't there a time and a place for the physical as well as spiritual family?</p>
<p>While I am on this Earth, I would like to see as much of my children as possible, as <em>my</em>'' children, not the Guru's even though I know we are all God's children and will one day be with Him.</p>

<p>Dear Sri Chinmoy:</p>
<p>My sister and I cannot find the words to describe your wonderful hospitality where everything was so arranged that a new pleasure appeared every moment. We count ourselves very fortunate and happy to have been invited to share the day with you, other mothers and their sons.</p>
<p>It made us feel good knowing your consideration to preserve the love of the family and all humanity. You teach the boys to be good because without that they can be neither valued by others nor set any value on themselves. You inspire them to be industrious and apply themselves to useful pursuits.</p>
<p>I had a dear and precious mother and father who instilled in me a love of God, truth and kindness to all, and I hope that in raising my boys I was able to transfer the same principfles to them. Thank you for your thoughtfulness and kindness and may God grant you continued success.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
