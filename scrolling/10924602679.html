<p><em>(Sukracharya and Jajati are together.)</em></p>
<p>SUKRACHARYA: Jajati, you have deceived my daughter, and you have deceived me. While you were married to my daughter, Devajani, you also got married to Sharmishtha secretly, and she has given you three sons. You have deceived us badly. Without my knowledge, without my daughter's knowledge, you did all this. You deserve severe punishment from me. I curse you. You will be paralyzed. You will not be able to move at all from now on. The end of your life has come. <em>(Jajati falls to the ground and cannot move at all.)</em> Old age will enter into you immediately. <em>(Jajati's whole face changes.)</em></p>
<p>JAJATI: Forgive me, forgive me, Father I have done a terrible thing to your daughter and to you. Is there any way I can be forgiven?</p>
<p>SUKRACHARYA: No forgiveness for a rascal like you! But I can tell you only this, that if anybody is willing to take your paralysis on himself, and to take on your old age, he can do so, and you will be freed. Then, eventually, if you want to take these sufferings back again, you can. If nobody agrees, if nobody will take on your paralysis and your dotage, then you will have to suffer in this condition until the end of your life.</p>
<p>JAJATI: Oh, I am so grateful to you! I have so many devoted sons. I am sure one of them will do this for me. I have two sons by your daughter, Devajani, and three sons by Sharmishtha. I am sure one of them at least will gladly listen to me. Why only one? All of them will listen. Everybody will be eager to fulfil my desire. I am always so kind to them; they are so affectionate to me. I am so proud of them; they are so fond of me. I am grateful to you, Father.</p>

<p><em>(Jajati is lying down. Beside him are his two wives and his five sons.)</em></p>
<p>DEVAJANI: What have I done? I made a mistake by complaining to my father. His curse is more severe than your crime. Ah, what is to be done?</p>
<p><em>(Both of his wives feel sorry. They are nursing their husband.)</em></p>
<p>JAJATI <em>(to his sons):</em> Don't feel sorry for me, my children. Don't feel sorry, my wives. My father-in-law, Devajani's father, is still kind to me. He has told me that if anybody wants to take on himself my paralysis and my old age, he can do so. You know, my children, I have been so kind to you, so affectionate to you. I have helped you in every way. You are all young. You will allow me to live on earth for a few more years with joy, enthusiasm, energy and vitality. And then when I die you will regain your health, your strength, your vitality, your energy, everything. And mind you, whoever does this for me will be King. Whoever takes on my old age, my paralysis, my disease, will be King. <em>(To Jadu.)</em> Jadu, look how I am suffering, my son, my eldest son. Now do me this favour. Take this incapacity from me. Just for a few years I shall enjoy life, and then I shall give you my throne.</p>
<p>JADU: Father, forgive me. Even for a moment I could not bear to have that kind of disease. I want to enjoy the world. You have done much for me and I am grateful to you. But I cannot take away your disease.</p>
<p>JAJATI <em>(to his second son):</em> Turbasu, will you accept my disease for a few years?</p>
<p>TURBASU: Father, forgive me. Old age is a very serious type of disease. One loses one's brain. When the brain is gone, everything is gone. Father, I am grateful to you for what you have done, and I shall ever remain grateful. But I can't take on your paralysis and your old age.</p>
<p>JAJATI: Devajani's sons have disappointed me. Now let me try Sharmishtha's sons. <em>(To Druhyu.)</em> Druhyu, you know how I am incapacitated. I can't speak well, I can't move. You have love for me. Do me the favour — take my disease.</p>
<p>DRUHYU: Father, forgive me, forgive me, forgive me. This life of mine is only for joy and pleasure. This life is to see people, mix with people and get joy from the world — nothing else. Father, I can't. I cannot do it. You are suffering outwardly, and I shall suffer inwardly for you. But I cannot suffer both inwardly and outwardly for you, Father. Forgive me, but I am ready to suffer only inwardly for you.</p>
<p>JAJATI <em>(to Anu):</em> Anu, Anu, will you not take on yourself my disease?</p>
<p>ANU: Father, forgive me. I want to live a pure life. I know that if I take your disease on myself I will suffer and I will not be able to pray to God. I won't remain pure, Father. I want to realise God as soon as possible, so I cannot think of your disease. I feel sorry for you, but I am helpless. Forgive me.</p>
<p>JAJATI <em>(to Puru):</em> Puru . . .</p>
<p>PURU: Father, you don't have to ask me. I shall take your disease.</p>
<p><em>(Puru touches the feet of his father and immediately falls to the ground. His whole face is changed. His body becomes the body of an old man. He is totally paralyzed. Sharmishtha begins shedding tears.)</em></p>
<p>SHARMISHTHA <em>(to Jajati):</em> Look! Look! Look what you have done! You are an old man. You have already enjoyed the world. And now you have ruined my son, my youngest and dearest son. He could have enjoyed the world. He could have done much for the world. You have ruined his life!</p>
<p>PURU: Mother, don't scold my father. Let him enjoy the world for as many years as he wants to. Then, when he is satisfied, he will take his disease back. Even if he does not want to, if he wants to enjoy the world to the end of his life, let him enjoy. I shall enjoy his suffering. Let him enjoy the pleasures of the world.</p>
<p><em>(Jajati sheds tears of gratitude.)</em></p>
<p>JAJATI <em>(to Puru):</em> Just a few years, a few fleeting years I shall enjoy, and then I shall take my disease back and you will be King. I shall make you King. <em>(To his other sons.)</em> You ungrateful creatures! I will have nothing more to do with you. Get out of my Kingdom! Get out! It is I who could have made you happy and prosperous. I did so much for you, but you have disappointed me bitterly, and my punishment is severe. You four are banished from my Kingdom.</p>

<p><em>(Many years have passed. Jajati enters Puru's room. Puru is lying on his bed, asleep, and is not awakened by Jajati's entrance.)</em></p>
<p>JAJATI <em>(to himself):</em> Ah, I have seen the world, I have enjoyed the world. I have been mixing with friends, having parties, living an ordinary life, but there is no joy, no satisfaction in it. I have seen that money cannot make me happy, women cannot make me happy, earthly possessions cannot make me happy. What can make me happy? Only God.</p>
<p><em>(Jajati sings.)</em> <em>Amar katha bhabi kebal tai parane byatha</em> <em>Kemane hai hasbe mane madhur nirabata</em> <em>Bhabi kebal manda amai amiy amar ari</em> <em>Nermi hiyay tomai prabhu nitya jena smari</em></p>
<p>[I always think about myself,</p>
<p>That is why my heart is full of pangs.</p>
<p>Alas, how can sweet silence smile in my mind?</p>
<p>I always think ill of myself.</p>
<p>I am my only enemy.</p>
<p>With sanctified heart,</p>
<p>may I always remember You,</p>
<p>my Lord Supreme.]</p>
<p>JAJATI: The life of pleasure can never satisfy any human being. What man needs is a life of joy and fulfilment. In order to have joy and fulfilment we must swim across the sea of desire and enter into the sea of aspiration. In me the life of desire has totally ended, and now the life of aspiration slowly begins. <em>(He calls aloud.)</em> Puru! Puru!</p>
<p><em>(Puru wakes up. Jajati goes and touches him.)</em></p>
<p>JAJATI: Puru, I wish to take back my disease from you. My son, you become King now. Let me take my punishment. I shall pray to God in this state and try to realise God through my prayers and meditation. You have pleased me most, my son, and you have my blessingful love, joy and gratitude. My Kingdom is yours. Everything I have is yours.</p>
<p><em>(Jajati falls down. His body is paralyzed. His face becomes aged and wrinkled.)</em></p>
<p>PURU <em>(gets up as a young man again):</em> Father, I am glad and proud that I have pleased you in your own way. Now, in your life of aspiration, in your life of love for God, I wish God to fulfil you.</p>

<p><em>(Two disciples in a room in their Master's ashram.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST DISCIPLE: I told you, I told you, I told you!</p>
<p>SECOND DISCIPLE: What did you tell me?</p>
<p>FIRST DISCIPLE: I told you that our Master has nothing. Nothing! He has no spiritual power. He has no occult power. He knows only how to talk. He talks about transcendental Reality and universal Consciousness and all about what he can do with his occult power. But it is all lies. He knows how to talk and we know how to listen to him. But he has nothing, nothing. Look, he has been suffering from his rheumatism for the last three months. If he had even an iota of occult power, he could have cured himself.</p>
<p>SECOND DISCIPLE: My heart tells me that he has the capacity to cure himself, but that God is asking him to have this experience.</p>
<p>FIRST DISCIPLE: He says he is taking on our <em>karma,</em> but we have done nothing. I have done nothing wrong. You and the other disciples have done nothing wrong. What happens is that he blames us when <em>he</em> does something wrong. Who knows what he has done wrong in the inner world? That's why he gets punishment. And outwardly he blames us.</p>
<p>SECOND DISCIPLE: He never blames us. And I believe him when he says he is taking our <em>karma.</em></p>
<p>FIRST DISCIPLE: You believe him? Then believe him. Remain with him and suffer. Die with him.</p>
<p>SECOND DISCIPLE: I shall die with him. Not only shall I die with him, but I shall die for him.</p>
<p>FIRST DISCIPLE: God created two types of people on earth: one type to deceive, another type to be deceived. One type to be rogues, the other type to be taken advantage of.</p>
<p><em>(Enter the Master. The first disciple begins to edge away. The second disciple touches the Master's feet.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER <em>(to the first disciple):</em> So you know that I have no capacity, that I just brag? I am not the right Master for you. You will do the best thing by going to some other Master, or waiting for the right Master to come to you. Leave me. Go home and live peacefully. <em>(To the second disciple.)</em> You believe in me. It is my duty to help you, to guide you. Now tell me, do you really feel that I take your ignorance, your imperfection into my body? Or do you just say it because you have studied my philosophy and books written by others? You have read about Ramakrishna, who took away the impurity, imperfection and ignorance of his disciples and suffered so much. Many, many spiritual Masters have said they have done the same. Do you think that I am just saying it because so many of them have said it? Do you think I am only talking, or do you think I actually take these things from you?</p>
<p>SECOND DISCIPLE: Master, I know what you take from me. Every day you take from me insincerity, obscurity, impurity, jealousy, doubt, insecurity and many other imperfections. Where do they go? I give them to you; they come to you. If there is nobody else on earth who believes it, I don't mind. Even if you tell me that you don't take it, that it is your own <em>karma,</em> I will not believe you. I know that God is giving you this experience for my sake. If I had gone through this particular experience, perhaps I would have died.</p>
<p>MASTER: My child, there are two reasons why I suffer. One reason is that I really take upon myself the burdens, the imperfections, the undivine qualities of my close disciples. That is what the Supreme wants me to do. There are two ways to take this <em>karma</em>. One way is to take it on oneself and suffer, and the other way is to throw the imperfections of the disciples into the Cosmic Consciousness. But the easier way, infinitely easier, is to take it on oneself. It is a direct way. You are suffering, and directly I touch you and take away your suffering. The other way is like carrying you to a different place, to the Universal Consciousness. The Cosmic Consciousness can be seen as a refuse heap. I take your impurities and imperfections and make them into a bundle. Then I have to carry that bundle there and throw it away. But the other way I just touch you and, like a magnet, I take away your sufferings, your pains, your undivine qualities. That way is easier and that's why I do it. God wants</p>
<p>me to do this. I say to God, "God, my children love me so much and I do not love them, I don't please them." Then God says to me, "Look how you suffer for them. Look at your own love, My son — how sincerely, how devotedly you love them. You feel that in your children's perfection is your perfection, which is absolutely true. They love you just because they feel that if they can possess you, they will possess everything. They love you to have you; you love them so that you can bring them to Me. You love them because you feel that if you can</p>
<p>bring them to Me, then you have played your part. By loving you for themselves, they feel that they have played their part. And when you love them, when you bring them to Me, to your Highest, then you feel that you have played your part. <em>(Pauses.)</em> Also, God has given me another reason to suffer. Many people come to me with only desire, desire, desire. They come to me only to fulfil their desires. But when they see that I am paralyzed with pain, that I am also subject to suffering and disease, that I am as weak as they are, they say, "He is an invalid, he is helpless. How can he help us in any way? How is he better than us?" They feel the best thing</p>
<p>is for them to go to somebody else who can help them, and many leave. But the truth of the matter is that God wants these people to leave me. This is the only way He can throw them out of my spiritual family. When they leave, my boat becomes lighter and can then go much faster toward the Goal. God wants desiring people, unaspiring people, to leave their Master and make the Master's boat lighter. So these are the reasons I suffer. When a sincere disciple sees that I am suffering for him, he says, "If I really love my Master, then I should give him only joy." So the disciple makes a promise, an inner promise: "I want him to be constantly proud of me, Nothing will give me greater joy than to see that my Master is always proud of me." So the disciple does not make any more mistakes and the Master becomes happy and proud.</p>
<p><em>(The first disciple touches the Master's feet.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST DISCIPLE: Master, for so long I was a faithless, inhuman creature. From today on I shall be your faithful, devoted disciple.</p>
<p>SECOND DISCIPLE: Master, I have been your devoted, faithful disciple for so long. Today you have told me the secret of your suffering. From today on I consider myself an important, conscious part of you. I consider myself an arm of yours. Master, your compassion is my life's only salvation.</p>
<p>FIRST DISCIPLE: Master, your forgiveness is my life's only salvation.</p>
<p>MASTER <em>(to the first disciple):</em> By recognising your stupidity, your ignorance, you have brought your divinity to the fore. <em>(To the second disciple.)</em> By recognising me, my spiritual Truth, you have manifested God's Divinity on earth. You have manifested God's Will on earth.</p>

<p><em>(Akbar's palace. A large audience has assembled before Akbar. His court musician, Tansen, is playing soul-stirring music.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Tansen sings.)</em></p>

<p>[Imagination, O imagination!<br /> You are my life's adoration.<br /> You I shall not keep afar.<br /> Imagination, O imagination!<br /> In false, binding lies I shall not cry.<br /> I shall not welcome the life<br /> of impurity's ugliness.<br /> With paltry victory<br /> I shall not smile and rejoice.<br /> Imagination, O imagination!<br /> To death's call I shall not respond.<br /> The soul am I, no death have I.<br /> No more, never, shall I walk<br /> along the wrong path.<br /> Imagination, O Imagination!]</p>

<p>AKBAR: Tansen, your music carries me into the highest world, and there I enjoy such happiness, such delight. Tansen, I shall give you anything you want. You can have anything from me for the asking.</p>
<p>TANSEN: O Emperor, you have already given me name and fame by allowing me to play for you. What more do I need?</p>
<p>AKBAR: Tansen, although you get everything from me, if you have any special desire, ask me and I shall grant it. Anything that you want from me today I shall immediately give you.</p>
<p>TANSEN: I have everything I want. But I have one thing to tell you. You think that I am the best musician. But there is someone who is far better than I. He is the one who taught me how to play. I am no match for him.</p>
<p>MINISTER: O Akbar, O Emperor, your Tansen is very clever. He wants to gain more favour from you with his false modesty. Don't believe him. He thinks that by telling you that there is somebody better than he is, he will gain more favour, more love, from you. This Tansen is so clever. He is the greatest musician, but he is also the greatest trickster. Don't believe him, my Lord.</p>
<p>AKBAR: No, Tansen, I don't believe you. But if it is true, then you should have told me about him before this.</p>
<p>TANSEN: O Emperor, you will never believe me. If I had told you about him, do you think he would have come to you? He does not care for name and fame as I do. He would not want to play here at your palace.</p>
<p>AKBAR: He must come and play here. I shall force him. I am the Emperor Akbar. Everyone is at my behest. He has to come and play. Go and bring him here.</p>
<p>TANSEN: I can go and bring him here, but I tell you, if you force him to play, he will play, but he will never play his real music. He is above name and fame. He shuns society.</p>
<p>AKBAR: All right, then I shall go to his house.</p>
<p>TANSEN: Well, if you go to his house, perhaps he will play. But he always shuns great men. If he sees that the Emperor has come, he will not play at all. If I request him, even if I plead with him, it will all be useless, because you are a great man, the greatest man on earth. Perhaps if you come with me as my servant, and if I tell him that my servant would like to hear his music, then he may condescend to grant my request.</p>
<p>AKBAR: All right, Tansen, I will visit your teacher as your servant. I want to hear your master's music since you are praising him to the skies. But he had better be good!</p>

<p><em>(Haridas' home. Enter Tansen, and Akbar in the guise of Tansen's servant. Haridas is meditating.)</em></p>
<p>TANSEN: Master, here is my servant. He has been begging me for a long time to bring him to hear your music. Today I have brought him.</p>
<p>AKBAR <em>(to Haridas):</em> Lord, I will be so grateful to you if you play. For some time I have been longing to hear your music. Today my master, Tansen, has brought me to you. Please play.</p>
<p>HARIDAS: I am sorry. Today I am not in the mood to play at all. I do not know why. Otherwise I would listen to your request. You look quite nice and smart. I am happy that my Tansen has such a good servant. You look beautiful, you look powerful. I am sure you are pleasing your master in every way.</p>
<p>TANSEN: Master, it is true that this servant is pleasing me in every way. I am most pleased with him and proud of him and, as a reward, I have brought him here. Please play for him just a little. It will be difficult for me to bring him here again.</p>
<p>HARIDAS: Tansen, when I refuse to do something, rest assured that I will never do it. I am not in the mood today. Today my mind is all concentrated on God. You came to me to learn music. I taught you many things, and now when you play I get tremendous joy. Today I wish you to play for me. Let your servant and me hear your music. It will transport me into the highest realm. Your music will inspire me to go deep within and commune with my inner Pilot. Now, Tansen, please play.</p>
<p><em>(Tansen bows to Haridas and starts playing. Soon he starts playing wrong notes.)</em></p>
<p>HARIDAS: Tansen, what is wrong with you today? Your music is absurd. You are playing like an absolute beginner. You, my greatest student! Is anything wrong in your family? Are you upset?</p>
<p>TANSEN: No, no, my family is all right. But today I had the greatest hope that my servant would be able to hear your music. You did not listen to my request, and that has made me very sad. Perhaps it is my sadness that is creating this problem and making it difficult for me to play well.</p>
<p>HARIDAS: No matter how sad you are, Tansen, I can't imagine how you can play so badly.</p>
<p>TANSEN: Master, it seems to me that I am playing everything correctly. You are saying that I am playing badly, but I feel that I am playing everything as I used to play before, as you have taught me.</p>
<p>HARIDAS: Tansen, you liar! I have not taught you to play like this. It is all wrong.</p>
<p><em>(Haridas snatches away Tansen's vina and starts playing most soulfully and hauntingly. The music comes from another world. Akbar is in deep trance. Tansen is listening with deepest inner delight.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Haridas sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Ekti katha ekti sur ekyi jhankar</em><br /><em>Nam dhare ke dakchhe jena amai barebar</em><br /><em>Kothai achi kothai jabo</em><br /><em>Nai jena thikena</em><br /><em>Ghumer ghore karchhi shudhu</em><br /><em>Ami becha kena</em><br /><em>Kata bhangi katai gari</em><br /><em>Katai kari ashha</em><br /><em>Hiya khani dhekechhe mor</em><br /><em>Andhar sarbanasha</em><br /><em>Alor pakhi alor pakhi</em><br /><em>Abar eso phire</em><br /><em>Jyotir dhara banan kare</em><br /><em>Namo amar shire</em><br /><em>Dak ditechha urdhe jete</em><br /><em>Jabo keman kare</em><br /><em>Bandi je mor paran khani</em><br /><em>Ekti andhar ghare</em><br /><em>Alor pakhi alor pakhi</em><br /><em>Alor pakhi alo</em><br /><em>Prane amar rekhona ar</em><br /><em>Ektu andhar kalo</em></p>


<p>[One thought, one tune, one resonance —<br /> Who calls me ever and anon?<br /> I know not where I am,<br /> I know not whither I shall go.<br /> In dark amnesia, myself I buy, myself I sell.<br /> All I break, again all I build.<br /> All I hope to be mine, mine alone.<br /> Alas, my heart is eclipsed by dark and wild<br /> destruction-night.<br /> O Bird of Light, O Bird of Light,<br /> With your glowing and flowing flames<br /> do enter into my heart once again.<br /> You are calling me to climb up<br /> and fly into the blue.<br /> But how can I?<br /> My heart is in prison<br /> in the strangled breath of a tiny room.<br /> O Bird of Light, O Bird of Light,<br /> O Bird of Light Supreme.<br /> In me, I pray, keep not an iota of gloom.]</p>

<p>TANSEN <em>(at the end of the music):</em> Master, forgive me. I know I have played all wrong today. After hearing you I realise how badly I have played. Forgive me, forgive me.</p>
<p>AKBAR <em>(bows):</em> I always thought that my master was the best musician, but he was sincere enough to say that you play far better than he does. I didn't believe him. But now that I have heard you, I know that undoubtedly you are a far better musician. I am so grateful to you and also I am so grateful to my master for bringing me to you today.</p>
<p>HARIDAS: May God bless you, my son. May God bless your devoted head. You are serving your master, who is my fondest son.</p>
<p>TANSEN: I am also fond of my servant.</p>
<p>AKBAR: Lord, I am also proud of my master, Tansen.</p>
