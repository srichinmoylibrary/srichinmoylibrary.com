<p>SHYAM SUNDAR: It seems to me that the more the writings of Aurobindo Babu are coming out in the <em>Bande Mataram</em>, the faster is India progressing towards the goal of her freedom.</p>
<p>HEMENDRA PRASAD: My friend, it is a pity that only a limited circle knows who is behind the great ideal of the Boycott movement, Passive Resistance and National Education. Aurobindo doesn't care a straw for fame. He is all for action.</p>

<p>AUROBINDO: How could you expect anything better from such fools? Would they ever care to know that to no one else is the catastrophe so great a blow as to your patriotic heart? You are absolutely right in disliking the do-nothingness of that assembly. That you valued it both as a great national fact and for its unrealised possibilities and hoped to make of it a central organisation for practical work is a matter of great joy to me. I am sure you will be remembered by all 'so long as our Motherland has pride in its past and hope for its future.'</p>
<p>TILAK: Alas, it is my own countrymen who let loose the full flood of their abuse upon me. But to my joy your fate will be otherwise. All those who have true love of the country will come to love you, admire your great sacrifice and adore the Seer in you.</p>

<p>LELE: But I always take you to be an exception. Come, let us sit down on the floor.</p>
<p><em>(They sit down.)</em></p>
<p>LELE: Sit in meditation, but do not think, look only at your mind; you will see thoughts coming into it; before they can enter throw these away from your mind till your mind is capable of entire silence.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Let me try.</p>
<p><em>(He accepts Lele's statement with absolute faith and follows his instructions to the letter. He begins to meditate. After one day all thought ceases. Three days, during which a little food is taken mechanically from a plate, pass by. There is the full realisation of Nirvana. Lele communicates again with Aurobindo on the third day.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Enter Lele)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(With a bowed head)</em> Quite a success. I made a perfect void of my mind and followed your instructions to the letter after my Namaskar to the audience. Soon a voice from within me started speaking. Immediately there were thundering cheers.</p>
<p>LELE: Arvind, I was fully aware of it. Your inner Guide spoke through you.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Quite so, Lele Maharaj. Before I received your assurance I was in great anxiety. Not even one useful thought flashed across my mind. How could I constructively address a big gathering? But it all turned out wonderfully well. Lele Maharaj, you may read my heart and see how grateful I am to you.</p>

Barin and Bibhuti take their positions on two sides. Nolini is some way afar on a tree to command a full view. From Prafulla's hands the missile flies towards the slope. It was expected to explode after touching the ground. But its passage through the air causes a deafening explosion scattering splinters. A cheerful voice comes from the tree: "Successful!

<p>CREAGAN: <em>(At the top of his voice)</em> Then to become rich you have done all this? Now take the consequences. <em>(To the police)</em> Wait, I'm coming back.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Creagan)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(To himself)</em> Poor obtuse Englishman, how can you appreciate the values of self-imposed poverty and of self-dedication to the cause of one's Motherland?</p>
<p><em>(Enter Krishna Kumar Mitra, Editor of </em>Sanjibani/, uncle of Aurobindo, and solicitor Bhupen Bose. His uncle is unable to resist tears.)/</p>
<p><em>(Re-enter Creagan)</em></p>
<p>BHUPEN: <em>(Addressing Creagan)</em> You are not entitled to treat Aurobindo like that. Take off the handcuffs and the rope.</p>
<p><em>(Creagan orders removal of the handcuffs and the cord.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Alipore Central Jail. A solitary cell 9' x 5' with a small courtyard in front. Aurobindo in contemplation. A column of blue Light from above descends and illumines his cell. A god-like figure emerges from the Light.)</em></p>
<p>FIGURE: How do you find your jail life here?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: To me it's no jail. It is my Yogashram.</p>
<p>FIGURE: Yogashram?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Decidedly.</p>
<p>FIGURE. Your enemies have put you here.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: I was striving hard to see Narayana within me as Friend, Master or Providence, but could not. Family ties, attachment to work and a number of other things stood like a wall between Him and me. Now those whom you call my enemies have peremptorily broken those attachments and whisked me away as if from my moorings and put me here in this splendid isolation where I can, quite undisturbed, dive into my depths and see my Lord, my Friend, my Guardian, my Guide, my All-in-all face-to-face. That is why I find in this solitary cell my precious seclusion for union with the Self of my self. He gave me an affectionate family, loving relations, friends, well-wishers, admirers countless in number but more than any one of them, more than all of them put together, my so-called enemies have done me the greatest good. They are no longer my enemies. They are the best of my friends. And this is not the only instance. It is one out of many. Hence, I say, enemies I have none.</p>

<p><em>(Statement of Barindra Kumar Ghosh before L. Birley, Magistrate of the first class at Alipore.)</em></p>
<p>BIRLEY: Do you wish to make a statement before me? [fn:7]</p>
<p>BARIN: Yes.</p>
<p>BIRLEY: Do you understand that your statement being made before a Magistrate will be admissible as evidence against you?</p>
<p>BARIN: Yes.</p>
<p>BIRLEY: Is your statement being made voluntarily or has any pressure been put upon you to make it?</p>
<p>BARIN: It is quite voluntary.</p>
<p>BIRLEY: Will you tell me what you have to say?</p>
<p>BARIN: Whatever I had to say I have said in a written statement.</p>
<p>BIRLEY: Have you any objection to making that statement to me here?</p>
<p>BARIN: Shall I begin at the very beginning?</p>
<p>BIRLEY: Yes ... When were you arrested?</p>
<p>BARIN: The day before yesterday, early in the morning.</p>
<p>BIRLEY: Where?</p>
<p>BARIN: At 32 Muraripukur Road.</p>
<p>BIRLEY: Who else was there?</p>
<p>BARIN: Ullaskar Dutt, Upendra Nath Banerji, Indra Bhusan Rai, Bibhuti Bhusan Sarkar, Paresh Chandra Mallick, Nolini Kanta Gupta, Kunja Lal Saha, Sachindra Nath Sen, Purna Chandra Sen, Hemendra Nath Ghosh, Sisir Kumar Ghosh, Bijoy Kanta Nag and others.</p>
<p>Please take down my motive for disclosing these names. Our party was divided as to the propriety of disclosing these names. Some thought they would deny everything and take the consequences but I persuaded them all to give written and oral statements to inspector Ramsaday Mukerji because I believe that as the band was found out, it was best not to do any other work in the country, and because we ought to save the innocent.</p>

<p><em>(Sessions Court of Mr. Beachcroft. Prior to the identification parade Sudhir Sarkar, an accused, whispers to Nolini Kanta Gupta that during the parade he will be posing as one afraid of being identified, while Nolini, the real accused in connection with the Jesidih bomb affairs, should keep standing quite unconcerned. The accused are brought out into the open and made to stand in a line in front of the prosecution Counsel Mr. Eardley Norton. Prosecution witnesses are brought in one by one.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter the 1st witness)</em></p>
<p>NORTON: <em>(Asking the first witness)</em> Have you seen any of them?</p>
<p>1st WITNESS: Yes, I have.</p>
<p>NORTON: <em>(Cheerfully)</em> Point them out.</p>
<p><em>(The witness slowly passes along the line, points out one or two and then withdraws.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter the 2nd witness)</em></p>
<p>NORTON: <em>(To the 2nd witness, the signal cabinman of Jesidih Railway Function who is expected to identify the persons involved in the local event)</em> Look at these men. Point out those you saw over the crossing on their way to Dighiriya Hill.</p>
<p><em>(The witness passes by the accused including Nolini. And, befooled by his cleverly studied movements, the witness fixes upon Sudhir as the culprit amidst a roar of laughter by the visitors and the accused.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter the 3rd witness)</em></p>
<p>NORTON: <em>(To the 3rd witness)</em> Whom among these have you seen?</p>
<p>WITNESS: I know nothing, I know none of them. Neither do I know why the police have brought me here. <em>(Side-splitting laughter from the accused and the visitors.)</em></p>

<p>DALY: It pains me to see you confined to this solitary cell. The jail Superintendent has kindly listened to my request. He has allowed you to have a walk in the open courtyard.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(Smiling)</em> I thank you both.</p>
