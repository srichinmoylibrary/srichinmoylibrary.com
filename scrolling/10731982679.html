<p>The mind is a creativity. So also is a thought.<br /> The mind says to a thought, "I have you."<br /> The thought says to the mind, "You I am."</p>
<p>The heart is a creativity. So also is love.<br /> The heart says to love, "I have you."<br /> Love says to the heart, "You I am."</p>
<p>The soul is a creativity. So also is life.<br /> The soul says to life, "I have you."<br /> Life says to the soul, "You I am."</p>
<p>The learning of the mind is a creativity, an expanding creativity.<br /> The feeling of the heart is a creativity, a deepening creativity.<br /> The becoming of life is a creativity, a manifesting creativity.</p>
<p>Art is Eternity's cry.<br /> Art is Infinity's smile.<br /> Art is Immortality's delight.</p>
<p>Music is not the mind's creativity-noise.<br /> Music is the heart's creativity-voice.</p>
<p>Poetry is not an earthly chimera's mist-creativity.<br /> Poetry is a Heavenly beauty-dawn-creativity.</p>
<p>Art and God sleeplessly talk together.<br /> Music and God breathlessly feel each other.<br /> Poetry and God unceasingly look at each other.</p>
<p>My life is God's creation.<br /> My blossoming smiles are my soul-creations.<br /> My streaming tears are my heart-creations.</p>
<p>The inner creation is the source.<br /> The outer creation is the course.</p>
<p>The inner creation is indispensable.<br /> The outer creation is irresistible.</p>
<p>My aspiration-heart's inner creation is God-exploration-delight.<br /> My dedication-life's outer creation is God-manifestation-light.</p>

<p>Creativity is in learning. Creativity is in unlearning as well. Creativity is in action-manifestation. Creativity is in inaction â€” rest as well â€” only we have to know the proper order for the fulfilment of our life.</p>
<p>My life cries ditto to the wise Chinese saying, "Be the first in the field, the last to the couch."</p>
<p>My creativity-boat plies between my desire-earth-tears and my aspiration-Heaven-smiles. On a lighter note, only an English conductor perhaps can dare to declare: "The English may not like music, but they absolutely love the noise it makes!"</p>
<p>Being an Indian, I feel I have the legitimate audacity to declare: the Indian music of yore touches, illumines and fulfils my very earth-existence. The modern â€” with an ultra-modern touch â€” Indian music chases me into the land of nowhere!</p>
<p>From the spiritual point of view, creativity is the beauty of God-revelation and the fragrance of God-manifestation.</p>
<p>Creativity is multiplicity's bloom in unity's blossom.</p>
<p>In the outer world, creativity is the light of individuality.</p>
<p>In the inner world, creativity is the delight of universality.</p>
<p>No matter how sublime the creativity is, the creator of it is notindispensable. If he comes to realise that, only then will he have peace of mind and abiding satisfaction.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish to invoke the most celebrated of the ancient Greek mathematicians-Archimedes. "Eureka! I have found it," was his discovery-cry.</p>
<p>O aspiring world, Him I have found, my Lord Supreme, in the aspiration-beauty and dedication-fragrance of my art, music and poetry.</p>

<p><em>25 June 1998</em></p>
<p><em>University of Texas at Austin</em></p>
<p>DR. WILLIAM LIVINGSTON (Senior Vice-President, the University of Texas at Austin): Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great, good fortune to be asked this evening to introduce our speaker, and I do so with pride and pleasure.</p>
<p>For a long time Sri Chinmoy has dedicated his life to the achievement of world peace and the fulfilment of the human spirit. He works towards these goals in a number of different ways. He is a poet, an author, an essayist, a speaker, a musician, an artist and, not least, an athlete. Nowadays he works out of New York, but his interests and his travels have taken him to many parts of the globe. He has inspired and encouraged people throughout the world by his activities and by the example of his own life.</p>
<p>The prizes and awards and commendations that he has received make it perfectly obvious that he has touched the lives of many people in many different places.</p>
<p>Texas is widely known as the home not only of individuality, but also of hospitality-a rough and ready culture in which men and women are prepared to stand alone, but in which they are also prepared to lend a hand to a neighbour. I think you will find this audience a congenial one, and one prepared to listen to your message with great interest.</p>
<p>This spring, the University adopted a new slogan or a theme called, "We're Texas." It was intended to enhance our sense of belonging here in Texas and to exemplify the culture of this part of the country. But as you see, the student body of this institution is marked by considerable diversity, both in its composition and in its interest and outlook. We tried to epitomise this slogan in our commencement programme in May by reproducing in it, in as many languages as possible, that slogan that had been adopted. It was thus presented to all the guests at the commencement. The intent was to reproduce it in all the languages represented by people in the student body. I can say to you it was not easy to render it, say, in the Cyrillic alphabet or to translate it into Bengali. But the point I make here is that we ran out of space in the programme before we ran out of languages to put it in. Accordingly, Sri Chinmoy, if you hope to reach out to many different peoples and cultures, I say to you that this is a good place in which to articulate your message.</p>
<p>One of the great problems of our time is, of course, to extend adequate communication across national and cultural boundaries, and to bring the varied communities of our world together in a common concern for peace and progress. Thus it is with great pleasure that I join these student organisations and this faculty in welcoming you to the University of Texas. It is the participation and the visits of people such as yourself that enrich the experience of our students and provide the yeast and flavour of life in a great university.</p>
<p>I welcome you, Sir, to this university and to this audience, and I am most pleased to present to this audience a man of rich experience and one who is deeply committed to an objective to which all of us may subscribe. Sri Chinmoy calls himself "a dreamer of world peace," but as I examine his biography and ponder his message, I have to say that he commits himself not merely to dreams but to actions and efforts. He is here tonight to share with us his dream and to enlist us in those efforts. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Sri Chinmoy Kumar Ghose.</p>
<p>DR. LESTER KURTZ (Professor of Sociology and Asian Studies, on behalf of the Department of Sociology and the Ad Hoc Committee on Peace and Conflict Studies): There is such a wonderful turnout for tonight's concert that I am really tempted to give a lecture, but I have this suspicion that you are not here to hear me. And so let me just say that it is a delight to be here to welcome Sri Chinmoy, to have all of you here. Let me simply read the plaque that I'm going to present to Sri Chinmoy.</p>
<p>Reads plaque: "The Department of Sociology and the Ad Hoc Committee on Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Texas at Austin are pleased to present Sri Chinmoy with the Peace Educator Award on the occasion of his visit to the University of Texas at Austin as a distinguished speaker and in recognition of his tireless commitment to world peace. Through his writings, paintings and musical compositions as well as through the global Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run, the International Peace-Blossom family and his worldwide Peace Concert programme, Sri Chinmoy has become a teacher of world peace to millions of people worldwide. Through eloquent words and actions, Sri Chinmoy has been striving to foster humanity's goal of goals: world peace. Austin, Texas, June 25, 1998."</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>SRI CHINMOY: I wish to offer my heartfelt gratitude to the many faculty, staff and students who have worked so hard for the success of this evening's programme. Highly esteemed Senior Vice-President Livingston, I am extremely grateful to you for your very kind and gracious introduction, as well as for the blessingful letter of welcome which you wrote to me last month. Your entire life has been consecrated to inspiring and encouraging your fellow professors and students at the University of Texas and worldwide. Therefore, I feel specially honoured and prayerfully moved by your soul-stirring words.</p>
<p>I would like to offer my heart's deepest appreciation to Professor Lester Kurtz, Professor of Sociology and Asian Studies and an enthusiastic pioneer of peace studies through the Ad Hoc Committee on Peace and Conflict Studies. Your tireless vision for a world of non-violence and peace has taken you to the four corners of the globe, including my homeland, India, and my heart is all gratitude to you for your kind invitation to your august University. I shall deeply treasure the "Peace Educator Award" which you have just bestowed upon my devoted head and aspiring heart.</p>
<p>May I also thank my student-friends of the Distinguished Speakers Committee for their wholehearted enthusiasm and support for my visit tonight.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My Peace-Education-Life</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My Peace-Education-Life" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Peace I find when I am lost inside God's Compassion-Eye.</p>
<p>Peace I become when I am lost inside God's Forgiveness-Feet.</p>
<p>Mine is a mind-jungle totally empty of peace.</p>
<p>Mine is a heart-garden flooded with peace.</p>
<p>The divine in us embraces peace.</p>
<p>The human in us longs for peace.</p>
<p>The animal in us destroys peace.</p>
<p>President Gorbachev, the peace-dreamer, peace-bringer and peace-server of this century, has urged again and again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What we need is Star Peace and not Star Wars."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I heave a sigh when my mind becomes a victim to searing conflicts.</p>
<p>I become a singing bird when my life becomes the breath of peace.</p>
<p>My heart's God-love-beauty has peace.</p>
<p>My life's God-surrender-fragrance is peace.</p>
<p>The dream-flooded and soul-stirring words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ring forth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I still believe that one day mankind will bow before the altars of God and be crowned triumphant over war and bloodshed."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Devotedly I chant the Name of my Beloved Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>Bountifully my Beloved Lord Supreme enchants my life.</p>
<p>My soul's peace-smiles and my heart's peace-tears together cover endless miles unobstructed.</p>
<p>Infinity is the Source of my soul's peace-smiles.</p>
<p>Eternity is the Source of my heart's peace-tears.</p>
<p>Peace is infinitely more than the birthless and deathless promises of my mind.</p>
<p>Peace is in the ever-blossoming hopes of my heart.</p>
<p>I wish to cite the momentous utterance of U Thant, the third Secretary-General of the United Nations, who was widely revered for his innate spirituality and deep wisdom. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is no peace in the world today because there is no peace in the minds of men."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God comes to me, compassionately and unconditionally, and gives me Peace.</p>
<p>Man comes to me, immediately and ruthlessly, and takes away all my peace.</p>
<p>God comes and man comes.</p>
<p>When God comes, I swim in the ocean of infinite Delight.</p>
<p>When man comes, my very earth-existence is devoured by the unquenchable thirst and insatiable hunger of sorrows.</p>
<p>But love mankind I must, for mankind is unmistakably an extension of my own reality-existence. The lofty realisation of Mother Teresa, the twentieth century's unparalleled server of bleeding humanity, echoes and re-echoes in the inmost recesses of my heart: "Works of love are works of peace."</p>

<p>I ask God,<br /> "My Lord, is there any way I can embody<br /> and treasure Your Peace forever and forever?"<br /> God says,<br /> "My child, there is a way.<br /> Just illumine your mind more, infinitely more.<br /> Feed your heart more, infinitely more.<br /> Energise your life more, infinitely more.<br /> Lo, in you My Infinity's Peace has found its Eternity's Abode."</p>

<p>Peace is today's soul-seed-world.</p>
<p>Peace is tomorrow's life-tree-world.</p>
<p>But the peace of tomorrow must be built upon the solid foundations of today. What are those foundations? President Woodrow Wilson, the champion of the League of Nations, has a most significant message for the world-community in this connection. He advises us that lasting peace can never be the fruit of a war where one side defeats the other. "It must be a peace without victory," he proclaims.</p>
<p>O world, you will not be happy and satisfied if you come and visit God's omnipotent Power-Head, but you will be completely happy and supremely satisfied if you come and visit God's omnipresent Peace-Feet. Man thinks his mind's love for world power and his heart's love for world peace can live together. Indeed, this is the height of man's stupidity.</p>
<p>Up until now, God has been pleading with the human mind to study the world peace course. But now God is forcing the human mind to study the world peace course.</p>
<p>The moment the division-mind desires to live in the heart of oneness-peace-world, God will immediately declare His supreme Victory on earth.</p>
<p>One minute of world peace is ten hours with God.</p>

<p><em>New York</em></p>
<p><em>30 March 1993</em></p>
<p>On 30 March 1993 the United Nations Staff Recreation Council Society of Writers honoured Sri Chinmoy for the publication of his 900th book and for receiving the degree of Doctor of Humanities, Honoris Causa, from the University of Southern Philippines in January of that year.</p>
<p>MR. HANS JANITSCHEK (President, Society of Writers): I am a writer, not a poet, but I have learned a lot from poetry. And Sri Chinmoy's writing touches me deeply. Whether it is 9,000 poems or just one, it is beautiful, it is wonderful, it warms your heart and inspires you, lifts you up and makes you move. Most great poets have also been great movers. They have changed the world by changing the minds and the hearts of people.</p>
<p>We are gathered here at a building where billions of words are being written which no one reads, which have no effect, which no one would ever want to have because the quantity is meaningless if there is no substance or spirit.</p>
<p>Yesterday during the Oscars, Federico Fellini, another great poet, was quoted as having said, "The visionaries are the true realists." Sri Chinmoy, you are a visionary of the first order, and what you are saying, what you are writing is real â€” real for each of us as individuals, real for the United Nations as an organisation.</p>
<p>I have been watching you over the decades quietly walking the halls of the United Nations. I have heard you play instruments. But above all I have felt your presence. And that is poetry of the highest order, because what poetry does is convey feelings. Again, Federico Fellini said: "The message is the feeling." The message is hard to describe without feelings, and this is why the presence of a great man, a holy man to many, changes the picture. In your presence, things change. In your presence, we feel something that we would not feel otherwise, and when we leave you, we take something with us. Sometimes it is a rose; sometimes it is a piece of delicious chocolate, if we are lucky. But above all, it is that feeling of eternity, of goodness, of warmth, of love.</p>
<p>In this spirit it gives me special pleasure to present you today with an award that we have given to other interesting people before. One of them comes to mind instantly because of the special relationship you have to him, and that, of course, is Mikhail S. Gorbachev. I know you met him when he was in power, and I saw a photograph of you together soon after the fall. You were there, and he wanted you there, in the moment of glory and in the moment of defeat because, again, I do believe your spirit played a role. And he knew it. A man that was the most powerful man in the world in terms of material power gave it all up because of faith in the spirit of man and the dignity of man.</p>
<p>We gave this award to Vanessa Redgrave; we gave this award to Jason Robards; we gave it to Carl Bernstein; we gave it to Norman Mailer; to Arthur Miller. I could go on and on. Today we are giving it to you. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to give you this beautiful piece of art with three wonderful words, just three words on it: Ex mente orbis â€” â€œFrom the mind comes the world." Nothing can describe you better than these three Latin words.</p>

<p>I do not know how I can possibly be worthy of this blessingful honour. I am known as a truth-seeker and a God-lover. But today I have become a poet as well.</p>
<p>May I read out to you the very first poem that I wrote in English?</p>

<p>The Golden Flute</p>
<p>A sea of Peace and Joy and Light<br /> Beyond my reach I know.<br /> In me the storm-tossed weeping night<br /> Finds room to rage and flow.</p>
<p>I cry aloud, but all in vain;<br /> I helpless, the earth unkind!<br /> What soul of might can share my pain?<br /> Death-dart alone I find.</p>
<p>A raft am I on the sea of Time,<br /> My oars are washed away.<br /> How can I hope to reach the clime<br /> Of God's eternal Day?<br /> But hark! I hear Thy golden Flute,<br /> Its notes bring the Summit down.<br /> Now safe am I, O Absolute!<br /> Gone death, gone night's stark frown!</p>

<p>So that was my very first attempt â€” over forty years ago. And this particular poem that I am going to read out is only three hours old. You will see the difference. You can call it either my most deplorable degradation and say that I have gone "downhill," or you can say that I have made progress in a different way.</p>

<p>There was a time<br /> When the poet in me<br /> Prayerfully desired to roam and roam<br /> Inside my heart-garden.</p>
<p>The poet in me now sleeplessly cries<br /> To clasp the flower-beauty<br /> Of my heart-garden.</p>
<p>And before long, the poet in me<br /> Will meditatively grow into<br /> The nectar-fragrance-delight<br /> Of my heart-garden.</p>

<p>I have been living in America for the last twenty-nine years, so I am enjoying American freedom in my poetry. When I embarked on my poetic career many, many years ago, I was compelled from within and without to learn English metre well. I had to learn iambic, dactylic, trochee, anapaest â€” endless English metre â€” as well as rhyme. But now I enjoy full freedom: I do not need metre; I do not need rhyme-nothing, nothing! It is a flow. When I was writing poems in those days, I felt that I was playing on the flute. Now when I write poems, perhaps I am striking gongs or playing on the synthesizer. But I feel that light and power are inseparable. They are the obverse and reverse of the same universal reality.</p>
<p>In my family, almost everybody has written poems. My father wrote about thirty poems; my two older brothers, one to a hundred; and my eldest brother, two or three thousand. I am the youngest and also, it seems, the most greedy. Over 50,000 poems go to my credit. My critics justifiably criticise me for having written so many poems. They say that I believe only in quantity and not in quality. They are perfectly right in their own way or according to their own judgement. But I feel that quantity is necessary as well as quality. I visit the supermarket quite often. The supermarket has many varieties of food, and I am able to choose what I need or want. If the supermarket had only one thing, I would be disappointed along with hundreds of other customers. So quality and quantity must go together.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to be a real judge of quality. I am an artist. Over 140,000 paintings I have completed. Some of my paintings I sincerely feel are not good at all. But to my utter astonishment, some people immensely appreciate those particular paintings, and I feel they are sincere in their appreciation and judgement.</p>
<p>A tree produces beautiful flowers as well as countless leaves. If we only care for the beauty and fragrance of the flowers and pay no attention to the leaves, then we are making a deplorable mistake, an Himalayan blunder, for the leaves also have beauty in their own way. A tree is beautiful and fruitful only when we look at it right from the ground to the highest branch. Only when we look at the tree as a whole and try to appreciate what it has and what it is can we do proper justice to its beauty, its compassion and its perfection.</p>
<p>I am extremely grateful to this distinguished Writers Society for bestowing upon me this signal honour at a time in my life when I am not as well known in the world of poetry as in the world of truth-seekers and peace-servers. People know me as a student of peace, as a truth-seeker, a God-lover and a world-server. But here my friends and colleagues have found an entire sun inside some of the climbing, aspiring poetic flames I have created. And for that I am extremely, extremely grateful to them.</p>
<p>It has happened in many cases that the world is apt to appreciate someone only when he is already known in a particular field. The world waits and waits until he is famous before appreciating him. I wish to tell you a most deplorable incident in the life of India's greatest poet, Rabindranath Tagore, the Nobel Laureate. Only two weeks before he received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, the editor of a significant and popular magazine in Bengal printed one of Tagore's poems and mercilessly criticised it from the first line to the last line. The Bengali editor found nothing beautiful, nothing soulful, nothing fruitful in the poem. Then, after Tagore got the Nobel Prize, the same poem was printed in the same magazine. But this time the editor extolled that particular poem to the skies. Not only each line but each word came down directly from Heaven-that was his proud comment! So we see what the Nobel Prize can do. Because Tagore had been accepted by great literary authorities, immediately the editor changed his mind.</p>
<p>This year is the centenary of the World's Parliament of Religions. Swami Vivekananda was a great friend of Tagore. As you know, Swami Vivekananda's most significant utterances were made in Chicago when he addressed the world conference. Before he spoke at the world parliament, he was nobody, absolutely nobody, in India. But after he became famous overnight in America, immediately Bengal and the entire India accepted him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only when the outer world or some well-established authority praises someone or justifiably acknowledges his merit is everybody else apt to appreciate that person. Although I am not known as a poet, still you are recognising the poet in me. For that I am deeply grateful to you. Who knows, in the future, with a stroke of good luck, I may be known as a poet. At that time I will feel that you saw something in me long before others were able to see it.</p>
<p>I have already spoken to you about quality and quantity. This particular book happens to be my 900th book â€” <em>Love, Compassion, Forgiveness</em>. I have dedicated this book to my beloved President Gorbachev. About two weeks ago I received a letter from him appreciating me for dedicating this book to him. Also, he said he wants to congratulate me personally in the near future.</p>
<p>Reading the dedication of the book: "Lovingly, affectionately and gratefully I am dedicating this book to the President Gorbachev, the Himalayan Peace-Dreamer on earth."</p>
<p>I wish to say a few words about President Gorbachev. To me, he is a universal figure. To me, he is the highest embodiment of world peace. He is the greatest world peace-dreamer and world peace-distributor. If the present-day world has made considerable progress, or any progress, then he deserves the utmost gratitude from the heart of the present-day world. He is the champion of champions to unmistakably improve the world situation.</p>
<p>In India it is said that a real Brahmin does not have to show his sacred thread to the public in order to prove that he is a real Brahmin. Similarly, I feel that President Gorbachev does not have to show the world his credentials to prove who he really is. He is loved and adored by the aspiration of the length and breadth of the world. He does not need a particular crown or a particular throne in order to prove to the world at large that he is, indeed, a king. President Gorbachev lives in the aspiring heart of mankind. I feel that Gorbachev is a universal king who lives inside the gratitude-heart of the peace-dreaming world. He definitely does not need an outer crown, an outer throne, to lovingly and compassionately guide the evolution of humanity. His inner achievements are so enormous that they can perfectly lead and guide us to our supreme destination, the Golden Shore. For him, peace is not a mere dictionary word. In him, peace is a living reality, a sleepless and all-illumining reality that lovingly and self-givingly inspires the mind and feeds the heart of humanity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">7. Poetry-Poem-Poet</h2><span property="dc:title" content="7. Poetry-Poem-Poet" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Musikaliska Akademien</em></p>
<p><em>Stockholm, Sweden</em></p>
<p><em>16 October 1990</em></p>
<p>Prose you can write. Prose he can write. Prose even I can write. But God writes poetry through you, through him and even through me.</p>
<p>Poetry is the shortcut to reach the subtle and tangible Goal of goals â€” Delight infinite. A poem starts in streaming tears and ends in soaring smiles.</p>
<p>The poet beckons tomorrow's dream-dawn and then transforms tomorrow's dream-dawn into today's reality-day.</p>
<p>It is a deplorable mistake we make when we try to understand poetry. Poetry is not to be understood. Poetry is to be felt. Poetry is to be loved. To try to understand a poem is like touching a rose with innumerable thorns. To try to feel a poem is to lovingly hold a rose without a single thorn. And to love a poem is to grow immediately into the beauty and fragrance of the rose itself.</p>
<p>The soul of the poet creates. The heart of the poet originates. The eyes of the poet initiate.</p>
<p>Inside each human being there is a poet. This poet can bring down the loftiest heights of truth and, at the same time, can powerfully eclipse the darkest falsehood if and when necessity demands.</p>
<p>Poetry whispers, "O my friends, O my admirers, adorers and lovers, metres and metrical dance-foot-movements â€” iambus, trochee, anapaest, spondee and others â€” are my fondness-children. They can scale the measureless height, fathom the deepest depth and run the farthest length. Let us embark on Eternity's voyage with my children, my fondness-children."</p>
<p>When we write a poem or read a poem self-givingly, we spend a quiet moment with God the Beauty, God the Compassion and God the Satisfaction.</p>
<p>I am a poet. I started writing poems right from my infancy. Before I write a soulful, powerful and significant poem, I concentrate with my vision-eye, I meditate with my liberation-heart and I contemplate with my realisation-soul. And then I focus my life-camera on God's transcendental Divinity and God's universal Beauty.</p>
<p>After I have written the poem soulfully and devotedly, the Absolute Poet Supreme, to my extreme surprise, tells me that He has prepaid my ticket to reach the highest height of boundless ecstasy.</p>
<p>When I read the poem in absolute silence, the soul of the poem tells me, "Come in, come in. Ah, you have come to see the real in me."</p>
<p>There are poets â€” ordinary poets, great poets. Again, there are seer-poets. The seer-poets are of supreme heights. A seer is he who envisions the present, the past and the future all at once.</p>
<p>The great difference between music and poetry is this: music is a universal language. I do not have to learn a particular language in order to appreciate the melody, the soulfulness and the fulness of the music. Just because music has a universal appeal, I can appreciate, admire and love the music. But the poetry that has a universal appeal is the creation of a seer-poet. 'Seer' in Sanskrit is <em>drashta</em> â€” he who has a free access to the past, present and future and has the rare capacity to divinely grow and supremely glow.</p>
<p>It is said that poets are born and not made. Unfortunately, I do not and cannot subscribe to this view. There are many, many poets I have seen in my lifetime who were not born as poets but, by virtue of their hearts' climbing cries and one-pointed, dedicated lives, have become excellent poets. So, as it is true that poets are born, even so, it is equally true that poets can be made. Here in the audience, I am sure there are some who are not poets but, at the same time, have a genuine desire to become poets. To them I wish to offer a few humble and soulful suggestions.</p>
<p>You want to be a poet. You can be a poet. You are bound to be a poet. Do not allow yourself to be ensnared by doubt. Self-criticism â€” no, no, no; self-enthusiasm â€” yes, yes, yes. Try to free your mind for a few minutes from the coil of thought. Just for a few minutes try to keep your mind silent. I am not saying for a few hours â€” far from it. Just for four or five minutes keep your mind silent. And then place your silent mind on the beautiful, illumining and fulfilling throne that your heart has created for you.</p>
<p>When you write a poem, you can read it time and again â€” as many times as you want. Each time you read it, you can try to increase your heart's joy with your imagination-power. Imagination is a world of its own. The Creator has created His creation. He is observing His creation and He is enjoying His creation. In exactly the same way, you can create a poem, you can observe it and you can enjoy it. You are the creator, you are the observer and you are the enjoyer.</p>
<p>There are critics here, there and everywhere. You must not heed the chorus of impossible critics. Critics, it is said, are the worst failures. There is considerable truth in this. Our goal is perfection. It is enthusiasm and not criticism that can perfect us. Self-criticism is not the correct way. What we constantly need is an inner cry. It is through self-search and self-illumination that we can arrive at perfection. What we need at every moment is enthusiasm in measureless measure and not criticism by others or even self-criticism.</p>
<p>Poetry is humanity's aspiration-cry, and poetry is Divinity's satisfaction-fruit. There are many, many planes of consciousness from which poems can descend. And again, the poet can also climb up like a bird-high, higher, highest-and enter into these planes of consciousness and bring down the loftiest truth, light and delight.</p>
<p>A poet can write a poem from the mind proper. He can write a poem from the intuitive mind. He can write a poem from the higher mind. He can write a poem from the overmind and even from the supermind. But when a poet enters into Sat-Chit-Ananda-Existence-Consciousness-Bliss â€” which is higher than all the planes that I have mentioned, the poet feels that he has covered the longest possible distance. It is like making a long-distance telephone call. But once he reaches this highest plane of consciousness, the Absolute Lord Poet Supreme tells him, "My poet-child, you are mistaken, completely mistaken. Once you reach the Highest, once you become one with the Highest, your journey's start and the Highest are not at two different places. They are at one place. So it is not a long-distance telephone conversation. You can say it is a local call. On the strength of your heart's immense cry, you as a poet have reached the ultimate height. Once you reach the ultimate height, the journey's start and the journey's close become inseparably one.</p>
<p>"My poet-child, I want you to sing with Me:</p>

<p>I barter nothing with time and deeds.<br /> My Cosmic Play is done.<br /> The One Transcendental I was.<br /> The Many Universal I am.<br /> I am the Soul-Flower<br /> Of My Eternity.<br /> I am the Heart-Fragrance<br /> Of My Infinity."</p>
