<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Early in the morning, when you meditate, try to feel that inside your heart there is a safe and inside that safe you have kept your most precious jewel, your most precious treasure, which is your Guru. Then imagine that you have placed love, devotion, surrender and gratitude-flowers all around the treasure. Imagine that there is a flower called love, a flower called devotion, a flower called surrender and a flower called gratitude. Imagine that you have decorated the outside of the safe with these four flowers. Imagine that you are seeing the beautiful flowers and that you are breathing in their fragrance.</p>
<p>Then, during the day, if you see that your colleagues are not aspiring, immediately close your eyes and imagine the flowers. Imagine that you are breathing in their fragrance. If you cannot imagine that you are seeing the flowers or breathing in the fragrance, then say, "Supreme, Supreme, Supreme," as quickly as possible. While you are saying "Supreme" very, very fast, you will be able to see me inside the safe and breathe in the fragrance of the flowers.</p>
<p>These things take only a few seconds. Whenever your consciousness is about to descend, whenever unaspiring thoughts have entered into you, immediately do them. They will act like medicine, like an antidote for the poison. Again, when you have free time during the day, even if your consciousness is not descending, try to remember that you have a most secret and sacred safe inside your heart, and inside that safe is your Guru.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here there is no competitive spirit. Here there is no greed involved. Here there is only joy. It is through joy that we are going to transcend ourselves.</p>
<p>At the age of thirteen or fourteen I ran. It is quite natural for a teenager to run. But at the age of sixty-five if I run, it means I am trying to maintain some joy, some enthusiasm. I am also trying to keep my body fit. When we are young, running is all competition; we want to defeat everybody and become the winner. Here the philosophy is totally different. If we can have cheerfulness and happiness, then that is our best achievement. At this age to do anything happily, cheerfully and self-givingly is most difficult.</p>
<p>Here I am competing with myself in order to maintain my inner joy and outer joy. When I run, I try my best to bring forward the enthusiasm that I had when I was a teenager. I try my best, but most of the time it does not come. The lethargy of the body does not allow me to bring forward the same quickness, alertness and promptness. I am imagining something, but the reality is somewhere else. When I was young, I did not have to imagine anything. I only used my capacity, which became reality. At that time, reality was pushing me forward. Now imagination is desperately trying to push me forward.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is the philosophy of self-transcendence. No matter how old we are, we are trying to increase our capacities and transcend our achievements.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part VI</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part VI" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p>
SCA 1112-1118. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 9 August 1989 at Aspiration-Ground in New York.</p>
<h2>Question: How can I have the Grace to be transformed radically?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You want to be transformed overnight? You want to be God-realised overnight? Then why did you go to kindergarten, high school and university? The day you started learning the alphabet, did you say, "Why do I have to learn the ABCs? Let me get my Master's degree all at once." It is not possible. We all must follow the process of evolution. As soon as you have sown the seed, do you ask, "How is it that the tree is not fully grown? How is it that I am not getting the most delicious fruit?"</p>
<p>Everything takes time. You start at the beginning by learning the alphabet. Then over the years, you study so many books. In the same way, if you want to be spiritually transformed overnight, it is impossible. So many incarnations you have taken, and so many more incarnations you will have to take before you achieve God-realisation.</p>
<p>Now you are walking along the right path — prayer and meditation. Then comes the question, "How can I go faster?" Every seeker can ask that question. But you cannot ask, "How am I going to reach the Destination all at once?" You can say, "I am walking. Now I want to run." And if you are running, you can say, "I want to sprint." Then somebody will come forward to teach you how to sprint. But nobody will be able to say that as soon as you start sprinting, the Destination will be right in front of your nose. No, the Destination is quite far. But definitely if you sprint and if you have the required stamina, you will reach the Destination much faster than otherwise.</p>
<p>In your case, in order to make faster progress, you can start with two things: your heart's purity and your life's gratitude. Every day pray to the Supreme to grant you more purity in your heart and more gratitude in your entire life. Your purity and gratitude will definitely increase your spiritual speed and expedite your spiritual journey. You have to make progress slowly and steadily, not overnight. God-realisation is not like instant coffee.</p>
<p>Outer knowledge takes many years for us to accumulate. Inner wisdom, which comes from our spiritual life, takes much longer because there is a great difference between wisdom and knowledge. Knowledge is of the mind, in the mind and for the mind. It can easily be contradicted. But wisdom-light cannot be contradicted. How are you going to contradict light? Can you contradict the sun? Light does not care for man's validation. If we say that it is darkness, light just laughs because it knows that it is light itself.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I feel God&#039;s Protection all the time?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I feel God&#039;s Protection all the time?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to pray for God's Protection. You cannot pray for twenty-four hours, but daily four or five times you can consciously pray for God's Protection. And while you are praying for protection, you have to simultaneously pray for forgiveness. Protection comes quickly if you pray for forgiveness. Suppose you have done something wrong, either today, yesterday or ten years ago. If you want protection from God, God will say, "You want protection, but you have done a few things wrong. Have you asked Me for forgiveness?"</p>
<p>The best approach is to pray to God, "Please forgive me for the things that I have done wrong, and even for the things that I am going to do wrong tomorrow." You have no control over the future. God may protect you today, but the next moment you may be tempted to do something wrong. If you ask for forgiveness first and then ask for protection, protection will come faster, plus it will be more effective.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How will the world of science and reasoning understand spirituality?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How will the world of science and reasoning understand spirituality?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to prove to those who are in the domain of science and the reasoning mind that peace is something valuable. We have to prove that what we are aiming at is what they want. To become peace-lovers and establish our oneness with all of humanity is the most significant goal. But unless we can prove it, who is going to believe us? If you are a weightlifter, for example, you have to prove that you can lift up 100 pounds. Otherwise, if you tell your friends, "I can easily lift up 100 pounds," they will simply laugh at you. Only if you lift up 100 pounds in front of them will they believe you.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you are really a peace-lover, then in your eyes people have to see the proof. Spiritual Masters or saints are also human beings. But as soon as you look at them, you feel something special. As soon as you look at them, you become peaceful. Their vibration gives you such joy, such a feeling of love and oneness. Those who are genuine peace-lovers do not have to declare it. Their very presence will compel the reasoning mind to surrender. But if those who claim to be spiritual do not have inside them real spirituality and divinity, why should those who depend on the reasoning mind listen to them? First we have to become something. Then automatically people will feel it. When those who give all importance to the reasoning mind can feel in somebody else a higher power — which is inner peace, inner love, inner compassion and inner oneness — naturally their minds will be illumined.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can one overcome the desires of the lower vital?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can one overcome the desires of the lower vital?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Lower vital desires can be conquered only by the higher vital. The higher vital identifies itself with vastness. Vastness takes away temptation. When a lower vital thought comes to you, just look at the sky and say, "Give me shelter!" Then the sky will give you shelter. When temptation comes, identify yourself with vastness. Immediately imagine the sky or the ocean or a vast field. Then try to become inseparably one with it. With your imagination either you can fly into the sky, where the vastness takes away your impure thoughts, or you can feel that you are totally helpless. You will beg the sky, "O sky, I cannot run to you. Please come to me with your vastness!" Then, when the vastness comes near you, imagine a door that is wide open and enter into the vastness. Vastness will immediately purify you, illumine you and engulf your impurity.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do when a lower vital thought comes to you is to chant "Supreme" or "purity" as fast as possible for a minute or two.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You speak of an eternal relationship between the disciple and the Master. Is this something that develops over time?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: You speak of an eternal relationship between the disciple and the Master. Is this something that develops over time?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When a spiritual Master accepts a disciple, at that time their relationship becomes eternal. But closeness between the Master and the disciple is a different thing altogether. Here we use the term 'eternal' because we are dealing with the soul, which is immortal. If you are working in a restaurant or in a hotel, we say that you are a permanent worker. There are many permanent workers in a hotel. Some workers are close to the manager or to the owner, while others are not. In exactly the same way, when I accept a soul, our connection becomes permanent, eternal. Then I watch to see how much spiritual progress that soul can make in and through the body, vital, mind and heart. The quicker the members of the soul's family make progress, the closer the individual becomes to the Master or to the divine in him.</p>
<p>All the workers are not equally close to the manager or to the owner. Similarly, we are all God's children; God loves us all equally. But at the same time, some receive much more than others. The sun gives light to all. But some keep their doors and windows wide open early in the morning, while others are sleeping. It is on the strength of our receptivity that we become close to the Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I fasted for six days, and now I feel more inner peace and that a lot of wrong forces have left me. Is there a connection between fasting or losing weight and wrong forces leaving the body?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I fasted for six days, and now I feel more inner peace and that a lot of wrong forces have left me. Is there a connection between fasting or losing weight and wrong forces leaving the body?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Losing weight is good, but you cannot say that the thinnest people are the most pure people on earth! Some people carry extra weight, absolutely unnecessary weight. If they lose weight, then along with their physical lightness, the mind becomes lighter and more clarity enters into the mind. Another thing is cheerfulness. Let us say you are carrying twenty or thirty pounds extra, and then you lose it. How much cheerfulness enters your mind! When cheerfulness enters into the mind, it destroys many negative forces. If you are cheerful, many, many lower vital forces you can conquer. Cheerfulness has tremendous, tremendous strength. So from that point of view, it is true that if you lose weight, wrong forces leave you, but you cannot say that just by losing weight all lower forces will be conquered.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I get more joy in running?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I get more joy in running?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you do not get enough joy from running, then bring some variety into your running. Do not run at the same speed or for the same distance every day. One day run one mile, the next day two miles and the third day seven miles. Every day change the distance or change the speed. If you normally run a mile in seven or eight minutes, then one day deliberately run at a nine-minute pace. Then do something completely different: 100 metres walk, 100 metres run, 100 metres walk, 200 metres run. That way you will develop a different kind of joy and confidence. I used to do that whenever I did not feel like running. In one mile if you have all kinds of variation, then you may get more joy. I used to get joy that way. Otherwise, if I had to run one mile non-stop, sometimes I found it so boring. One day you may decide to be spontaneous. You will say, "When I want to run depends on my mood." You may run for 20 metres and walk for 200 metres. You will let your heart or mind decide. You will not have a fixed pattern — that you will run 50 metres and walk 50 metres. No. As your mind carries your body, you will just surrender to your mind's will, or you can say, your mind's whims. Then afterwards you will get joy that you have covered so much distance.</p>

<h2>Question: What is your definition of a miracle?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For me, if millions and millions of people cannot do something and then one individual does it, it is a miracle. It can be on any plane. Our mind thinks that a miracle has to be like this or like that. Its conception of a miracle is so narrow. When the patient is on the brink of death and the doctor saves him, the mind says it is a miracle. But a miracle can be on any plane. Why say that one miracle is more important than another?</p>
<p>Today I have lifted 170 pounds with each arm. I am sure that nobody of my age will come forward to say that they can also do it. Again, my achievement is on the physical plane. Perhaps somebody else will do something on another plane which I will not be able to do. So your miracle I cannot do, and my miracle you cannot do. God is infinite, so He is showing different miracles in and through various individuals.</p>
<p>There are so many miracles performed on earth that we do not take into account; we do not value them. But if we do value them, we are wonderstruck that one individual has been able to accomplish what millions and millions of human beings could not do.</p>
<p>Let us take Schubert. His immortal song <em>Ave Maria</em> comes from another world. Now millions and millions of people around the world sing that song. For me, it is a true miracle.</p>
<p>Again, on the political plane, what President Gorbachev and President Mandela have done is nothing other than a miracle. And in the sporting world, look at Carl Lewis. He became the fastest human being on earth, the best jumper and so on.</p>
<p>When millions of people cannot do something, we are apt to say that it is not humanly possible. Then, when someone eventually does it, we can definitely claim it as a miracle. God is manifesting His Light and Power in and through that individual in a most special way.</p>
