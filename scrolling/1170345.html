 <p></p>
<h2>Spiritual power, occult power and will power</h2>

<p>Spiritual power is vastness. Occult power is swiftness. Will power is readiness.</p>
<p>Spiritual power says to the seeker, “Eternity is at your disposal.” Occult power says to the seeker, “Here, here and now.” Will power says to spiritual power and occult power, “We are friends. Both of you are perfectly right; therefore, I wish to help you, serve you, manifest you and fulfil you in your own way.”</p>
<p>Spiritual power is the sea. Occult power is the river. Will power is the current of the river and the tranquillity of the sea.</p>
<p>Spiritual power is self-awareness. Occult power is self-confidence. Will power is self-experience.</p>
<p>Slowly, steadily and unerringly the spiritual power within us grows until eventually it reaches the destination. Occult power speedily, dynamically and amazingly reaches its destination. Occult power has the speed of a deer. It runs very fast and reaches its goal quickly, but that goal is not the ultimate goal. Will power has faithfulness and devotedness. It is devoted to occult power and, at the same time, it is devoted to spiritual power. With its devotedness and faithfulness, will power reaches its destination. We can safely say that will power acts like a faithful dog.</p>
<p>The seeker who is far advanced in the spiritual life tells us that he uses his spiritual power in order to climb up high, higher, highest. The seeker who is far advanced in the spiritual life tells us that he uses his occult power in order to run fast, faster, fastest. The seeker who has tremendous will power, who is inundated with will power, energises the seeker who has spiritual power and the seeker who has occult power. The role of the seeker who is inundated with will power is to help the seeker who has spiritual power and the seeker who has occult power.</p>
<p>Spiritual power almost whisperingly tells us that right is might. If you have the divine right, inside that right you must feel the divine power. If you have the right, then use your power. Occult power bravely tells us that might is right. If you have the capacity, that is your right. Occultism is simple. But the seeker with tremendous will power will tell us that the cry of Mother Earth is the might of Mother Earth and the smile of Father Heaven is the right of Father Heaven. We need only one might and that is the inner cry of Mother Earth. We need only one right and that is the smile of Father Heaven.</p>
<p>How do we acquire spiritual power? We acquire spiritual power by self-giving, constant self-giving. How do we acquire occult power? We acquire occult power by self-examining. How do we acquire will power? We acquire will power by self-affirming. In self-giving, what do we give? We give what we have and what we are. What we have is love of God and what we are is concern for mankind. In self-examining, what do we examine? We examine sincerely our capacity and our incapacity. We examine our incapacity in order to transform it into capacity and we examine our capacity in order to make it absolutely perfect. In self-affirming, what do we affirm? We affirm ourselves. But we have to know that this self-affirmation is not like the self-affirmation of Julius Caesar, who declared, “I came, I saw, I conquered.” Our self-affirmation will be: “I came, I loved and I became.” This is our divine self-affirmation: “I came into the world, I loved all human beings and I established my inseparable oneness with all human beings.”</p>
<p>If we properly use spiritual power, then we can live here on earth in immortality’s Reality. If we properly use occult power, then the Universal Reality is always at our disposal. Nothing will be able to hide from an occultist’s vision. Anything in the creation will be within an occultist’s reach sooner than at once.</p>
<p>If we misuse spiritual power, we shall be extremely, extremely poor in the spiritual life. Sometimes it has happened that advanced seekers, after misusing spiritual power, have become poorer in aspiration than they were right at the beginning of their spiritual journey. Similarly, if an occultist misuses his occult power, then he becomes totally blind in the spiritual life. This blindness is not physical blindness; it is a much more serious blindness. It is a loss of his inner vision. This seeker will not be able to see the truth anymore. And something worse: when occult power is misused, the power that is misused eventually comes and attacks the occultist. In the case of spiritual power, he who misuses it sometimes escapes the attack of the misused spiritual forces; but when occult power is misused, the person who has misused it will eventually be attacked and punished by the forces that were once upon a time his own and at his beck and call.</p>
<p>With will power, what can we do? With will power we can identify ourselves with God’s creation; we can identify ourselves with God’s Reality. Will power is conscious identification with the reality that exists or with the reality that is going to blossom. Each individual here has a certain amount of will power. But will power can also be cultivated. As we develop our muscles, even so we can develop our will power. But while developing will power, we have to know whether we are going to use this will power only to build in ourselves the temple of truth, the temple of light, the temple of peace, the temple of delight. If this is our goal, then will power will always be ready to help us, mould us and shape us into perfect perfection. Otherwise, will power can also be a true obstacle in our spiritual path.</p>
<p>Spiritual power tells us in unmistakable terms, “I am, I eternally am.” Occult power tells us unmistakably, “I can, I immediately can.” Will power unmistakably tells us, “I enjoy, I divinely enjoy, I supremely enjoy. I enjoy, not in a human way, but in a divine way, in a supreme way.</p>

SPOP 3-9. Questions following the talk <em>Spiritual power, occult power and will power</em>.</p>
<h2>Question: Can you speak about your spiritual teachings?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My teachings are that we do not neglect the body and we do not neglect the soul. We need the soul to realise the highest absolute Truth; and we need the body for the manifestation of the highest absolute Truth. The body is the temple and the soul is the shrine. In the spiritual life we give importance to physical fitness and also we give importance to the soul. We need both for complete realisation and for complete manifestation: the soul for complete realisation and the body for complete manifestation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we acquire spiritual intensity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we acquire spiritual intensity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here on earth, the thing that keeps you alive is your breath. Each time you breathe in you feel the necessity of breath. When you hold your breath for ten seconds, you feel that you are about to die; then, when you again breath in, you feel tremendous inner and outer intensity in your breath. When you breath in, try to make yourself feel that this breath exists solely because it contains the Life, Light and Reality of the Supreme. If you can feel the existence of the Supreme’s Light and Love inside each living breath, if you can feel that the Supreme embodies your life-breath, then your love for the Supreme automatically increases.</p>
<p>You have to feel that the Supreme is the Source of your life-breath, and you should always try to go to the Source. If you can constantly aspire for this, you will feel that intensity is coming to the fore in your life of aspiration. You have to cry always for a free access to the Source. When we are aware of the Source and live in the Source, we become perfect instruments of the Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is your view of theosophy and spiritualism?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is your view of theosophy and spiritualism?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have nothing to say against theosophy; it helps seekers in its own way. Only we know that there is something deeper which theosophy cannot touch. The theosophy of Madame Blavatsky and Annie Besant is not wrong. But we have to know whether they are truly God-realised souls.</p>
<p>In Madame Blavatsky’s <em>Secret Doctrine</em> and also in other writings of Annie Besant, they have caught a portion of the truth. But this truth has not come directly from the highest realm of consciousness. It was in the vital world that this truth originated and got its expression. I am not saying anything against their offering. But at the same time we have to know that the truth they offer is different from the truth that comes from a spiritual Master who has entered into the plane called <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda:</em> Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. This plane is infinitely higher than the plane which theosophy has approached or achieved.</p>
<p>There is a great difference between spirituality, real spirituality, which is Yoga, and spiritualism. Spiritualism involves mediums; it involves spirits in the vital world or vital beings that are not purely connected with the soul and our inner being. If we are too interested in spiritualism, we give too much importance to the beings that move around in the vital world and in other worlds which are not at all illumined. They are only frightening, threatening, quarrelling and fighting. They satisfy a kind of curiosity plus a destructive quality in human nature.</p>

Are there different beings in different cultures, or are they the same beings with different names?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They are different beings; they are not the same. But they may have similar qualities. It is like, say, calling someone a great poet of America. You may want to say, “He is the Shakespeare of America.” Similarly, our Indian goddess Saraswati can be compared with Pallas Athena. She is not the same person, but since she has the same type of quality, you can make a comparison. Still, it is not the same goddess.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can you become aware of the soul?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can you become aware of the soul?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Through your deep prayer and meditation. Once you see your soul, you will be able to see the soul in everything. The soul is not an easy thing to see just now. Now you are studying, seeking for the result of your M.A. course. If a kindergarten student asks about university courses, you can try to explain. But it is difficult to explain to him. Similarly, with your mind you are asking me about the soul and with the mind I have to answer. Mentally we are trying to formulate some ideas, but actually it has to be understood on the strength of one’s own inner awakening, inner experience. Questions can be answered, but if you go deep within, in the process of your own spiritual awakening the answers will be there.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do we lose all our progress when we die and then do we have to start from the beginning in our next incarnation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do we lose all our progress when we die and then do we have to start from the beginning in our next incarnation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, nothing is lost. From the soul’s region you come into the world-battlefield to fight against doubt, anxiety, frustration, and everything else that is undivine. But in this life you have not yet manifested the proper victory for God here on earth. You have not established the divine victory on earth. So with the achievement you have made, you will go back to the soul’s region and take some rest for some time. You come into the world and play your role. Then, as in a game, you become tired and you take rest. After five years or ten years or twelve years, you will come down here again and continue the game. You may not remember, but your soul remembers how much you realised here. So, with that achievement, you will again start your journey. Nothing is lost. Suppose you have an iota of Peace, Light and Bliss in this incarnation. In your next incarnation you start with that iota of Truth. From one dollar we go to three dollars and then to five dollars.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life also, we go from little Light to more Light. When we start our journey, we cannot meditate for five minutes. Then, after two or three months, or years, we can meditate for two hours without any difficulty. Each time we come into the world and aspire, we increase our divinity. Then a time comes when we realise the Highest. At that time, our inner consciousness becomes infinite, our inner joy becomes infinite. A spiritual Master, if he is a real spiritual Master, deals with infinite Peace, infinite Light, in his inner consciousness. Outwardly nobody will know it or value it. Now I have infinite Peace, Light and Bliss. But if I go to a grocer and say that I will give him Peace and Light in exchange for some food, he will tell me to go home. Again, in this world everybody can give and everybody can receive. The Master wants to receive your aspiration; he wants to see if you are sincere and if you want to receive his Light. It is a mutual giving. You give me what you have, your aspiration; I give you what I have, my realisation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we learn to hear the inner music?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we learn to hear the inner music?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is through constant prayer and meditation that we can learn to hear the inner music. We have to pray to God soulfully to grant us Light, abundant Light, so that when we dive deep within we can hear His message without being hindered by our doubting mind. The deeper we can dive, the sooner our doubting mind will leave us for good. So it is through prayer that we can listen to the dictates of our soul, dictates that embody music pristine in purity and Light and Delight.</p>
<p>Sometimes a seeker, if he is not a seeker of the purest type, feels that he is acting like a beggar when he is praying. So he does not want to continue praying. But if the seeker meditates, then he has a different feeling. He feels that he has a Source and meditates on the Source, but not in a begging manner. He tells the Source, “You have sent me here to do something for You. Now, I feel it is high time that You come and act in and through me. Kindly bring to the fore the capacity that I embody to please You, to manifest You, to fulfil You.”</p>
<p>If the seeker cannot pray properly, divinely and soulfully, or if his doubting mind or his proud mind interferes and he does not want to act like a beggar, then let him invoke God like a prince invoking the King. Or, like a son, let him invoke the Father to do the needful. That is done through meditation.</p>

<h2>Heaven-Vision and earth-reality</h2>

<p>Heaven-Vision and earth-reality. Heaven-Vision is great; it is appreciated, admired and adored by earth-reality. Earth-reality is good; it is liked, loved and embraced by Heaven-Vision. Heaven-Vision is God’s Duty: eternal expansion. Earth-reality is God’s Beauty: infinite manifestation. Heaven-Vision tells the seeker that there is only one thing that the seeker needs and that is illumination: liberation from the meshes of ignorance. Earth-reality tells the seeker that he needs only one thing and that is transformation: total transformation of his human nature.</p>
<p>When the cry of the finite grows and glows into the smile of the infinite, we call it liberation. When the darkness of the body is transformed into the light of the soul, we call it transformation. Liberation is of the entire being. Transformation is mainly of the physical nature, the earthbound nature. Illumination is the connecting link between liberation and transformation.</p>
<p>When one is liberated, one feels and knows that there is another world to take rest in; and when one is transformed, one feels that it is here, here on earth, that he has to manifest the Absolute Supreme. When one is liberated, one feels that he has worked very hard and now it is high time for him to take rest in some other plane of consciousness. When one is transformed, when one’s outer being is transformed by light, one feels that he has got the golden opportunity to be a perfect instrument of God here on earth.</p>
<p>The light descends from the soul into the heart. Liberation usually starts with the heart. Then the flame of liberation enters into the vital, which may be aggressive, emotional or animal. And finally the flame of liberation enters into the gross physical. The light descends from the soul into the heart, from the heart into the mind, from the mind into the vital and from the vital into the physical. This is how liberation takes place. But transformation starts right in the physical, and for the physical, when the light descends from above. In the unaspiring human being, Heaven-Vision cannot abide even for a fleeting second. Earth-reality also finds it almost impossible to reside inside the unaspiring human being. But just because human beings remain on earth, with boundless compassion and boundless patience earth-reality does abide inside unaspiring human beings. But inside aspiring human beings Heaven-Vision discovers the only way to reveal God. And inside aspiring human beings earth-reality finds its goal, its only goal: the manifestation of God here on earth.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his spiritual journey, the seeker says to Heaven-Vision, “All that I am is from You. All that I have is from You: it is Your Light, Your Delight, Your Silence, Your Sound.” At the end of the journey’s close, the seeker says to earth-reality, “All that I am and all that I have is for you: infinite patience, infinite compassion, infinite forgiveness.”</p>
<p>Heaven-Vision tells the seeker that if he knows how to believe, then it can make him a perfect instrument of the Absolute Supreme. Earth-reality tells the seeker that if he can listen to the dictates of his Inner Pilot, then earth-reality can make him a perfect instrument of the Absolute Supreme. The sincere seeker knows how to believe and he will believe. He knows how to listen and he will listen to the dictates of his inmost being, the soul, the direct representative of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Heaven-Vision is a flower that, petal by petal, grows inside each seeker. Earth-reality is a fruit that comes into existence at the end of climbing aspiration in the inner world and soulful dedication and loving self-giving in the outer world. Each seeker deep inside him has Heaven-Vision and earth-reality. The Heaven-Vision in the seeker starts the journey. If the seeker starts with earth-reality, he will be making a Himalayan blunder. Heaven-Vision is the Consciousness-tree. The seeker has to climb up the tree and only then can he share the reality-fruit with the world at large.</p>
<p>When we close the door of the doubting, questioning, suspicious mind and open the door of the loving, sympathising oneness-heart, Heaven-Vision enters into us. When we use our indomitable will to see the face of truth and to grow into the very name of truth, earth-reality claims us as its very own. When we cry in the purest recesses of our heart, Heaven-Vision answers. When we smile at ignorance-sea that is inundating the human world, earth-reality embraces us.</p>
<p>Heaven is vision, earth is reality. Again, earth is vision, Heaven is reality. Heaven is the seed, earth is the fruit. When we look at Heaven-Vision in seed form, we see that Heaven-Vision is the pioneer. Again, when we look at the fruit which will offer its seeds, we know that earth-reality is the pioneer. Today the seed is the vision and the fruit is the reality. Tomorrow the same fruit will be the unveiling of vision and theseed will be the illumined and fulfilled reality.</p>

 <p>
SPOP 11-20. These questions were asked following the talk <em>Heaven-Vision and earth-reality</em>.</p>
<h2>Question: Does suffering increase one’s inner hunger?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the inner hunger is increased through suffering, I tell you, this hunger does not last. This hunger will be satisfied after a short time and then again you will enter into ignorance-life and immediately be assailed by more suffering. Real hunger constantly increases through inner joy, inner satisfaction. At that time you are constantly transcending yourself.</p>
<p>When one suffers, at that time God becomes real for him. There are many atheists; for them there is no God. But when their children fall sick and it is critical, immediately they invoke God or Light or some Power. Somebody is passing beyond the Curtain of Eternity, so they feel it is time to invoke some higher Power, some higher Light, something which they don’t have that comes from somewhere else. They invoke something and that something is God. They are stark atheists; they don’t believe in God at all. But at that time God comes into the picture just because they are suffering. But the moment their suffering ends, temptation-life or ignorance-life catches them and they forget God.</p>
<p>So if we have to go to God through suffering, then eventually temptation will come and take us away. If we feel we have to go to God by cutting off our arms or limbs, if we feel that when we suffer, at that time God will listen to us, we are making a deplorable mistake. The positive way to go to God is through love, through joy. Constantly we are loving him; that is why we are getting joy. Just because we are in joy we love Him. If we want to increase our inner cry, then we have to love God more and we have to be inwardly and outwardly cheerful. It is through constant cheerfulness that our love of God increases. By remaining always in a state of melancholy we will not make progress. We are only trying to draw sympathy from the world and become an object of pity. But that is not the way. The right way is always to have spontaneous joy. From Delight we came into the world, in Delight we grow and, at the end of our journey’s close, into Delight we retire. This is our philosophy.</p>
<p>Joy and cheerfulness is not a life of pleasure. No! It is the conscious awareness of our inner divinity. When we are happy, when we are really happy, we are making real progress. Through suffering one may make progress, but before he makes progress he curses God. “He is happy, she is happy, everybody is happy. How is it that I am suffering?” So before we actually cry for light, quite often we misunderstand God, we criticise God and find fault with Him. But when we are happy, at that time we don’t criticise God. On the contrary, we show our gratitude. He has made us happy, whereas there are many who are still unhappy because they are wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance. When we become a happy heart, we move forward, we dive deep within, we fly. At that time we make considerable progress. Progress is in movement, and this movement comes only when we have joy and we become joy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Isn’t spirituality a way of escaping from our problems or difficulties?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Isn’t spirituality a way of escaping from our problems or difficulties?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We do not give up because the world is full of difficulties; we do not commit suicide because the world is full of difficulties. What we have to do is pay more attention to the spiritual life. Our path is the path of acceptance. We shall accept the outer life in a normal way, but we shall also do something which most people do not do, and that is pay full attention to the inner life as well. Real spirituality will demand acceptance of life as it is. Obstacles we don’t deny, but the obstacles have to be surmounted. We are not saying to ignore them or run away from them. Far from it. But the advice I am giving is that if we can achieve light from above, then only can we conquer these outer obstacles. We are not avoiding them, we are not afraid of them. We are not trying to escape from the hard reality. But if we know that there is a medicine which can cure the maladies of centuries, then if we are wise we will take that medicine. That medicine is inner light.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If one wishes to become a good person, is that a form of aspiration?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If one wishes to become a good person, is that a form of aspiration?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. But if we want to be a really good person, our goodness must come not from a sense of morality, but from a sense of divinity. We have to know whether we are looking at good from the moral aspect or from the spiritual aspect. Morally, everyone can know what is good and what is bad. But spiritually, what is good and what is bad only God and our soul know.</p>
<p>The moment you become a better human being, you have to offer your good qualities — your sincerity and your love — to mankind. These good qualities come from God. The inspiration and aspiration to love mankind come not from outside but from inside. If you want to give, you have to receive from someone who has already achieved that thing, and that is God inside you. If you do not first receive, how are you going to give?</p>
<p>You can be a better human being if you think of the Source, the One who makes you good, better, best — the One who is already better than you. You <em>can</em> be a good human being and you can help people, but only if the necessity comes from within.</p>
<p>When we become realised, we become one with everyone according to his own standard. When I deal with a child, I am at one with the child’s standard. If I don’t become one with the child’s standard, he won’t talk to me. Then when I deal with the parents, I am one with their standard. Although I am one with them, I am also a little ahead, one step ahead. By being just a little ahead, I can give more encouragement. But if I am very far ahead of them and if I maintain my own high standard, they will become discouraged and feel that they will never be able to keep up with me. This is why I stay just a little ahead.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is Peace God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is Peace God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God and Peace are synonymous. It is like the obverse and reverse of the same coin. If one wants God, that means he is really crying for Peace. If one is crying for illumination, how can he separate God from God’s Peace?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can you speak of the personality of God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can you speak of the personality of God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, we cannot bind God with personality and individuality. He transcends both individuality and personality. God deals with the Universal and Transcendental Consciousness. An individual embodies personality and shows his personality in his earthly activities. But in God’s case it is all universality. He is not bound by anything; therefore we cannot ascribe personality to Him. He far transcends both personality and impersonality precisely because He is both Transcendental and Universal all at once.</p>
