  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, what is the relationship between physical beauty with spirituality and physical beauty without spirituality?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, what is the relationship between physical beauty with spirituality and physical beauty without spirituality?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Physical beauty without spirituality is like an empty vessel. There is nothing satisfying or fulfilling in it. Physical beauty without spirituality, you can say, is skin deep. But if there is spiritual beauty, inner beauty, an inner cry for God inside the physical beauty, then the physical beauty becomes soul deep. We know how deep the soul is. It has an eternal connection with the Source, the Supreme. If there is no inner beauty in one's physical beauty, then it creates temptation for others and problems for oneself. This kind of beauty tries like a magnet to draw others. It is like a sick person: when others stay with a sick person, they become sick too. So beauty without spirituality is dangerous. But again it is in and through the physical that the Divine manifests itself. It may happen that inside the physical there is divine beauty, but one may not be aware of it; the divine beauty may not yet have started manifesting in and through the physical. That is why we see only the physical beauty. If we are not aware of the inner beauty, naturally we shall separate the physical from the spiritual. But it is always possible that inside the physical beauty there is divine beauty waiting to be fully manifested. Some people are really spiritual, but they are not aware of their spirituality at all. Their hour has not yet struck. That is why they are leading an ordinary or undivine life. But inwardly they are ready. In a matter of a day or a week or a few years, they will begin to follow the spiritual path. Some people say, "I want the spiritual life, but not now. After three years or six years or ten years I will be ready." These people are getting some indication of their latent inner beauty. Otherwise, they would categorically say, "Spiritual life is not meant for me. I don't need it or want it." Instead, they say that after a few years they will accept the spiritual life. This means that their spiritual qualities are already coming to the fore, but they are not yet fully aware of them. When physical beauty and spiritual beauty go together, then perfection dawns. Again, physical beauty is a matter of judgement. You may think some person is extremely beautiful. But somebody else will say that person is quite ugly. Your sense of beauty and somebody else's sense of beauty may totally differ. Now who can be the judge? Nobody! Appreciating a person's physical beauty may create problems for us. But if we only deal with the spiritual and see inner beauty in people, then there cannot be any problem. Concentrate on bringing the inner beauty forward and not the outer beauty. Inner beauty is love, divine love. Inner beauty is universal oneness. Inner beauty is self-giving. How can these things create problems? Let us bring to the fore our inner beauty and let the outer beauty take a very secondary place.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When an individual offers gratitude to God, immediately his receptivity increases. His vessel becomes large. Then God is able to pour more of His Blessings into the person or enter more fully into that vessel with His own divine Existence. God is infinite, but only according to our receptivity can He enter into us. God is like sunlight. If I leave this window open, sunlight will come in here. If I keep all the other windows closed, it cannot come in there. The more we offer gratitude, the more we increase our receptivity and capacity. The more windows we open, the more God enters into us with Light, abundant Light, infinite Light. When we offer gratitude, immediately God's Light comes pouring into our being.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, does the world have more beauty or less beauty than it had one hundred years ago?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, does the world have more beauty or less beauty than it had one hundred years ago?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The present-day world has more beauty than the world of one hundred years ago. An individual or country or nation or the world is composed of many parts. We have to separate them all. We have to see on the physical plane how many divine things have occurred recently and then compare them with the achievements of a hundred years ago. We have to see the physical things that have been discovered, and know whether they have been used for a good purpose or a bad purpose. We are creating and creating and each creation is beauty. But we have to know whether this power of creation has become a form of destruction or not. We have to know whether all the things that have taken place for the last one hundred years are divine — that is to say, whether they are progressive and being used for the divine purpose. The answer can be given by each individual soul. You may say, "Oh, four thousand years ago we were all spiritual people." We like to bask in the past. Our parents and grandparents never told a lie, we think. Falsehood was not born at that time. Go to any Indian village and the people will tell you, "We have fallen, but our parents were all saints, and our parents' parents were absolutely all gods." But if you know a little bit of world history, you will know that their parents also quarrelled, fought, killed and did God knows what else. Now, look at our achievements. Astronauts have gone to the moon. We have the atom bomb, the hydrogen bomb and all kinds of scientific inventions. Of course, with these creations we are destroying the world like anything. Achievement we have got, progress we have made, but God alone knows how we are using these things or going to use them. Still, we are all in the process of evolution. Gradually, gradually we are going from the animal life to the divine life. We cannot say categorically when the consciousness of earth was more divine. Historians will widely differ as to that. But one thing we can say is that the general trend, by virtue of evolution, is progressive. We have tremendous power at our disposal, although if it is not properly used it can create real problems. But almost any earthly achievement can be used in two ways. The radio is a comparatively modern achievement. Two hundred years ago there were no radios. Now the radio is doing wonderful things in spreading knowledge. But if you use the radio to listen to undivine music, how is it helping your soul? The jet plane has conquered distance and made the world very small. But again, the jet plane can do something very damaging. It can carry bombs from one place to another. There was a time when the question of a destructive purpose or a constructive purpose did not arise because there was no achievement at that time. But evolution has come to a point where, when we achieve something, it becomes common property. We do not try to keep our achievements only for our own use. If we get something, we share it. This achievement is a real kind of beauty. The main thing right now is that we have to learn how to utilise all our achievements for a constructive purpose.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Beauty and Power go together. Beauty is Power; Power is Beauty. Both are Light that an individual sees in his own way. When Light is being manifested in the Divine Mother, you may call it Power and somebody else may call it Beauty. When somebody sees the Divine Mother's Light, if the soul feels that by seeing this Light as Beauty its progress will be faster, then it sees the Light as Beauty. If the soul feels that by seeing Power its progress will be faster, then it will see the Light in that way. Beauty and Power are both manifestations of Light, but each individual will see Light in the way that will best help his soul's progress.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Beauty is dynamic and changing and it is also a reflection of our soul's evolution. When we speak of dynamism, it means life-energy is flowing most powerfully. Life-energy is a river constantly flowing. Although it is continuous, the movement itself is change. Movement we notice. But when the river enters into the sea, when it has reached its goal, at that time it seems to be stopping. But it is actually becoming one with the silence. From this silence again it will come back to the place where it started its journey. Before we start to do something, everything is static. When we begin to do it, everything becomes dynamic. And when it is done, the fulfilled action enters again into something which is absolutely silent. By constant action we create new energy in our life. This is one kind of beauty. The other kind of beauty is the soul's reflection. The soul represents the Supreme, who is all Beauty. When the soul comes to the fore, its light is reflected by the rest of the being. When you pray and meditate you feed the soul and the strength of the soul increases. But when the physical and the vital also add to the soul's capacity, then its strength is really great. You may have thousands of dollars, but if your child gives you one dollar, then you will have one thousand and one. Here also, when we consciously aspire with the physical, with the vital, with the mind and with the heart, we acquire the ultimate wealth. Then the increased capacity of the soul adds to the soul's beauty immediately. This beauty is the reflection of the soul's progress and evolution.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The essence of nature's beauty is the Supreme Light or the Supreme Delight in nature. Nature itself is not complete. Nature is not the doer. Nature has somebody as its boss, and that is the Absolute Supreme. As soon as something is created we immediately ask who did it. As soon as we see a creation, we feel that it is incomplete unless and until we know from where it came. Nature is God's creation. Again, the Creator is inside the creation. That is why we can say that nature itself is God. But we have to know that it was not nature who was the Creator. The Creator was above, and after creating He became one with His creation. I write a poem. Because of my inspiration, aspiration, capacity and dedication, I feel that it is a part of me. The poet and the poem are inseparably one. At that time you can say it is Guru's poem or you can say it is Guru's consciousness. It is the same. Similarly, nature is God's creation and it also embodies God's Consciousness. That is why we can easily say that nature and God are one. Nature functions as a representative of God Himself. But we have to know that nature is aware of the fact that there is somebody inside it who is regulating it. If that portion of the Creator which is in nature is taken away, immediately nature becomes lifeless.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, can you describe the Supreme&#039;s Beauty?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, can you describe the Supreme&#039;s Beauty?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme's Beauty only the Supreme can describe. If you try to express the Supreme's Beauty, you will immediately be challenged even by a child. Try to describe to a child who has never seen the sea how vast, how powerful and how beautiful it is. The child will ask, "How big is it? Show me." Then you will spread your arms out and say it is so huge. The child will say, "That big?" Then again you will say, "No, it is far, far bigger. It is much farther than a person can reach."Even if he imagines what you are trying to describe, he will not be satisfied. The moment you try to express anything in our human language you are limiting it. The moment you try to express anything divine you limit it. Why can't I describe God-realisation? I can try, but I will have to write thousands of pages and even then, if you have had the experience yourself, you will give me zero because my description is not complete. These things have to be experienced; they cannot be described. Action is one thing, but explanation is something else. When I want to describe something that I have done, it does not remain the same. The Supreme's Beauty I see twenty-four hours a day. I can see it at any moment. But when I have to explain it to you, I am using my mind. That is like standing in front of the mightiest ocean and with a ruler trying to measure it. It is a hopeless task because I have such a limited instrument at my disposal. This is the unfortunate thing. When we want to explain the Supreme's Beauty or the Supreme's Light, we have to use our physical mind. It is the best thing we have for dealing with the world at large. It is far more developed than the body or the vital, but in comparison with the soul, the mind is absolutely weak and insignificant. If you remain in the heart, explanation is not necessary. There identification is the medium. Just stand in front of the ocean and enter into your heart. Immediately the consciousness of the whole ocean enters into you and you become one with it. Why? Because at that time you identify with it. If you can use your heart to identify with the infinite Beauty, or with whatever you want, then you will know its attributes. Through identification we get everything, but through mental scrutiny we can never explain the infinite Beauty of the Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do some animals see more beauty than others?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do some animals see more beauty than others?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here we have to know what kind of animal it is. If it is a tiger or a lion or an elephant, it will not see any beauty. Their beauty is destruction. A tiger's beauty will be in devouring you. That is his satisfaction, and that satisfaction it considers beauty. In our human life also, satisfaction is beauty. There is no difference between satisfaction and beauty. As soon as you see a beautiful flower you are satisfied. But also, our satisfaction lies in becoming one with the beauty that we see. We want to be as pure as the flower. But a tiger's satisfaction will be found only in destruction. Again, there are some animals that are very mild and won't try to destroy anybody; they will only try to go toward their own goal. They are trying to reach something, not destroy something. So naturally they are creating beauty. In the animal kingdom beauty means harmony. A deer is not going to eat me up. The deer's very nature is to run and run toward an unknown goal. The deer's constant movement is not for destruction, but to see something, to feel something and to reach something. That movement gives it satisfaction, and that satisfaction is real beauty. We human beings do not care to move. Most of us are lazy. Again, when we do move and encounter some obstacle, we feel that we are lost; immediately we feel that there is no goal and we don't try to go in another direction.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can inspire the world more with my divine beauty, which is my Realisation-Light, through your self-giving to humanity. You can offer yourself devotedly and unconditionally to humanity only when you discover that each human being is a living manifestation of your Inner Pilot, the Absolute Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a difference between the beauty that is in simplicity and the beauty that is in something very striking?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a difference between the beauty that is in simplicity and the beauty that is in something very striking?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Simplicity itself is beauty. If somebody is very simple, because of his simplicity he is beautiful, and if someone has inner beauty, because of his inner beauty he is simple. If somebody is inwardly spiritual, he is like a beautiful and simple child. But you have to know the difference between the beauty that is in simplicity and the striking beauty of a God-realised soul. A child is most simple, but you have to know the capacity of a child. His simplicity is beauty; his beauty is simplicity. When somebody has prayed, meditated and realised God, he may not be as simple or as innocent as a child. But look at his capacity! When it is a matter of achievement or capacity, the child is very limited. He has to grow up and gain inner strength. His simple beauty cannot be placed on the same footing as the inner beauty of a spiritual Master. But when a Master is not simple, that does not mean that he is crooked or complicated. No! Only he may not want to act in a very simple way. He may be guarded or caution or more restricted than a child, but when it is a matter of capacity, he can do millions of things for himself, for God and for earth which a child cannot do. Naturally his capacity, his achievement, his offering to the world is much more striking. A child's beauty is undeniably appreciated. But when somebody, with his sincerity and aspiration, has achieved something in the inner or the outer world, his beauty's capacity is much more appreciated, much more valued by the world. You may say that the child is offering beauty according to his capacity. A kindergarten student is sharing knowledge with his friends. But if his eldest brother, who has a Ph.D., is also sharing his capacity with others, we have to know who is giving more benefit to the world. How many people are getting benefit from the child's capacity and from the brother's capacity? Undoubtedly, everybody can get some benefit from the eldest brother's capacity. Even the child's friends, who are getting a little joy and a little knowledge from the child, can be taught by the eldest brother. But the little child with his little capacity cannot teach most of the world. The capacity of beauty differs. Simplicity is the first rung of the spiritual ladder. But if you want to compare the beauty of simplicity with the beauty of another, more evolved type which offers infinitely more light, then naturally you will say that the more evolved beauty is infinitely more significant. The child's beauty is important, but if you need something to use on a world scale, then the capacity of the person who is spiritually and inwardly mature is much more important or, let us say, much more beneficial. The world derives much more benefit from that person's inner beauty. But a child will not remain a child forever. He will also grow up and get his Master's degree and his Ph.D. He who is a beginner in the spiritual life today will not be a beginner tomorrow. The beauty of his childlike simplicity will grow into a more mature and powerful beauty.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What as the best way to appreciate nature&#039;s beauty?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What as the best way to appreciate nature&#039;s beauty?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to appreciate nature's beauty is to sit and meditate with nature. If you take a tree as nature, then sit at the foot of a tree and meditate. If you take the sun as an expression of nature, then look at the sun and meditate. If you feel the ocean or sea as nature, then sit in front of the water and meditate. While looking at the tree or the sun or the ocean, try to feel your oneness with it. Anything that you consider as nature or nature's beauty, you should try to become one with. Again, if you want a particular thing from nature, you have to go to that thing. If you want to have vastness, then just go out of the house and look at the sky and you will enter into vastness. If you want to have a very vast, pure consciousness, then stand in front of a river and meditate on the river. And if you want to get height in your life, then go to a mountain and meditate there. So whatever you want, you have to stand in front of that particular thing and invoke it. You have to invoke the spirit of nature or become one with the soul of nature. That is the best kind of identification.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Feel that without beauty there is no life in you: you are a dry flower which can be of no use. Appreciate beauty in yourself and in others. From your appreciation you will develop the capacity to become a vehicle for beauty.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When we want to create, how can we invoke beauty to inspire us?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When we want to create, how can we invoke beauty to inspire us?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us imagine a bird that is flying in the firmament. It is constantly flying, flying. When we look at the bird, immediately we are fascinated by its capacity. We cannot fly, but we have the capacity to identify ourselves with its action. If we look at the bird while we are in a meditative mood, we feel as if we are also flying. At that time, our inner being is flying; our aspiration is flying. When you want to create something, you want to invoke beauty to inspire you. So at that time, you have to identify yourself with someone who is creating. You want to do something unique, but the type of thing that you want to do somebody has already done or is doing. Only you want to surpass him. So try to identify yourself with the consciousness of the person who has already done the thing or with the person himself, and try to get inspiration, aspiration and capacity from him. If you want to write something spiritual, read my writings and identify with them. If you want to draw something, take your ideal artist and identify with his creation. But you have to be careful. An artist may have a very bad character. His creations may be divine, but his character may be undivine. In that case, don't identify with the creator but identify with the creation only. If you identify with a creation of beauty, that beauty will inspire you to create something beautiful. Identify, identify, identify. Identification is not imitation. Far from it! But if you identify with something and get the capacity or quality or essence of that thing, then you can develop it and increase it in your own way.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If a person has four children and they are playing together, he gets tremendous joy. But if he has only one child, he may not get the same amount of joy. Similarly, if you have a beautiful body, beautiful vital, beautiful mind and beautiful heart, when you see them operating together harmoniously and divinely, you get the greatest joy. How can you make yourself beautiful in all parts? How can you make them all what you want to be? It is through self-giving. You have to give time and attention to the physical in you; that is to say, you have to keep your body clean and neat. You have to offer time and attention to your vital; that is to say, you have to act, you have to be dynamic, you have to move around; you will not stay at home and rest all the time. You have to give time and attention to your mind by reading spiritual books and by concentrating. You have to give time and attention to your heart by praying and meditating. If you don't pray and meditate, you will remain insecure, but when you meditate you become aware of your oneness with God. By paying attention to the physical, to the vital, to the mind and to the heart, you are giving them the nourishment they need. If you want them to please you, you have to feed them first you have to pay attention to them. Once you give them proper nourishment they will all dance in front of you like divine children.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. According to one's inner achievement one appreciates the outer beauty. Again, he who has realised the Highest has a different way of appreciating beauty. He sees the past, present and future at a glance and he determines the value of beauty according to the soul's already achieved reality.</p>
