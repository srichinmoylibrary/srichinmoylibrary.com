 <p>
PTED 2-20. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions about tennis at Aspiration-Ground, his tennis court and meditation park, on 9 July, 1988.</p>
<h2>Question: Do you root for a tennis player to actually win a match or doesn't it matter to you whether someone wins or not?</h2>

<p>The divine in me immediately takes the side of the divine and says, "Whoever God wants to win is the person I also want to win." But the human in me sees the good qualities or the divinity in the two players and immediately takes the side of the one who is the most divine or who has the most good qualities. In every case the human in me is hoping for the manifestation of the divine victory. In fact, my whole life is dedicated to working for the divine victory and increasing the divine in human beings. So I always want the victory of the best instruments of God — whether it is in weightlifting, body-building, tennis or any other field of endeavour.</p>
<p>Again, you have to know that this is only my simple, childish wish — just as when you say, "How I wish so and so would win!" In no way am I using my will-power in order to help someone win. If an individual loses in spite of my good wishes, I don't feel at all sad. The divine in me, which has already taken the side of the divine, says, "Let Thy Will be done." So I am happy that God's Will has been fulfilled.</p>

What do you think of this theory?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Theories are not always correct. His game would badly descend if he changed his grip. A supreme player like McEnroe is not bound by hard and fast rules. Who makes the rules? People have said that if you do not have the proper style, then you can't run. But Zatopek was the radiant proof that this is not true. His style was worse than the worst, yet he killed himself when he ran and kept on winning. Previously, people used to say that you had to do the high jump in one way; now people do it an entirely different way. Previously nobody could imagine anyone playing with an over-sized racquet. They asked, "How will people be able to handle it? It will be dull and heavy." Now the theory has changed and most of the players use over-sized racquets. So styles are always changing.</p>
<p>Most athletes follow the general rules. But there will always be champions who don't have to abide by the well-established rules. From the very beginning they will rebel against the past and try to do something totally different, for it is their very nature to invent something new. Geniuses like McEnroe break out of the old boundaries and limitations. If they did not, everything would be fossilised and there would be no new creation.</p>

<p>Suppose you are an excellent player and I am a useless player. What will my spiritual capacity do for me? A saint will come and box with Tyson, and Tyson will destroy him. Only if the saint has occult power and decides to use it will Tyson not be able to beat him. In one of my stories I tell about a great military man who had killed so many people on the battlefield. A spiritual Master said, "Lift up this ballpoint!" The soldier could not do it because the Master had used occult power to take away the soldier's life-energy.</p>
<p>Again, if two players have similar outer capacities, then the one with stronger inner capacities will definitely have the advantage. During a competition, if one player can bring tremendous determination to the fore, then naturally he will win. But this determination has to come from the dynamic vital and not from the aggressive vital. The dynamic vital has to transform the physical and the mind into good instruments. It has to energise the physical, which is normally lethargic, and tell it, "You have to be as dynamic as I am." It has to command the mind to give up its doubt. The mind may be saying, "Oh, my opponent's service is most powerful. How am I going to return it?" The vital has to tell the mind, "You have to throw away your doubt! Do not waste time doubting your capacities. Be one-pointed like me and have confidence!"</p>
<p>If the dynamism of the vital enters into the body and the body becomes fully one with the vital, and if the doubting mind surrenders to the dynamic vital, then there is every possibility that the individual will win the match. If the dynamic vital can take full control of the game, then even at the eleventh hour you can change the course of the game and win. Many times this happens, and it is the vital which deserves full credit.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do you think that the huge prize money involved in professional tennis is ruining the game?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do you think that the huge prize money involved in professional tennis is ruining the game?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Good professional players have to stop being so concerned about money. It is not true that money is necessary to inspire great players. Kramer, Gonzalez and many others were great players, but they didn't compete for such prizes.</p>
<p>The standard of tennis has definitely improved compared with the past. Today's great players are far better than those in previous generations. But we cannot say that today's players are taking the sport more seriously because of the prize money. This higher standard would have come into existence even if there had been no prize money. And these same players would be far better if they were thinking only of winning and not also of the prize money. It is not that money has made them aggressive. No, it has actually ruined their capacities.</p>
<p>Before they even start to play, the players are thinking of money-power rather than the beauty and the divinity of the game. They have forgotten about the joy of tennis. Money-power also takes away the joy of the spectators. Thousands of people go to a match to see the capacities of two individuals and to enjoy the game. But sometimes when they think of the thousands of dollars the players are getting, they become jealous. These negative forces from the spectators are entering into the players. Then, this same jealousy-force the players send to other players. Let us say a player is not participating in a particular tournament. When be thinks of the huge amount of money the winner is going to get, he immediately sends his jealousy-power. So, wrong forces are moving all about in the tennis-world.</p>
<p>For so many years Hillary and others were trying to climb up Mount Everest. They failed and failed, but finally Hillary did it. What kind of money did he get? He didn't get any money. One hundred or two hundred years ago people didn't get any money for doing these things. What they cared about was the expedition and their own capacity. Football players are not making as much money as the tennis stars are making. Still, their standard is going up! But in tennis, money talks. I have not seen a single player who, in the back of his mind, is not thinking about money rather than the beauty of the game or the perfection of his own capacity. These players could play much better if they were not trying to become millionaires.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: In ultra-running they are talking of bringing in money. Will it ruin the consciousness there as well?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: In ultra-running they are talking of bringing in money. Will it ruin the consciousness there as well?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>It is already being ruined. You can see it. On the one hand, the runners are saying that they need money because this is how they earn their livelihood. But it is one thing to need money to live on and another thing to be greedy. Good runners definitely should get some money — but not $10,000 or $20,000. If they want that kind of money, they should go into another field. If someone wants to dedicate his life to running, he should open up a business — a running store or a health food store and use the money from that to support himself. Then he can run for the joy of it. But when a runner expects thousands and thousands of dollars for winning a race, he is only feeding his greed. In these cases the money is taking away all the cheerful, enlightening joy of the sport.</p>
<p>It is not a question of sour grapes; we are not criticising money-power because we ourselves are not good enough to win prize money. No! I am seeing how money-power has captured some good runners and is devouring them. When people competed in sports twenty or thirty years ago, they had much more innocent joy. Now, from the beginning to the end, some runners are only thinking about winning the prize.</p>
<p>If a runner is looking for real satisfaction, he will never get it from prize money. The New York Marathon gives $20,000 to the winner. But the runner who gets it may feel miserable that he did not run the Chicago Marathon or Boston Marathon, where the prize may be $30,000 or $40,000. He may say, "Why did I not wait for that one? If I had waited two more weeks, I could have run the Boston Marathon and gotten more money." Perhaps he has gotten $20,000, but because somebody else is getting $40,000, all his joy is going away. Joy is infinitely more important than money. If he did not care for money, he would say, "I have done my personal best here. I am so happy. Who knows if I would have done as well if I had joined the Chicago Marathon or the Boston Marathon." So when you keep money-power away, real wisdom-power comes.</p>

<p>It depends on whether he continues to maintain his spiritual approach to tennis. During a recent interview he said that even if he cannot immediately bring his determination to the fore and loses points, he does not mind because he and his opponent are giving one another such joy playing together. This kind of attitude is so spiritual! He is reaching the hearts of so many people and he has become very, very popular. If he continues to maintain this sincere, spiritual approach throughout his career, then he will be able to inspire many, many people. I do hope he will continue and not let his business manager and others instigate him to start thinking of money-power.</p>

<p>He had the will to win and he refused to surrender. Most of the time Borg plays a defensive game, and so many times he wins. Therefore, he has confidence that his opponent will eventually get tired and not be able to attack him anymore. It is like a boxer who lets his opponent keep on hitting him. He knows that after a while the opponent will become tired and lose confidence. Similarly, if the other player strikes the ball hard ten times, and you keep on returning it, your opponent's determination will go away and he will give up.</p>

<p>There is a great difference between the outer life and the inner life. There is one player whose tongue is absolutely fouler than the foulest. He behaves so badly that everybody who sees him is ashamed. But that is only on the physical and vital plane. His soul is very, very progressive, but the soul is not able to offer its divine qualities to the outer being. The outer being is dominating him. In his case, there is no bridge between the inner and the outer.</p>

<p>First of all, we should not give the players prize money. Then, whoever is the organiser could give a five-minute talk. He could say that in order to do anything successfully in life, you always need friends. It is like a tug-of-war: If you have more people on your side, then you are bound to win. It is the same in tennis. You already have talent as a friend. You also have parents, dear ones and so on. One more friend that you can have is a good thought. A good thought can be your best friend. If you have good thoughts and good will toward your opponent, then these realities will enter into him and you will also receive good thoughts and good will from him.</p>
<p>Both of your good thoughts will meet together, and from these good thoughts something special will develop. If I am good to you and you are good to me, then from our goodness a deeper reality will come to the fore: the feeling of oneness. Without oneness there can be no goodness, and without goodness there can be no oneness. Goodness means oneness.</p>
<p>If you take the other approach and think that your opponent is a bad fellow, then you will want to defeat him by hook or by crook. Your negative feeling toward him will bring an even stronger negative force to the fore in you. Even after the game is over, you will be thinking and saying nasty things about him. This will further lower your consciousness and, in the end, you will be the loser. But good thoughts will only increase your capacity in every way, and even after the match is over, there will be happiness in your mind.</p>

<p>Sometimes the players are overconfident. Because they have won three of the four Grand Slam tournaments, they feel that easily they are going to win the fourth. Again, sometimes after winning three tournaments, they lose all their confidence and fear comes. After covering hundreds of miles, when somebody sees that he is finally near the shore, the beauty or the enormity of the shore frightens or puzzles him.</p>
<p>Also, negative forces can come into the picture. Sometimes people who were eliminated right in the beginning are dead set against somebody's winning the Grand Slam. Or people who used to be good players many years ago become very jealous if they see that someone is about to win the Grand Slam. They didn't get that kind of joy and that kind of prize when they were playing, so they don't want anyone else to get it. They use their negative power and put out a tremendous wrong force.</p>
<p>If someone becomes a good player, ninety per cent of the people do not want him to get any better. Only ten per cent want him to improve. I am not only talking about the players who are his rivals. It is a human tendency not to appreciate others' good qualities. We always try to destroy the good qualities of others even though we know perfectly well that we have accomplished nothing ourselves. I am lame, let us say. But if I hear that Carl Lewis or someone else is doing well, then immediately I will put out a negative force, saying, "Let him lose, let him lose!" And this negative thought enters into that person like a current.</p>
<p>Another reason why some players don't win the Grand Slam is that the destination itself does not want them. The destination — the Grand Slam — has its own consciousness and sometimes it does not want certain individuals to reach it. So when the destination sees that so and so is approaching, it just recedes. The destination should be neutral, but sometimes it is not.</p>
<p>Again, the destination does not have the capacity to actually decide whether or not somebody will reach it. If God is the destination, then God can decide. But if the destination is the finish line of a race or something like that, it cannot decide who will win. The destination in this case has its own limits. Again, God is inside the destination. In fact, God is the destination of everything.</p>

<p>The destination likes you because it sees some good qualities in you, whereas it doesn't see those good qualities in me. If I am a bad person, let us say, and you are a good person, the destination may not want to be touched by me. But the destination may like you and want you to reach it. If I am spiritually awake, I will realise the reason the destination allows you to touch it but does not allow me. The next time I have to start the same journey, I will see that it is not my capacity that the destination wants from me but my good qualities. Then I will try to develop the same good qualities that you have. Outwardly I may not know what they are, but I can pray to God to give me the good qualities that allowed you to win.</p>

<p>They had the capacity to teach me and they were ready to help me. But I have such knee pain. What can I do? You are willing to help me to become a good runner, let us say. But if I am lame and can't even get up, how can you help me? Their promise to help me was very, very sincere, and even now they are eager to help me. But they do not have the capacity to cure my knee injuries. So my present incapacity has destroyed everything. Otherwise, in two or three months you would have seen my tennis game become totally different.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes when I play tennis badly I get very, very frustrated and when I&#039;m playing well I get so much joy. Is there some way I can be more consistent instead of playing badly one day and playing well the next?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes when I play tennis badly I get very, very frustrated and when I&#039;m playing well I get so much joy.

<p>Everybody has the same problem — even the professionals. For nine days Lendl plays so well. Then on the tenth day, he plays badly and loses. Since you are following the spiritual life, you have to depend more on divine Grace than on your own capacity. On the day when you have a match, many hostile forces may attack you. Either doubt comes and you feel, "I may not be able to defeat so and so," or overconfidence comes and you say, "Yesterday I played so well, so today also I will easily be able to defeat my opponent."</p>
<p>What you have to do for a few minutes is pray and meditate with the idea, "By Your Grace, O my Supreme, I will play my best." You have to depend on His Grace, rather than on your own capacity, because even our own capacity is His Grace. So you have to depend on Him to give you the capacity to fight against doubt; you have to depend on Him to purify and illumine your consciousness so that you do not have nervousness, overconfidence or anything else.</p>
<p>Again, there is an even higher prayer: "By Your Grace I will play the way You want me to play, and I will be equally happy no matter who wins." Unconditional surrender is the highest prayer. Second best is to pray to play extremely well through the Supreme's Grace. Let us not bring unconditional surrender into the picture right now. If you use the second best prayer, then God's Grace will enter into your nervousness, insecurity, doubt and other wrong forces and you will always be able to maintain your regular standard.</p>
