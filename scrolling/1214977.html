<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God wears ties at every moment, from His birthless Silence to His deathless Sound. From the beginning of His creation and throughout the ever-continuing creation, He has always worn ties. When a human being wears a tie, it is for a few hours. Then he changes his tie or he takes it off. But in God’s case, He has been wearing His ties since the creation of humanity. Birthless and deathless ties of oneness He has been wearing all throughout His creation, and He will continue to wear these ties of oneness eternally.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, God has both false teeth and real teeth. When He devours ignorance, He uses His false teeth. Why? Because ignorance itself is false. But when He eats Light, He uses His real teeth, for Light is eternally real.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God teases you for two reasons. The first reason is that God wants you to feel that He is your eternal Friend, your only Friend. Just because He is your eternal Friend, He does something which only a real friend would dare to do. Only a real friend can tease you.</p>
<p>God also teases you for another, very specific reason. Sometimes when God sees that you are consciously or unconsciously in an unpleasant, superior, haughty consciousness, He tries to bring you down to the normal human consciousness, so that you will act like a normal, natural, loving human being. He brings you down to the level of your brothers and sisters so that even unconsciously you do not have a superior or self-imposed feeling of isolation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, unlike mortals, God does not believe in sleeping every night. But, on rare nights, God does take rest or go to sleep. Then, early in the morning when He gets up, He gets up with a universal headache or a universal stomach upset, or with a universal Hope or a universal Inspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God’s Eyes have no colour of their own. It is the individual who sees the colour in God’s Eyes according to his or her own aspiration-height. If the seeker is very aspiring, then that seeker will see God’s Eyes as blue. If the seeker is very pure, then he will see God’s Eyes as white. If the seeker is extremely energetic and dynamic, then that individual will see God’s Eyes as green. If the individual has tremendous willpower and fiery determination to reach the Goal, then that particular seeker will see God’s Eyes as either red or brown. Or if God Himself is fighting against the teeming ignorance of the seeker so that the seeker can realise Him infinitely sooner than otherwise, then the seeker will see God’s Eyes as red or brown. Red and brown have a powerful, dynamic quality.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, God likes cities because the cities add to His dynamic movement, dynamic life. He also likes villages, because the villages add to His static relaxation. Both relaxation and dynamic movement are of great importance. Together they make God complete. So when God wants to enjoy dynamic movement, He lives in the cities; when He wants to enjoy static relaxation, He lives in the villages.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Seriousness is also an aspect of God. If God always remains childish or frivolous, or if God does something in a relaxed, funny manner, then His children may do that very thing in a destructive way. That is to say, if God cuts a joke which is not at all a hurtful joke, then just because God has cut a joke, His children may cut jokes which will be most hurtful and painful. So God has to show His other aspect. After all, His universal Breadth, transcendental Height and eternal Depth are all serious matters.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God does not gain extra weight because He feels that if He does so, then He will add to the ignorance-force around Him. Just because He is all-wise, He does not want the force of ignorance to be more powerful and more uncontrollable.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If God really likes ice cream for Himself and His children, there must be some reason. The reason is that God wants His children to be eternally sweet. And He Himself eats ice cream because He Himself wants to be sweet to His children. Both Father and children alike must sweeten their existence. It is in sweetness that eternal harmony can eternally last.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not the climate as such that God likes, but how people who live in a particular climate invite Him and welcome Him. If people who live in a cold climate invite God or feel the necessity of God more than those who live in a tropical climate, then God will definitely prefer to stay in the cold climate.</p>
<p>Those who live in a particular climate are like the inhabitants of a house. The house may not be beautiful, but if the inhabitants invite you and welcome you, then you will definitely go there. You do not go for the sake of the house, but for the sake of its inhabitants. A climate is like a house. If the person who dwells inside the house shows interest in you and cares for you, then you will definitely go there instead of going to another house where you are unwanted, even if the other house is more beautiful.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is an endless Creator. But unlike human creators, God does not feel the necessity of attaching Himself to His creation. He feels that once He has created, His creation is earth’s possession and is for earth’s illumination. It is redundant and unnecessary for Him to sign His initials or His name to His creation, for, after all, He knows what He has done. As a matter of fact, nothing is created on earth without His approval or His direct or indirect help. Such being the case, He feels that He is responsible for anything that has been created on earth. Therefore, He feels it is unnecessary to sign His name, for who else can create but He Himself?</p>
