<p>Gary Fannelli was running among the lead runners in the New York City Marathon. When he saw me at the three-mile mark, I was begging him to continue. But he stayed and talked and talked and talked. He was telling me that he had a vision of me and that he meditates on me. He said that he is so grateful to me. Like this, he went on and on talking. Finally, he continued running, but by that time many runners had gone by.</p>

<p>I am extremely grateful to and extremely proud of those who ran our half marathon this morning. You are really brave soldiers. It was so cold! I ran four miles and walked four miles. That was enough. Many years ago in Boston I had frostbite. My nose was seriously affected. So I was getting frightened that again I would have frostbite. You are all really brave! Ninety-five non-disciples came to run in this weather! I am so grateful to them.</p>

<p>On my trip to Australia and New Zealand I walked and ran every day, except one. Yesterday I ran in Australia. The date was December 3rd. Then, when we arrived in Los Angeles after so many hours in the plane, it became the 3rd once more. Again I ran. So on the 3rd I ran twice. Tomorrow, no matter what happens, even if it rains or snows, I will definitely run.</p>

I was about to make a left turn, but I did not see that one car was coming behind me. I would have crossed in front of the car, but Ila called out to me and saved me. A little farther on, I saw Pradhan and then I saw Agraha. I ran for twenty minutes and then I came back to the hotel following the same route. On the way back, it was less than eighteen minutes. So, while coming back, I ran faster.</p>

<p>This morning, when I went running in Jakarta, I saw little children running. They were all about three or four years old. Some of them were wearing sandals, but most of them had no shoes at all. How I wish my spiritual children would get up early in the morning at 4:30 like these children and run! Savyasachi told me that the main street would be blocked off for joggers and walkers this morning. So many people were out running so early in the morning!</p>

<p>Pragati is one of the very few disciples in the New York area who is so kind to me to give me expressions. Almost every day she gives me ten expressions. Then, when she sees me early in the morning, running or walking, she puts both her hands over her chest. Her humility is very sincere, her devotion is very sincere. I feel intensity in her humility and intensity in her devotion. She runs according to her own pace. Most of the time, it is the pace of an Indian bullock cart. Since she runs at the speed of a bullock cart, my compassion-heart can keep pace with her speed and it blesses her for at least 50 or 60 metres. Then I reach my house-destination. I run towards my house-destination and she runs and runs inside my heart-corridor, which is her destination.</p>

<p>Around 6:30 in the morning, it is quite light. Before 6:30 I have asked the girls not to run alone. At least two girls, or preferably four or five, should go together. Otherwise, some serious calamity may take place. Today I was very happy to see four or five girls running together. I saw Bigalita and quite a few others. While I was running, little vans were inviting me. They were literally stopping the vans to ask me to come inside. Perhaps they thought that I was lost.</p>

<p>I was running and walking early in the morning in Yogyakarta. It gave me such joy. Today, for the first time, I walked for one hour. On other days, I walk for forty or fifty minutes. Today it was one hour. After I crossed over the mile mark, I saw Savita and Ankhi. Then I went a mile and a half and I saw Indu and another girl. Running here is so beautiful. Farmers are ploughing their paddyfields and nature's beauty is all around. I was walking and walking so happily.</p>
