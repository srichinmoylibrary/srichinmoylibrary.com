Could you please comment on this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dear David, it will simply be impossible for me to see eye to eye with the statement that has been made by the spiritual leader in question. To say that the United Nations is a society for united animals, since people at the United Nations are not interested in religious things, is to criticise the United Nations not only mercilessly but almost unreasonably. First of all, we all know that in the name of religion and religious matters countless people have been killed since the dawn of so-called civilisation. Almost all the religions have fought at one time or another against one another unreservedly and, what is worse, at times without any rhyme or reason. Just to show its supremacy over other religions, each religion has swerved from the fundamental principles of truth. Why blame the United Nations? The wisest thing for the wise man is to first solve his own personal problems, illumine his own darkness and perfect his own nature. This is the only way that either the united or the divided human animals all over the world can climb to a higher rung of evolution, which we can unmistakably call proper human life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, the United Nations can and should aspire for a higher goal than what the member states that compose it represent. The member states are like strong pillars of an edifice, but many more things are required to build the edifice. Those things are also of tremendous necessity. When everything is in its proper place and all things are combined to achieve a specific goal, at that time the body of the achievement-reality becomes divinely integral and supremely perfect.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on the inner strength of the individual delegations. If an individual delegation has received a higher call to spread deeper reality in human life and, at that time, if it does not get support from its home government, then I think and feel that the individual delegation must move forward and listen to the inner dictates. Let us take the home government as an old man, an old father, and the individual delegation as a young man. The old man always thinks that he knows everything far better than his son, but sometimes it happens that a higher truth and more illumining realities want to express themselves in and through the young generation. At that time, if the old generation does not want to accept the new vision that has dawned on the young generation, then it will be a deplorable mistake. And this mistake may cause an untold disaster in the minds and the hearts of both the fearful and unwilling old generation and the daring and pioneering new generation. God does not have to speak all the time through the human father. He can easily speak to the father through the human son as well. Therefore, as it is obligatory for the son to listen to his father when the father's advice is founded upon unmistakable truths, even so it is equally obligatory for the father to accept the son's vision-reality when it is unmistakably illumining and considerably fulfilling.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When a member state assumes an &quot;anti-United Nations attitude,&quot; the cause would probably be frustration or fear that the U.N. has taken or may take some action against it. Does such an attitude weaken the U.N. system?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When a member state assumes an &amp;quot;anti-United Nations attitude,&amp;quot; the cause would probably be frustration or fear that the U.N. has taken or may take some action against it. Does such an attitude weaken the U.N. system?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When a member state assumes an "anti-United Nations attitude," it undoubtedly weakens the United Nations system. First of all, it violently and shamelessly goes against the United Nations system. When a member state goes against the United Nations system, on the outer plane it definitely weakens the system; but on the inner plane the strength of the United Nations system is extremely solid and sound. As long as the inner aspiration of the United Nations is sincere and strong, we do not have to worry if a member state or even if all the member states assume an "anti-United Nations attitude." For it is not the member states alone that can and will bring about world harmony. It is the united force of all the nations, big and small, that can and will bring about a oneness-world family.</p>
<p>There can be many reasons why a member state wants to stand against the United Nations policy. But just by standing against United Nations policy, a state will not be able to solve even an iota of the world's problems. If one sees that the United Nations is doing something wrong, that is no reason why one should want to stand against the United Nations. One has to love the United Nations more in order to bring to the fore its sincere aspirations which can and will change the face of the entire world.</p>
<p>To err is human, to forgive divine. To forget past blunders of others, as well as one's own, is to make friends with satisfaction-peace and perfection-bliss. Further, this is the only way to accelerate humanity's oneness-vision and oneness-goal. If you see the world's imperfections, you should not discard the world; you should not consider it a filthy object or speak ill of it in season and out of season. No! The wise thing is to accept and embrace the world — the well-meaning U.N. world — as a humble and trying instrument of an all-embracing and all-fulfilling supreme Reality.</p>

Is there a preferred definition of the institution of the Secretary-General?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> According to my inner aspiration, I wish to say that an ideal Secretary-General is he who has a free access both to the inner realities and the outer realities of life. The inner realities are heart's cry, heart's oneness. The outer realities are life's total and consecrated dedication. The ideal Secretary-General is he who dives deep within in order to quench his inner thirst, the thirst of the oneness-world family, and then comes from within to without to share with the rest of the world the nectar-bliss that he has discovered and drunk profusely in his inner life.</p>
<p>An ideal Secretary-General is he who at once fulfils his inner vision and outer mission. His inner vision is love of humanity, for humanity's sake, and his outer mission is service to humanity, for humanity's sake. His inner life is a continuous growth to reach the acme of perfection. His outer life is dedicated to spreading his perfection, which is illumination itself, throughout the length and breadth of the world.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We should always try to be true servers and warriors of truth, for truth is life in the purest sense of the term. Therefore, our supreme choice and our only choice has to be an all-loving, all-caring, all-serving and all-fulfilling Secretary-General, whose love-power will transform the dominion-power or the influence-power, and not the other way around. Love inspires us to do the right thing in life. Power quite often, if not always, influences us or, rather, not always but quite often instigates us to do the wrong thing. Therefore, a Secretary-General who is higher than the highest in height is also expected to be wider than the widest in every sphere of his life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a special need to promote co-operation between the newer and often poorer countries in the General Assembly and the older and, in most cases, more established, wealthier countries? Should the latter not take the lead in fostering good relations?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a special need to promote co-operation between the newer and often poorer countries in the General Assembly and the older and, in most cases, more established, wealthier countries? Should the latter not take the lead in fostering good relations?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We all believe in progress. Progress is nothing but true satisfaction. If one country is more established and more financially secure than another country, that doesn't mean that this particular country is the happiest and the most perfect country. If one country wants to remain always at the vanguard of all the other countries, or if it wants to exercise supremacy over the other countries, then it may be able to do so. But true satisfaction, for which there is a common and universal cry, will never come. Supremacy will never be transformed into either an individual or collective smile.</p>
<p>Everything is relative. One country may be poorer than another country in one particular aspect of human life but it can easily be richer in some other aspect of life. Outer wealth it may lack, but inner wealth it may have in profuse measure. Again, if one country is wanting in the outer wealth as well as in the inner wealth, then it will be an act not only of kindness but also of wisdom if the superior country opens both it's inner door and outer door to help, guide and illumine the unillumined, inferior one. At that time the illumined one is only increasing its reality-existence. The heart of love knows only how to expand, and another name for this expansion is satisfaction. Satisfaction-reality is the fruit of the satisfaction-tree, which comes from the perfection-seed.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Co-operation of all nations is an ancient dream. Assuming we are building on the past, how can we assess the outlook now?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Co-operation of all nations is an ancient dream. Assuming we are building on the past, how can we assess the outlook now?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The ancient dream of co-operation is not a human dream which has very little to do with reality. The ancient dream, to be precise, is not a dream at all but a faultless and divine vision — an unhorizoned vision — which is slowly, steadily and unerringly shaping the individual and collective destiny in humanity's march towards the supreme goal of universal oneness and transcendental newness. The world is evolving and progressing and reaching a higher standard of life. It is not moving in a horizontal way, but in a spiral. Therefore, at times this progress is not immediately noticeable. At times it confuses and baffles our human mind. But on the strength of our inner oneness with the world situation and world evolution, we see unmistakably the world's slow and steady progress.</p>
<p>True, man-made destructive forces are to be found here, there and everywhere. Here they may be in small measure; somewhere else, in a large measure. But the creator of the wrong forces, the destructive forces, need not remain always a creator of wrong forces. He can easily become a creator of good forces. In spite of creating and possessing wrong forces, if one remains silent to catch a glimpse either consciously or unconsciously of the divine, illumining and fulfilling light, at that time one is taking the first step. The second step is to create positive realities in order to accelerate humanity's progress towards perfection.</p>
<p>A negative force is not by nature negative. Only it is a force that we use in a negative way. A knife can be used either as a destructive force or as a force of co-operation and oneness-expansion. With a knife one can stab others; with the same knife one can cut fruits and share them with others.</p>
<p>The ancient dream, nay, the ancient vision, will always remain a new and progressive vision, for creation itself is an ever-transcending reality. We shall have to open our heart's door and our mind's windows in order to see from the body-room the light that illumines and fulfils the world around us. Then only we shall discover continual progress in humanity's march along Eternity's road to Infinity's Satisfaction-Goal.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When these qualities, the good qualities of the East and the good qualities of the West, are all combined, a human being can be perfect. Right now the good qualities that the East has are not enough. Similarly, the good qualities that the West has are not enough. But when we can amalgamate, when we can have the qualities of both worlds, then an individual can become perfect. Right now the West wants to proceed with only honesty and frankness, but this will be insufficient. Humility is also required. The East has humility, but honesty is also required if it wants to become perfect.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I do feel that we are accomplishing something meaningful and fruitful. The delegates and staff members at the United Nations are showing more and more interest. They come to meditate and they ask questions. Their response is most favourable.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We pray and meditate, plus I give short talks and answer their questions. The inner world embodies Peace, Light and Bliss. The outer world, unfortunately, does not right now embody these qualities, whereas the inner world has them in boundless measure. So we try to establish a free access to the inner world by virtue of our inner cry and our soulful meditation. We call this our aspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. I am quite ignorant of politics as such. My forte is spirituality. There are two approaches to every problem. One is the inner approach the other is the outer approach. Those who come to meditate want to try to walk along the inner road. But ultimately both the roads can lead to the same destination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The inner road is the road of sincere dedication to the highest Cause. In the outer world one can aim at a particular goal without having sincere dedication to the goal. But the inner road represents the attitude of the seeker. The seeker tries in every way to lead a more illumining and more fulfilling life, to find and follow the way that is right from the highest point of view.</p>
