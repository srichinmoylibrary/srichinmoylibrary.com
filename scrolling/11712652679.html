<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Two Americans came to the Ashram. They saw something in me, and they invited me to come to America. In my last job here I was the secretary of the General Secretary of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Nolini Kanta Gupta. He was a well-known writer who was admired by Tagore. He was the main Secretary of the Mother and Sri Aurobindo. I did office work for him, plus translation of his writings from Bengali into English. About him, Tagore said, "Nolini Kanta's contribution to Bengali literature is unique."</p>

What made you accept their invitation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Interviewer: What did you have in your mind before going to America? What made you accept their invitation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I got a message from within. From the dawn of my life I have been praying and meditating. From within the message came that I should go and be of service to America. There are many people in the West who are searching for spiritual fulfilment. I had a visa to stay for only three months. Then I applied for a job at the Indian Consulate in New York and got a job there. I was so lucky. I did not have any formal education. I did not get a matriculation degree because there was no degree at the Ashram. I studied in Chittagong up to class seven, and then I came to Pondicherry. I was self-taught. When I applied for the job as a clerk, there were three graduates and two with Master's degrees who also applied. I was the only one who did not have any formal degree. But the Passport and Visa Section Consul gave me the job, so I was saved.</p>
<p>At the Indian Consulate, after three months they evaluate your work to see whether you are a good worker or not. If your work is not good, they dismiss you. But in my case, after only thirteen days, the Consul made me permanent. He is now a very close friend of mine. His name is L.L. Mehrotra. I worked at the Indian Consulate for two years.</p>
<p>In the meantime, many of my friends helped me considerably to meet seekers who wanted to know about spirituality, Indian philosophy and Indian religion. My colleagues and my bosses at the Indian Consulate were also very eager — not to get rid of me, but that I should enter into my own line, which is spirituality.</p>
<p>Then I got my green card so I could remain in America permanently. Over the years, people have come from various countries to meet with me.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> After giving talks on spirituality at various places, I was invited to open up centres where people come to pray and meditate and read my writings. Since I also happen to be a musician, I have offered many concerts all over the world. I have been offering meditations at the United Nations for twenty-nine years. Every Tuesday and Friday I have been going there between one and two o'clock to meditate in silence, and those who are interested in the spiritual life come to meditate with me. I have also given many talks at the United Nations. They have come out in a book called <em>The Garland of Nation-Souls.</em> My talks at various universities have also been published in books, such as <em>Beyond Within</em>, <em>Eastern Light for the Western Mind</em> and <em>The Inner Promise.</em> These are some of my major works. From these books people have come to know about me.</p>
<p>Our mission is like a plant, growing and growing and growing. The seed was sown when I came to America. Now from all over the world, seekers have come to me, and if get a chance, I go to visit their countries.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How will we get peace without prayer and meditation? There is no other way. Politicians talk about peace. Next moment they go and fight. So my way has nothing to do with politics, although many politicians are very kind and affectionate to me. When I meet with politicians of the highest order, we meditate together and try to bring about inner peace.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I inspire them to bring to the fore their own love of God. This is my main job. I do not teach them; I inspire them. When I offer peace concerts, thousands of people pray with me and meditate with me. I play different musical instruments and sing for about two hours. The peace-lovers who come to listen inspire me, and I inspire them. Everything is based on inspiration. If we are inspired, we will become good citizens of the world. If we are not inspired, then we will do all kinds of undivine things.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Twenty-eight nations have joined our peace-blossoms-family so far. Either the President or Prime Minister or some other very important government leaders have written me that they want to be part of this peace movement. Then I have gone to these places to inaugurate them. I have been to Malta, Nepal, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, to name a few.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My philosophy is the acceptance of life. Some people neglect the world; they enter into the Himalayan caves. I do not want that. I want people to pray and meditate to have a better world. I want to inspire people to become good citizens of the world. For that, we all have to pray and meditate, and we have to offer goodwill to each and every human being.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Interviewer: So you feel that peace is going to come about by offering goodwill to each and every human being?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Interviewer: So you feel that peace is going to come about by offering goodwill to each and every human being?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, that is the only way. If I offer goodwill to you, and if you offer goodwill to me, we shall not quarrel, we shall not fight. Because we do not offer goodwill to one another, this world is full of conflicts and misunderstandings. If we pray and meditate, we shall not misunderstand one another because prayer makes our mind pure. If we have purity inside our mind, inside our heart, then we are not going to quarrel, we are not going to fight. So that is my very simple philosophy. The main thing is the acceptance of life. Do not enter into the Himalayan caves. Do not neglect your duties on earth. You must perform your duties.</p>
<p>I live in America. My sister passed away recently, and I came here to see my brother. I could have said, "I am praying, I am meditating. I have thousands of disciples. I do not have to go to India." No, my duty is to come and be here with my brother, so I cancelled my activities. I was supposed to go to Norway, Sweden, Ireland and Poland, but I said, "No. Right now, my sister is dearest to me. Those things can be taken care of a few weeks later." In my case, duty is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>My philosophy is the acceptance of life. We have to accept life — not run away from life or enter into the Himalayan caves. Here on earth we have to offer goodwill, inspiration and aspiration. We have to love and serve mankind. Then only this world of ours can be transformed. There are many, many who are outwardly known as politicians, but inwardly they are most sincere truth-lovers and God-lovers. That is why they are my friends. We are sailing in the same boat.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Music is a universal language. I do not know Tamil, but when they play Tamil music, I appreciate it. I do not know German, but when I hear the music of Beethoven, Mozart and all the great classical musicians, their music appeals to me. Thousands and thousands of people who do not know Bengali enjoy Tagore's songs. Why is it that all over India Tagore's songs are on the radio? Does a Gujarati understand Bengali? Tagore's Bengali songs help people considerably. They have peace, poise and joy inside them. They inspire us.</p>

But what I wish to understand is how it helps your peace mission." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When people are happy, then they do not quarrel. Peace and joy go together. If I am really happy, then I shall remain peaceful. I shall not quarrel with you. I shall not fight with anybody. A saint is peaceful. He does not quarrel with anybody. He is only praying and meditating. When a singer is singing very soulfully, most hauntingly, do you think he has any kind of animosity inside him? No. People who are singing very soulfully and most hauntingly are inspiring us.</p>
<p>As I said before, our task is to inspire each other. Music, art and other things inspire people. When we enter into a garden, we see the beauty of the flowers. We smell the fragrance. Then we have joy inside. When we have joy inside, we are peaceful. If we do not have joy, then we will feel that the world is full of conflicts and misunderstanding. Spiritual music helps us considerably because it has joy in it. Real joy and peace are inseparable. If you are peaceful, you are happy, and if you are happy, you are peaceful.</p>

<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Do you think it is God's Gift?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely. If it were not God's Gift, how could I do so many things?</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do train. Every day I spend three hours exercising. One hour I spend doing stretching exercises. Then for two hours I lift heavy weights.</p>
<p>As I said, the acceptance of life in its various branches is my philosophy. Otherwise, I could not have done so many things. I entirely depend on God's Grace. Because of His Grace, I have been able to write so many songs and so many books, and to visit so many countries.</p>
