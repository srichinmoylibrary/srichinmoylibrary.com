<p>One of the secretaries in our section was Mrs. Carol Coutinhoe. Except me, is there anybody who did not get scoldings from her? She used to tell Dhanda: “Dhanda, do not forget that I am married! You should not speak to me so much!” My other colleagues also used to cut jokes with her and she would scold them and insult them mercilessly. But, in my case, she used to say, “Ghose is very nice. Ghose never cuts jokes with me.”</p>
<p>When I started going to the United Nations, Carol Coutinhoe’s husband was there. He used to work at the Permanent Mission. That was in 1971 or ’72.</p>

<p>Shivaram and I were serious type friends at the Consulate. Once we walked and walked after office hours talking about Sri Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and so many things. Whoever thought that someday Shivaram would become my disciple? Look at his divinity!</p>
<p>Shivaram has a younger brother, Ramachandran, who also worked at the Consulate. His brother was of a totally different type; he was always joking.</p>
<p>In 1987 I saw Ramachandran again at the Los Angeles airport. How much respect he showed me! I could not believe he was the same person. All credit goes to Shivaram; he has changed his brother’s attitude completely.</p>
<p>In 1990, Shivaram brought his mother and his brother to our tennis court and I lifted them. Another colleague from the Consulate, C. R. Seshu, also came at that time.</p>

<p>When I hear about people quarrelling and fighting at the office, I think that I was so lucky at the Indian Consulate. I did not have even one enemy. Everybody was so kind and affectionate. Everyone had a good heart.</p>
<p>One of my friends was the librarian, Mr. Master. Anything important in the newspaper he used to underline and tell me. When he was leaving the position, he wanted me to apply for his job. But in the meantime I got my green card, so I no longer had to work at the Consulate.</p>
<p>Then there was a Bengali called Anil Kumar Mukherjee. He was Assistant to the Consul. He was so nice to me. Now nobody knows where he is. He used to tell me, “I do not believe in religion. I do not believe in spirituality. I do not believe in yoga — no. But, Ghose, when you stand in front of me, everything changes.”</p>
<p>At the Consulate, we never used first names. We always called each other by our surname. It was our practice. I was always known as Ghose, never Chinmoy. Mr. Ramamoorthy was called Mr. Ramamoorthy, my section head was Mukherjee and so on. We knew the first names, but we did not care to use them.</p>

<p>Another colleague of mine was Acharya, a senior clerk. When his wife gave birth to a little girl, they had a name, but Acharya wanted me to choose a name. He asked me if I could give his child a name. I said, “I can give a name, but nobody will call her that.”</p>
<p>He said, “I am the father.”</p>
<p>So I gave the name Bela, meaning “Time: one who will go beyond time.”</p>
<p>Acharya said, “Ghose’s name is the best,” and they used the name I gave.</p>
<p>Many years later at a function in Manhattan, I lifted this former colleague. He asked me, “How is it that you are not asking me about my daughter? You gave her the name. It is your name and nobody else’s name, and you have totally forgotten?”</p>
<p>So he reminded me of his daughter, asking why I was not enquiring after her.</p>
<p>Then I asked our singers to sing my song “Bela chale jai,” and he was very happy.</p>
<p><em>[Note: On 21 April 1989, Sri Chinmoy and his disciples held a special function in Manhattan to observe the 25th anniversary of Sri Chinmoy’s arrival in the West. Sri Chinmoy lifted several special guests overhead with one arm to show his sincere gratitude to them. Mr. N. C. Acharya was one of those. Mr. Macwan, another colleague, also attended the function.]</em></p>

<p>In the beginning, I received a salary of $230 every month. Then it went a little higher — $10 more per year! Every Friday, at four o’clock, my boss used to allow me to bring refreshments for the nine or ten colleagues who worked in my section. I used to take mail to the post office in Bloomingdale’s. There was a bakery there and I used to buy one or two items for everyone.</p>

<p>There was a very nice black man who worked at Bloomingdale’s post office. He was the postal clerk. He was so kind to me. Sometimes I was late in coming from the Consulate with the mail and he used to wait for me. He used to tell me, “You are such a nice guy. Our priest would love you. I have to take you to our church.” How many times he begged me to come! I promised and promised, but I did not go with him.</p>
<p>Wherever I went in those days, people tried to convert me.</p>

<p>One day the black man at Bloomingdale’s post office was asking me to take a vitamin pill. I used to say vitamin with a short “i”. He was saying vitamin with a long “i” and I could not understand him at all. Then, all of a sudden, I realised what he was saying. “You mean vitamin!” I said, using my own pronunciation.</p>

<p>Those were the poverty-stricken days! On three or four occasions, at night, I went to Bloomingdale’s to try to get extra work carrying heavy boxes and unloading the delivery trucks. At first they would not give me a job because they thought I was not strong enough. Then they said to me, “You are strong, but you need a social security number before we can hire you.”</p>
<p>Poor me! If you work at the Indian Consulate, you do not get a social security number because the Indian Government takes responsibility for you. And I did not have a green card either. So I could not get work at Bloomingdale’s. I could not become a porter to carry boxes from one place to another just so that I could earn a little extra money. O God, O God!</p>

<p>Mr. Ramamoorthy did not join us. But Mr. Ramamoorthy used to invite us to his place to eat. Poor Mr. Ramamoorthy! Now nobody knows that he is an excellent cook, but I have eaten at his apartment many times. How can I ever forget his dal?

  <h2 id="page-title">A letter to the Consul General</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A letter to the Consul General" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day I got a call to go and see the Consul General, S. K. Roy, immediately. “What have I done wrong?” I asked myself.</p>
<p>I went there and the Consul General said, “Ghose, sit down.” He was looking at me very compassionately. Then he said, “A letter has come from the Sri Aurobindo Ashram against you, saying how useless you are. It is asking why I have given you a job, saying you will bring disgrace to the Indian Consulate. All kinds of things they have written. They want me to dismiss you.”</p>
<p>Here I was, poverty-stricken, helpless — and I was on the verge of losing my job. I was earning only $230 a month and out of that, sixty or seventy dollars used to go for rent. I had a tiny room in an apartment with two other workers. The length of the room was only one foot longer than my height. Sometimes I would get hurt if my feet came down the wrong way. When I remember my poverty, I shed tears.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of the blue, the Consul General asked me a question. “By the way, Ghose,” he said, “do you know Dilip-da?”</p>
<p>I was surprised. I said, “Sir, do you mean Dilip Kumar Roy?” Dilip Roy was a very great singer who was extremely close to Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p>The Consul General said, “Yes.”</p>
<p>I said, “I know Dilip-da so well. How much affection he has for me! At the Ashram, he was always very kind to me. I can tell you so many stories about him.”</p>
<p>The Consul General said, “Tell me.”</p>
<p>I started. When I was only thirteen years old, I wrote two hundred poems. In this connection, how much affection he showed me. He read the poems and made suggestions. A few years later, I wrote an article about him in Bengali. It was about forty pages and he was so moved. The name of this article was “Amader Dilip-da.” Recently, I sent him an article about his father, D. L. Roy, the immortal poet and playwright, that I had written in English, and he has corrected it. He sent me a letter highly appreciating the article. He has also sent me a message: “No matter how much you suffer, never, never go back to the Ashram. People will say that you have gone to the dogs, but never go back.”</p>
<p>Then the Consul General said, “I am a personal friend of Dilip-da and I know why Dilip-da left and opened up a centre in Poona. If Dilip-da likes you, the matter is finished.”</p>
<p>Then, in front of me, he tore the letter into pieces and threw it away. He did not even show it to me. Can you imagine! The magic touch of Dilip-da saved me. My best credential was his affection for me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">I come from Chittagong</h2><span property="dc:title" content="I come from Chittagong" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Our Indian Ambassador to the United Nations at that time was B. N. Chakravarty. His offices were also in India House. One of my colleagues said to me, “He is a Bengali. Go and chat with him.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, he is such a big shot,” I said.</p>
<p>Then one day I saw that he was reading a newspaper in the park, so I went there and stood in front of him.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I have just come to get your blessings,” I replied.</p>
<p>“Fine. Come, come. What is your name?”</p>
<p>I told him my name.</p>
<p>“Where do you come from?”</p>
<p>When I said, “Chittagong,” he burst out, “Chittagong! I hate Chittagong! My mother died in Chittagong, in your hospital. I will never forgive Chittagong.”</p>
<p>That was enough. My conversation with him ended there.</p>
<p>After six or seven months, it was time for his farewell. I forgave him or he forgave me, God knows. Anyway, I composed a poem on him in Bengali. I was asked to read it out at his farewell party. When he heard it, he melted. He placed his hand on my shoulder and we talked in Bengali. His wife also melted. At that time there was no Chittagong.</p>
<p>Then he told me one of his personal experiences. One day he was walking by Pandit Nehru’s side. He wanted to ask Nehru a question, but Nehru’s personality was so great that he did not dare to ask his question. He could not even bring himself to speak to Nehru. Then he looked at me and said, “People are all afraid of me but, you see, this is what happened to me when I was with Nehru.” And he was very well educated, a member of the Indian Civil Service.</p>

<p>The divine Sher Singh was our gatekeeper, or you can say security guard, at India House. He had a harmonium. One day he said to me, “Do you play the harmonium?” He wanted to sell it to me for six dollars.</p>
<p>I said, “Please take twenty-five dollars!”</p>
<p>He said, “No, no. You are poor.”</p>
<p>Then I said, “My lucky number is seven. Let me buy it for seven.”</p>
<p>So he took my seven dollars and gave me back one dollar. I do not know why. Then he gave me the harmonium and I was so delighted and inspired. I used it for many, many years. His harmonium is immortal. It was my first and foremost harmonium. His name was written in Hindi on the front of the instrument.</p>
<p><em>Sher Singh:</em></p>
<p><em>If my recollection is not failing me, I was the first person at the Consulate to meet Chinmoy Ghose on the day that he came to apply for a post. I was relieving the receptionist, Mehru, during the lunchtime. A young Indian man came in and, as a security guard, I asked him, “What is your name?” He said, “Chinmoy Ghose.” Then I asked, “May I help you?” He sat down by the reception desk and told me his story. He said that he wanted to stay in New York but, in order to stay here, he needed a job to help himself.</em> <em>After learning that his intention was to stay in New York, I told him that the only person who could help him was Sunil Kumar Roy, our Consul General. Somehow, Ghose got in touch with the Passport and Visa Consul, Mr. Mehrotra, and within a week or so he started working in Mr. Ramamoorthy’s department.</em> <em>Since Mr. Mehrotra had to ask S. K. Roy for approval, I believe that S. K. Roy created the job for Ghose. In this world I do not have much, but I do have a little bit of memory—which has not failed me yet!</em></p>
<p><em>Sher Singh:</em></p>
<p><em>One of Mr. Mehrotra’s secretaries had to go back to India, so I bought a harmonium from him to occupy my leisure time and to learn some music. Somehow Ghose came to learn that I had a harmonium. In those days I used to live at the Consulate in the basement, which was the security quarters. I knew that he wanted a harmonium and so one day I brought it to him and said, “Ghose, here it is!” He paid me seven dollars for it.</em> <em>Once I went to a meeting that he was holding on 86th Street. That was the first time I saw him playing the harmonium.</em></p>
<p><em>Sher Singh:</em></p>
<p><em>Often I used to see Ghose eating his lunch inside the telephone booth. He kept the door closed. When I passed by, I would knock on the door from outside by way of joke.</em></p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My first musical performance</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My first musical performance" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In June 1965, the Asia Society wanted someone to set tune to and sing three songs. They were poems by ancient Bengali poets. The Consulate gave me the job, and they told me a week before the performance. Whether I was happy or unhappy, God knows.</p>
<p>That week I practised those three songs on Sher Singh’s harmonium at least forty times. Before the actual performance, during my lunch hour, I had to go to the Asia Society and sing before the Society’s leaders. They were very satisfied. They gave me $30 and a beautiful letter of appreciation.</p>
<p>When I went to perform the songs at the Guggenheim Museum, there were quite a few people and they appreciated my singing.</p>
<p>I was there an hour ahead of time. I was looking at the street light by the gate and whom did I see? Lord Krishna! It was not my mental hallucination. He was dancing before me because all the songs were dedicated to Krishna and Radha.</p>

<p>One day Sher Singh begged me to go with him to Mr. Mehrotra’s office. So I went with him. When we got to the room, he said, “Please stand at the door.” Then he entered into the room and sat on Mr. Mehrotra’s chair. He was so relaxed. He placed one of his legs on the desk and then he started giving orders to me. He became the Consul. At the same time, he was saying, “Please guard the door carefully. Otherwise, if Mr. Mehrotra comes…!”</p>
<p>When he begged me to go with him, I did not know that he was going to do that kind of thing. I thought it was for some purpose. O God! And he was just a guard at the Consulate!</p>
<p>I told the story to Mr. Mehrotra in 1989 when I went to eat at his residence in Sri Lanka. Mr. Mehrotra was then the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka. I said, “This is what Sher Singh and I did.” Mr. Mehrotra was deeply amused.</p>
