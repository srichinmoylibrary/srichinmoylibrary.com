<p>In the small bus that takes everyone to the airplane, a seven or eight-year-old boy in the group was smoking.</p>
<p>There was a Punjabi on the bus, a Sikh. He had a beard and a turban, and he looked like a saint. He said to the boy, "Did you get your father's permission to smoke?"</p>
<p>The little boy said, "Does my father take my permission to smoke?"</p>
<p>So the elderly man kept quiet. The boy was so smart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Best Restaurant In Canberra</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Best Restaurant In Canberra" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I was in the Delhi airport before leaving India, a lady near me at the counter was very angry. She was screaming, "I have a first class ticket! How is it that I have to sit in the economy section?"</p>
<p>The man behind the counter was telling her that they would refund the difference between the first class fare and the economy fare. But she was so furious, she looked like she was about to strike him.</p>
<p>O God, then they announced that on this flight there were no assigned seats; you could sit anywhere you wanted to. When one man in the airport heard this, he said, "Now the real trouble starts!" But I was very happy because I thought I would be able to get a seat on the aisle.</p>
<p>I was a little bit late getting onto the plane, so most of the aisle seats were occupied. I was looking and looking for a place, but everywhere there were people. Then I saw the same lady who had been screaming about her first class ticket. She was sitting by the window, and beside her were two empty seats. I wanted to be on the aisle, so I asked her permission to sit there.</p>
<p>She said, "I bought a first class ticket, but at the check-in they told me I wouldn't be able to sit in first class."</p>
<p>Then she looked at me and asked, "Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>I said, "India!"</p>
<p>She said, "You don't look like an Indian."</p>
<p>Then I asked, "Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>She answered, "I come from Canberra. Do you know where that is?"</p>
<p>I said, "I was there only two weeks ago."</p>
<p>She said, "You were there? Where is Canberra?"</p>
<p>I answered, "It is Australia's capital. I gave a performance in the School of Music. Some of my friends performed and I also played there."</p>
<p>The strange thing is that I never carry any pamphlets saying who I am. I can't prove anything, and others simply remain silent and unbelieving. What can you tell them?</p>
<p>She asked, "Why did you go to Australia?"</p>
<p>I said, "I have some friends there. The other reason was to see kangaroos."</p>
<p>Then the story started. I said, "I have a few friends who run a vegetarian restaurant."</p>
<p>At first I forgot its name, and then I remembered it is called 'Oneness-Home'. I told her the name of the restaurant and said, "The food is most delicious. My friend's wife told me that it is the best restaurant in Canberra."</p>
<p>The lady again started to get mad. She said, "My husband and I have a restaurant, and <em>he</em> is the best cook in Canberra." She was really excited, and she stood up, as if I had said something very upsetting.</p>
<p>So immediately I invoked the goddess of sleep, and then everything was over. I didn't look at her again and I didn't speak to her.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Seat Mate</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Seat Mate" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>After fifteen minutes I was blessed by a hostile force. A little girl about seven or eight years old came and sat between the Australian lady and me.</p>
<p>Then the girl said to me, "My little sister Sona is sitting over there. Could you let my sister sit here?"</p>
<p>Her sister was not sitting in an aisle seat. For me to go and sit between two people for eight to ten hours was too much. O God! I said, "No, I am very sorry, but I need to be on the aisle. I am an old man."</p>
<p>She said, "She is my sister, my little sister."</p>
<p>Again I pretended I was going to sleep. Then she started leaning on me to talk to her sister across the aisle. And that was not enough. Every ten or fifteen minutes she would say to me, "Please let me go out."</p>
<p>From Delhi to Bangkok, at least twenty times she had to go out — not only to go to the bathroom but also to speak to Sona. She would come out of her seat and stand talking to her sister. She said she was not able to hear from her seat.</p>
<p>Throughout the flight, how she disturbed me! She kept standing in front of me, talking and talking to her sister. At one time she was telling her sister to eat with her hands. She said, "Nobody is watching you, so you don't have to be embarrassed." Sometimes, the two of them were arguing and screaming.</p>
<p>First I had the problem with the Australian lady, and then I had a problem with the two sisters. In this way my whole trip was ruined.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Thrown Out Of My Seat</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Thrown Out Of My Seat" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In Bangkok we had a fifteen-minute stopover. The man in the Delhi airport who said that there would be problems because we didn't get assigned seats was right. If you don't have assigned seats, you are out, out, out!</p>
<p>I was sitting in seat 27C. I left my seat for a few minutes at Bangkok. When I came back, a lady was sitting in it. She said, "This is my seat." Her boarding pass said seat 27C. In Bangkok they gave out seat numbers, but in Delhi they hadn't. So I was thrown out of my seat.</p>
<p>I found another seat. In three minutes a man came and said it was his seat. I went to speak to the steward. He said, "I know in Delhi they didn't give out seat numbers. You sit here."</p>
<p>I had to sit in a middle seat between two people, and I suffered for so many hours.</p>
<p>When I travel alone, the forces very nicely attack me.</p>
<p>The Australian lady also left her seat at Bangkok, and I never saw her again. God knows what happened to her. Perhaps she also had the same problem that I did with the seat numbers.</p>

<p>There were also two groups of children on the plane — one group of 40 children and one of 60. They were so bad, especially the boys. The two teachers who were bringing them from Bangkok kept begging them to behave.</p>
