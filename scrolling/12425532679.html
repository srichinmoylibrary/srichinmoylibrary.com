  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I know when I should be in your physical presence and when I should be manifesting you? I am not sure if the answer will be personal or if it will apply to all the disciples.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I know when I should be in your physical presence and when I should be manifesting you? I am not sure if the answer will be personal or if it will apply to all the disciples." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I was a child, we used to have quite a few cows. Among them, two were very famous. One was Nandini and the other was Surabhi. Nandini was very mild, but Surabhi was very dynamic. Here is the difference between the physical presence of the Master and his spiritual presence. If you pull the tail of a cow, will you get milk? If you pull a leg of the cow, or the horn, will you get milk? No. The place where you get milk from the cow is called the udder. When you milk the cow, that is the place where the milk comes from. All the parts belong to the same cow, but there is a special place where you will get milk. Again, if the other parts did not exist, then it would not be a cow. If all the limbs were not present, it would not be a cow.</p>
<p>Some spiritual Masters say that when you are in the physical presence of a spiritual Master, it is like the udder, where the milk comes from. That is the goal: to get milk. Some spiritual Masters say this, and it is absolutely true. Again, some spiritual Masters are of a different opinion. They say that familiarity breeds contempt. If you mix too much with the Master, then you see only the human side of the Master, not the divine side. If that is the case, then in a sense I was lucky that I saw my Guru, Sri Aurobindo, only four times a year — four times a year, each time for just a few seconds. The Mother Divine I saw every day, a minimum of three times and sometimes four times.</p>
<p>If you have to stand in front of your Master four times a day, you must be careful. Once only if you go before him, then you may think that afterwards you can relax; but three more times at three different hours if you have to stand before your Master, imagine how careful you have to be! Once a day if you stand before me, then the rest of the time is all yours. For the entire day you can enjoy yourself. But after two hours if you have to return, then you must behave well and keep your consciousness high.</p>
<p>There is both an advantage and a disadvantage to being in the Master’s presence, but some people are very fortunate. The more they can stay in the physical presence of the Master, the more they are able take him very, very seriously, very seriously. They do not believe that familiarity breeds contempt. The more they can stay in his presence, the more benefit they receive.</p>
<p>There is a term in Sanskrit called <em>satsang</em>. It means the company of spiritual people. Have you ever been in the company of saints? Perhaps you have read Sri Aurobindo’s immortal story, “The Ideal of Forgiveness.” King Vishwamitra came to kill the saint Vashishtha. He had already killed the one hundred children of Vashishtha, and he wanted to kill Vashishtha also on that day — all because Vashishtha would not declare that Vishwamitra had realised God. Only for a few minutes he was in the physical presence of Vashishtha, and then he was transformed by Vashishtha’s love and forgiveness.</p>
<p>If you are with spiritual people, what happens? In America we do not give that much value to spiritual company. In India, specially in Indian spiritual communities, they give so much attention to the physical presence of the Master. In New York, Saturday night is our “comedy and tragedy” night, when disciples dramatise my spiritual stories. I am here with you; you are in my presence. In my case, at times I really enjoy the performances of so many groups. I bring down only innocent joy, and the performers are also giving joy. This world needs joy — pure, innocent joy. When some people perform, that innocence disappears; but most of the time there is joy, innocent joy, and that helps us. From innocent joy we can make tremendous progress.</p>
<p>I am coming back to the point. Advantage is there and disadvantage is there; but if you are wise, the more time you can spend in front of the Master, the better. You can make very fast progress in the physical presence of your Master. If you are unwise, you can take your own time.</p>
<p>Look at this chair. I sit on this chair. I have been sitting on it for years and years and years. I do not think this chair will realise God before you. No — never, never, never! The soul of this chair has to take human incarnation. Now it is in the tree-consciousness, or the wood-consciousness. It has to come to the human consciousness, and from there it has to make progress, progress, progress. Then only will it realise God. I have been using it for so many hours, for years and years. This chair has a soul, but the consciousness is very, very low, or we can say that it has no consciousness.</p>
<p>The physical presence of the Master can be of tremendous help provided the disciple takes it soulfully and prayerfully. Otherwise, it can be detrimental. While I am talking, your outer mind will say, “Guru is talking. He is not meditating." Again, your heart will say, if it is aspiring, “Guru can do many things at once.” In the morning I drive. I look this side, I look behind, I look that side. I am doing so many things at once while I am driving. I am putting so much concentration, here, there and all around. Here, when I am chatting and getting massaged by our doctors, people may say, "Comfort, comfort, comfort! Nobody is massaging my feet. All the time they are massaging Guru’s feet.”</p>
<p>Many spiritual Masters have had the same habit. Sri Ramakrishna used to have two disciples massaging him while he and his disciples were all chatting. Sometimes he had three. In my case, on very rare occasions I have three doctors to massage me. In so many ways the disciples can misunderstand the Master’s physical presence if they use their mind. But if they use their heart, it is all oneness, oneness. They will say, “Whatever the Master is doing is for our good, for our good. He has attained to a certain height — the high, higher, highest height. There he is not affected by the so-called outer comfort. At every moment the Master can go very, very high.”</p>
<p>The problem arises if the disciples use the mind. If they use the mind, they may think that everything the Master is doing is wrong. If they use the heart, they will feel that everything the Master is doing is good. So, use the heart all the time! If you use the mind, you may think that everything I am saying and doing is all wrong. If you use the heart, you will say that everything is right, right, right.</p>
<p>Just from the physical presence of a cow, you will not get milk. But when the Master is in the physical, it is like you are getting the milk immediately. If you say, “Supreme, Supreme, Supreme,” God alone knows where the Supreme is: is He this side, or that side? Where, where, where is He? But if you say, “Guru, Guru, Guru,” immediately you are entering into me. You have seen me thousands of times, and there is my Transcendental Photograph. Alas, we do not have a picture of the Supreme in His Highest. We do not have it, and we will never have it. When I see Him, at that time I have no camera with me. My third eye is the camera!</p>
<p>In Woodstock, I had many times the experience of the Supreme as the highest, most beautiful, absolutely golden Being. Once my dearest sponsor, Anne Harrison, was driving, and I saw in the street a most golden form. The Supreme can take any form. A childish desire entered into me. I said, “How I wish I had a camera with me!” I did not have a camera, but the desire to take a picture entered into me. Perhaps it would not have come out, because this experience took place in the subtle world, not in the physical world. We cannot or we may not capture the experience from the subtle world on the physical plane. But again, we can imagine, imagine, imagine Somebody who is most beautiful, infinitely more beautiful than any human child. Imagination has its own reality.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, there is an advantage and there is a disadvantage to being in the Master’s physical presence. If you are wise, you will always avail yourself of the advantage.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: My question is about work. Can one make equally fast spiritual progress if one is working outside of our Divine Enterprises?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: My question is about work. Can one make equally fast spiritual progress if one is working outside of our Divine Enterprises?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to be the judge. If you are in the company of your spiritual brothers and sisters, you all have the same spiritual Master. If people who are working at the Divine Enterprises are really spiritual, if they are only thinking of me, thinking of me and pleasing me, it is easier. If four or five disciples are working at the same place, and if they are good disciples, their consciousness or their concentration is all the time around me. They will say to each other, “Tomorrow is Saturday. I am dying for Saturday to come so that I can go to New York.” They will all be trying to find out what is happening in New York and what I am doing. They have an advantage because their goal is the same.</p>
<p>If you work outside the Divine Enterprises, your colleagues have nothing to do with your spiritual life, absolutely nothing. Your destination is your Guru, and their destination is somewhere else, so it may be difficult, very difficult for you. That is why I encourage the disciples to work at our Divine Enterprises. There are many disciples who work in Divine Enterprises. They may not get as high a salary as they could get elsewhere — I know that. But in one place several workers are thinking of the same goal, whereas at another place, you are the only one who is on our path, so it may be very difficult. Who will be there to help you? And whom are you going to help? There is a great advantage for those who work in a Divine Enterprise.</p>
<p>Again, if you are very spiritual, who cares whether others are spiritual or not? But you have to have tremendous concentration and will-power. Let others think of their own life; you will think of your spiritual life. It is very difficult, but not impossible, not impossible, not impossible. Nothing is impossible — it is only difficult. In a Divine Enterprise it is easy, because all the workers are in the same spiritual boat. But in your case you have to be extremely strong in your heart, in your mind and in your life to maintain the height of your spiritual life.</p>
<p>Again, it is difficult, but not impossible. Look at this boy! He is a doctor. Where is his country, and where is New York? While he is working, his mind and his heart are all the time for me. His consciousness and his concentration are here, with me. In how many ways he serves our humanitarian programme, The Oneness-Heart-Tears and Smiles! In the doctors’ profession, they are dealing with life and death every second. Their business is life and death. In spite of doing something very serious, he is always thinking of me and how to please me, how to please me. He is one example. We also have a professor who comes to New York so often. While he is teaching, his mind and heart are here, with me.</p>
<p>The mother is working someplace, let us say, and the child, the little baby, is at home. The mother is working, but her heart is in her house, in her home, in her baby’s room. That little child is the mother’s goal and her God — nobody else. With her mind the mother is working at her office, but her heart is in the tiny room where her baby is staying.</p>
<p>It is difficult, difficult, I must say, to maintain your spiritual height while working outside our Divine Enterprises; but it is not impossible. Nothing is impossible. Definitely it is difficult if your colleagues are not spiritual and they are not in the same spiritual boat — very difficult, but not impossible.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Jesus Christ was a direct descendant of God. For him, everything was destined.</p>
<p>Perhaps an ordinary person cannot get up because of his lethargy. If he gets one year more to live on earth, then the next day he may be inspired to get up early in the morning to pray and meditate. If ordinary people, or seekers, stay on earth for a longer time, then they get the opportunity to pray and meditate. But in the case of God-realised souls, it is all destined. Whatever God wanted to do in and through them was all destined. Jesus Christ lived for thirty-three years; Swami Vivekananda, for thirty-nine years; Sri Ramakrishna, for fifty years; Sri Aurobindo, seventy-eight years; and the Mother of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, ninety-five years.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Once you were joking that you gave a disciple bad advice. How could an Avatar do something that is not right?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Once you were joking that you gave a disciple bad advice. How could an Avatar do something that is not right?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Avatars come into the world. They cannot drink divine nectar all the time. I think I have enjoyed nectar, whereas my disciples have not. In the absence of nectar, I have to enjoy drinking juice. Ordinary human beings like juice, and Avatars also enjoy juice. In this case, “juice” means “jokes.” All spiritual Masters like to cut jokes!</p>
<p>One cannot be serious twenty-four hours a day. If a spiritual Master is serious twenty-four hours a day, nobody will go near him. Nobody will be able to go near him because he is in another world. Sometimes, all of a sudden, I become very serious. At that time I become unfathomable for you. But when I look at you and cut jokes, then you feel that I am alive.</p>
<p>My advice is never to compare my life with your life. I am not boasting. My life was like your life many, many hundreds and hundreds of years ago. I have a human body, but I am something totally different, totally different. My soul, my heart, my physical body, my life is God-made, God-moulded, God-shaped. It is totally different from other human beings.</p>
<p>A spiritual Master’s outer life people may judge, but there is no difference between his inner life and his outer life. In your case, they are totally different: your outer life is one thing, and your inner life is something else. In my case there is no difference between my inner life and my outer life. While I am speaking seriously or sternly to someone, I do not lose an iota of my divinity, I tell you. But if you scold someone, you go down, down the hill. This is the difference.</p>
<p>Never be discouraged with the spiritual life! I am begging you never to give up hope. Bring to the fore your promise, the promise that you made when you joined the path, the promise that you would make fast, faster progress to realise God. That should be your goal. Again rekindle the flame of aspiration inside you. Never give up, no matter what your present standard is.</p>
<p>There were some spiritual Masters of the highest calibre who, for one month or six months, could not meditate. They openly told their disciples, in order to encourage them, “I myself was not able to meditate for quite a few months.” Again, some spiritual Masters, out of sheer compassion, told lies to console their disciples; but some said, in all sincerity, “I myself have gone through that desert-life, with no aspiration, no inspiration.” Never give up, never! If you have descended, so what? If you climbed up the tree and now you have descended, again you have the capacity to climb up to the top of the tree and stay at the top.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: In a book about Sri Aurobindo, the Mother spoke about the descent of the overmind, and I was wondering if you could explain that.</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><sup> , </sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Question: In a book about Sri Aurobindo, the Mother spoke about the descent of the overmind, and I was wondering if you could explain that." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In 1926 Sri Aurobindo declared his God-realisation. At that time Lord Krishna descended into him permanently. Before that, Sri Krishna used to come and go, come and go. Sri Aurobindo was in the Alipore jail for one year. There Sri Krishna used to come and see him. In the Alipore jail, Sri Aurobindo would look at the wall, look at the bad people, look at everything and see that it was all Krishna, Krishna, Krishna. But Sri Krishna was coming and going. Finally he entered into Sri Aurobindo permanently. We heard that Lord Krishna brought the overmind. There are so many layers of the mind!</p>
<p>The overmind-consciousness descended into Sri Aurobindo and also the Krishna-consciousness. Lord Krishna promised to Sri Aurobindo that he would be inside Sri Aurobindo permanently. That was Sri Aurobindo’s God-realisation. Swami Vivekananda came to Sri Aurobindo in the inner world for two weeks continuously while he was in jail to tell him that there is another plane of consciousness higher than the overmind: the supermind. He said, “You must bring it down, you must bring it down.” Sri Aurobindo got this message from Swami Vivekananda.</p>
<p>When Sri Aurobindo left the body, for two and a half days the supramental consciousness descended as a most beautiful light. There was no electric light there; it was the supramental consciousness. After two and a half days, the Mother said that the earth-consciousness was not ready to receive the supramental light. On the 5th of December Sri Aurobindo left the body; by the 9th the light was completely gone.</p>
<p>I was brought up in the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Around 1956, the supramental light was descending. I was an athlete, a first-class athlete. Once, after running 400 metres, I was all ready to die. I was lying down on a mat, and I saw that supramental light descending. On the highest plane it is golden, but when it descends, the supramental light becomes reddish. The Mother said that only three or four persons saw the supramental light the first day, when it started descending.</p>
<p>There is the overmind, the supermind, and what I call the intuitive mind. There are all kinds of minds. Before the level of the overmind there are quite a few minds. After the overmind comes the supermind. For you it is not necessary to know what the overmind is doing or what the supermind is doing.</p>
<p>When one deals with the overmind, the ordinary mind is still operating. But when it is a matter of the supermind, the supramental consciousness, at that time one far transcends the mind-consciousness. It is totally different. There is a big jump, a big leap between the overmind and the supermind. Before that, from the ordinary mind it goes in tiny, tiny steps. Between the overmind and the supermind is a very, very long step. I am telling you this from my own experience and realisation. Very few people on earth have had glimpses of the supermind.</p>
<p>One evening Sri Ramakrishna said to five or six very, very close disciples of his, “Please do not tell anybody: I am God." In all sincerity and seriousness he said, “I am God, I am God. Please do not tell anybody.” He was not cutting jokes. In Sri Ramakrishna’s case, most seriously he told his very dear disciples, “You know, I am God.” This moment Swami Vivekananda believed his Master, and the next moment he did not believe. At the eleventh hour of his life, Sri Ramakrishna said, “He who is Rama, he who is Krishna, in one form is Ramakrishna.” Lord Rama is an Avatar, and Sri Krishna is an Avatar. “Avatar” means direct descendant of God. Sri Ramakrishna declared himself to be a direct descendant of God.</p>
<p>In my poem “Revelation” I wrote, “The Supreme and I are one; all we outlast.”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I wrote that poem when I was quite young. In “Immortality” I wrote, “In birth-chains now shines Immortality.”<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I had the realisation long before, but at the age of twenty-three or twenty-four, in my poems I declared it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When your feet first touched the soil of America, was there any inner experience that you could share with us?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When your feet first touched the soil of America, was there any inner experience that you could share with us?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only one thing I can say. When I stepped onto the soil of America, joy and bewilderment, joy and bewilderment in measureless measure I felt.</p>
<p>The same thing I can say about Switzerland. Years later, when I first stepped onto the soil of Switzerland, I knew nothing about Switzerland. I only knew that Indians who suffered from cancer and other ailments came to Switzerland. That much I knew. I said to myself, “This is my land, this is my land, this is my land — Switzerland! This will be the land of my manifestation.” Then Kailash came. Now look at Switzerland, Germany and Madal Bal! This was my experience in Switzerland that evening. I was so delighted, so excited.</p>
<p>Both joy and fear I felt while walking on the street in New York — tremendous joy, and fear also. Such huge, huge human beings! I could not understand their language, although they were speaking English.</p>
<p>I had a friend who was so kind to me. He was from Brooklyn. His name was John Kelley. Alas, I could not understand anything he was saying. His accent was too much for me! Even now, Brooklyn pronunciation still puzzles me. Queens and Bronx pronunciation I understand, but in Brooklyn, their English is totally different.</p>
<p>I used to type 60, 65 or more words per minute in India. Then, for months I did not practise. A score of 33 was needed for the Indian Consulate, and I got less than 33. John Kelley was so kind, so kind, so kind. When he heard that I needed to practise typewriting, he immediately took me to get a typewriter. At the Ashram I used a Corona that had belonged to President Wilson’s daughter Margaret, whose spiritual name was Nishtha. Then Nolini gave it to me. Here in New York, John Kelley immediately got me a typewriter. I practised a little, and right away I went over 33 words per minute.</p>
<p>That night Mr. Mehrotra’s secretary, who was from the West Indies, phoned me up and said, “Ghose, tomorrow morning come and see Mr. Mehrotra at nine o’clock.”</p>
<p>The next morning Mr. Mehrotra said, “We shall take care of you.”</p>
<p>My friend John Kelley wanted me to study at the New School. Many years later I went to the New School to give a talk. I said to myself, “My friend wanted me to study at this place, and now I have come here to speak.”</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Life-awakening experiences</h2>

<p>Many years ago there was a disciple in our Centre whose son had been, in his immediate past incarnation, a very, very devoted disciple of Sri Ramakrishna. He did not realise God, but he was a most, most devoted direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna. From Calcutta this disciple went to Madras, and to Mylapore. It was at the Sri Ramakrishna Ashram in Mylapore that I had an experience with Sarada Devi in 1964.</p>
<p>I went to Mylapore to collect a “P-form," a kind of visa that cost eight dollars. I needed it in case my sponsors did not come to the airport in New York to pick me up. For more than two weeks I stayed in Madras, but I was not getting the form. Every day I went to a big government office building, but there was no P-form.</p>
<p>One evening I went to the Sri Ramakrishna Ashram. I walked two and a half or three miles from the hotel where I was staying. There were huge pictures of Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda and Sarada Devi at the ashram. I stood in front of Sarada Devi’s picture with tearful eyes. I said, “Mother, I am waiting here, but I am not getting my P-form.”</p>
<p>Sarada Devi said to me, “Go there tomorrow. Go at eleven o’clock.”</p>
<p>I said, “Mother, Mother, tomorrow is Saturday.”</p>
<p>Again she said, “Go.”</p>
<p>All the doubts of the whole world entered into me! Again, I said to myself, “Sarada Devi is a God-realised soul. How can she be mistaken?” I was torn between doubt and faith. My life-boat was plying between doubt and faith, doubt and faith. On Saturday would such a huge government office give me my form? Impossible!</p>
<p>Again Sarada Devi said, “Go!”</p>
<p>The next day I did go there. It was a huge building, with many steps. I did not walk. I did not know how to walk in those days — I only knew how to run! I climbed up the steps very fast.</p>
<p>When I came to the last step, a thin, dark-skinned young girl opened up the door and said, “Mr. Ghose?”</p>
<p>I said, “Yes."</p>
<p>She gave me my passport and the P-form. Then she bolted the door and disappeared. God knows where she went! This is what happened in my life.</p>
<p>That night I entered into my highest meditation. When I enter into my highest meditation, I know everything. When we do not enter into meditation, we are like absolute beggars. This side is doubt, that side is faith; we do not know what to do. In my meditation I saw that this girl was a disciple of the Sri Ramakrishna Ashram and a devotee of Sarada Devi. She went to that temple. Mother Sarada Devi had appeared before her and told her to give me the passport and the P-form. Otherwise, how would she have opened the door for me at eleven o’clock on a Saturday? This story is one hundred per cent true.</p>
<p>We all struggle with doubt. Why do we have to struggle? Let us have implicit faith. I am your spiritual Master. If I tell you to go and get a form from the immigration office on a Saturday, then go! Outwardly it may seem absurd. This experience of mine seemed like the height of absurdity. Like that, many other so-called absurd things have happened in my life.</p>
<p>In Pondicherry, just before that, I had another experience. I needed police clearance to get my passport. The Ashram manager only had to say that I had behaved well. He was so fond of me! But the Mother of the Ashram did not want me to leave. For more than a month I waited. The manager was really so fond of me, but the Mother did not want to give me permission, so I could not leave Pondicherry. I begged him. He said, “What can I do?”</p>
<p>Then I went to my dearest friend’s place. The whole family was so devoted to me — not only loving, but absolutely devoted. At around midnight I was chatting with them. One of the family members was in the habit of smoking and drinking. In the Ashram, smoking and drinking were forbidden, but he did not believe in those rules. That fellow died young, at the age of twenty-eight. He was very fond of me, and I was very fond of him. In that big family, he was the only one who used to drink and smoke. I was in their kitchen, chatting with the whole family. This fellow placed his hands on my shoulders. He was heavily drunk — I could smell it. He said, “Chinmoy-da, why are you so sad? What is wrong with you?"</p>
<p>I was sad. I said, “What am I going to do? I cannot leave the Ashram, because the Mother is not allowing me. She will not permit me to get the police clearance. She will not allow the manager to tell the police that I have behaved well.”</p>
<p>He said, “Do not worry! I am now going to the head of the police."</p>
<p>I replied, “What are you saying?”</p>
<p>He said, “Just now we were drinking together, so I will go to his place.” How could I believe him?</p>
<p>He went to the police chief's place on his motorbike. Such a noise it made! In five minutes he came back again. The motorbike was victorious! My friend said, “Tomorrow the police chief will sign the clearance form for you."</p>
<p>I said, “He does not know who I am!”</p>
<p>My friend said, “That is not necessary. Tomorrow morning you can go to the police station. He has promised.”</p>
<p>I said to myself, “My friend is drunk, and his friend is perhaps more drunk.</p>
<p>I am caught in between two drunkards!" Again, I had such love for this fellow.</p>
<p>The next day I went to the police station, and immediately they gave me the form. Who had signed it? The head of the police department.</p>
<p>Then I went to show the form to the manager. He asked how it was done, and I told him. This happened just before I went to Madras.</p>
<p>You have seen a photograph of me in Pondicherry where I am wearing a hat. My head is cleanly shaved. That young man was the photographer. He took that particular picture about two months prior to my departure for America. He had a very good heart. His name was Gopal — Lord Krishna. Alas, he died at the age of twenty-eight.</p>
<p>Two miracles! Outwardly, we would say that these experiences reached the height of absurdity. We have to go beyond the mind. The mind will not be able to comprehend such absurd stories.</p>
<p>One more story I can tell about an absurd utterance that proved true. Mahatapa’s great-uncle was a professor at Shantiniketan. At one point, he came to America to teach Indian philosophy at Missouri University. He taught there for two years. His complaint was that some students behaved very badly! He was very, very, very fond of me.</p>
<p>At the end of 1960, this gentleman gave a series of talks at the Ashram. I had no idea of going to America at that time, let alone having a sponsor! I was preparing wholeheartedly for the Himalayas. I said to myself, “This is the time for me to go to the Himalayas.” That was the whole story. I was not thinking of going to America.</p>
<p>This professor was so fond of me. During one talk at the Ashram, he was reading out his paper, which was about ten pages long. After reading out the second page, he stopped. He said, “I can clearly see that our Chinmoy will one day go to America and make a big noise!” Everybody laughed and laughed at him! I was in the third or fourth row. There were eight hundred people, at least, in the audience. The whole playground was full, and he was reading into a microphone. After reading two pages, he got that inspiration: “I can clearly see it.” Everybody laughed! Again, I never thought of going to America — never! I was only preparing for the Himalayas.</p>
<p>Six or eight months later, Sam Spanier came to the Ashram. I was coming out of the main gate. I was going very fast. In those days, believe me, I did not walk. Very, very fast I was moving; I was almost running. God knows, perhaps I was hungry and it was time to eat. I was in a hurry. Sam Spanier caught me. He said, “Brother, brother, will you please tell me something about Sri Ramakrishna and Mother Kali?”</p>
<p>Alas, I was a Sri Aurobindo Ashram disciple, and he was asking me to tell him something about Sri Ramakrishna. He had come to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, and he was asking me about another Guru!</p>
<p>I said, “All right, very good. Let us go to the park.” There was a park about eight hundred metres away from the main gate. We went to the park and he asked me so many questions about Sri Ramakrishna, although he had come to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram to become a disciple. I answered all his questions. He was very happy. Then he said, “I will have to take you to America.”</p>
<p>Then an American lady came to the Ashram. She was so devoted. She wanted to become my sponsor. Her name was Anne Harrison.</p>
<p>Now I am coming back to Mahatapa’s relative. How could he have had such a vision? He had never discussed anything with me. Out of the blue everything happens. I am sure that everybody has had that kind of experience. It seems absurd, absurd; but that very absurdity awakens our life.</p>

<p>Recently in New York I have been giving importance to one particular aphorism:</p>

<p>“I have come to learn<br /> Something very new:<br /> Manifestation-privileges<br /> God gives to very few.”<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>That message should be ingrained in your heart. I would like you to recite it quite a few times, so that you will value God-manifestation.</p>
<p>God-manifestation can take place even inside your own physical body. Let us say that your body is undisciplined, or you have a disease. If you can bring down light, peace, bliss or any other divine quality into the physical, that is a great manifestation.</p>
<p>Again, if you can be sincerely nice and kind to your brother and sister disciples, that is also an aspect of our manifestation.</p>
<p>The manifestation that disciples are doing here and there, you all know. But there are many, many other kinds of manifestation that you may not be consciously aware of.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Lord Buddha</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The Lord Buddha" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I have written a very powerful poem about <em>nirvana</em>. Tomorrow perhaps I will compose a song. This poem is about my first experience of nirvana — that is to say, in this incarnation. In previous incarnations I definitely had the experience of nirvana and I went beyond it. In this incarnation I have perhaps gone far beyond nirvana. One day I was enjoying my nirvana experience and I wrote this poem. I can tell many, many stories. It will be difficult even for my disciples to digest my experiences!</p>
<p>At Kamakura, and also at Borobudur, how I was conversing with the Lord Buddha! Many times it happened. Even in Puerto Rico I had such a wonderful conversation with the Lord Buddha.</p>
<p>I was told, although I did not see it when I used to meditate in Sri Aurobindo’s room, that Sri Aurobindo kept only one picture there, and that was the Lord Buddha’s picture. I meditated there every day for quite a few years, but I did not see the Lord Buddha’s picture in Sri Aurobindo’s room. Perhaps it was long before I was born that Sri Aurobindo kept the Lord Buddha’s picture. When I meditated there, I saw only two tigers.</p>
<p>The Lord Buddha’s wife was extremely eager to be her husband’s disciple, so she played a wonderful trick on him. Their son, Rahul, became very, very devoted to his father. The mother asked the son to go to his father and beg him for initiation. Ananda, the dearest disciple, and others felt very sorry for the little boy. He was all sincerity. At first the Lord Buddha refused. He said, “No, no, no! I will not accept my son.” But Ananda, his absolutely dearest disciple, begged him. Ananda said, “Look at his sincerity! How sincerely he wants to become your disciple! Please, please accept him.” So the Lord Buddha accepted Rahul, his son, as his disciple.</p>
<p>Then the son played a trick on his father! He said, “Father, you have left my mother. I have also left her. Now, who will take care of her?” What a wonderful trick he sprang upon his father! Then the father accepted his wife also as a disciple.</p>
<p>The Lord Buddha was a spiritual Master not only of infinite Compassion, but also of infinite Forgiveness. In the evening of his life, a former disciple invited him to come and eat at his place. That is how the story runs. Whether the host deliberately put poison inside the food or it was done inadvertently, God alone knows.</p>
<p>The disciples were very, very, very upset and furious, but the Lord Buddha said, “You must not, must not punish him. My time has come. Do not blame him." They did not do anything, because the Lord Buddha forgave that man.</p>
<p>At the age of eighty, the Lord Buddha could not walk properly. He could not keep his head and chest straight. According to the books, he needed a walking stick. He was bending and bending.</p>
<p>The Lord Buddha used to give lectures, and many, many seekers came, only to go. When the Lord Buddha gave talks, hundreds of people used to come. One day these people would come to listen to the Lord Buddha’s sermon, and the following day they would go to hear a talk given by another spiritual Master. Like this it went on and on and on. The Lord Buddha’s disciples Ananda and Sariputra begged their Master, “You are now too old. Please, please give up offering sermons. Those who want to become your followers will come.”</p>
<p>The Lord Buddha said, “I am not doing this to acquire more followers. I am doing it as a service to mankind. When people come to me, they get some benefit. And when they go to the other Master, they get some benefit.”</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that the Lord Buddha and another spiritual Master, Mahavira, could not or did not want to meet. Only nine and a half miles — some say six and a half miles — separated them from one another, but they did not have the occasion to meet. In two neighbouring villages they were born, and they left home at practically the same time. The Lord Buddha had a son and Mahavira had a daughter.</p>
<p>Mahavira’s way was the most difficult way, the most arduous. He tortured his body to the extreme. Physical discomfort he embraced. In the Lord Buddha’s case, he also wanted to practise austerity. Then he came to realise that austerity was not the answer; the middle path was the answer. Sujata taught him to follow the middle path.</p>
<p>It is like music. If you play on the higher scale all the time, nobody will appreciate your music. Again, if you play always on the lower scale, nobody will appreciate it. We start from the middle scale and occasionally we enter into the highest scale and the lowest scale. Who will be able to sing always on the highest scale?</p>

<p>I wish to give a one-minute speech on happiness.</p>
<p>Happiness, happiness, happiness, happiness, happiness I expect from each and every disciple. Happiness, happiness, happiness! If you are unhappy, if you are miserable, if you are depressed, you must feel that you are hurling arrows.</p>
<p>I am fortunate, sincerely fortunate, to have you as my disciples, and I wish to say that you can also feel the same, since you have an Avatar as your spiritual Master. I make bold to say that I am an Avatar. An Avatar is the direct descent of the Absolute Supreme. Believe it or not; believe that I am an Avatar or not; but believe in your own happiness.</p>
<p>If you are happy, then you are giving me a world of bliss. If you are unhappy, I feel miserable. Unhappiness does not have any solid foundation. Even if you are sick, very sick, your sadness will not cure your disease — never! Your happiness is the cure, the only cure — a happy, cheerful mind and heart. In every sphere of your earthly activities, keep happiness, happiness.</p>
<p>There are some disciples who were attacked by the most serious diseases. Their faith in me, and their happiness, was most praiseworthy. Even here there are some disciples in this category. A disciple’s faith in me enters into the Heart of the Absolute Supreme. If one has implicit faith in our Lord Supreme, He is bound to help the suffering patient. Faith is needed — absolute faith.</p>
<p>Not only one, but hundreds of disciples of mine have been cured of serious ailments because of their faith in the spiritual life, and that means their faith in our Lord Supreme. Again and again I say, He is my Guru, He is your Guru, He is everybody’s Guru. He chose me to be His representative to be of service to Him and to be of service to you as well.</p>

<p>How many times our Jagattarini practically died — seven or eight times! Recently the message came from Moscow that she was dying. The case was absolutely serious, and the doctors said she would die soon.</p>
<p>I started talking to her on the phone. She was enjoying a so-called mental hallucination. She was saying that she was in such a beautiful place, and she did not want to leave that place. Sometimes she understood what I was saying, and sometimes she was giving me a full description of Heaven. I did not have to tell her anything about Heaven; she was telling me how beautiful it is.</p>
<p>I said, "O Jagattarini, I want you to come back from that beautiful place. I want you here!"</p>
<p>Then she said to me, “Oh, Guru!”</p>
<p>I said, “No, I want you to be here. Come back, come back from that place!” Then, after we had been talking for four or five minutes, there was a complete change. She came back to this world. Before, she was lecturing about the other world! She was very lucky. It was a matter of half an hour or an hour — not even two or three hours — before she would leave this world. Luckily the disciples got me on the phone.</p>
<p>Now she has her story number ten or eleven to tell about death. This time she herself wanted to die, but it was not the Will of the Supreme. She writes in such a charming way about how many times she was saved. She has such faith, such faith in me.</p>

<p>There is a disciple who has a most powerful intellectual mind, but luckily it has surrendered to his heart. If his mind had not surrendered to his heart, God knows what kind of disciple he would have been! Because he surrendered his intellect so sincerely to his heart’s wisdom, he is a very, very good disciple. The mind can destroy; again, if one can pull the mind into the heart, it is a tremendous success.</p>
<p>Some disciples were born intellectuals, but I am so happy that they have put the brilliance of the mind inside their heart. Some of my very, very close disciples have had problems because of their powerful intellect. I spoke very seriously to them, and now they do not use that intellectual mind in a wrong way. Sometimes my seriousness works!</p>
<p>If the mind can be illumined by the heart, then the mind and the heart will be able to go together. Right now, inside everybody there is a constant fight going on between the two. At times the mind becomes faithful, like a little puppy following a very big dog. It has happened in some cases, and it is still happening. But if the mind and the heart both remain aloof, then there is a very serious problem. Everything at that time the person sees with a negativity-mind. Negativity comes forward always. When the mind is not under control, immediately we get an attack from negativity. There is no rhyme or reason for it.</p>
<p>Somebody is walking in the street. You have nothing to do with that person, but you immediately form a bad opinion of him. Or let us say that your friends are moving around with very good, compassionate and affectionate feelings. As soon as you see them, all your negative thoughts you inject into them. They will immediately say, “What happened, what happened?” They have not done anything wrong.</p>
<p>If the intellectual mind, the negative mind, is not illumined by the heart, dryness will reign supreme. The intellectual mind loves dryness. In the spiritual life, we never want dryness! Sri Ramakrishna used to say, “Give me juicy stories!” He did not want dryness. At times he wanted to enjoy earthly news, earthly humour, as everybody does. When the intellect is not purified by the heart’s affection and compassion, the intellect becomes a very serious obstacle. It feels that it knows everything. It is all dryness; there is no sweetness.</p>
<p>Intellectual people who cherish dryness create suffering for their dear ones. Again, the dear ones are at times so kind that they understand their intellectual family members and friends. If the two parties have tremendous affection and compassion for each other, then the intellect surrenders to that affection and compassion. When the intellect enters into the heart, it is overwhelmed by the affection, sweetness and concern of the heart. Then intellectual people can become very, very happy.</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo wrote that the intellect was the helper in the beginning, but then it became an obstruction. Many, many good things we want to have in the beginning of our life. Then we get them, and at times we misuse them or we overuse them. At that time they become veritable obstacles in our life. Those very things become weapons. Then we pray to God for God’s Grace. When God’s Grace descends, at that time the obstruction goes away, because God’s Grace swallows pride, intellect and all other problem-makers. But the heart also has to be fully prepared to save the mind. If the heart is not strict and eager to save the mind, then the mind runs amok.</p>
<p>Again, I am so happy that many so-called intellectual giants on our path have accepted the spiritual life so sincerely. They give full value to the spiritual life, and their intellect is under full control.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, two disciples of a spiritual Master had a very unfortunate experience. One disciple was not doing well, and the other one was trying so hard to encourage and inspire him. There is perhaps something called being overly kind. One disciple was very, very kind and wanted to help the other one and do the work of the other one. Alas, the second disciple, instead of taking the help of the first one, rejected his help and did something absolutely wrong from the spiritual point of view. This is what happens at times. We try to please someone in our own way, but when our consciousness is not high, no matter how we try to help the person who has become a victim to irritation or some other undivine quality, we cannot be of any service to him.</p>
<p>At times it seems as though nothing works in this world! In one of her books Mother Teresa said, "I thought love could conquer everybody.” But then she said that, from her own experience, she had discovered that it was not true, not true. She said, “I loved, but I could not succeed in certain circumstances.” Sometimes even love cannot succeed. Then what shall we do? We always say that power does not succeed; love succeeds. But there came a time when Mother Teresa, who was all compassion, self-giving and forgiveness, said, “Even love does not work.” What can we do at that time?</p>
<p>In my case, many, many times when my kindness, softness, tenderness, politeness and everything else fails, fails, fails, then I use my powerful scolding, and it works. When I scold someone, inwardly I am so miserable. Outwardly I am pretending that I am very, very angry, but inside my heart I know how much I myself am suffering from the scolding that I am giving to someone.</p>
<p>This kind of thing I do for some good disciples who work very hard. When I appear to be angry with them, I suffer much more than they suffer. Outwardly I do not show them kindness and compassion, but this is only what is visible in the outer world. I become two individuals: one individual to use justice-light, and one individual to take the suffering. Inwardly, I am all kindness, all forgiveness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The capacity of meditation</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The capacity of meditation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Prayer and meditation both are needed, true. But if we can enter into the meditation-world seriously, then we will see the difference between meditation and prayer. Prayer is needed, but prayer only says to God, “Give me, give me, give me!” Good things we are asking for, true. But during our meditation, we dive deep within. At that time we house the Infinite. The finite houses the Infinite. The mind cannot believe it: how can the finite house the Infinite? But it does house the Infinite. That is the capacity of meditation.</p>
<p>When God wants to discuss something, God takes meditation as His eldest son with whom He can discuss anything. When we deal with the prayer-world, we see that prayer is a little child. God can show His Affection, Sweetness and Fondness to the prayer-world, but He is not going to discuss anything serious with the prayer-world. But in the meditation-world, God gives advice to those who do excellent meditation. He even discusses things with them, as a father speaks with the eldest child in the family. The father and mother discuss things with the eldest one. They have such confidence in him.</p>
<p>The prayer-world is good, very good. Instead of breaking things here and there, a little child prays to God to get God’s Attention, Blessings and Love. But if we really want to describe the difference between prayer and meditation, we can say that prayer is like a child asking for something, and meditation is like a grown-up who is at once diving deep within and going up, all the time.</p>
<p>Sometimes one has to be a strict judge of the whole spiritual realm. Spiritual Masters do have the authority to tell the difference between prayer and meditation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A gift from the soul</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="A gift from the soul" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This morning at four o’clock I vividly saw one of the disciples in the inner world. His soul came to me. He was so happy, and I blessed him. His soul is very small, but most beautiful and most powerful. His body is much more stout than his soul — much more! His subtle physical being gave me a beautiful blue lamp, very bright. How happily his subtle body was giving me this lamp! I was very pleased.</p>
<p>Now, in the outer world, I have given this disciple a job: I have requested him to find a lamp like that for me. That experience took place in the higher world. Now he will bring me many lamps, I am sure. Easily he will be able to do it. I shall have to choose the one that will satisfy me.</p>
<p>This is what happens when we are dealing with the soul.</p>
