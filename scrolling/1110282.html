<h2><em>Professor Charles Johnson:</em> Why did God create the different races?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, God created and continues to create each individual with a special purpose. Each one He creates in a unique fashion. What He actually wants from His creation is unity in its multiplicity. His creation is His Cosmic Game. In a team, a certain number of players are needed. Each player has a specific position and a role to play. The question of superiority and inferiority does not arise; the sole purpose of the players is to score jointly. Unfortunately, our human mind wants to enjoy division, wants to feel superiority and wants to receive satisfaction in its own limited way.</p>
<p>There are a few distinct races, as we all know. To serve our purpose, let us take only black and white. God the Creator is also God the Supreme Artist. An artist, when he paints a picture, can easily use black and white side by side. The two colours are interdependent, adding visible beauty, contrast and harmony to each other to complete the painting to perfect perfection. In exactly the same way, God the Supreme Artist, God the Dispenser of human destiny, wants each individual and each race to grow and glow together, each playing perfectly its individual role for the betterment and enlightenment of humanity. If the races can be inseparable and interdependent, the division-enjoyment in our human nature can be illumined and divinely and supremely transformed into oneness-fulfilment.</p>
<p>Dear Professor, I had the golden opportunity and privilege of meeting with you in Seattle. Your prayerful, soulful and compassionate eyes have gone far beyond the so-called boundaries of race distinction. You represent a particular race, African, and I represent a particular race, Aryan. Both our races may be distinctive, but our Source is the same: God. And our Goal is the same: perfect perfection. Your own embodiment of light — illumining and fulfilling — can perfectly sing the song of oneness, while preparing itself to sing the song of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.</p>

<h2><em>Rev. Dr. David B. Burrell:</em> How is it that in prayer people discover that they literally have no distance to traverse between themselves and God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My dear Father, prayer is a magnet. When you put a magnet between two iron filings, the magnet immediately unifies the two objects on either side. In exactly the same way, prayer is the magnet between humanity's tearful heart and God's cheerful Heart, between humanity's cries and God's Smiles.</p>
<p>When we soulfully cry or soulfully smile, inside our cry and smile we discover the very Presence of God. We do not have to travel the length and breadth of the world to discover God's Existence. We can discover God's Existence here and now inside our own heart of love.</p>
<p>For everything we need in life, there is a teacher to help us find it. If we need God, then prayer is the teacher, prayer is the helper, prayer brings God into our consciously awakened life.</p>

 <p>
PCGR 3. Associate Dean, School of Theology, Boston University, Boston, MA</p>
<h2><em>Professor John Berthrong:</em> Does God change?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, God is eternal, immortal, infinite. A tiny drop is God. The vast ocean is also God. How does the vast ocean come into existence if not from one drop, two drops, three drops and then countless drops? God is constantly changing, sleeplessly changing. From the finite He is going to the Infinite. Again at His sweet Will, from the Infinite He is coming into the finite. He has the capacity to be the Infinite by changing or transforming or adding to the finite. Again, if He wants to separate Infinity into finite parts, He can do so drop by drop, or portion by portion.</p>
<p>On the one hand, God is changeless and deathless. On the other hand, He is in the process of constant change, constant self-creation and self-immolation. Creation and dissolution take their turn in exactly the same way that day and night interchange.</p>
<p>When we ordinary human beings change something, we are not sure that the change is going to be an improvement. Change in and of itself does not necessarily mean improvement. But when God changes something, He changes Himself in and through that thing, always for progress and true satisfaction.</p>
<p>God is not bound by anything, either by what He creates or by what He does. We human beings must have wisdom before we try to change a thing, since human change need not necessarily be for the better. But when we try to change ourselves for the better on the strength of our inner wisdom-light, we succeed.</p>
<p>God desperately wants the transformation of human nature. Although He does not have to change anything, He does change whenever He wants to change, and this change He does with a view to feeding mankind's hunger for the ultimate progress-delight.</p>

 <p>
PCGR 4-5. Department of Theology, St. Bonaventure University, Olean, NY</p>
<h2><em>Professor K. R. Sundarajan:</em> The notion of the goodness of God, which all theistic forms of Hinduism affirm, runs contrary to the human experience of evil and of the unmerited suffering that one experiences in life. It may be that the Hindu doctrine of karma enables one to explain them. Even so, how can we explain these experiences, especially when we try to emphasise the Love and forgiving Grace of God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, everything depends on the planes of consciousness in which we live. There are many planes of consciousness, as you know from studying Hindu philosophy: physical, vital, mental, psychic, to name only a few. On the physical plane, when we see that the world is full of misery, suffering and cruelty, we find it very difficult to believe that God the Creator could be loving or compassionate.</p>
<p>Hindu philosophy believes in reincarnation. Because of our ignorance and limitation, we do not know what we did in our previous incarnations. It may happen that we are very good, kind and virtuous in this lifetime, but during a previous incarnation we did something very bad, and for that we are paying the penalty now in the form of suffering which appears to be unmerited. If we dive deep into the Hindu philosophy-ocean and go beyond the law of karma (which we may explain on a very mundane level with the phrase "As you sow, so you reap," either today, or in the near or distant future,) we come to realise that it is God who is having all the experiences in and through us. He is at once the action and the Doer.</p>
<p>The human in us always wants to emphasise the idea of God's Love, God's Forgiveness and God's Grace. We want only God the Compassion-Height to act in our life; we do not want God the Justice Light. But if we truly love God, and if we dare to say, "Let Thy Will be done in and through us," then even the suffering that comes to us through God's Justice-Light will make us happy.</p>
<p>If we want to be totally surrendered to God's Will, we shall pray to God to make us His perfect instruments by utilising His Compassion-Aspect or His Justice-Aspect — whichever pleases Him. There can be no better prayer than what the Saviour Christ taught us: "Let Thy Will be done."</p>

How can I best teach these concepts to our students in the United States?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Hindu doctrine uses the term <em>'maya'</em> which means 'illusion'. It has been the Hindu belief, right from the very birth of the Hindu philosophy, that the world is an illusion. The Hindu spiritual figures, the Hindu philosophers and some of the Hindu thinkers get tremendous pleasure in telling the world that it is nothing but an illusion. Their philosophy is: why pay so much attention, or even any attention, to something that is unreal?</p>
<p>I wish to say that it is the height of our stupidity to say or feel that we have more wisdom or understanding than the Transcendental and Universal God. We are ready to pray to God, we are ready to devote ourselves to our idea of Him, but we are not ready to accept God's creation as something real. If we believe that we are praying to a God who is real, then how can we believe that His creation is unreal? How can we separate God's reality from God?</p>
<p>Maya has another meaning. It means 'fleeting, impermanent, temporary'. The things that we see or we do or we are in the physical world do not last permanently. Therefore, some people describe the physical world as unreal. But the outer reality does not require immortality. Although the highest reality is infinite, eternal and immortal, reality can also be short-lived, just as Infinity can be infinitely tiny as well as infinitely vast. Reality can be short-lived and reality can be long-term. Again, reality can be immortal. A flower that lasts only for a day is not unreal. A human being who lives for 80 years is not unreal. They are temporary; therefore, you might describe them as illusory. They are real, but limited, impermanent.</p>
<p>Some philosophers are of the opinion that only that which lasts forever is real. But if God's Will is to create something permanent or to create something that will last only for a short time that is His choice. Both things are still His creations. He is at once the Creator and the creation, the Player and the play, the impersonal and the personal, the invisible and the visible, the known and the unknown, the real and the unreal. No matter how hard we try to define God, we cannot. To define is to limit, and God is without limits. God is Eternity's Child playing in His own Infinity's Heart-Garden. As a little child gets satisfaction, abundant satisfaction, when he plays with his friends, even so, God the Child-Player likes to play with His child-friend-creations. God is one, but He wants to enjoy Himself in countless ways and in countless forms. And He does this through His Cosmic Play, through His <em>lila</em>. You and I and all of your students are God's creation-friends, although we may not understand the purpose of God's creation or our role in it.</p>

PCGR 6. Dirks Professor of Comparative Religion, McGill University, Montreal Canada</p>
<h2><em>Professor Arvind Sharnia:</em> What contribution can the study of religion in colleges and universities make to the spiritual life?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, it is of paramount importance to have religion not only inside the body of colleges and universities, but also inside the body of all schools. In this way, even if we do not long for God at the dawn of our lite, we may try at any time during our life's journey to bring God into our lives.</p>
<p>What is God? God is Satisfaction in the purest sense of the term. If we do not long for God's sleepless Presence, if we do not bring God's sleepless Presence into our conscious life, then we can never have abiding satisfaction, no matter how much knowledge or how many degrees we get from schools, colleges and universities. True satisfaction will always elude us.</p>
<p>What is religion? It is the messenger of God. It is always helpful to have a messenger who can carry messages between ourselves and God. Religion is the older brother of humanity. The older brother tells the younger brothers that only aspiration, dedication, love of God and service to God can provide us with an endless vision of perpetual truth and perpetual light. Religion is God-invocation, and inside God-invocation is mankind's transformation-life and satisfaction-breath.</p>

<h2><em>Professor Sumner B. Twiss:</em> Can we experience God in such a way that we can embrace as equals the authentic spirituality of all the world's religious traditions? Here I am looking for not only a viable theory but also a viable practice.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, after one has realised the Highest Absolute Supreme, one can easily embrace all religions with equal love and concern. It is like climbing up a tree that has many branches. An expert climber finds no difficulty in climbing from one branch to another. An Indian spiritual Master of the highest order named Sri Ramakrishna first realised God in India's traditional way. Then he realised God in the Christian way, and then in the Islamic way. He taught his followers that all religions are equal. Their source is an oneness-God.</p>
<p>The life-tree is one, but the branches are many. If a tree has no branches, then we are not inclined to call it a tree. God is the trunk of the world-religion-tree.</p>
<p>The spiritual Masters of the highest order have all come to the same realisation: there is only one true religion, and that religion is love of God in God's own Way to manifest God's Light here on earth for the complete satisfaction of Divinity in humanity and humanity in Divinity.</p>
<p>If one reaches a certain height, one can easily embrace all the religions in this way. Unfortunately an ordinary person cannot do so. But everyone, regardless of what height he or she has reached, should have respect for all religions.</p>

<h2><em>Professor Joan Chatfield:</em> God has created us all in the image and likeness of God. But why is there such a discrepancy in the way that we human beings think about ourselves? We like to think of ourselves as so much better than our fellow human beings. Why do we like to foster our blatant elitism?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, the real God creates us all in the image and likeness of Himself, but we have accepted the false god — our mind — as our real boss. The limited mind wants to exert its supremacy over each and every thing and over each and every person. The ordinary human mind has not studied and does not want to study the oneness-philosophy-course. It wants to satisfy itself either through superiority or through separativity. But, alas, neither superiority nor separativity can satisfy the poor self-styled mind-god.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Professor Joan Chutfield: At what moment does God place the soul into the body? Why does God not reveal to the parents the exact moment?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Professor Joan Chutfield:&lt;/em&gt; At what moment does God place the soul into the body? Why does God not reveal to the parents the exact moment?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, there is no hard and fast rule as to when the soul will enter the body. The soul can enter into the body exactly at the moment of conception, or the soul can enter into the body a few days later, a few months later, or even a few hours before the birth of the child. According to the occult vision of seers, the soul can enter into the body as long as 13 hours after the birth of the child.</p>
<p>Similarly, the soul can be away from the body for as long as three days without causing the death of the body. The body can continue to function in its mechanically normal way without the soul's occupancy for short periods of time. Such incidents are very rare, but great occultists and spiritual Masters of the Himalayan heights can testify to the veracity of this fact.</p>
<p>The soul is neither masculine nor feminine. The soul enters into one kind of body or the other, the way one enters into a house. If a soul takes a feminine body that does not mean that the soul itself is feminine. The soul has accepted a feminine type of house. One particular soul prefers a certain type of house. Another soul may prefer a different type of house. With occult power that house can be changed. Science will not believe it.</p>
<p>The soul is like the person who wants to buy a house. He may give the order to the contractors to build the house in a certain way, or he can choose a house that has already been built. In either case, the buyer can decide to enter whenever he wants to, within limits. Like that, the soul is under no obligation to come at a certain time. It can come at any time during the nine months before the birth of the child. It can even come shortly after the birth if it wants to.</p>
<p>When the soul enters the body, if the parents are spiritually conscious, they will see a column of light descending. The soul is made of light, but it can take any form. If the mother is very, very spiritual, she will feel something special on the day that the soul enters. The father also may feel it. The soul of the child is entering the mother's body, but if the father is very, very spiritual, on the strength of his oneness with his wife and his child, the father will feel that something special is happening. God will give them the vision. In the Bible we learn that an angel told Mary that she was carrying the Christ. This has also happened in the case of some other highly developed spiritual figures.</p>

 <p>
PCGR 10. Department of Languages and Literature, University of North Florida, Jacksonville, FL</p>
<h2><em>Professor Satya Pachori:</em> Why does God let virtuous people suffer from sorrow and grief?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, today somebody can be virtuous, but perhaps he was not so yesterday. In this incarnation somebody may be leading a virtuous life, but in his previous incarnation the life that he led may have been totally different. Even in the course of one incarnation we may notice that certain people who are undivine to the extreme in the beginning may eventually become divinity incarnate.</p>
<p>The great sage Valmiki, who wrote the Ramayana, belonged to this group. When he was a young man his name was Ratnakar. He was a notorious robber. Destruction was his very nature. But with the grace of Sri Ramachandra he became compassion incarnate and illumination incarnate. His life embodied the transformation of human nature to its ultimate heights.</p>
<p>It also happens that some people, either consciously or unconsciously, take on the sufferings of their dear ones. In the case of spiritual figures of the highest Height, like the Lord Buddha, Sri Krishna, Jesus Christ and others, what kind of bad things did they do that they had to suffer so much? The answer is that they took humanity's suffering as their own, very own.</p>
<p>When virtuous people suffer, it may be because of something they did in their past lives, or, if their past lives were spotless, soulful, spiritual and divine, they may have consciously or unconsciously prayed to God, "O God, people around me are full of suffering. By Your infinite Grace, You have given me wisdom-light, compassion and concern. Please allow me to take their suffering as my own, very own. Let them be free."</p>
<p>The way a mother cries to take away the suffering of her children, some people try to remove the suffering of their dear ones. It may even come to pass that when death threatens their dear ones, they pray to death to summon them instead. I shall give you an example from our Indian history. Babar was the first of the great Moghul Emperors of India. He had a son named Humayun, which means 'fortunate'. When Humayun was a young man, he fell seriously ill. Day by day his condition grew worse, until his death seemed imminent. Many people prayed to Allah for Humayun's recovery, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Then a saint came to Babar and said, "If you make a great sacrifice, if you sacrifice something most precious to you, only then will your son be cured."</p>
<p>The Emperor Babar asked, "What kind of thing should I sacrifice?"</p>
<p>The saint replied, "Give away the Kohinoor diamond. It is most precious."</p>
<p>But the Emperor said, "The Kohinoor is my son's possession. What kind of sacrifice would that be? I have to sacrifice something of my own. I have so much wealth and such a vast kingdom. But the most precious Kohinoor diamond is not mine. Therefore, I cannot sacrifice it. And even if I did own the Kohinoor, it would not be a real sacrifice to give it away. Even if I were to give away all my wealth and power — my entire kingdom — I do not think this is the most precious sacrifice that I could make. My life alone is most precious. I am ready to give my life."</p>
<p>Then he walked around his son's bed three times, offering this prayer: "Allah, my most precious possession is my own life. If You wish me to sacrifice something most precious, then take my life instead of my son's. Let me die in his place, and let him live on earth. This is my only prayer and my most willing sacrifice."</p>
<p>To Babar's wide surprise, after he had completed three rounds, his son stood up completely well. But immediately Babar fell ill.</p>
<p>Humayun wept with gratitude and love for his father. He said to Allah, "My father is going to die, but I shall eternally treasure my father's fondness for me, and my father's implicit faith in Your Compassion."</p>
<p>Allah listened to the father's prayer, and in three months' time Babar died. This is the kind of love that a human father can have for his son. This kind of love will gladly welcome undeserved suffering.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, unfortunate things can happen to seemingly virtuous people, and also good things can happen to undivine people. Do they merit it? On the face of it, they do not merit it, but perhaps in their previous incarnations they did something good, and the law of karma is now giving them the fruits. Or possibly it is because God's unconditional Compassion and unconditional Love is operating in and through them for their transformation and perfection. God may choose to make some people happy, although they do not seem to deserve it.</p>

<h2><em>Professor Shawn Wong:</em> I often tell my students that acquiring knowledge and learning are about belief. It is from belief that one's passion about one's own education springs. How can a student better understand where knowledge comes from? Is God the Source of this deeper knowledge?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, please allow me to use four words to come to my rescue: belief, faith, knowledge and wisdom.</p>
<p>Belief and knowledge are on one side. They are with the mind, in the mind and for the mind. Faith and wisdom are on the other side. They are with the heart, in the heart and are not only for the heart but also for the body, vital and mind. These four concepts are not supposed to enjoy rivalry and contradictions. They are supposed to sing the song of oneness in their ultimate reality. The outer education — belief and knowledge — feeds the mind, and vice versa. The inner education — faith and wisdom — feeds the heart, and vice versa. The outer education can be challenged, contradicted and even replaced. The inner education, which is sleepless and breathless oneness with God's Will, can never be challenged, contradicted or replaced. The outer education at times searches for God, at times does not. The inner education embodies and reveals God spontaneously, unreservedly and self-givingly.</p>
<p>Again, belief, knowledge, faith and wisdom have the selfsame Source: God the Illumination-Eye and God the Compassion-Heart.</p>

<h2><em>Professor Genevieve McCoy:</em> How does one reach Being-in-General?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, I was told that your expression 'Being-in-General' means God Himself. How do we reach God? Instead of trying to reach God, it will be wiser for us to discover God. When man tries to reach God, a certain distance always remains between himself and God. By virtue of our prayer and meditation, we come to realise that God is not someone who is at the farthest corner of the globe or in the highest sphere. Definitely He does dwell in those regions, but our wisdom will tell us that He is nearer than the nearest as well. He is Someone within us whom we have to discover.</p>
<p>When we want to invent something, we use the power of our mind to its fullest extent. When we want to discover something, we simply dive deep within, using the power of our heart. In the heart there is no question of distance, and we realise God much sooner than otherwise.</p>
<p>To reach the furthest length, we have to run fast, faster, fastest. To reach the ultimate height, we have to climb up high, higher, highest. But when we want to discover God, we just dive deep within and find our supremely chosen Inner Pilot dwelling inside our hearts.</p>
<p>To come back to your question: How does one reach God? Let us say, how does one discover and then realise God? We discover God and realise Him by virtue of our sleepless prayer and breathless meditation. And for that we have to love God unconditionally. We have to say to ourselves, "God for God's Sake," and then make this a reality in our life.</p>

PCGR 13. Co-Director of Research, Bastyr University Research Institute, Bastyr University, Seattle, WA</p>
<h2><em>Professor Leanna J. Standish:</em> Why is it that for you, apparently, the existence of God, the Absolute, the Divine, is known and experienced every day, but for me, a scientist and a physician, there is insufficient evidence to say I know, or even believe, that God exists? I am not at all certain that scientific materialism or material realism is an incorrect assessment of the nature of reality. Why are you certain and I am not?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My esteemed Professor, our human life is so complicated. Our human understanding is so complicated. Our approaches to reality are also complicated. But again, we can develop mutual respect for each other's understanding and conviction. You, as a scientist, are at home in the world of science. I happen to be a conscious God-seeker. My life has been entirely devoted to the inner exploration. Therefore, God — out of His infinite Bounty — has blessed me with certain illumining and fulfilling experiences. With regard to science, there are many things of which I am totally unaware, that you will be able to prove to me if I am willing to devote my time to the study of your reality. I also will be able to prove to you the existence of God if you want to consciously and selflessly dedicate your life to God-discovery. Your science-God and my spirituality-God are the same Being. But devotees of the science-God ask for concrete proof at every step of the way. Devotees of the spirituality-God care more for inner experience than for immediate proof or physical evidence.</p>
<p>Those who are devoted to the spirituality-God do not try to authenticate God's Existence. Their own faith in God and love of God enables them to feel God as an omnipresent Reality. They have tasted a most delicious mango, and they are still enjoying the taste of it to their full and complete satisfaction. They do not care whether the rest of the world believes in the mango or not. They are pleased and satisfied with what they have. The inner Presence of God is enough for them. They do not feel it is at all necessary for God to come and stand in front of them face to face. They feel that their inner happiness, peace and satisfaction in life are proof enough for them.</p>
<p>As a scientist, you may want me to prove to you the authenticity of my approach to reality, but as a God-lover I shall not ask you to prove anything. I shall only ask you to be satisfied, and if you are already satisfied with what you have and what you are, then I am truly, divinely and supremely proud of you. Your satisfaction is the manifestation of your chosen reality. My satisfaction is also the manifestation of my chosen reality. At the final end of our life-journey, we will see that God the Science and God the Spirituality are eternally and inseparably one, playing two different, distinct roles for the betterment and fulfilment of humanity.</p>
