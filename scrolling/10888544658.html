<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation far surpasses the barriers of religion. One can follow any religion. Meditation is like a school, and religion is like a house. You can go to a school or college no matter which house you live in. Everybody can meditate no matter what religion he belongs to or even if he does not belong to any religion.</p>

<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> The person who has a hard time accepting the discipline, the person who finds it really difficult to give up smoking or drinking or sex life and yet still wants to meditate — is it hopeless for that person?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not hopeless at all, if the person is sincere. If he prays to God for His boundless Compassion, then God will give him the necessary capacity to discipline his life. He has only to pray to God for God's infinite Compassion. God's Compassion-Light will be able to illumine him, and his weaknesses and shortcomings will not be able to remain with him forever.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Easily. We are all instruments of God. But if we are too much involved in the material life, then we will not be able to be chosen instruments of God. Chosen instruments of God are those who are constantly self-giving. They are not for themselves only but for the entire world. The chosen instruments have a wide heart.

<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> If he finds his life in danger, can a person seriously speak to God, even though the person has been irreligious?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are all God's children. The parents are always full of love, even for a naughty boy who does not listen to them. When this naughty child at times runs into difficulty, he runs to his parents to help him. Will the parents discard him at that time? No, the parents will immediately embrace him and say, "At long last, my son, you have come to me for help." Similarly, God's help is always there provided we have a sincere cry.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> So the person who has been against religion or thought religion was silly or did not want to get involved in religion, if at a moment of danger that person reaches out to God, God will answer him?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely He will answer, but in His own Way, of course.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> He will accept the sincerity of this person?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If someone sincerely cries for God's help, God will definitely help him. It depends on his sincerity.</p>
