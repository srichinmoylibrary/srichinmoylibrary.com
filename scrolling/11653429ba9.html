<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have spoken hundreds of times on drugs. Here all I wish to say is that if you have a real coin and a counterfeit coin, they look similar; but when you examine them properly, you know that one is real and the other one is false. I have a few disciples who once upon a time were addicted to drugs. They had very high, lofty experiences according to their own understanding and realisation at that time. But now these same disciples have been meditating with me for a couple of years and by the Grace of the Supreme they have had spiritual experiences. They say that the difference between the two is like the difference between a counterfeit or false coin and a real coin.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Would you say that in order to achieve enlightenment it is necessary to give up sex or to engage in ascetic discipline?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Would you say that in order to achieve enlightenment it is necessary to give up sex or to engage in ascetic discipline?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Asceticism is not necessary for God-realisation. In order to realise God I must not torture my being. If I cut off my arms and run toward my Father and say, "Father, look, just for you, just to come to you, I have cut off my arms," then God will not be pleased. Too much asceticism or torturing the body in the name of discipline is not good. Discipline is necessary but, like anything else, when you go to the extreme it is very bad. Asceticism is not advisable. We should adopt the middle path; like the Buddha, we should not go to any extreme. We should not be over-indulgent and at the same time we should not be overly strict with our physical consciousness.</p>
<p>About sex I wish to say that one has to transcend it slowly and steadily. If one wants to conquer sex overnight, then it will tell upon his health; it will ruin his consciousness. It is like giving up tea or coffee. If you take it six times a day, then gradually bring it down to five, four, three cups a day. If you overcome something gradually, then your achievement becomes solid and permanent in your consciousness. Otherwise, today you will give up everything and tomorrow the lower vital forces will come and attack you most vehemently. At that time you will be helpless. Slow and steady wins the race. This saying is also applicable to our spiritual life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, I do not want to offer any comment because real Yoga does not enter into commentary or any kind of competition. Real Yoga includes everything. The path that we are following, the real Yoga, does not exclude anything. It says that everybody is right in his own way. As every religion is right, so also every path is right, every form of spiritual discipline is right.</p>
<p>I can speak only on my philosophy; you can speak on your philosophy or your religion. I live in my room, so I can tell you what I have in my room. I know that in one place I have my chair, in one place I have my books and in one place I have all my other possessions. I know what I have in my room and you know what you have in your room. Now, for me to speak about what you have in your room would be an act of foolishness. What do I know about your life? So in Zen and other paths, each teacher is most qualified to speak on his respective path. I do not make any comparison or pass any proud judgement on any other path because I am not authorised or qualified to do so.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: In your writings you quote quite a bit from Western poets and Western philosophers. I wonder if you get spiritual inspiration from them? Do you think that they are enlightened in the sense in which the people in the Orient use the term?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: In your writings you quote quite a bit from Western poets and Western philosophers. I wonder if you get spiritual inspiration from them? Do you think that they are enlightened in the sense in which the people in the Orient use the term?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have to be very frank here. I do get inspiration from the Western poets and philosophers, but not enlightenment. Having been a poet right from my childhood, when I get something inspirational I am thrilled. Poetry is next to spirituality. So, being a spiritual man, I try to have the consciousness of poetry in my writings. The Western writers whom I very often quote derive their inspiration or their achievement from the Eastern background. When I read their writings I get the ancient message of my great-great-grandfathers. But again, inspiration and enlightenment are two different things.</p>
<p>When it comes to Truth, there are no such things as East or West. We have got light, inspiration and divine messages from the Vedic seers of the hoary past, true. But the Vedic seers also live in the Universal Consciousness. Truth is not the sole monopoly of the East or the West. Unfortunately, the West and the East very often want to remain separate. The East claims spirituality as its own monopoly and the West claims scientific achievement as its own monopoly. But while we are trying to discover ourselves, we find that science and spirituality must go together. The offering, the achievement, the contribution of the West is of greatest importance; and the offering, the achievement, the contribution of the East is also of greatest importance. The message of peace that we hear in the East and the message of the soul's dynamism that we hear in the West must be combined.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I would like to know how all disciplines such as diet fit in with spirituality. It seems to me that if God is in everything, then if we just keep our thoughts on God we shouldn&#039;t need anything else.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I would like to know how all disciplines such as diet fit in with spirituality. It seems to me that if God is in everything, then if we just keep our thoughts on God we shouldn&#039;t need anything else." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is in everything, true. God is in a tiger and in a snake, but that doesn't mean that I will go and stand in front of a tiger or a snake, for I know that I will be devoured or bitten. Since God is Omnipresent, He is in everything. He is in desire and in aspiration. God is in everything, but I have to use my common sense. I feel that sooner or later I will be frustrated. Then I see that my frustration is immediately followed by destruction. So I have to search for the God who is in aspiration. When I aspire, I get abundant Peace, Light and Bliss. It is like drinking water. Why do we drink pure water instead of dirty, impure water? Both are water, but when we use our wisdom we see that we should drink the pure water.</p>
<p>We have come into the world to make progress, but if we do not use our wisdom in our day-to-day life, then we will make no progress. Success is a form of experience and failure is also a form of experience in life. Both success and failure we offer at the Feet of God. But since God Himself is transcending His own Realisation, we feel that the more we can consciously make progress, the more we are achieving, revealing and manifesting the Truth. If there is no quest, what kind of life will we lead? In spite of knowing this, most of the time we quarrel, we fight, we strangle, we do everything that is undivine. But since we know that God is everything, why do we not lead a divine life?</p>
<p>To a spiritual person, the very concept of God is divine. He is divine, He is immortal and He is all Compassion. If we think of God as Satan, as a destructive force, then we are totally lost. So for a spiritual seeker, the very idea of God is Benevolence, Compassion and Light. We have to know which aspect of God we want. God is in everything, true. God is in destruction and God is in imperfection. But being seekers of the infinite Truth, we will care for the God who is all Compassion, who is all Illumination.</p>
<p>We know that everybody wants satisfaction, but it depends on how the individual soul is satisfied. A thief is satisfied after he has committed a theft. A seeker is satisfied only after he has realised God, the highest Truth. But the thing that I need for satisfaction you may not need. So you are right in achieving something to satisfy yourself and I am perfectly right in achieving something to satisfy my own needs.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. What Paul Brunton has said is perfectly right. Previously Yoga was confined to a select few; now Yoga is open to all. Previously, even in India, the land where it has always been practised, Yoga was confined to the limited few. But now the book of Yoga is no longer sealed; it is open to all. Unfortunately, we are seeing many false teachers, especially here in the West. But on the other hand, I wish to say that in America I have come across thousands of sincere seekers. So the world is progressing, the world is evolving. We are in the process of evolution. We see in the West as well as the East that the inner cry for truth, the ultimate Truth, has increased. And the book of Yoga is no longer sealed, but is now an open book.</p>
