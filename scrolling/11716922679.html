<p>Dear Ramona:<br /></p>
<p>You have written to me that your daughter constantly asks you for money, while your son constantly demands time from you. You need my advice. I wish to tell you that you should give money to your daughter when she <em>needs</em> it, and that you should give your son time when he <em>demands</em> it. Otherwise, you will suffer for the rest of your life from your daughter's lack of love and from your son's lack of knowledge.<br /></p>

<p>Dear Joshua:<br /></p>
<p>You want to know from me if so-called silly jokes can ever be instructive. I wish to tell you that sometimes they can be not only instructive but most instructive. Dear Joshua, you are now young and green. You are now in the seventh heaven of romantic life. Do you know what Baudelaire said? He said: "A sweetheart is a bottle of wine, a wife is a wine bottle." I am sure you will agree with Baudelaire. But I want to tell you that when you start drinking the bottle of wine, one day it will be all used up, and it will naturally turn into a wine bottle. At that time, who can be your bottle of wine, nay, nectar? God and God alone.</p>
<p>Do not worry. Some day you are bound to taste God's Nectar. Again, if you want the largest bottle of divinely intoxicating wine for your life-long use, dear Joshua, then your life's partner must be spiritual, absolutely spiritual.</p>
<p>Joshua, your name means, 'whom God has saved'. So you are lucky. God has already saved you by giving you a spiritual soul which you will use for God and which will use you for God.</p>
<p>I am mighty happy that God has saved you. I am truly happy that you two will work for God, my Beloved Supreme.<br /></p>

 <p>
SCA 1218-1225. This interview with Sri Chinmoy was conducted on 6 August 1993 at the Jharna-Kala Gallery in Soho by Ms. Tricia Curry of <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine.</p>
<h2>Interviewer: Is there one thing that has inspired you to do all these small drawings of birds?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am a Truth-seeker and God-lover. I pray and meditate. From my prayer and meditation, I receive inner messages and inner inspiration. So from deep within I get inspiration to compose songs, write poems, draw and do various other things. And this inspiration carries me. I listen to these inner dictates and try to offer what I can to the world at large, according to my capacity. I try to receive inspiration from within and, with this inspiration and aspiration, I try to be of service to mankind in various ways.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Interviewer: So as part of this inspiration, did you feel that birds were something you should draw?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Interviewer: So as part of this inspiration, did you feel that birds were something you should draw?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For me, birds have a very special significance. They embody freedom. We see a bird flying in the sky and it reminds us of our own inner freedom. As I said before, I am a Truth-seeker and a God-lover. So I feel that inside each of us there is an inner existence which we call the soul. The soul, like a bird, flies in the sky of God's Infinity. So the birds we see flying in the sky remind us of our own soul-bird flying in the sky of Infinity.</p>
<p>If we buy a cage and put a bird inside it, the bird is limited. But if we release the bird, it will go high, higher, highest. When the bird is flying in the boundless sky, there is no limit to its flight. When we live inside the mind, we are encaged by limited, earth-bound thoughts — undivine, impure, destructive thoughts. But when we live in the soul, we are able to fly in the sky of divine freedom. When we pray and meditate, we become simple, sincere, humble and pure. We learn to live in the soul. By praying and meditating, we feel that we can go beyond our ordinary, silly, earth-bound thoughts and fly in the sky of divine illumination and perfection.</p>

<article id="node-1171711" class="node node-book">

  
  <h2 id="page-title">Interviewer: By sharing these birds with the public, are you trying to inspire people with that message?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Interviewer: By sharing these birds with the public, are you trying to inspire people with that message?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Exactly. Let us say you have gone to the market and purchased a mango. Now you feel that if you can share it with the members of your family, you will get more joy than if you eat it all by yourself. Similarly, I have received some inspiration from my Inner Pilot. I feel that He is the one who is drawing these birds in and through me, according to my receptivity. I am only an instrument of His. So I have received some inspiration from within and I feel it is my bounden duty to share it with others, for I take the whole world as one family.</p>
<p>Inside each human being, we are trying to see the divine. If I see something beautiful and divine in you, then I get the inspiration and aspiration to be of service to you. And if you see something beautiful and divine in me, then you get the inspiration and aspiration to be of service to me. In this way we are inspired to become good citizens of the world and serve mankind. Otherwise, we are only for ourselves.</p>
<p>No matter how many things we get or how many of our desires we fulfil, we will never be happy unless and until we see that others are also happy. We can never be satisfied with our own happiness, because true happiness has to be all-encompassing. If everyone does not have it, I cannot have it either. Even if God fulfils all my desires, still I cannot be happy, for I will look around and see that somebody else is unhappy. And how can I be happy when I see that my brothers and sisters are not?</p>
<p>These birds remind me of a happiness that is all-pervading. I look to this side and see birds, and I look to that side and see birds. No matter in which direction I look, I see birds, and this gives me a kind of childlike happiness. A child is inside a garden that has many beautiful flowers and plants. The child does not stay at one place. He looks at one flower and appreciates its beauty and fragrance. Then he runs to another flower somewhere else. He gets tremendous joy in seeing the beauty, fragrance, light and delight inside so many flowers. Everywhere he goes inside the garden he is happy, happy, happy. But if he remains confined to one place, he will not be happy. He gets joy by moving from one place to another.</p>
<p>In exactly the same way, we human beings move from one place to another, appreciating the different flowers in God's life-garden. One flower is called America, another is called India or France. But these are just names and forms. Beyond the name and form comes the reality, which is all oneness. We all belong to one family, and we get boundless joy when we share our heart's love and delight with the other members of our family. So that is what I am trying to do with my drawings.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is my own inner feeling that when they look at the drawings, they get a certain sense of peace. I have observed a few visitors and I have heard quite a few of the comments that they have made. When they look at these birds, they feel a sense of peace. What more can I offer to humanity? As a human being, the greatest reward that I can have is the opportunity to be of service to mankind. If I see that somebody is getting an iota of peace from my service to mankind — from my drawings, from my paintings, from my songs, from my poems or anything else that I do — then I feel that I have accomplished something because I have been able to share my inspiration and aspiration with others.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Interviewer: It is very peaceful here, despite the fact that it is in the middle of New York City!</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Interviewer: It is very peaceful here, despite the fact that it is in the middle of New York City!" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite peaceful. There is only one thing that we need here on earth and that is peace. Everything else is meaningless and useless. We can get name, fame, prosperity and everything else, but if we do not find peace in the inmost recesses of our heart, then we will not be satisfied. Only peace can give us true satisfaction. Nothing from the outer world can give us abiding satisfaction save and except peace. And for this peace we have to dive deep within and pray and meditate.</p>
<p>So when people look at my drawings and find peace, this helps to bring forward their own soul's qualities and increase their own wisdom and joy. When they look at these birds and see them flying in the inner freedom-sky, this increases their own heart's joy.</p>

Is this how most of these were done, just sitting?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, just sitting. Usually when I draw, I try to be in a contemplative mood, in a prayerful and soulful consciousness. I do not talk. Usually I draw early in the morning when I am all by myself. Sometimes I draw inside the car or the plane. Occasionally I draw when people are moving around and I am in the middle of the hustle and bustle of life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Interviewer: Do you have a special bird in mind when you draw?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Interviewer: Do you have a special bird in mind when you draw?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have nothing in mind. I try to keep my mind as empty, vacant and tranquil as possible. The outer mind is like the surface of the sea. On the surface, the sea is full of waves and surges; it is all restlessness. But when we dive deep below the surface, the same sea is all peace, calmness and quiet, and there we find the source of creativity.</p>
<p>I do not use the mind when I draw because I believe that the process of thinking binds us and limits us. As soon as we think of something, we bind ourselves. The mind is binding us precisely because it has not yet learnt the art of self-giving, which is all expansion. It is the inner heart, the aspiring heart, that has learnt the art of self-giving. As soon as we enter into anybody's heart, even if that particular person is our so-called enemy, we will immediately feel that he is also trying to become a better person. But when we enter into somebody's mind, we become aware of that person's imperfections, negative thoughts and so forth. Of course, if we enter into our own mind, we will see that we also have the same destructive thoughts. That is why our minds are always clashing. Each person wants to lord it over the other. When we live in the mind, we want to exercise our supremacy. But when we remain inside our hearts, we only love one another. At that time, the question of supremacy does not arise at all. So this is how we can solve our problems.</p>
<p>These birds represent unity in multiplicity. Here we have 70,000 birds. Each bird is different, but when you look at them, you feel unity. As soon as we think of the bird-consciousness, it is one. The bird-consciousness represents the consciousness of our soul's inner freedom.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I have been doing more. Today I have completed 76,000. It is my wish, on the 19th of November, to exhibit 100,000 birds in Ottawa. About nineteen years ago, I entered into the art world in a hotel room in Ottawa. There I did my first drawing in the West. I have students in Canada, and every year they observe the anniversary of that first drawing. This November it is our plan to have a huge gallery that will house 100,000 birds. I do hope that by the end of October I will be able to complete them.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not know what is going to happen until my Inner Pilot tells me what He wants me to do. On my own I do not know because He is the Doer in me. According to the capacity of my receptivity, through my prayer and meditation, I try to receive His Messages. He knows everything infinitely, infinitely better than I do and, at His choice Hour, He will tell me to do this or do that. I know that when the time comes — I call it God's Hour — it is He who will direct me.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I call Him my Father or my Inner Pilot, the Pilot of my life-boat. I take life as a boat and I feel that He is steering our life-boats towards the Supreme Destination, the Golden Shore.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. That is another way for me to offer my service to mankind. For about two hours I shall play on various instruments and sing. This will be done prayerfully, and the audience also will remain in a prayerful and soulful consciousness. I am so grateful to the audience. They observe pindrop silence and they join me in my prayer and meditation.</p>
<p>Very often I dedicate my concerts to some individual who is responsible for bringing about world peace. I have dedicated many, many concerts to President Mikhail Gorbachev. He is a very, very close friend of mine and he has been extremely kind to me. I have the deepest admiration for him. Because of him, the two Germanies have now become one Germany, and so many other countries have been liberated. He has worked so hard to bring about world peace.</p>
<p>I wish to thank you for your most sincere questions. May I know your name please?</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sanskrit is the mother of all our myriad Indian languages. In Sanskrit <em>trisha</em> means 'thirsty for wisdom, light and peace'.</p>
