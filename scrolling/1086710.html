<p>I am very pleased with all of you here because your mothers and fathers are praying. I am their teacher. I am pleased with you now because your mothers come to me and your fathers come to me. When your parents come to me so that I can help them to see God, I am very pleased with them. At that time I also become pleased with those who are their children. You are the children of parents who are pleasing me, so I am pleased with you. When you grow up and start praying to God, naturally I will be even more pleased.</p>
<p>There are some children sitting right behind you who are a little older than you. You are between seven and ten years old, but they are eleven, twelve, thirteen and fourteen and they are coming here to meditate with their parents. Their parents are very good because they are praying and meditating and the children are also very good because they are doing the same. When you grow up, we will allow you to come here regularly to pray to God. Now we are pleased with you, but we will be even more pleased at that time.</p>
<p>In the meantime what can you do? If you pray for five minutes in the morning and in the evening, then God will be pleased. Your mother or father will teach you how to pray to God. When you pray, you will see that God is bound to come to you, just as he came to the little boy in a story I know. In that story, God came in the form of Krishna and helped the little boy.</p>

<h2>Question: I have always wanted to see God.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am very glad that you have always wanted to see God. Your desire to see God deserves my special joy, concern and blessing. You will definitely see God before you die if you become an extremely good boy and a totally surrendered seeker. If you really want nothing else but God and God alone, you will definitely see God in this lifetime.</p>

<h2>Question: Why can't I see God inside me?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can see God inside you. But you can't see Him right now because you are not crying, you are not flying. If you don't ask for something from your mother, she won't give you anything. If you do ask for something, your mother will always give it to you. So if you want to see God, it is best to look for Him. If you look for Him, then only will you see Him.</p>
<p>God is like the most beautiful child, the most beautiful jewel. He is inside your heart-room. There you have to look for Him. If you don't look for Him, how can you see Him? This Jewel is in one corner of your heart-room. If you search for it, then immediately you will find it. If you just look quickly into your room and say that God is not there, try to feel that He is there. Once you really look for Him, you will see Him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is God in the sky?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is God in the sky?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, God is in the sky, and God is also on earth. Now, what is your sky, and what is your earth? Your sky is your head, and your earth is your feet. When you think of the sky, think of your head where God is; and when you think of earth, think of your feet, where God also is. You need both your feet and your head. If you don't have your feet, you can't walk. If you don't have a head, then you cannot exist; you will have no brain. Both are necessary, although God is in each. Your head is at one place and your feet are at another place. There should be something to connect them and that is your heart. The heart is the connecting link, the bridge. When you want to see God who is in your head, you can easily go from your feet to your head by crossing the safe bridge, the connecting link, which is your heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God makes thunder by His indomitable Will. Thunder, compared to his indomitable Will, is like a tiny insect compared to an infinite number of tigers, lions and elephants.</p>
<p>How does God talk to souls? God talks to souls with His Light, with His Vision. What is Light? Light is something that is everywhere. And what is Vision? Vision is the capacity of the Light. It is like a lamp and a flame. God's Light is the lamp and His Vision is the flame.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Guru flies up to God by crying constantly. He cries to God to give him two wings. God gives him two wings and these two wings constantly carry him up. The name of one wing is 'love' and the name of the other wing is 'surrender'. He loves God and he surrenders to God's Wish and Will. When he loves God, God is pleased. When he surrenders to God, he says, "God, I want to fly, but make me fly only if it is Your Will, only if it is Your Wish." First he loves God, then he tell God he will fly only if it is God's Wish. Because he loves God, God will give him the capacity to fly. If you love God, then surrender your wish to Him. God will give you the capacity to fly to Him as he has given the capacity to your Guru.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God Himself made God. God the Silence made God the Sound. Who is God the Silence? God the Silence is God the Dream. God the Sound is God the manifested Reality.</p>
<p>Who made God? God's Silence. God made Himself because He wished to enjoy. What was he going to enjoy? He was going to enjoy His universal Presence. That is to say, He wanted to enjoy His presence everywhere — inside everyone, inside everything. Why did He want that? He wanted that because if He enjoyed His presence everywhere, then one day the human beings he would create would also be able to enjoy His Presence.</p>
<p>When He was One, He was happy. But He wanted to become Many because He wanted to be happy in a different way. So in two ways He wanted to become happy. When we do something in one way, we are happy, but we may feel there is another way to do it. When God was alone, He created Himself alone, and He was happy. He thought that he should have some other way to become happy so He created Himself in many forms, in infinite countless forms.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The difference that you notice between your closest friend, God, and your other friends is very simple. God thinks that you are as good as He is, as divine as He is, as perfect as He is; whereas your other friends think you may be good, divine and perfect, but they feel that they are better, more divine and more perfect than you are. All your human friends outwardly think and inwardly feel you are not on their level, but you like them, they like you; you love them and they love you. That is why they are your friends and you are their friends. But in God's case, He loves you not because you are His eternal friend, but for something more: you are He and He is you.</p>
