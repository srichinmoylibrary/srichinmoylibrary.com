<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Delight does not come from Reality’s external freedom. Delight does not manifest in and through the external life, the extroverted life. Delight comes only from the silence of Reality’s inner, inseparable love.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What is real delight? Real delight is our constant communion with God. Where can it be found? It can be found only in our constant search for God and in our self-giving to God. How can we apply it to everyday living? We can apply this delight to everyday living if we feel that delight is the only fruit that can nourish us, strengthen us and immortalise us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People experience delight in different ways according to their power of receptivity. If different individuals have the same level of consciousness, they will experience delight in the same way and with the same intensity. Again, seekers who are not on the same plane of consciousness will experience delight in different ways. For example, when you see something from the top of a tree, you see it in one way. When you climb down to the middle of the trunk, you see the same thing in a different way. And when you stand at the foot of the tree, you may see it in still a different way. But again, if you have wide vision, very powerful vision, then from the top of the tree, from the middle of the tree and from the foot of a tree you will see a thing in the same way. This is also true of experiencing delight.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> With the power of aspiration one can consciously enter into Sat-Chit-Ananda and bring down delight into the mind, vital and physical, provided one cares constantly for his Source. He has to feel that his Source is all he needs, he does not need anything else. He wants only the Source and nothing less.</p>
<p>We all know how affectionate our parents can be to us. When we are children, we feel our very existence depends on their kindness, their affection, their loving words, their smile. Always the child runs back to the source, the father and mother. Here our Source is Sat-Chit-Ananda. If we want to go back to our Source with loving joy, loving adoration for the Supreme, then without fail we can bring down the delight that we experience. When we either go deep within or climb high, higher, highest, we can bring down Peace, Light and Bliss and change the mental world in us, the vital world in us and the physical world in us.</p>

What can we do about this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here we have to be sincere. Sometimes it is not actually delight that descends; it is only a kind of pleasure that enters into the seeker from the vital world which he mistakes for delight. This so-called delight naturally cannot and does not last for a long time. The real delight within us knows perfectly well that this is a false delight that is trying to please and satisfy the human in the aspirant, so the real delight comes and pushes aside the false delight. Now, the seeker may have identified himself to such an extent with the first kind of delight that when it leaves him, he feels sad and miserable. When this pleasure goes away, a kind of frustration comes, and in frustration, dissatisfaction looms large.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one way to expand our receptivity and that is through our constant remembrance of what we were, what we are and what we can be. We were animals. We are human beings trying to become divine and perfect. We will, by the Grace of the Absolute Supreme, eventually become divine, perfect and immortal. If we remember this, then automatically we expand our receptivity. Then we experience delight in abundant and boundless measure.</p>

What is the best way for us to spread delight to others around us?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way is through inner communication. If you have meditated with me and you have achieved and received some delight, then afterwards if you see someone, do not talk to him about it. If you tell him about this divine quality, his mind will come forward and you will only be rejected. Also, if you talk about it, your own mind may lose its divinity because the mind is constantly suspecting. Only with the greatest difficulty can we illumine the mind. So please concentrate on the other person’s heart and feel that inside his heart is a big hole or that his heart itself is a hole. Try to put the delight and the other divine qualities that you have received from the Supreme in me into the hearts of those who are around you. Try to spread delight inwardly, in silence. If you do it in silence, it will be most effective.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible for an advanced seeker or a great spiritual Master to experience constant delight in the inner world. For the beginner, however, it is only a passing experience. But one does not remain a beginner forever. A child grows up and, as a grown-up, he acts the way his father or his mother does. In the same way, it is quite possible that there will come a time when one can experience delight constantly. Again, if one is not sincere enough, devoted enough or spiritual enough, naturally delight will always remain a passing experience.</p>

<h2>Question: When the aspirant decides to follow a spiritual path, is this human opportunity, divine opportunity, or both?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the aspirant decides to follow a spiritual path, it is not a human opportunity; it is a divine opportunity. More than that, it is a supreme opportunity. Human opportunity once lost is lost forever. Divine opportunity comes and goes and goes and comes. The supreme opportunity has the magnetic pull to lift the seeker to the highest plane of consciousness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there are always opportunities in life for spiritual development, but if we avail ourselves of the opportunities each time they knock at our door, we can realise and manifest the Highest sooner than otherwise. Further, if we take each experience as a golden opportunity, we can become the colossal pride of our Pilot Supreme.</p>
