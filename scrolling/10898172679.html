  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What are the devas? Do they follow the evolution of man, and do they help the evolution of man?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What are the devas? Do they follow the evolution of man, and do they help the evolution of man?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The devas are the cosmic gods. The cosmic gods are higher than angels. They do not take human incarnation, but they do protect, encourage, inspire and bless human beings here on earth. It is through their inspiration, their encouragement, their blessings and their concern that man gets a faster and higher evolution. The devas themselves will not attach themselves to a human soul or enter into a human incarnation, but they do help us and guide us from Above. They themselves do not walk on our path or run towards our Goal, but they do push us towards it.</p>
<p>The devas, or cosmic gods, are not evolving beings. Human beings evolve and evolve and evolve. We are constantly going beyond ourselves. Our very humanity will be transcended ultimately. The gods, however, are not evolving. They do not want our ultimate Goal; they are satisfied with the consciousness that they have. They are full of divine light and delight; they are very pure and very luminous. They are divine instruments of knowledge and power. Right now, needless to say, they have more than we have. But, believe it or not, a day will come when we will become fully realised and remain constantly in union with the Supreme. At that time, we will actually have gone beyond them. At that time, we will not need their help, and they will not be able to affect us or influence us.</p>
<p>Right now the cosmic gods help man with their love, their concern and their joy. But you may be surprised to hear that a time comes when the cosmic gods actually stand in our way. When we no longer need their help and have the capacity to go to the Highest, to the Absolute Supreme, they do not want us to go beyond them. It is like a father and son: the father helps the son when the son is a student. But when the father sees that the son is going beyond him, if the father is narrow-minded or jealous, he may find some reason to stop giving the son money to continue his studies. But if the father is large-hearted, he says, "I did not achieve what my son can achieve. I do not have the education that he is going to have. But let him have it. Let him go beyond me. Let him surpass me." If the father is noble, he feels this and does this.</p>
<p>Some of the cosmic gods, unfortunately, stand in our way at the last moment before our self-realisation, at the last milestone of our journey. At the beginning of our journey they push us and pull us, saying, "Go, go towards the Goal!" But when we are about to reach the Goal and we no longer need their help, they stand in our way. Why? They do not like us to go beyond their jurisdiction. Every conscious being in this whole universe and beyond it, except the Supreme, cherishes his own sovereignty and guards his own realm. Every authority on earth and in Heaven is gratified by the devotion of his subjects and does not like to see them go to another authority. It is the old problem of separativity or ego, but on a very high, subtle level. Still, it is there. That is why we have to forgive the cosmic gods. It is like a parent who does not want his child to leave home because the parent will lose his influence over the child whom he loves and to whom he is attached.</p>
<p>Here I am telling you the absolute truth. Otherwise, people will be under the impression that the cosmic gods help us all the time. No, they help us for many, many incarnations, for hundreds of incarnations. Many, many souls would be nowhere if it were not for the compassion of the cosmic gods. They save human beings from disaster, ruin and many, many catastrophes, including death. They are responsible for most of the higher ideas and ideals that human beings get in their inspired moments. In their own way they are great and divine instruments of the Supreme. But when the seeker is about to merge into the Highest, at that time they do not help.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why is Mother Kali represented with four arms?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why is Mother Kali represented with four arms?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, I wish to tell you that this is the conception of the artists. Mother Kali is the Divine Mother in her power aspect, and she is not at all like the representations which you see in pictures and posters. In the highest world she is golden, most beautiful and most luminous. When she enters into the vital worlds to fight against fear, darkness, imperfection, obscurity and ignorance, she assumes a divinely heroic quality. Yet even in the vital world, she does not look like the pictures that you see. The Indian artists traditionally insist on portraying her this way. They feel that when she is striking the hostile forces, cutting them with her scimitar and so on, she must look like this. But when the real Mother Kali assumes human form, even while she is fighting against ignorance, she has only two arms.</p>
<p>In the pictures we see four arms, each performing a different action. With the arm wielding the scimitar, Kali is striking the hostile forces. The second arm holds the trident which is the weapon and emblem of her consort, Lord Shiva. This weapon symbolises his power. So this second arm is shown holding and using Shiva's power. The third arm she is holding aloft the head of the greatest demon, Mahasura, whom she has conquered and killed. And with the fourth arm she holds the vessel which is catching the blood pouring from his severed head.</p>
<p>This is all the pure imagination of the artist. In India we have a set of sacred books called the <em>Puranas</em>. They are not as well known in the West as the <em>Gita,</em> but in India they are very well known and well loved. They are full of simple, colourful stories about great Indian deities. In those books you will read about Kali and all her battles in the inner worlds. It is Mother Kali who represents the transforming Power of the Supreme. She kills the hostile forces in our human nature and takes us as quickly as possible to the Highest. She does not kill the human being; she kills only the imperfection and obscurity in our human lives.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Will you explain the soundless sound?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Will you explain the soundless sound?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When two things are struck together they produce a sound. When I strike my hands together I produce a physical sound. Sound is normally the result of some impact. When we want to produce any sound, two things must be brought together in some way.</p>
<p>AUM is called the soundless sound because we do not strike any object with any other object in order to produce it. Because it is unstruck, it is known as the soundless sound. In Sanskrit, this phenomenon is called <em>Anahata,</em> which means literally 'unstruck'. We can hear the sound in the inmost recesses of our heart, but we ourselves do not do anything to create it; it is created spontaneously. We only receive AUM or hear it.</p>
<p>On the physical plane AUM is a physical sound like any other sound. But permeating the physical sound is a higher divine vibration. This spiritual vibration comes from its connection with the inner reality of the universal AUM, which is the life-breath of the whole creation.</p>
<p>We call AUM the soundless sound although with our ordinary ears we may hear this sound produced in the ordinary way in the outer world. But we can also hear it in the inner world if we have a special kind of hearing. We can hear the unstruck AUM with our spiritual ears. It is not the same sound that we hear with our physical ears. The inner AUM comes from an inner world and its sound is altogether different. With our human ears we cannot hear it. We must have a different type of hearing if we want to hear the true soundless sound.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How is the inner sound produced?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How is the inner sound produced?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not actually produced; it spontaneously exists. Everything that can be known or seen in the material world has a source, whereas this soundless sound has no source. Its origin is the Supreme, whom we call Brahman. AUM is a symbol of Brahman. It is the Source itself. If we know that the Ganges comes from the Himalayas, we can climb to the top of the Himalayas and see the source for ourselves. But we will never find a source for the soundless sound. It is like trying to find the origin of the Supreme. It is its own origin. That is why it is difficult for us to understand.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When an accident or something serious is about to take place, your utterance is an expression of your inner cry. At that time you need not repeat the name of the Supreme in a slow, prolonged manner. When danger is approaching, if you repeat 'Supreme' quickly and intensely, there is nothing wrong in it. It is an expression of the soul's cry for immediate intervention of the divine protection.</p>
<p>When one is pronouncing the Supreme's Name, one has to know what the purpose is. At the time of meditation or as part of one's inner spiritual discipline, one has to say it slowly and soulfully. Even then, this does not mean that you have to prolong the word as long as possible. You can say the Name very soulfully with love, reverence and devotion at a normal speed. But in an emergency, when danger is threatening, if 'Supreme' comes from the depths of the heart like an intense cry, then it is also most soulful, although it is fast.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In such cases, the best thing will be for you not to say anything to him. If you feel that you really want to help him, then you can spend five minutes of your most precious time in inner prayer, asking the Supreme to give him some illumination. He <em>is</em> ignorant, but if you tell him that he is ignorant, he will only be angry. If you feel from within that it is your duty or that it will be worthwhile, then you can pray to the Supreme for his illumination.</p>
<p>You have to know whether that man is basically good or not. If he is basically good, you can offer five minutes of your prayer to the Supreme to change his attitude towards God. If he is basically not good, you need not spend even five minutes on him, because it will not do him any good. At God's Hour, God Himself will illumine this man and make him realise the error of his ways. He is, after all, God's child, and God Himself is hearing him. As God is hearing your prayers and observing your meditation, so also God is listening to his curses. Fortunately, God has enough strength to bear his insults.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Since we cannot slaughter the soul or destroy the soul in any way, it is the same kind of soul. Through evolution a soul may go through a specific experience, but this does not mean that it is a different type of soul. Who knows, perhaps when we were in the animal kingdom, we were also slaughtered, if we were lambs or goats or cows. But now our souls have passed through so many incarnations. A certain kind of death does not require a certain kind of soul. It is just an experience. While walking from one place to another we can walk along a road that is very beautiful, or along another road that is desolate, but the destination is the same.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He could definitely create a different world if He wanted to, but it seems that He is not going to create a totally new world. He is like a great-great-grandfather who enjoys watching His children, His children's children, and so forth. He enjoys the game. For Him it is a daily affair that his great-great-grandchildren fight and quarrel. Of course He wants the members of His family to lead a harmonious life, but He does not plan to destroy His entire creation for a new creation. He believes in evolution.</p>
<p>The Supreme has been feeding and nurturing His present creation for so many years. True, satisfaction is still a far cry. But if He decides to start all over from the beginning, He has an apprehension that His next world may be worse. So He continues with the hope that light will descend on this present family, and it will eventually be illumined. In the process of evolution there is no such thing as perfection descending from Above all of a sudden. Gradually, light has to be received, and then the difference between light and darkness has to be recognised. Otherwise we shall not value light.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, but we have to know for what purpose — for meditation, or for gossip? For my disciples I advise six or seven hours of sleep. Six or seven hours is necessary, but not eight, nine or ten hours.</p>
<p>If you become like me, then after one hour of sleep you can make yourself feel that you have slept for five hours. The clock will say one hour, but your mind and body will say five hours. However, until you have that yogic capacity, six or seven hours is absolutely necessary for you and others. Four or five hours I do not advise. If you cannot get six or seven hours at night, then sleep sometime during the day. During your lunch break eat for ten minutes and then, instead of talking with your colleagues, go into your office and sleep for half an hour or forty-five minutes. That will help.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why did He create you? Why did He create me? For the sake of spontaneous joy. When astronomers look at the stars, they get joy. In this world you may find that flowers give you joy. Others will like the stars, and still others will like something else. God created everything for His own Joy, and the different parts of His creation get joy from each other. I get joy by seeing something; you get joy by seeing something else. God gets Joy from all of His creation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it really possible to empty your mind of thoughts?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it really possible to empty your mind of thoughts?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, with regular practice. Early in the morning you are meditating for, let us say, fifteen minutes. During your meditation if you are getting twenty uncomely thoughts, restless thoughts, then after a month of serious practice, you can watch again to see how many thoughts you are getting. Gradually you will see how many uncomely thoughts you have eliminated. Again, if you get one illumining or fulfilling thought, you can gradually try to get more. It is like running in the outer life — from one mile at a time you progress to two, then three, and so on. Perhaps you started at a ten-minute pace, but gradually your regular practice enables you to go faster. Like this, gradually you will be able to go beyond the thought-world. There will be some thoughts floating in your mind, but you will not be affected by them. Thought-power can create problems for us or help us. A really good thought is the soul's vision operating in the mind.</p>

Is there any way we can break through that barrier?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have reached a certain height and you feel a block? Suppose you have meditated for fifteen minutes or half an hour, and you feel frustration that you are unable to go higher. On that day give up but remember that height, and try to remember the joy of that height. Feel happy that you reached a considerable height, and keep up the ecstasy and joy. The next day you do not have to start from the beginning and climb all the way up again. Just by using your willpower and your previous experiences, you can start very high — almost from where you stopped during your previous meditation. You know how far you went up yesterday, and from there you can try to go higher. Keep up your joy about the height you reached the previous day, and the following day make an attempt to go beyond it right from the start.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that time I often feel that you are all pilgrims and I am the leader. We are all enjoying the pilgrimage. I am walking along Eternity's Road, and you are all following me. On the outer plane, you are all waiting in place for my blessings, but actually I see your souls following me while I am walking.</p>

Do we all have the same inner structure?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have a physical body, a subtle body and a causal body. Whatever we have in the physical body, we have the same in the subtle body. But in the causal body there is no limit. If we want to, we can have five or six arms the way the Indian gods and goddesses have. If the seeker has made progress, if he wants to have a different kind of structure in the inner body, he can, but only for his own fulfilment. If I have ten hands or arms or legs, I will not be able to accomplish something more on the inner plane. There we are dealing with will-power. We do not need a different kind of structure in order to achieve something in the inner world. Somebody can be very thin in the inner world but still have tremendous strength. If one has made tremendous progress, he can totally change his inner structure. But there are many who do not do that, because it is absolutely unnecessary.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there any danger of disciples becoming attached to the Master?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there any danger of disciples becoming attached to the Master?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on how they think of their Master. If you take the Master as a God-realised soul, there is no problem. But if you take him as a human being, then there may be a problem. If you are attached to the sky, can this cause any emotional problem for you? No. If you are attached to the ocean, is there any problem? But if you are attached to a certain tree or a certain house, then you are in trouble. If you consider your Master as only an inch higher than you are, or only a foot higher than you in inner wisdom, then there is a great danger in becoming attached to him. You have to consider your Master as something vaster than the vastest. If you are attached to the sky or the sun or something very vast, that is not the same as human attachment. That is only your eagerness to grow into that enormous height or expanse or capacity. But if you think of the Master as you would any ordinary person and consider that he is just a little better than you are, then you are in trouble.</p>
<p>Three or four years ago my brother, who is dearer than the dearest to me, wrote: "I know who you are. You are for the Infinite and in the Infinite. But why do you blame your disciples for thinking of you as another human being? It is so difficult for them. They see you eating like them, shouting, barking, struggling, so naturally they can't fathom who you are." So it depends on how the disciple approaches the Master — what kind of relationship he has. If you have the inner feeling that I am infinitely higher or vaster than you, then you cannot try to bind me. Your attachment is destructive only when you feel you can bind and possess me. If you are giving me whatever capacity you have for love and devotion, with the hope that I will be able to give you more, then you are safe. You are giving your little capacity to the Master, and he will give you his limitless capacity. Your own faith, understanding, love and consciousness you have to apply in order to know whether you are trying to possess your Master or trying to become part and parcel of his universal existence.</p>
<p>So attachment is very bad if you think of your Master only on the physical plane. But if you take your Master as a God-realised soul whose existence is limitless, then you cannot be attached. You can be attached to something which is a little higher than you or better than you. But if you think of something or someone as truly vast, then you will be devoted, and not attached.</p>
