  <h2 id="page-title">The Brahman of the Upanishads</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Brahman of the Upanishads" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Yale University; New Haven, Connecticut, USA</em><br /><em>8 December 1971</em></p>
<p>The heart of the Upanishads is most meaningful and most fruitful because it embodies the life of the Brahman. Brahman is Reality in existence; Brahman is Reality’s existence. The eternal Truth of the Brahman is in the finite, beyond the finite, in the Infinite, and beyond the ever-transcending Infinite.</p>
<p>In the domain of realisation, Brahman is the Sovereign Absolute. In the domain of revelation, Brahman is the omnipresent Reality. In the field of manifestation, Brahman is the immortalising Perfection.</p>
<p>Brahman the Creator is the Consciousness-Light; Brahman the Fulfiller is the Consciousness-Delight. Brahman is the inner Soul of all and the only Goal in all.</p>
<p>When we look within, Brahman is Consciousness-Force. When we look without, Brahman is Self-manifestation. When we think of Brahman with the earth-bound mind, the limited mind, the sophisticated mind, the unaspiring mind, our life becomes sheer frustration. When we meditate on Brahman in the heart, in the silent recesses of the heart, our life becomes pure illumination.</p>
<p>To a non-seeker, Brahman is unknowable. To a beginner-seeker, Brahman is unknown. To a Master-seeker, Brahman is knowable, Brahman is known. Further, he himself grows into the Consciousness of Brahman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sarvam khalvidam brahma</em></p>
<p><em>Indeed, all is Brahman.</em></p>
<p>The Eternal is existence within. The Eternal is existence without.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no abiding happiness in the finite. It is only in the Infinite that we can hear the message of eternal Delight: Anandam Brahmaand Anantam Brahma. These are the two major aspects of Brahman. Anandam Brahma is the life of the all-illumining Delight and the all-fulfilling Delight. Anantam Brahma is the life of Infinity.</p>
<p>Here on earth the life of Infinity constantly grows for the fulfilment of the Absolute Brahman. That is why the Upanishadic Seers sing from the depths of their hearts about the Transcendental Delight of the Brahman:</p>

<p><em>Anandaddhyeva khalvimani bhutani jayante</em><br /><em>Anandena jatani jivanti</em><br /><em>Anandam prayantyabhisamvisanti</em></p>
<p>From the Transcendental Delight we came into existence;<br /> In Delight we grow and play our respective roles; and,<br /> At the end of our journey’s close, we enter into the Supreme Delight.</p>

<p>Again, when the Seers saw Infinity in Brahman, they sang:</p>

<p><em>Aum</em><br /><em>Purnam adah purnam idam purnat purnam udacyate</em><br /><em>Purnasya purnam adaya purnam evavasisyate</em></p>
<p>Infinity is that. Infinity is this.<br /> From Infinity, Infinity has come into existence.<br /> From Infinity, when Infinity is taken away, Infinity remains.</p>

<p>Brahman is active. Brahman is inactive. The active Brahman inwardly does and outwardly becomes. Also, the active Brahman outwardly does and inwardly becomes. But the inactive Brahman is the total freedom of inaction and complete freedom in inaction.</p>
<p>Brahmam is at once the eternal Unborn and the eternal birth and growth of existence. Brahman is ignorance-night. Brahman is knowledge-light. Brahman the ignorance-night needs total transformation. Brahman the knowledge-light needs complete manifestation.</p>
<p>The whole universe came into existence from Brahman the Seed. When Brahman wanted to project Himself, He first projected Himself through four significant worlds: <em>Ambhas</em>, the highest world; <em>Marici</em>, the sky; <em>Mara</em> the mortal world, the earth; and <em>Apa</em>, the world beneath earth.</p>
<p>Then Brahman sent forth the guardians of these worlds. Next, He sent forth food for them. Then Brahman came to realise that He Himself had to take part in His Cosmic Game, so He entered into the Cosmic Lila (Game) through His own Yogic power. First He entered into the human body through the skull. The door by which Brahman entered is called the door of Delight. This door is the highest centre of consciousness. This is known as sahasrara, the thousand-petalled lotus. It is situated in the centre of the brain. The realisation of the Yogi enters there and becomes one with the Consciousness of the Brahman.</p>
<p>Brahman has many names, but His secret name is ‘Aum’.</p>

<p><em>Pranavo dhanuh saro hiyatma brahma tallaksyam</em></p>
<p>Aum is the bow and Atman, the Self, is the arrow;<br /> Brahman is the target.</p>

<p>Through repeated practice the arrow is fixed into the target, the Brahmic Consciousness. That is to say, through regular concentration, meditation and contemplation, the seeker enters into the Absolute Consciousness of the Brahman.</p>
<p>Creation is the supreme sacrifice of the Brahman. Creation is by no means a mechanical construction. Creation is a spiritual act, supremely revealing, manifesting and fulfilling the divine splendour of the Brahman. The divine Architect is beyond Creation and, at the same time, manifests Himself in and through Creation.</p>
<p>Brahman created out of His Being priests, warriors, tradesmen and servants. Then He created the Law. Nothing can be higher than this Law. This Law is Truth. When a man speaks the Truth, he declares the Law. When he declares the Law, he speaks the Truth. The Truth and the Law are one, inseparable.</p>
<p>Indian mythology has divided Time — not earth-bound time but eternal Time — into four divisions: <em>satyayuga</em>, <em>tretayuga</em>, <em>dvaparayuga</em>, and <em>kaliyuga</em>. According to many, we are now in the <em>kaliyuga</em>. Brahman in the <em>kaliyuga</em> is fast asleep. He is in inconscience — ignorance-mire. In the <em>dvaparayuga</em>, He awakes and He looks around. In the <em>tretayuga</em>, He stands up, about to move forward. In the <em>satyayuga</em>, the Golden Age, He moves fast, faster, fastest, towards His Goal. The message of the Vedas, the eternal message of the Aryan culture and civilisation, the realisation of the Indian Sages and Seers, is movement, inner progress, life’s march towards the Destined Goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Caraiveti caraiveti</em> Move on, move on!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Gayatri Mantra</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Gayatri Mantra" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Columbia University; New York, New York, USA</em><br /><em>10 December 1971</em></p>

<p><em>Aum bhur bhuvah svah</em><br /><em>Tat savitur varenyam</em><br /><em>Bhargo devasya dhimahi</em><br /><em>Dhiyo yo nah pracodayat</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We meditate on the transcendental Glory of the Deity Supreme, who is inside the heart of the earth, inside the life of the sky and inside the soul of the Heaven. May He stimulate and illumine our minds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Gayatri Mantra is the most hallowed mantra of the Vedas. It is the mother of all the mantras. Mantra means ‘incantation’. A mantra can be a one-syllable word or a few words, a sentence or a few sentences. The Gayatri Mantra can offer to the sincere seeker the Light of the Infinite, the Delight of the Eternal and the Life of the Immortal.</p>
<p>The Gayatri Mantra has four feet. The first foot consists of the earth, sky and Heaven. The second foot consists of the <em>Rig Veda</em>, the <em>Yajur Veda</em> and the <em>Sama Veda</em>. The third foot consists of <em>prana</em>, <em>apana</em> and <em>vyana</em>. The fourth foot consists of the Sun, the solar being.</p>
<p>A seeker of the Infinite Truth must meditate on the Gayatri Mantra. The result that he will get is incalculable.</p>
<p><em>Bhumi</em>, earth; <em>antariksa</em>, sky; and <em>dyauh</em>, Heaven, make up the first foot of the Gayatri. Whoever realises the significance of the first foot wins everything that is in those three worlds.</p>
<p><em>Rcah</em>, <em>Yajumsi</em>, <em>Samani</em>, make up the second foot of the Gayatri. Whoever realises the second foot of the Gayatri wins the knowledge-sea of the three Vedas.</p>
<p><em>Prana</em>, <em>apana</em>, and <em>vyana</em>, the three forms of the vital force, make up the third foot of the Gayatri. The knower of this foot wins all the living creatures that exist in the universe.</p>
<p><em>Turiyam</em>, the quaternary, the Solar Being Transcendental who alone shines, is the fourth foot. He who realises this fourth foot shines with infinite magnificence.</p>
<p>Subtle is the path to <em>moksa</em>, liberation. Hard is the path to liberation. But a genuine seeker can reach the Goal solely by meditating on the Gayatri Mantra. When one is freed from the fetters of ignorance, one grows into the supernal Glory of the Transcendental Self. Liberation can be achieved, must be achieved, while the seeker’s soul is in the body. To fail to realise God on earth is to swim in the sea of ignorance with two more swimmers: ignorant birth and shameless death. Liberation attained, the bonds of grief destroyed. Before liberation, like the Buddha, we have to proclaim, “This fleeting world is the abode of sorrow.”</p>
<p>The teeming desire-night that has occupied the heart of the seeker must needs be driven out by the glowing aspiration-light. This done, the seeker attains to the Brahman. An Immortal he becomes. The Light Eternal is his new name. Today the seeker feels that the Gayatri is his mind’s inspiration. Tomorrow he will feel that the Gayatri is his soul’s realisation.</p>

<p>With inspiration a seeker sees the Truth.<br /> With aspiration a seeker realises the Truth.<br /> With realisation a seeker becomes the Truth.</p>
<p>Inspiration is might.<br /> Aspiration is light.<br /> Realisation is life.</p>
<p>Inspiration runs.<br /> Aspiration flies.<br /> Realisation dives.</p>
<p>Inspiration is the Smile of God.<br /> Aspiration is the Cry of God.<br /> Realisation is the Love of God.</p>

<p>The Gayatri is eternal knowledge divine. When this knowledge dawns in the seeker’s aspiring heart, he need no longer seek for anything, either on earth or in Heaven. He reveals what he achieves. He manifests what he reveals.</p>
<p>In the Vedas there are two most significant words: <em>satya</em> and <em>rta</em>. <em>Satya</em> is Truth in its pure existence. <em>Rta</em> is Truth in its dynamic movement. There is another word, <em>brhat</em>, which means ‘vastness in form’. What we call creation is the manifestation of the Unmanifest, <em>asat</em>. According to our scriptures, the manifestation took place with the <em>anahatadhvani</em>, the soundless sound, Aum.</p>
<p>The Gayatri is dedicated to <em>Savitr</em>, the Creator. The root of the word <em>Savitr</em> is <em>su</em>, ‘to create’ or ‘to loose forth’. This mantra is known also as <em>Savitri Mantra</em>, for <em>Savitri</em> is the shakti of <em>Savitr</em>. This mantra was envisioned by Visvamitra, the great Rishi. <em>Savitr</em> is regarded as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Brahma, the Creator, with Brahmani as his shakti; Vishnu, the Preserver, with his shakti, Vaisnavi; and Shiva or Rudra, the Destroyer, with his Shakti, Rudrani, regularly visit the Brahman. The eagle is the vehicle-bird of Vishnu. The swan is the vehicle-bird of Brahma. The bull is the vehicle-beast of Shiva.</p>
<p>The Gayatri Mantra is the divine magnetic needle. The magnetic needle points to the north, hence the ship does not lose its direction. The Gayatri Mantra always points to the Transcendental Height of the Supreme, hence the seeker does not miss his Goal: Existence-Consciousness-Bliss.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The journey’s start, the journey’s close</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The journey’s start, the journey’s close" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Cornell University; Ithaca, New York, USA</em><br /><em>26 January 1972</em></p>
<p>The journey’s start and the journey’s close. Human aspiration is the journey’s start. Divine manifestation is the journey’s close. Birthless is the journey’s birth, and endless is the journey’s end.</p>
<p>We came; we shall return. We came from the Supreme Being. To the Supreme Being we shall return. We embody the earth-consciousness and the Heaven-Consciousness. The earth-consciousness inspires us to meditate on the Transcendental Truth and realise the Transcendental Truth in the soul of Heaven. The Heaven-Consciousness inspires us to meditate on love and manifest love in the heart of earth.</p>
<p>We know, we grow and we become. We know in Heaven. We grow here on earth. We become the Transcendental Truth. What we know is Reality. What we grow into is Immortality. What we eventually become is Divinity’s Perfection. Reality embodies Immortality and Divinity. Immortality and Divinity manifest Reality.</p>
<p>The Upanishads teach us the significant truth that each individual seeker must have inner peace and outer freedom. It is only through inner peace that we can have true outer freedom. From the Upanishads we learn how to discover God, the inner man, and see man, the revealed God. The Upanishads tell us that the dedicated human beings, the surrendered human souls, are God’s necessity, and each realised human being is given God’s unreserved, infinite capacity.</p>
<p>Here is the secret of the Upanishads: love, serve and become. Love God’s Life in man, serve God’s Light in man, and become God’s perfect Perfection here on earth.</p>
<p>In two words we can sum up the message of all the Upanishads: aspiration and manifestation. Aspiration is the way and manifestation is the Goal. Aspiration is the song of the infinite, eternal Consciousness abiding within us. Manifestation is the dance of unity’s multiplicity within and without us. Aspiration is the height of our Delight, and manifestation is the light of all-nourishing and all-fulfilling Delight.</p>
<p>Each soul needs involution and evolution. When the soul descends, it is the soul’s involution. When the soul ascends, it is the soul’s evolution. The soul enters into the lowest abyss of inconscience. The soul evolves again into Sacchidananda — Existence-Consciousness-Bliss — the triple Consciousness.</p>
<p>The soul enters into inconscience. For millions of years it remains there, fast asleep. All of a sudden, one day a spark of consciousness from the ever-transcending Beyond opens its eye and then the hour strikes for self-enquiry. “Who am I?” it asks. The answer is “Tat twam asi—That thou art.” The soul is thrilled. Then again it falls asleep. Again it enters into self-oblivion. More questions arise after some time: Whose am I? I am of That. Where have I come from? From That. To Whom am I returning? To That. For Whom am I here on earth? For That.</p>
<p>Then the soul is satisfied. The soul now is fully prepared for its journey upward — high, higher, highest. At this moment the soul sees the Self, an exact prototype of the Supreme Being here on earth, and the evolution of the soul starts properly. The soul, from the mineral life, enters into the plant life, from the plant into the animal life, from the animal life into the human, and from the human into the divine life. While in the human life, the soul brings down Peace, Light, and Bliss from Above. First it offers these divine qualities to the heart, then to the mind, then to the vital, then to the gross physical. When illumination takes place, we see it in the heart, we see it in the physical mind, in the vital, and in the gross physical body.</p>
<p>The Upanishads are also called Vedanta. Vedanta means ‘the end of the Vedas, the cream of the Vedas, the essence of the Vedas’. It is said that Vedanta is the end of all difference — the point where there can be no difference between the lowest and the Highest, between the finite and the Infinite.</p>
<p>Our journey starts with aspiration. What is aspiration? It is the inner cry, inner hunger, for the infinite Vast. Aspiration has a most sincere friend — concentration. How do we concentrate? Where do we concentrate? We concentrate on an object, on a being, on a form, or on the formless. When we concentrate with the help of the mind, we feel that eventually we shall see the vastness of the Truth. When we concentrate with the help of the heart, we feel that one day we shall feel our intimacy with the Universal Consciousness and God the eternal Beloved. When we concentrate with the help of our soul’s Light, we feel that man is God in His preparation, and God is man in his culmination.</p>
<p>The unaspiring mind is our real problem. The human mind is necessary to some extent. Without it we would remain in the animal domain. But we have to know that the human mind is very limited. The human mind is insufficient. In the human mind there cannot be any abiding light, life or delight. The human mind tells us that the finite is the finite, the Infinite is the Infinite and there is a yawning gulf between the two. They are like the North Pole and the South Pole. Whatever is Infinite can never be finite and vice-versa. Infinity, the human mind feels, is unattainable. When something is finite, it is simply impossible for the human mind to feel that that, too, is God. Also, this mind quite often feels that because of His Greatness, God is aloof and indifferent.</p>
<p>When we meditate in the heart, we come to realise that God is infinite and God is omnipotent. If He is infinite, on the strength of His omnipotence He can also be finite. He exists in our multifarious activities; He is everywhere. He includes everything; He excludes nothing. This is what our inner meditation can offer us. Our heart’s meditation also tells us that God is dearer than the dearest and that He is our only Beloved.</p>
<p>Inspiration, aspiration and realisation — these are the three rungs of the spiritual ladder. When we want to climb from the finite to the Infinite with God’s boundless Bounty, the first rung is inspiration, the second rung is aspiration and the third rung is realisation, our Destined Goal.</p>
<p>To achieve the Highest, we become inspiration, aspiration and realisation; and to manifest the Highest here on earth, we become compassion, concern and love. This is how we start our journey; this is how we end our journey. Again, when we become one with the Inner Pilot, inseparably one with the Inner Pilot, there is no beginning, there is no end. His Cosmic Lila, divine Game, is birthless and endless.</p>
<p>In human realisation, God within us is aspiration and realisation bound by earth-consciousness, bound by earthly time. But in divine realisation, God is the Beyond, the ever-transcending Beyond. He plays the Game of the ever-transcending Beyond. He Himself is the aspiration of the ever-transcending Beyond, and He Himself is the manifestation of the ever-transcending Beyond. When we consciously know Him, realise Him and become inseparably one with Him, we, too, play His divine Game, the Game of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Life and death, atman and paramatman</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Life and death, atman and paramatman" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Brown University; Providence, Rhode Island, USA</em><br /><em>9 February 1972</em></p>
<p>The Upanishads come from the Vedas. They contain the records of eternal Truths. These Truths were discovered by various Seers at different times and handed down to humanity.</p>
<p>Life is a problem. Even so, is death. The aspiring Aryans of the hoary past wanted to solve these two problems. Soon they came to realise that their senses could be of almost no help to them in solving these two major problems. They also came to realise that it is the knowledge of the Ultimate Reality alone that can solve, once and for all, the problems of life and death.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, two divine soldiers came in. Nobody knows where they came from. These two soldiers were inspiration and aspiration. The first soldier, inspiration, commanded them: “Give up the study of the body.” They immediately did so. The second soldier, aspiration, commanded them: “Take up the study of the soul.” They immediately did so. Lo, the King and the Queen from the Golden Shore of the Beyond garlanded them, the seekers, the Seers, and the Knowers of Light and Truth.</p>
<p>What do the Upanishads actually mean? If you ask a Western seeker, he will immediately say, “Very simple. Sit at the feet of the Master and learn.” If you ask an Eastern seeker the same question, he will quietly say, “Very difficult. Transform human darkness into divine Light.” Both the Western and the Eastern seeker are perfectly right. No Master, no discovery of the Transcendental Reality. No transformation of darkness, no manifestation of Divinity on earth.</p>
<p>Who needs the Truth? A seeker. When does he achieve the Truth? He achieves the Truth when he becomes the surrendered and divine lover.</p>

<p>His first achievement is God the Creator.<br /> His second achievement is God the Preserver.<br /> His third achievement is God the Transformer.<br /> His fourth achievement is: Thou art That.<br /> His fifth achievement is: I am That.<br /> His sixth achievement is: He and I are one.<br /> His seventh achievement is: He am I.</p>
<p>In the Creator he sees.<br /> In the Preserver he feels.<br /> In the Transformer he becomes.</p>

<p>The heart of the Upanishads is the <em>Purusa</em>. The life of the <em>Purusa</em> is the message of the Upanishads. Who is the <em>Purusa</em>? The <em>Purusa</em> is the real dweller in the body of the universe. The <em>Purusa</em> is three-fold: the outer <em>atman</em>, the inner <em>Atman</em>, and the <em>Paramatman</em>.</p>
<p>The outer atman is the gross physical body. The outer atman is that which grows in the body, with the body and for the body. The outer atman is the identification of one’s body with the gross aspect of life. Here we live, we are hurt, we hurt others, we enjoy pleasure from others, we offer pleasure to others. This atman exists, changes, develops and, finally, decays.</p>
<p>The inner <em>Atman</em> is the discriminating Self. The inner <em>Atman</em> identifies itself with the aspiring earth-consciousness. It identifies itself with air, ether, fire, water and earth. The inner Atman is the thinker, the doer and the direct messenger of God. The inner <em>Atman</em> manifests its inner realisation through outer experience.</p>
<p>The <em>Paramatman</em> reveals itself through the process of Yoga. Neither is it born, nor does it die. It is beyond all qualities. It is all-pervading, unimaginable and indescribable. It is Eternity’s Reality and Reality’s Divinity.</p>
<p>Each Upanishad is a mighty drop from the fountain of eternal Life. This drop can easily cure the teeming ills of human life. The infinite power of this drop can free us from the endless rotation of human birth and death.</p>
<p>The mind, assisted by the body, creates bondage. The heart, assisted by the soul, offers liberation. The unaspiring mind thinks useless thoughts and down it sinks. It thinks too much and sinks too fast. The blind body is constantly digging its own grave. The heart wants to love and be loved. God gives the heart the life of oneness. The soul wants to reveal God. God fulfils the soul and, by doing so, He brings down the message of Perfection in the Divinity of manifested Reality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Existence, non-existence and the source</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Existence, non-existence and the source" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>University of Connecticut at Storrs; Storrs, Connecticut, USA</em><br /><em>11 February 1972</em></p>
<p><em>Sat</em> and <em>asat</em> are two terms in Indian philosophy which one very often comes across. <em>Sat</em> means ‘existence’, and asat means ‘non-existence’. Existence is something that becomes, that grows and that fulfils. Non-existence is something that negates its own reality and its own divinity. Existence is everywhere, but existence has its value or its meaning only when divinity is visible in it. If divinity does not loom large in existence, then that existence is useless. Divinity is the life-breath of existence. Divinity fulfils our aspiring consciousness and reveals our own Immortality here on earth only when we see divinity as something infinite and eternal.</p>
<p>Existence is cherished by the aspiring consciousness and by God’s own highest Reality. Reality and existence have to go together. Reality without existence is an impossibility, and existence without reality is an absurdity. Divine Reality and divine Existence always go together.</p>
<p>Existence expresses itself only through Truth. This Truth conquers everything that is untruth. India’s motto, <em>Satyam eva jayate</em>, means ‘Truth alone triumphs’. What is this Truth? This Truth is at once the Depth of God’s Heart and the Height of God’s Head.</p>
<p>Truth is our inner promise. Our inner promise, our soul’s promise, is that in this incarnation we will realise God, not by hook or by crook, but under the able guidance of our spiritual Master, because we feel that this is what the Supreme within us wants. What for? So that we can serve Him in His own Way.</p>
<p>The highest way of feeling this Truth is to feel this: “If He does not want me to realise Him in this incarnation, but in some future incarnation, I am fully prepared to abide by His decision.” But the seeker must have a dynamic feeling. If he just says, “Oh, let me play my role. Let me be nice, sincere, truthful, obedient and, when the time comes, He will do it all,” then relaxation comes. Very often when we say, “Let me play my role, and God will take care of my realisation,” God does take care of our realisation. But if we feel that if we can become fully realised as soon as possible, then we can be of real help to God, then we are bound to get our realisation faster.</p>
<p>If we have peace, light and bliss, only then can we be of real service to mankind. The idea of God-realisation at God’s choice Hour must come from the very depths of our heart, and not from our mental knowledge. Unfortunately, it usually does not come from the heart; it comes only from the clever mind which says, “I have read in books and I have heard from the Master that if I do not want anything from God, then God will give me everything.” It is better to pray to God to give you peace of mind so that you can see the Truth in its totality. To ask God for peace of mind is not a crime. If you do not have peace of mind, wherever you are, whether in the subway, or in the country, or in Times Square, there will be no God there for you. God has given us some intelligence. In the morning if you say, “God, it is up to You whether I eat or not. I will just stay here in bed,” God is not going to put food into your mouth. No, God has given you the necessary intelligence to know that you have to put forth some effort. You have to leave the bed and take a shower and eat by your own effort.</p>
<p>In the inner life, if you want purity, humility, peace of mind and other divine qualities, then you have to make an effort to get them. It is true that if you do not pray to God for anything then He will give you everything, but this truth has to be understood in its highest sense. If you do not pray to God, or aspire for God-realisation, or even think of God, then how do you expect God to give you everything? He will give you everything on the strength of your absolute faith in Him combined with your sincere inner cry.</p>
<p>The Upanishads come from the Vedas. What is the difference between the gifts which we get from the Vedas and the gifts which we get from the Upanishads? The Vedas are like a storehouse — everything is there, but it is not kept in proper order. Also, in it there are quite a few things which are unimportant for the modern world, for present-day life, for evolved human beings, for the intelligent or developed mind. The Upanishads come to our rescue. They take the inspiration and aspiration from the Vedas, but they have their own originality. All that is good in the Vedas the Upanishads gladly take and offer in a special manner.</p>
<p>Without the Vedas, the Upanishads do not exist. The Vedas are the source. But the wealth of the Vedas can be offered properly to the generality of mankind only through the Upanishads. The Upanishads have the capacity to enter into the source and the capacity to offer the illumining, fulfilling wealth of the source in a way that can be accepted and understood by humanity at large. They are the end or cream of the Vedas; they are called Vedanta. On the mental plane, on the spiritual plane, on the psychic plane, on the moral plane, all of India’s achievements come from the polished, developed, aspiring and illumining consciousness of the Upanishads.</p>
<p>Buddhism is a form of Vedanta philosophy. But the Buddha’s philosophy emphasises a special aspect of Vedanta. We speak of the Buddha as the Lord of Compassion. We speak of the Buddha’s moral ethics. Where did all this come from? From Vedanta. But while expressing the Vedantic or Upanishadic truth, the Buddha offered his own inner light in a specific way. That is why ordinary human beings find it difficult to believe that Vedanta was the original source of the Buddha’s teachings.</p>
<p>In the Western world we have Pythagoras and Plato, two great philosophers. You can see that the philosophy of both of them, and especially of Plato, has been greatly inspired by Upanishadic thought.</p>
<p>The world has received many significant things from the Upanishads, but unfortunately the world does not want to offer credit to the source. No harm. A child takes money from his parents and tells his friends that it is his money. Friends of his age believe that it is his, but adults will say, “He does not work. Where can he get money?” They know that he has received it from his parents. Millions of people have been inspired by the Upanishadic lore, consciously or unconsciously. In India and in the West there are many paths, many religions, which have taken abundant light from the Upanishads, but they find it hard to give credit to the source.</p>
<p>The Upanishadic Seers abide within us. They do not need any appreciation or recognition. What do they want? What do they expect? From the genuine seekers and followers of Truth, what they want and expect is the application of the Truth which has been offered. If the Truth is applied in our daily lives, no matter where it came from, divinity will loom large in us, and divinity will offer appreciation, admiration and glorification to the source. Even God does not expect or demand anything more from us as long as we apply the Truth in our own lives consciously, constantly, devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally.</p>

<p><em>University of Massachusetts; Amherst, Massachusetts, USA</em><br /><em>1 March 1972</em></p>
<p>I had decided to give thirteen talks on the Upanishads. Today I will be giving my thirteenth talk on the Upanishads. That means that today we are at the end of the race, the divine race. We are nearing the goal. When we reach the goal, we shall offer our most devoted gratitude to the Inner Pilot.</p>
<p>When we think of the Upanishads, immediately our minds enter into these particular subjects — philosophy, religion, spirituality and Yoga.</p>

<p>The philosophy of the Upanishads is the vastness of the mind.<br /> The religion of the Upanishads is the oneness of the heart.<br /> The spirituality of the Upanishads is the Immortality of the soul.<br /> The Yoga of the Upanishads is the total manifestation of God here on earth.</p>
<p>The vastness of the mind needs God the infinite Consciousness.<br /> The oneness of the heart needs God the supreme and eternal Beloved.<br /> The immortality of the soul needs God the ever-transcending Beyond.<br /> The total manifestation of God needs man’s constant inner hunger.</p>
<p>God is Purity in the vastness of the mind.<br /> God is Beauty in the oneness of the heart.<br /> God is Life in the Immortality of the soul.</p>
<p>The philosophy of the Upanishads tells me, “See the Truth.”<br /> The religion of the Upanishads tells me, “Feel the Truth.”<br /> The spirituality of the Upanishads tells me, “Grow into the Truth.”<br /> The Yoga of the Upanishads tells me, “Become the Truth.”<br /> God tells me, “You are the Truth.”</p>
<p>When I see the Truth, I know what God’s Compassion is.<br /> When I feel the Truth, I know what God’s Love is.<br /> When I grow into the Truth, I know what God’s Concern is.<br /> When I become the Truth, I know what God’s selfless Life is, and what His unconditional Duty is.<br /> When I realise that I am the Truth, the full manifestation of Divinity’s Light begins.</p>

<p>The Upanishads offer to each aspiring heart countless messages. There are quite a few messages which are at once most significant and most fulfilling. Here is a stupendous message about life and death. Before death and after death, what happens? This is the message of the Upanishads:</p>

<p>Before death, life is a seeker.<br /> After death, the same life becomes a dreamer.</p>
<p>Before death, life struggles and strives for perfection.<br /> After death, the same life rests and enjoys the divine Bliss with the soul.</p>
<p>Before death, life is God’s Promise.<br /> After death, life is God’s inner Assurance. This Assurance of God’s we notice while we fulfil God in our future incarnation.</p>

<p>Life for each individual is an act of inspiration and revelation. Life is an experience; even so, is death. Our human life is God’s sacred flame mounting towards the highest Source. Human death, the so-called death, is a secret play of God’s Will.</p>
<p>When we study the Upanishads, we start with the concentration of the mind. This concentration of the mind is the most difficult thing that we can ever think of. We know what the mind is, we know what concentration is, but when it is a matter of concentration of the mind, it is extremely difficult to do.</p>
<p>Once some spiritual aspirants went to their Master and said, “Master, we have been meditating for so many years — for ten long years. How is it that we cannot control our minds?” The Master said, “My children, God-realisation is not so easy. Had it been easy, you would have by this time controlled your minds. God-realisation is extremely difficult — here is the proof. We consider the mind to be our best instrument. We consider it to be the highest, most developed part in our human life. But look at its helplessness.” Then he went on to say, “You are all standing before me. Now if somebody stands up right on the shoulders of one of your spiritual brothers, what will happen? Immediately your brother will be irritated, he will feel disturbed. His prestige will be hurt. He is also a human being. How does someone dare to stand on his shoulders? The same thing happens to the mind. When the mind is agitated by our thoughts — low, undivine, uncomely thoughts — it does not allow us to become calm, quiet and serene enough to meditate on God.”</p>
<p>The origin of the mind is divine; the mind itself is divine. But unfortunately, the mind that we are using right now is the physical mind, which cannot help us at all in our upward journey. This mind has consciously or unconsciously accepted three undivine friends: fear, doubt and jealousy. I said in the beginning of this talk that the vastness of the mind is the philosophy of the Upanishads. Now, when vastness wants to appear before the physical mind, the physical mind is horror-struck. It is afraid of the vastness. Further, it looks at its own insufficiency, its own limited capacity, and says, “How is it possible? I am so weak; I am so impotent; I am so insignificant. How can the vastness accept me as its very own?” First it is afraid of vastness, then it doubts. It doubts the very existence of vastness. Then, by God’s infinite Grace, fear leaves the mind and doubt leaves the mind. Alas, now jealousy comes in. The mind looks around and sees that there is some fulfilment in the vastness, whereas in its own existence there is no fulfilment, there is no joy. Jealousy starts. Fear, doubt, and jealousy — these three undivine forces — attack the mind and make it meaningless, helpless and hopeless in our upward journey. When the mind is attacked by fear, doubt and jealousy, something else consciously and deliberately enters and feeds the mind, and that is our ego. With ego starts the beginning of our spiritual end.</p>
<p>We have to go beyond the domain of the physical mind with the help of philosophy, religion, spirituality and Yoga. The seeking mind operates in philosophy. The crying heart operates in religion. The illumining soul operates in spirituality. The fulfilling Goal operates in Yoga.</p>
<p>There are two approaches to the Goal. One approach is through the mind; the other is through the heart. The approach of the mind is not safe; it is not secure. But one eventually can reach the Goal this way. It is not that if you approach God through the mind you will not realise God. You will realise God, but the road is arduous. You may doubt your aspiration, you may doubt God’s Compassion for you. Hence, it may take you hundreds, thousands of years to reach the Goal. But the approach through the heart is safe and sure. We can do one of two things: either we can identify ourselves with the subject or the object — with the Supreme Pilot, the Eternal Beloved — or we can surrender our existence at every second to the Inner Pilot. Either we have to become totally one with the Will of the Inner Pilot, or we have to surrender totally, unconditionally to the Inner Pilot. When we approach God in either of these ways, His Infinity, Eternity, Divinity and Immortality we feel immediately as our very own.</p>
<p>If we follow the messages of the Upanishads step by step, if we start first with philosophy, then with religion, then with spirituality and finally with Yoga, then God-realisation need not and cannot remain a far cry. God-discovery is our birthright. If we really want to discover God, then we can start right from the beginning: philosophy, religion, spirituality and Yoga. When we fulfil the demands of philosophy, religion, spirituality and Yoga, God fulfils all our demands. Their demands are very simple: aspiration and self-control. Our demands are God’s Gifts: Peace, Light, Bliss and Power.</p>
<p>Do we really care for God’s Gifts? If we really care for God’s Gifts, then God will offer us the capacity to receive His infinite Wealth. In our ordinary life, when we want something from somebody else, that person will not give us the capacity to receive it. He will demand our own capacity. If we have the capacity, if we work for one day, then the boss will give us the salary. But in the spiritual life, God wants to know whether we really want the salary — Peace, Light and Bliss. If we want them, then He Himself will energise us and be our aspiration and self-control. He will work in and through us. He will work as the seeker within us and, at the same time, He will work as the Pilot for us. He Himself will be both Employer and Employee. If we really want God, God will play at once both the roles. He will be the Giver and the receiver. He will be the seeker and the Fulfiller.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Vedic bird of illumination</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Vedic bird of illumination" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Wellesley College; Wellesley, Massachusetts, USA</em><br /><em>14 November 1972</em></p>
<p>Dear sisters and brothers, I shall be giving seven talks on the Vedas at the Seven Sister colleges. Interestingly, the <em>Rig Veda</em> itself deals with seven special sisters. It tells us that there is a divine chariot with only one wheel, and that this chariot is drawn by one horse with seven names. Seven sisters sing spiritual songs while standing before the chariot. While singing, the seven sisters reveal the concealed message of life’s Liberation and humanity’s Perfection.</p>
<p>Seven is an occult number. In the spiritual world, the number seven has a most special significance. In the hoary past there were seven great Indian Sages who saw the Truth, lived the Truth and became the Truth. There are seven important rivers in India. A river signifies movement; water signifies consciousness. The movement of consciousness is a continuous progress towards the farthest Beyond.</p>
<p>There are seven notes in the musical scale. Each note has a special value of its own. Music is the mother tongue of humanity. God is the Supreme Musician. It is through music that we can enter into the universal harmony. It is through music that God’s Beauty is being manifested in His all-loving Creation.</p>
<p>There are seven colours in the rainbow. These colours indicate the stages of our spiritual journey towards the ultimate Goal. We all know that a rainbow is the sign of good luck and future progress. In the spiritual world, each colour of the rainbow is the harbinger of a new dawn.</p>
<p>There are seven higher worlds and seven lower worlds. An aspiring human being enters into one of the seven higher worlds and makes progress in the inner life. Like a bird, his aspiring consciousness flies from one world to another, until finally he finds himself in the seventh world, Saccidananda, the world of Existence, Consciousness and Bliss. There he becomes consciously and inseparably one with the Supreme Pilot. But when a human being deliberately and knowingly does wrong things, heinous things, he is compelled to enter into one of the seven lower worlds, which are the worlds of darkness, bondage and ignorance.</p>
<p>Mother India is an aspiring tree. This aspiring tree has the Vedas as its only root. The root is Truth, the tree is Truth, the experience of the tree is Truth, the realisation of the tree is Truth, the revelation of the tree is Truth, the manifestation of the tree is Truth.</p>
<p>The Vedic Seers saw the Truth with their souls, in their Heavenly visions and in their earthly actions.</p>

<p><em>Satyam eva jayate nanrtam</em></p>
<p>Truth alone triumphs, not falsehood.</p>

<p>This Truth teaches us how to be true brothers of mankind, conscious and devoted lovers of God and perfect masters of nature.</p>
<p>The Vedic teachings are universal. In the <em>Yajur Veda</em> we clearly observe that the teachings of the Vedas are for all — the Brahmins, the Kshatriyas, the Vaishyas, the Shudras, even the Chandalas, who are the degraded and the abandoned. Men and women alike can study the Vedas. God is for all. The Vedas are for all. In the Vedic church no one is superior, no one is inferior; all are equal, all are children of God. These children of God can live in the heart of Truth and become the veritable pride of God.</p>
<p>Each Vedic Seer is a poet and a prophet. In the case of an ordinary poet, his poems are quite often based upon imagination. Imagination gives birth to his poetry. In the case of the Vedic poets, it was intuition that gave birth to their poems. This intuition is the direct knowledge of Truth. As regards prophets, very often we see that an ordinary prophet’s prophecy is based on a kind of unknown mystery. But in the case of the Vedic prophets, it was not so. Their prophecies were based on their full and conscious awareness of direct and immediate Truth. They just brought to the fore this dynamic Truth to operate in the cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>The present-day world believes that the mind can offer the highest possible experience of Reality. The Vedic Seers gave due importance to the mind, but they never considered the mind to be the source of the highest possible experience of Reality.</p>
<p>The Vedas have the eternal wisdom. It is for us. The Vedas are more than willing to illumine us if we dare to hearken to their message.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Srnvantu visve amrtasya putrah</em></p>
<p>Hearken, ye sons of Immortality.</p>
<p>This is their generous invitation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we live in the mind and do not want to go outside the boundaries of the mind, we remain bound in the trammels of the body. We remain in bondage. It is only the light from within and the guidance from Above that can liberate us from the teeming ignorance which has enveloped us. When we live in the mind, we live in the fabric of form. When we live in the soul, we enter into the formless and eventually go beyond both form and formlessness. We become, at that time, the individual soul universalised and the Universal Soul individualised.</p>
<p>The outer world is synonymous with the mind. The inner world is synonymous with the heart. The world of the Eternal Beyond is synonymous with the soul. The outer world has the past, present and future. The inner world has the glowing and fulfilling future. The world of the Beyond has only the Eternal Now. When we live in the outer world, the ignorant ‘I’ destroys us. When we live in the inner world, the illumined ‘I’ satisfies us. When we live in the world of the Beyond, the Infinite ‘I’ fondly embodies us, reveals us and fulfils us. When we live in the mind, we cannot go beyond the judgement of destiny. Our human will is at the feet of destiny. When we live in the soul, we have free will. This free will is the Will of the Supreme. It is the will of the soul, which constantly identifies itself with the Will of the infinite Beyond.</p>
<p>Whether others believe it or not, the lovers of the Vedas know perfectly well that the Vedas are a significant contribution to the world of literature. These sublime literary scriptures are not just of national interest, for they offer international inspiration and universal aspiration. Just because they are international and universal, they fascinate and illumine sincere seekers in different countries at all times.</p>
<p>The Vedic mantras, or incantations, help us to develop will-power in boundless measure. Even if we do not take the trouble of learning and repeating the mantras, we cultivate some will-power just by studying the Vedas devotedly. The paramount question is how we are going to use this will-power: to dominate the world or to serve God in the universe? If we live in the body for the pleasures of the body, we shall want to dominate the world. But if we live in the soul for the transformation and illumination of the body, then we shall serve God, love man and fulfil both God and man.</p>
<p>To say that the Vedas are badly infected with asceticism and otherworldliness is to betray one’s own ignorance. The Vedas are divinely practical and their message is of constant, practical value. Needless to say, a great many Vedic Seers were householders and most of their pupils, at the end of their instruction, went home and became family men. The teachers in the Seers taught their students the secret of eternal life and not the secret of unending death, which we learn from some of the destruction-loving teachers of science.</p>
<p>The Vedas do not embody depression, repression, self-mortification, sin-awareness or hell-consciousness. The Vedas embody the divine duty of the earthly life and the ever-increasing beauty of the Heavenly life. The Vedic Seers accepted the heart of life to found the ultimate Reality upon earth. The Vedic Seers accepted the body of death to carry it into the land of Immortality. Inspiration of the clear mind they liked. Aspiration of the pure heart they loved. Realisation of the sure soul they became.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The glowing consciousness of Vedic truth</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The glowing consciousness of Vedic truth" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Radcliffe College; Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA</em><br /><em>14 November 1972</em></p>
<p>In Vedic times people lived with nature and played with intuition. The modern world lives with the mind’s barren desert and plays with the body’s frustration and the vital’s destruction. In those days life was simple, and life’s approach to the Goal was direct. Now man’s life is complex, and man has two names: ‘lifeless machine’ and ‘loud noise’.</p>
<p>Spontaneous intuition was the wisdom of the past. Constant suspicion is the wisdom of the present. In the Vedic age people knew the divine art of self-abnegation and self-dedication, as today we know the human art of self-glorification and world-destruction. They cared for self-perfection first and then for world-perfection. We do not care for self-perfection at all; we care only for world-perfection. They were convinced that self-discipline would liberate them. We feel that self-discipline will limit us. They knew that self-discipline was not the end, but a means to the end, and that the end was Ananda, Delight. We also know that self-discipline is not the end, but a means to the end. But for us, alas, the fatal end is self-destruction. The Vedic Seers needed freedom. We also need freedom. To them, freedom was self-dedication to the life divine and the ever-transcending Beyond. To us, freedom is the imposition of our own reality-power on others.</p>
<p>There are four Vedas: the <em>Rig Veda</em>, the <em>Sama Veda</em>, the <em>Yajur Veda</em> and the <em>Atharva Veda</em>. The <em>Rig Veda</em> has 10,552 mantras. Mantra means ‘incantation’ or, simply, ‘stanza’. The <em>Sama Veda</em> has 1,875 mantras, the <em>Yajur Veda</em> has 2,086 and the <em>Atharva Veda</em> has 5,987. A number of the Rig Vedic verses are also found in the other three Vedas. Most of the mantras in the Vedas are in the form of lucid poetry, except for some that are written in thought-invoking and rhythmic prose. The Vedas house the earliest poetry and prose literature of the searching, striving and aspiring human soul. He who thinks that the Vedic poetry is primitive and the Vedic literature insignificant is unmistakably wanting in mental illumination. How can primitive poetry offer such sublime and enduring wisdom to the world at large?</p>

<p>The body of the Vedic poetry is simplicity.<br /> The vital of the Vedic poetry is sincerity.<br /> The mind of the Vedic poetry is clarity.<br /> The heart of the Vedic poetry is purity.<br /> The soul of the Vedic poetry is luminosity.</p>

<p>There are two ways to study the Vedas. When we study the Vedas with the mind, we are constantly admonished by the strict vigilance of conscience. When we study the Vedas with the heart, we are unceasingly inspired by the flowing spontaneity of glowing consciousness. The achievement of the mind is a scholar of the Vedas. The achievement of the heart is a lover of the Vedas. The scholar tries to satisfy the world without being satisfied himself. The lover feeds the world with the light of illumining manifestation and the delight of fulfilling perfection.</p>
<p>There are two words in the Vedas which are as important as the Vedas themselves. These two words are Satya and Rta, eternal Truth and eternal Law. Realisation and Truth embody each other. Manifestation and Law fulfil each other. If we do not live the Truth, we cannot reach the Goal. If we do not follow the Law, we cannot grow into the Goal.</p>
<p>The Vedic Seers accepted the laws of others not only with their hearts’ frankness but also with their souls’ oneness. They saw the One in the many and the many in the One. To them, the Absolute was not their sole monopoly.</p>
<p><em>Satyam eva jayate nanrtam</em></p>
<p>Truth alone triumphs, not untruth.</p>

<p><em>Asato ma sad gamaya</em><br /><em>tamaso ma jyotir gamaya</em><br /><em>mrtyor mamrtam gamaya</em></p>


<p>Lead me from the unreal to the Real.<br /> Lead me from darkness to Light.<br /> Lead me from death to Immortality.</p>

<p>Unreality is untruth, and Reality is Truth. <em>Satya</em> is invoked by the pure heart. <em>Rta</em> is invoked by the brave vital. Love of Truth takes us from darkness. Love of divine order takes us from the human body to the divine life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The inner revelation-fire</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The inner revelation-fire" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Vassar College; Poughkeepsie, New York, USA</em><br /><em>15 November 1972</em></p>
<p>Why do we appreciate the teachings of the Vedas? We appreciate the teachings of the Vedas because they inspire us to rise and go beyond the body-consciousness. The <em>Rig Veda</em> inspires us to make the world great and perfect. The <em>Sama Veda</em> inspires us to become one with the divine melody and cosmic rhythm. The <em>Yajur Veda</em> tells us, “May our lives be successful through self-sacrifice. May our life-breath thrive through self-sacrifice.” The <em>Atharva Veda</em> inspires us to go forward along the path of continuous progress. It tells us that Brihaspati, Guru of the Cosmic Gods, is leading and guiding us.</p>
<p>The Vedic Seers saw fear in the outer world. They felt freedom in the inner world. They wanted to bring to the fore the freedom of the inner world through aspiration. In the <em>Atharva Veda</em>, the Seers have offered us a significant prayer: “May we be fearless of those we know not, and of those we know.”</p>

<p>Fear of darkness is fear of the unknown.<br /> Fear of Light is fear of the known.<br /> Fear of the unknown is stupidity.<br /> Fear of the known is absurdity.</p>

<p>What we need is the soul-will. Soul-will is God-Freedom.</p>

<p><em>Uru nas tanve tan</em><br /><em>Uru ksayaya nas krdhi</em><br /><em>Uru no yamdhi jivase</em></p>

<p>The <em>Rig Veda</em>’s fiery utterance means: “Freedom for our body. Freedom for our home. Freedom for our life.”</p>
<p>The Vedic way of life cannot be separated from ritual. In Vedic times, rituals were an integral part of life. In performing rituals, seekers in the Vedic era made remarkable progress. In the <em>Rig Veda</em>, however, we see more emphasis on mental and inner philosophy than on ritual. This combination of ritual and philosophical wisdom is the wealth of the Vedic culture. Devotion and dedication loom large in ritual. Aspiration and meditation loom large in philosophical wisdom. In those days, ritual disciplined and regulated life. Inner philosophy illumined and liberated life. In the heart of philosophy, the Light was discovered. In the body of ritual, the Light was manifested.</p>
<p>The Vedas specifically speak of three worlds: <em>prthivi</em> the earth; <em>antariksa</em>, the sky; <em>dyauh</em>, the celestial region. On earth, matter is all. In the sky, divine activity is all. In Heaven, sentience is all.</p>
<p>Poetry and philosophy run abreast in the Vedas. Philosophy illumined the minds of the Vedic Seers. Poetry immortalised their hearts. The philosopher is a poet in the mind. The poet is a philosopher in the heart. The philosopher likes outer religion and inner science. The poet likes outer art and inner literature. The philosopher says to the poet, “I give to you my precious wealth: wisdom, which is the constant and conscious instrument of intuition.” The poet says to the philosopher, “I give to you my precious wealth: my devoted oneness with the life of Light.”</p>
<p>Many Seers have seen the Truth, but when they reveal the Truth, quite often their revelations are not identical. What is really deplorable is that on different occasions, under different circumstances, their own revelations of the same Truth are found to be anything but identical. Here we must know that the differences exist only in the realisation and revelation of the Truth. There can be no difference in the Truth itself. Why do the differences occur? The differences occur because human individuality and personality do not see the Truth the way it has to be seen. When the human personality and individuality are dissolved, the Truth remains one in realisation and one in revelation. Needless to say, the Vedas are the direct revelation of the Seers’ illumination, and not gifts from the unknown skies above.</p>
<p>There are people who think that the Vedas deal only with spirituality, and not with science. They are mistaken. Advanced seekers and spiritual Masters are of the opinion that in the <em>Yajur Veda</em> there are many scientific truths which modern science has not yet discovered or acknowledged. The scientific knowledge of the <em>Atharva Veda</em> cannot be looked down upon either. The Vedic Seers were aware of the process of cloud formation. They were fully aware of the different seasons. They knew the science of arithmetic, and worked with figures in the millions, billions and trillions. In the <em>Yajur Veda</em> there is something even more striking. There we see evidence of the existence of aeroplanes. The Vedic Seers used to make actual non-stop flights for hundreds of miles. They also knew the secrets of geology, medicine and other sciences. All this, four thousand years ago!</p>
<p>The Vedas have been translated into many languages and admired and appreciated by people from many countries. The great German philosopher Schopenhauer considered the Upanishads to be the consolation and illumination of his life. We know that the Upanishads are the most powerful and most illumining children of the Vedas. But there is much truth in the saying that a translation cannot do full justice to the original. In the case of the Vedas, this is certainly true. Many people have translated the Vedas, but no matter how sincerely or devotedly they worked, a considerable amount of the Vedic beauty was lost.</p>
<p>There are four Vedas: the <em>Rig Veda</em>, the <em>Yajur Veda</em>, the <em>Sama Veda</em> and the <em>Atharva Veda</em>. The <em>Rig Veda</em> deals mainly with the forms of prayer. The <em>Yajur Veda</em> deals with sacrificial formulæ. The <em>Sama Veda</em> deals with music. The <em>Atharva Veda</em> deals with medicine, science and magic formulæ. In the <em>Rig Veda</em> the message of human evolution begins. The <em>Rig Veda</em> tells us the meaning of existence and of man’s contribution to the world. The <em>Yajur Veda</em> teaches us how to perform the sacrifices correctly and how to control the universe. This Veda gives more importance to the mechanical side of sacrifices than to their spiritual aspect. The <em>Sama Veda</em> teaches us how divine music can elevate our aspiring consciousness into the highest realm of Bliss and make us conscious channels of God the Supreme Musician for the transformation of human darkness into divine Light, human imperfection into divine Perfection, human impossibilities into divine Inevitabilities and human dreams into divine Realities. The <em>Atharva Veda</em> teaches us how to control the spirits and lesser deities, and how to protect ourselves from evil spirits and destructive beings.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Rig Veda</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Rig Veda" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Barnard College; New York, New York, USA</em><br /><em>17 November 1972</em></p>
<p>The <em>Rig Veda</em> is the oldest of all the Vedas. Most students of the Vedas are of the opinion that the <em>Rig Veda</em> is the most inspiring, most soulful and most fruitful Veda. This Veda embodies the earliest monument of India’s aspiration and realisation. India’s poetry, India’s philosophy, India’s literature, India’s religion and India’s science all owe their very existence to the <em>Rig Veda</em>, which was their source.</p>
<p>When it is a matter of choice between quality and quantity, the wise long for quality and the ignorant cry for quantity. The highest quality and the greatest quantity almost never go together. But to our great joy, the <em>Rig Veda</em> surpasses most strikingly the other three Vedas both in quantity and in quality. The <em>Yajur Veda</em>, the <em>Sama Veda</em> and the <em>Atharva Veda</em> have borrowed a considerable amount of wealth from the <em>Rig Veda</em>.</p>
<p>In the <em>Rig Veda</em>, the Gods are seen as personifications of nature-power. The Seers invoke the Cosmic Gods with their heart’s prayers and their life’s dedication. These Gods were supposed to have been thirty-three in number. Each God had his own origin; all of them did not come into being at the same time. It is said that at first they accepted human incarnation and were mortals, as we are now. But by drinking Soma, Nectar, immortal they became. In the subtle physical plane, they are retaining the quintessence of their physical forms and earthly appearances. Some are warriors, while others are priests. Indra is the champion leader of the warriors, and Agni is the champion leader of the priests.</p>
<p>Power they have. Power they are. Some have the power of silence and peace, while others have the power of light and delight. Ceaselessly they fought against the formidable forces of evil, and eventually they did win the victory.</p>
<p>The Rig Vedic Gods are kind and compassionate. With their boundless kindness and compassion, they fulfil the desires of the matter-loving world and the aspirations of the spirit-invoking life. They live in different homes: Heaven, air and earth. Heaven is the home of Vishnu, Varuna, Surya, Mitra and a few others. The atmospheric region is for Indra, Rudra, the Maruts and others. Agni and Brihaspati are well known among those who are considered to be terrestrial Gods.</p>
<p>In the <em>Rig Veda</em> we see the pure presence of devotion and the sure presence of knowledge. Devotion tells us how sweet and compassionate God is. Knowledge tells us how high and great God is. Devotion and knowledge find their complete satisfaction only in service. Service is concentration. Devotion is prayer. Knowledge is meditation. Only concentrated service, devoted prayer and illumined meditation can make us divinely great and supremely perfect.</p>
<p>According to the Vedas, action is a most essential part of life. Action is the conscious acceptance of our earthly existence. Action needs the body, which is its temple and fortress. Action needs life, which is its inspiration and aspiration. A man of action is an ideal hero in the battlefield of life. He lives with God’s human body, the earth, and works for God’s divine life, Heaven. Action is outer sacrifice and inner oneness. The <em>Rig Veda</em> offers us a supreme secret as to what kind of sacrifice we can make on the strength of our oneness. In action we see the universal Presence of God. In action we embody the spirit and reveal the form. In the spirit is God the Absolute. In the form is God the Infinite.</p>
<p>The <em>Rig Veda</em> speaks of God the Power:</p>
<p><em>Tvam Indra balad adhi sahaso jata ojasah…</em></p>

<p>O God, Thy Existence rests on strength, valour and energy.<br /> O Mighty One, You are Strength itself.</p>

<p>In order to manifest God considerably on earth, the seeker must live a long life.</p>
<p><em>Aum bhadram karnebhih srnuyama devah…</em></p>
<p>O Cosmic Gods, may we hear with our ears what is good and auspicious.</p>
<p>May we see with our eyes what is good and auspicious…</p>
<p>But merely living a long life lacking in divinity is nothing short of stark ignorance.</p>
<p>The Seers of the <em>Rig Veda</em> regard God as the eternal Father, Mother and Friend. They also feel that God is their Beloved. God has many aspects, but a devoted Seer prefers the aspect of God as Lord. He prays to his Lord for Compassion and Benediction. He has come to realise that if he has God’s Love and God the Love, then he needs nothing else either from earth or from Heaven.</p>
<p>The Rig Vedic Seers are the teachers of mankind. The Rig Vedic Gods are the saviours of mankind. The teachers are teaching the world the message of Light and Truth. The saviours are healing the unaspiring, blind and deaf world, and championing the genuine seekers. The Rig Vedic Seers are the builders of Hindu culture and Hindu civilisation. They represent the dawn of Hindu inspiration and the noon of Hindu aspiration. They offer to the world at large the ultimate meaning of religion. According to them, religion is the inner code of life. In each religion is the love-branch of the Truth-Tree. The Rig Vedic Gods tell us to accept life with love, to enjoy life with renunciation and to fulfil life with surrender to the Will of the Absolute.</p>
<p>The Vedas tell us that we are cattle of the Gods. Unfortunately, we are now compelled to feel that we are slaves of the machine. Let us aspire. Our aspiration will once more make us cattle of the Gods. Later, our realisation will make us lambs of the Gods. Finally, our manifestation will make us lions of the Absolute Supreme. Aspiration we have. Realisation we need. Manifestation God and we together need.</p>
<p>With loving gratitude I offer this talk to my eldest brother, Hriday Ranjan Ghose, who is a great lover of the Rig Vedic lore and an erudite exponent of the four Vedas.</p>

<p><em>Mount Holyoke College; South Hadley, Massachusetts, USA</em><br /><em>28 November 1972</em></p>
<p>The Vedas are the most ancient scriptures in the library of consciously evolving humanity. For our own conscious evolution we may be inspired to read the Vedas by Max Müller’s encouragement: “I maintain that for everybody who cares for himself, for his ancestors, for his history, for his intellectual development, a study of Vedic literature is indispensable.”</p>
<p>The Vedas embody intuitive visions, divine experiences and life-illumining Realities. From the ignorance-sea we have to enter into the knowledge-sea. The <em>Rig Veda</em> inspires us, saying, “The vessels of Truth carry men of good deeds across the ocean of ignorance.”</p>
<p>Present-day human life is nothing but an endless despondency. To come out of the trap of despondency is almost impossible. But the <em>Yajur Veda</em> offers us a solution: “He who sees all existences in the Self and the Self in all existences, falls not into the trap of blighting and weakening despondency.”</p>
<p>The Vedas are universal; hence, the West can claim them as well as the East. The great American philosopher, Thoreau, said something most significant about the Vedas: “What extracts from the Vedas I have read fall on me like the light of a higher and purer luminary which describes a loftier course through purer stratum, free from particulars, simple, universal. The Vedas contain a sensible account of God.” Undoubtedly they do.</p>
<p>The firm belief of Sir William Jones is challenging and, at the same time, illumining: “I can venture to affirm, without meaning to pluck a leaf from the never-fading laurels of our immortal Newton, that the whole of his theology, and part of his philosophy, may be found in the Vedas.”</p>
<p>The Vedic commandment for the human physical is <em>saucam</em>. <em>Saucam</em> means ‘purity’ — purity in the body and purity of the body. Without the body’s purity nothing divine in us can expand; nothing divine in us can be permanent.</p>
<p>The Vedic commandment for the human vital is <em>ahimsa</em>. <em>Ahimsa</em> means ‘non-violence’ — non-violence in the vital and non-violence of the vital. It is from non-violence that man gets his greatest opportunity to feel that he does not belong to a small family, but to the largest family of all: the universe. India’s philosophy of non-violence was first put into practice by the compassionate Lord Buddha and his followers and by the Lord Mahavira and the followers of Jainism. Gandhi’s non-violence was a most precious gift to the life-loving humanity of the present.</p>
<p>The Vedic commandment for the human mind is <em>satyam</em>. <em>Satyam</em> means ‘truth’ or ‘truthfulness’. Truthfulness in the mind and truthfulness of the mind alone can lead us to a higher life, a life of illumining Divinity and fulfilling Immortality.</p>
<p>The Vedic commandment for the human heart is <em>isvarapranidhana</em>. <em>Isvarapranidhana</em> means ‘the heart’s loving devotion to the Lord Supreme’. When we have pure and spontaneous devotion for the Supreme Lord, we feel our inseparable oneness with Him, with the Eternity of His Spirit, with the Infinity of His Body and with the Immortality of His Life.</p>
<p>In the Vedas, the concept of sacrifice looms very large. We sacrifice to God what we have: ignorance. God sacrifices to us what He is: Perfection. God’s sacrifice is always unconditional. Our sacrifice at times is conditional and at times is unconditional. In conditional sacrifice we fight and win the battle. In unconditional sacrifice we do not have to fight at all, for the Victory is already won. Victory is our birthright; it is forever ours.</p>
<p>Sacrifice is self-offering. Self-offering is self-fulfilment. Self-fulfilment is love-manifestation and Truth-perfection. Through our outer sacrifice we become a divine part of Mother Earth. Through our inner sacrifice we become an immortal part of Father Heaven. We make the outer sacrifice when we come out of the domain of binding desires and enter into the domain of liberating aspiration. We make the inner sacrifice when we try to manifest God in the world of ignorance after having achieved God-realisation. The outer sacrifice demands the strength of a hero. The inner sacrifice demands the power of an army. With our outer sacrifice we see the Truth. With our inner sacrifice we become the Truth.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Intuition-light from the Vedas</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Intuition-light from the Vedas" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Smith College; Northampton, Massachusetts, USA</em><br /><em>28 November 1972</em></p>
<p>Scholars as well as students disagree over the origin of the Vedas. I find this controversy foolish. The Vedas are as old as the conscious aspiration of the universe. But the universe is consciously or unconsciously evolving into Perfection, whereas the Vedas contain the beginning of inspiring Perfection and the end of illumining Realisation.</p>
<p>When we say that the Vedas are eternal, we do not mean that the four scriptures have no beginning and no end. What we mean is that the real meaning of the Vedas, which is the knowledge of God, has neither beginning nor end. The Vedas are the direct experiences and revelations of the Rishis of the hoary past. These experiences may be had by any sincere seeker of the Truth, at any time and in any place.</p>
<p>Unlike other scriptures, the Vedas have the sincere and brave heart to say that they are not indispensable; nay, not even important. They say that what is really important and supremely indispensable is the realisation of Brahman, the One without a second. Nevertheless, if we want to study the Vedas, we have to study with the help of an illumined Teacher. The Vedas themselves instruct the seeker to approach a Teacher. They also say that the Teacher has to be approached with a heart of humility and a life of dedicated service.</p>
<p><em>Karma</em>, which means ‘work’ or ‘service’, and <em>jñana</em>, or ‘knowledge’, are the principal teachings of the Vedas. Through <em>jñana</em> we realise the Absolute Truth, and through karma we manifest our realisation.</p>
<p>According to the Vedas, there are four important stages in life: student-life, marriage-life, retirement-life and renunciation-life. Student-life is self-discipline. Marriage-life is self-control and self-regulation. Retirement-life is peace and tranquillity. Renunciation-life is the offering of what one has and what one is to the Absolute Supreme.</p>
<p><em>Ekam sad vipra bahudha vadanti</em></p>
<p>Truth-existence is one.</p>
<p>Sages call it by various names.</p>
<p>This Truth-existence is experienced and realised in different ways by each seeker of the infinite Truth, according to his own inner development. Just because of this lofty message from the Vedas, India’s religious heart is large and cosmopolitan. India’s spiritual heart knows how to accept other religions, how to appreciate other religions and how to admire other religions. India’s spiritual heart has realised that for each new religion there is a new approach to the Goal. Each path is right and indispensable for its own followers.</p>
<p>In order to realise the highest Truth, we need three things: inspiration, aspiration and intuition. Inspiration asks us to run towards the Goal. Aspiration asks us to fly towards the Goal. Intuition asks us to see and feel the Truth directly, and to grow into the very essence of Truth.</p>
<p>The word sarama symbolises intuition. <em>Sarama</em> is the hound of Heaven who enters into the world of inconscience and discovers its concealed treasures: light and delight. <em>Sarama</em> is the dawn of Truth in a dedicated body, dynamic vital and aspiring heart. Sarama and the straight path go together. <em>Sarama</em> follows the straight and sunlit path and arrives at the Truth. The path of fear and doubt, error and terror, sarama never follows. <em>Sarama</em> secretly and cautiously enters into the heart of illumination, and openly and bravely walks in the life of revelation, so that the hostile forces cannot thwart or destroy her progress. So that the Truth-consciousness can be realised as a whole by all seekers, <em>sarama</em> travels between earth’s cry and Heaven’s smile. <em>Sarama</em> is the seeker who seeks Truth-consciousness. <em>Sarama</em> is the lover who loves earth’s conscious ascent and Heaven’s illumining descent. <em>Sarama</em> is the player who plays with the Seer’s vision in the inner world and plays hide-and-seek with the beginner’s inspiration in the outer world.</p>
<p>The Vedas are at once the sky of Light and the sea of Delight. The Light-sky is the vastness of Truth. The Delight-sea is the immensity of Truth. Light and Delight are perpetual runners. Sometimes Light precedes Delight. Sometimes Delight precedes Light. When Light touches the earth-consciousness, earth is divinely transformed. When Delight touches the earth-consciousness, earth is supremely fulfilled.</p>

<p>Light is the birth of God.<br /> Delight is the life of God.<br /> Light is the smile of Universal Oneness.<br /> Delight is the smile of Transcendental Perfection.<br /> Light is what God has.<br /> Delight is what God is.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The wisdom-sun of Vedic-truth</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The wisdom-sun of Vedic-truth" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Bryn Mawr College; Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, USA</em><br /><em>29 November 1972</em></p>
<p>When we study the Vedas we should be aware of two different things: the esoteric interpretations of the Vedas made by illumined spiritual Masters, and the mental conclusions made by scholars and historians. Each esoteric interpretation by a Master is founded upon a direct intuitive vision of the Truth, whereas each mental conclusion of a scholar or historian is founded upon unillumined mental analysis and hesitant, uncertain research.</p>
<p>The Seers of the hoary past saw the Truth and revealed the Truth. Seekers of all ages feel the Truth and use the Truth. But most scholars do not care for the realisation of the Truth; they care only for the manifestation of the Truth. They care more for the form than for the spirit of the Vedas.</p>
<p>Most historians put the lesser truths mentioned in the Vedas, those relating to the caste system and magic formulæ, in the vanguard of their discussions, and pay little attention to the highest Truth, the knowledge of Brahman. They have no time to know, soulfully and devotedly, the life-energising and life-fulfilling messages that the Vedas actually contain. The life-giving and life-revealing messages of the Vedas do not seem to satisfy them. The birth of the Vedas, the outer growth of the Vedas and the decline of the Vedic influence on India are more than enough to satisfy them.</p>
<p>The Vedas are meant for the lovers of eternal Time, not for the lovers of fleeting, earthly time. The Vedas are meant for those who love God, the Truth, and not for those who love merely the body of obscure history, which embodies the life of complication and confusion.</p>
<p>Professor Max Müller undoubtedly loved India. He wrote considerably on Indian scriptures. But there was something in him which a true lover of India cannot forgive. Those who feel that Max Müller’s love for India had a secret motive are perfectly correct. In utmost secrecy, in the inner recesses of his heart, it seemed that he wanted to convert India — the Indian mind and the Indian heart — to Christianity. For example, he wrote to the Secretary of State for India, the Duke of Argyl, in 1868:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ancient religion of India is doomed and, if Christianity does not step in, whose fault will it be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And to his wife in 1886, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope I shall finish the work, and I feel convinced, though I shall not live to see it, that this edition of mine and the translation of the Vedas will hereafter tell to a great extent on the fate of India and on the growth of millions of souls in that country. It is the root of the religion, and to show them what the root is, I feel sure, is the only way of uprooting all that has sprung from it during the last 3,000 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he extolled India to the skies, he was sincere in his praise. It came from the depths of his heart. But his desire to convert India to Christianity was equally sincere. That feeling, too, I am sure, came from the depths of his heart. His was a life of complexity.</p>
<p>Had Max Müller not studied the Upanishads, had he not been illumined by the light of the Upanishads, he would not have been acclaimed by the entire world. His name would have remained unknown in the world’s literature. If it is true that he brought the Upanishads to the world at large, then it is equally true that the touch of the Upanishadic light brought him fame.</p>
<p>The Vedas and the Vedic hymns are inseparable. Each hymn is an invocation to a particular God or Deity. Each hymn is a discovery of a <em>Kavi</em>, <em>Rishi</em> or <em>Vipra</em>: a Vedic Poet, a Vedic Seer or a Vedic Sage. Each Vedic discovery is a boon from God. Each boon is a spark of light. Each spark of light is an accomplishment of God in man and an accomplishment of man in God. Man’s ultimate accomplishment is the transformation of human nature. God’s ultimate accomplishment is the perfection of the earth-consciousness.</p>
<p>Life is an idea; life is an ideal. Life has a soul; life has a goal. The Vedic idea of life is the idea of Truth. The Vedic ideal of life is the ideal of Bliss. The Vedic soul is the soul of multiplicity in unity. The Vedic Goal is the Goal of unifying earth’s wideness and Heaven’s Abundance.</p>
<p>India had the Vedic Seers of Truth. India has seekers of Truth. The supreme task of the Seers was to bring the Cosmic Gods and Deities down into the earth-consciousness. They performed their task. Now it is the task of the seekers to keep the Gods and Deities here on earth and help them in their Cosmic Play. The Supreme saw His infinite potentialities and possibilities in the Seers. The Supreme sees His manifesting Reality and fulfilling Perfection in the seekers.</p>
