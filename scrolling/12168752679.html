<p>Once when we went to a circus in Venezuela, I saw that one of the young girl performers was an extremely evolved soul. I felt miserable that Saraswati was not there, because I wanted somebody to approach her. Later, I told Saraswati to go and give her gifts.</p>
<p>That girl was one of the two hundred most evolved female souls living on earth at this time. Such an evolved, receptive soul in the silliest possible circus!</p>
<p>Our circus is far better; only we don't have animals. But we don't need animals because we represent animals.</p>

<p>The first day I went to the eating place at the university in Puerto la Cruz, I saw a group of cute little boys watching me from about fifteen metres away. They were afraid to come closer. Then they all gave me very soulful smiles and took one step nearer, but immediately they got frightened again.</p>
<p>So I gave them a smile. Then they took another step towards me. Like that, we kept smiling at one another and they kept coming forward until they were only one metre away.</p>

<p>I have been on airplanes many, many times, but only two or three times have I watched the movie. On a flight from Florida to New York, I was sitting in my seat drawing when they announced that it was time for the movie.</p>
<p>They were going to show George Burns in <em>Oh God.</em> I hadn't liked the movie when we showed it at the Centre, but I said, "To kill time, let me see it."</p>
<p>So I paid two dollars for the earphones and turned the switch to channel 9. With my right hand I was holding the earphones to my ear, and with my left hand I was trying to draw. Of course, I couldn't draw very well with my left hand, since I am right-handed.</p>
<p>The stewardess saw me and said, "Why are you not using the headphones?"</p>
<p>So she showed me how to put the headphones on my head. Then she asked, "Where do you come from? India?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>She said, "Oh, that's why!"</p>
<p>I said, "I have been here in the States for 20 years." I didn't have the heart to tell her how many times I have been on airplanes. But if you don't use things, you don't know the proper way.</p>

<p>Sitting in front of me on the plane was an elderly couple; they were both over 60.</p>
<p>Before the plane took off, another old man came up to the lady and said, "Hi!" She also said something to him.</p>
<p>Then the man said to the husband, "Harold, how are you?" But the husband didn't answer.</p>
<p>When the man went away, the husband got so mad! For ten minutes or more he was insulting and scolding his wife.</p>
<p>When the plane landed, the other old man again had to come very close to the lady, and the lady again said something to him.</p>
<p>Her husband was holding two small bags. He got so furious that he just dropped them on the seat.</p>
<p>I was dying to get off the plane before he struck his wife. I saw his anger and wanted to disappear immediately.</p>

<p>Today Kailash and I went to East Berlin. At the place where you cross over, every 10 metres they ask to see your passport. Within 50 metres, at four different places you have to show your passport! Can you imagine!</p>
<p>I have to change Kailash's name to patience. He was so patient with those people. If I had known German, I would not have waited there. After being stopped the second time, I would have just gone back.</p>
<p>In some cases they opened the car trunks and lifted up the seats to see if you had brought something illegal. They are very, very strict.</p>
<p>Germans have to enter through one place and Swiss through another place. Indians go the same way as the Swiss, so Kailash and I went together.</p>

<p>At the concert last night the audience applauded after I played the synthesiser. Strangely enough, what I played was absolutely original.</p>
<p>Sometimes a very peculiar rhythm comes, and for a few seconds that peculiarity remains. It gives me so much joy. At that time I don't have to worry about the melody at all!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A small world</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A small world" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This world is so small. In 1966 a German lady became my disciple in Puerto Rico. She lived right across the street from our first Centre there. From my apartment I could see where she lived. In my book <em>Yoga and the Spiritual Life</em>, there are quite a few questions on the soul that were asked by her. She also translated our Invocation into German. I gave her the Indian name `Abhaya,' which means fearless, dauntless.</p>
<p>One day Nadeshwar, our supreme boxing champion, was saying unkind things about the strength of women. Abhaya could not tolerate it, so she challenged him to a boxing match. She didn't know anything about boxing, but she was very mad.</p>
<p>Nadeshwar said, "Oh no, I can't fight with women."</p>
<p>After that, Nadeshwar kept quiet.</p>
<p>Abhaya moved to Miami a few years later and left us.</p>
<p>At the end of tonight's concert, who should come up to me but Abhaya! I didn't recognise her until she told me her name. She was quite devoted.</p>

<p>During the walk-past, one man asked me in Bengali if I can speak Bengali. So Projjwal thanked him and he went away.</p>
<p>If he had been a real Bengali, he would know that I am Bengali from the way I pronounce English. Also, I was singing in Bengali during the conce had some Gujarati boys and girls who spoke Bengali with perfect intonation and pronunciation. They spoke so fast that they could easily fool Bengalis.</p>
<p>But we Bengalis had such pride. We never learned Gujarati correctly. We knew quite a few words, so we would use Gujarati nouns and then complete the sentence with Hindi verbs. Our Gujarati friends could speak Bengali, but we thought it was beneath our dignity to learn Gujarati!</p>

<p>This is a cock and bull story. When I was a child in Chittagong, my family usually had two servants — one young and one old.</p>
<p>After tonight's concert, one boy came up to meditate with me after the concert. While we were meditating together, his soul said, "Madalia, you cannot recognise me?"</p>
<p>Not only did he use the nickname from my childhood, Madal, but he said it with an endearing term. I said, "Who can call me by my Chittagong name with this kind of endearing term? In my house, even my sisters and brothers didn't call me that, and here this young German boy is addressing me this way!"</p>
<p>Then the soul said that he had been our servant in Chittagong and he gave his former name. Then vividly I could see and remember him. I had heard that he had died, and now I see that he has taken a new incarnation in Germany. I was looking into his eyes and his soul recognised me.</p>

<p>There was another lady who came to see me after the concert. When I was in the Ashram, I was close to her brothers and her sister. But she was only four or five years old at that time, and during my 20 years at the Ashram I never had any occasion to speak to her.</p>
<p>Her sister had been the Ashram athletics champion. She had even learned how to box. She used to study with me. One of her brothers had been a wrestler. Once he injured his neck while wrestling and for three weeks was in the hospital. Her youngest brother once climbed up a tall coconut tree when he was three or four years old. Then he got frightened and couldn't climb down. He was crying and screaming because he was afraid.</p>
<p>The lady's name is Purnima. She started talking to me in Bengali. Then she introduced her husband to me. But she had forgotten the Bengali word for husband, so she said it in Hindi and added, "I have forgotten the word."</p>
<p>Then I was able to tell her the word in Bengali.</p>

<p>I was on my way to our hotel lobby for the Montreal Peace Concert. I got into the elevator on the twelfth floor and went down.</p>
<p>Kirit and Surashri had pressed the button for the elevator on the tenth floor. When the door opened, I saw them standing there. I thought that was the lobby so I went out of the elevator. They didn't say anything to me because they didn't know what I was doing.</p>
