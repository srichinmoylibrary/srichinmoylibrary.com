  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You have talked about the way a soul remains around after it has left the body to see if people are feeling sorry for the deceased. I have always thought that the soul is perfect. How can it have jealousy and desires?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: You have talked about the way a soul remains around after it has left the body to see if people are feeling sorry for the deceased. I have always thought that the soul is perfect. How can it have jealousy and desires?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is the way with ordinary souls. They like it if their dear ones cry. When an ordinary soul sees that its dear ones are crying, it feels, “Oh, they really cared for me.” But the good souls will say to those still on earth, “No, no, no. Only try to follow and live a divine life. Try to reveal and manifest the Supreme on earth.”</p>
<p>You have to know what kind of soul we are talking about. The vital has the same relationship to the soul that the physical has to the mind. If too much of the physical is inside the mind, we call it the physical mind. The soul is always good. But if too much of the impure, undivine lower vital is operating in and through the soul, then naturally the soul cannot come forward with its pristine beauty, purity and perfection.</p>
<p>Now, this house is good. It is so beautiful and glowing now that we have decorated it. But if we had put rubbish and junk here, it would give off very bad vibrations. Although the house is now very beautiful, the same place could be made very untidy and unclean, and then the consciousness, the vibrations, would be totally different. The house would then give a very bad vibration.</p>
<p>The soul is like a bird inside the body-cage. If the bird is tortured or mistreated while it is inside the cage, then it will become a very bad bird. Then, when it is released from the cage it will not have its original pure and free qualities. When the soul is hovering around the scene of the body’s death, the vital and the qualities of the vital will still be with it, so it will still maintain all its bondage.</p>
<p>The soul has to leave the vital world. There is a world for the vital, there is a world for the mind and there is a world for the psychic being. The soul has quite a few loads on its shoulders, let us say. After it leaves the body, one by one it will leave the psychic being, the mind and the vital on their own planes.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In our Centre, we have first class disciples, second class disciples, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh class disciples. We even have eighth class disciples. Some souls are like first class disciples. They are determined to manifest and reveal the Supreme on earth. Others become one with the vital. They come to earth to enjoy. Sometimes first class souls come here with the intention of spreading light, but then darkness enters into them from the temptation of the world and they surrender to darkness. These are weak souls. Each soul does have the divine spark in it. But we have to know how capable the soul is of manifesting the light, and how much it has consciously or unconsciously accepted the ignorance of the world.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every soul comes down with a promise. When a disciple comes to me, he immediately says, “Your path is by far the best for me. I am going to manifest you and fulfil you. But the next day the same disciple may leave me and say that my path is the worst path on earth. In the same way, although the soul comes from the Supreme with a promise, as soon as it enters into earth-ignorance, it forgets. Sri Ramakrishna brought two most powerful souls to earth with him to become his disciples. You know about Swami Vivekananda, whom he found. But there was another disciple who had been brought down from the soul’s region, whom Sri Ramakrishna could not find on earth. Even Sri Ramakrishna, with all his spiritual height, could not discover this soul. Where did he go? Ignorance took him away. He never came to Sri Ramakrishna at all.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Christ Consciousness and Cosmic Consciousness go together. Let us take Cosmic Consciousness as this room. This room needs someone to live in it. The Christ Consciousness will be the occupant. The Christ Consciousness lives in the Cosmic Consciousness. Then again, in the divine Lila, the divine Game, the Christ Consciousness may become the hall and the Cosmic Consciousness may become the occupant of the hall. They exchange roles.</p>
<p>One who has realised the Highest, like the Christ, has become part and parcel of the Highest. On the strength of his highest consciousness, on the strength of his inseparable oneness with his eternal Father, he said, “I and my Father are one,” and “I am the way, I am the goal.” How is it that he could say this? We all know that God is our Father, but this is just a mental idea. We heard it from our parents or we read it in books. But in the Christ’s case it is a reality, a living reality. He and his Father are one. So the Christ Consciousness and the Cosmic Consciousness are one. At times the Christ Consciousness is inside the Cosmic Consciousness, the universal Consciousness. And again, sometimes the Cosmic Consciousness is embodied in the Christ Consciousness. This is the game.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I&#039;ve heard that when one accepts a spiritual path, there is a point at which one must surrender oneself to a Guru who is higher than himself. But I&#039;ve also heard that one must constantly question the teachings of the Guru and listen to a voice within himself.

But I&#039;ve also heard that one must constantly question the teachings of the Guru and listen to a voice within himself. This idea of scepticism and questioning seems to contradict the idea of surrender." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all we have to know that if someone goes to the trouble of getting a Guru, then he has to listen to his Guru. It is better for him not to accept a Guru at all if he feels that he must doubt and question his Guru. Surrender is a different matter. A real spiritual teacher will say that he is not the Guru; the only real Guru is the Supreme. A human being is only a leader for a few people. It may be a hundred people, or a thousand, or it may be millions of people. But the real Guru, the only real Guru, is God. When you accept a human being as your Guru, it is just because he is more illumined than you are.</p>
<p>You should always listen to your higher part. Right now your mind is superior to your physical and your vital. When the mind asks you to do something, immediately the physical in you does it, the vital in you does it. But again, the heart is superior to the mind. We know that the mind doubts and suspects, and that it does not have one-pointed aspiration for a particular goal, whereas the heart gets light and illumination from the soul. That is why the heart is superior. Similarly, if the Guru, the human teacher, is sincere and illumined, then he is getting Light directly from the Supreme. He should then be considered as the higher part of the seeker, not as a different person. Since the physical feels that the mind is superior, the physical listens to the mind. Similarly, if the seeker feels that the person whom he has accepted as his Guru has more wisdom-light than he does, then he listens to that person, not with a sense of separativity, but as he would listen to his own highest part.</p>
<p>Now, the questioning mind can never realise the Highest. Only the aspiring heart can realise the Highest. If we constantly question, “Is he right? Is he wrong?” then we will never be able to go forward. We have to know what we want. If we want light, then we have to have implicit faith. Faith in whom? Faith in ourselves, faith in God and faith in the one whom we accept as our guide or leader. Once we reach the highest Goal, we do not need the guide. But if we start questioning the truth or the wisdom of the Guru, then we will never arrive at the Goal. If we really want to follow the spiritual life, we must have implicit faith in ourselves, in our teacher and in God. Then only will we make the fastest progress. If we question, if we doubt, then we can never make satisfactory progress.</p>
<p>A spiritual teacher is only the elder brother in the family. If he claims to be God, then he is fooling himself and others. The elder ones in the family generally know more than the younger ones. So they are in a position to show the younger ones where the goal is. Once they do this, then their job is over. In the spiritual life, it is necessary to abide by the soulful dictates of that part of us which is already illumined. It is not somebody else whom we are listening to; it is only our own highest part. We cannot consciously remain in our own highest consciousness all the time, but if we know that there is someone who always represents or embodies our highest part, then we can easily listen to him. If my head tells my legs to do something, my legs do not constantly question the wisdom or truth of my head’s directions. I do not feel that it is beneath their dignity to do what my head tells them, because I know that my head and my legs are part and parcel of my own body. In the same way, the Guru and his disciples are inseparably one.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one wants to follow a spiritual path, then to start with, one needs inspiration. He can get this inspiration from spiritual books, preferably written by the genuine spiritual Masters. Then, if he does not get adequate inspiration from the books, or if the books are not satisfying the seeker, he should mix with the disciples of some Masters in order to get inspiration. If he mixes with aspirants who have already found a path, then he gets encouragement and assurance. Finally, he should find a teacher. If there are quite a few teachers available, he has to make a choice.</p>
<p>The easiest way to select a Master or a path is to see which one gives you the greatest joy. The teacher who gives you the greatest joy is meant for you: you have some inner affinity with that particular teacher. Once you have chosen your Guru and your path, then you have to have all loyalty to your Master and all faith in him and in his path.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why is it that you always speak of God in masculine terms?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why is it that you always speak of God in masculine terms?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I say “Father,” I don’t exclude the Mother. God is both masculine and feminine. It is only that the term “Father” is more familiar in the Western world. In the West, the Christ taught us, “I and my Father are one,” and “Our Father, who art in Heaven.” He always said, “Father, Father.” So here I use the term “Father” because it is familiar.</p>
<p>In the East we use the term “Goddess” quite often — we think of the Supreme Goddess, of the Mother. We have so many goddesses: Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati. So in our case, it is very easy to think of God in feminine terms. But when I am with you, I have to use a term which is quite familiar to you, for I feel that it will become easier for me to share my experiences with you. In truth, God is both masculine and feminine. And again, He transcends both: He is neither masculine nor feminine. He is what He is, eternally is: He is His Vision, and He is His Reality. This Reality transcends both masculine and feminine form; and at the same time it embodies both masculine and feminine.</p>

Before you do something, pray to God: “God, if it is Your Will, then please inspire me to do it well.” While working, tell God, “God, since I have accepted this work with the feeling that You wanted me to do it, please work in and through me so that I can do it well.” At the end of the work, whether the result comes as success or as failure, offer it at the Feet of God with the same joy. Then you have done what God wants you to do. But before you do anything, you will have to pray to God, in this way: “If it is Your Will please inspire me. From your inspiration I will be able to know that it is Your Will.”</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want inspiration, then pray to God. Inspiration is the first step. If you are not inspired, you will not budge an inch. You will not do anything. You will not make any progress. There is nothing wrong with praying to God to give you inspiration, just as you cry to Him to give you more aspiration, intense aspiration. People are inspired. That is why they become great scientists or something else great. If they are not inspired, they cannot do anything. So you can pray to God to give you inspiration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can you take the mind to the heart? It seems impossible.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can you take the mind to the heart? It seems impossible." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why should it be impossible? If it is impossible, how has this restaurant done it? How have I done it? Do not pay any attention to what the mind tells you. Just feel that there are two boys in front of you. One is a mischievous boy; the other is kind, polite and nice in every way. So you pay attention to the nice one. The bad one will try to disturb you, but do not pay any attention to him. In this world there is something called pride. We think that only good people have a sense of their own dignity. But that is not true. Bad people also have it. That bad boy will bother you for a long time. But if you do not pay any attention to him, then he will say that it is beneath his dignity to bother you. The mind is like a very bad boy, pinching you all the time. If you do not pay any attention to him, if you just let him go on and on, then sooner or later he will stop bothering you. He will see that you are paying all attention to the other boy, the heart, which is very kind, affectionate and loving.</p>
<p>Then you will see that gradually the mind will become good. There is always competition in this world. The mind will try to compete. He will say, “By disturbing and bothering this person I have gained nothing. On the contrary, he is ignoring me like anything.” Then the mind will try to imitate the heart. It will say, “I can also become a nice boy. I shall become nicer than he so that I can get more attention, more affection from this person.” In the beginning it will try to imitate the heart. Then after a few months or a few years it will say, “Why have I to imitate the heart? Let me try to become good in my own way. Let me try to please the boss in my own way.” When it tries to please the boss in its own way, it will find it very, very difficult. Then it will say, “Let me go deep within and see how it is possible for the heart to please this person, while I cannot.” When it goes within, it will see that inside the heart the soul abides, and the soul is constantly offering light to the heart. That is why the heart is able to please you. So the mind will try to enter into the soul.</p>
<p>But the mind will find it very difficult to enter into the soul, because the soul is like the vast ocean. The mind will think, “Oh, if I enter into the ocean, I will be totally lost.” Then the mind will see how much light the heart has and how much light the soul has. When the mind makes a comparison between the heart’s light and the soul’s light, it sees that the soul has much more light than the heart. But the light that the heart has is more than enough to satisfy the person, and the mind will feel that the light of the heart is within its reach. The mind is ready to fight with the heart, but it does not dare to fight with the soul because it sees how powerful the light of the soul is. So the mind tries to compete with the heart’s light and then, while competing, it comes very close to the heart in a positive way. At that time, the soul, out of its infinite compassion, offers light to the mind through the heart. The mind is able to grasp or to know the capacity or quality or quantity of the heart’s light, but it cannot grasp the soul’s light. The soul is kind, so it tries to offer a little light to the mind through the heart, according to the mind’s capacity.</p>
<p>Try from the very beginning to think of the mind as a naughty boy who is creating problems all the time. Then ignore it. Think that your mind does not exist. There are thousands of people, millions of people, who do not have this kind of mind, but they do exist because they have the heart. You can ignore your mind for many years, but you will not ignore it forever. If anything in us remains imperfect, we cannot be totally perfect. If any part of our being remains imperfect, then we are not complete. It is not that we shall neglect and ignore the mind forever. But for the time being we have to be wise. Let the mind know that it is not sufficient, it is not complete, it is not perfect, it is not even necessary. Just as the mind tries to convince us all the time, let us now convince the mind that it is not perfect, it is incomplete, it is weak, it is helpless, and that we do not need it. We need something higher, something deeper, something infinitely more meaningful and fruitful. Now we have surrendered to the mind, but when we convince the mind, the mind will surrender to us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To some extent you have already conquered it. If you had not conquered the animal in you, you would not have become a human being. So let us say, how can you conquer the human in you, human weakness? Human weaknesses you can conquer only by paying all attention to the divine strength, divine capacity, divine potentiality within you. Always look ahead, look forward; do not look backward. From the animal kingdom you have already come to the human. But that is not enough. You want to enter into the divine kingdom. Always try to remember the divine in you, not the human. Then the human in you, which is imperfection, limitation and bondage, will leave you, or you will transcend it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What can I do to clear my mind of old emotional attachments? Why don’t they leave my mind?</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What can I do to clear my mind of old emotional attachments? Why don’t they leave my mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The answer is very simple. What God has, or what God is, is not enough for you. If you can make yourself feel that God is enough for you, God is complete and God can make you complete, then thoughts about other people will go away. If you feel that by thinking of God, you will be able to get only ninety-nine dollars, and that if you think of your ex-wife you will be able to make it one hundred dollars, then naturally she will come into your mind. But if you feel that God is one hundred dollars, then you will not need to think of others. If God is enough for you, then your previous attachments will not come to plague you.</p>
<p>In one place, two persons cannot stay. An Indian Master once said, “If I have only one small room, then only God can stay there.” Your mind is a tiny room, let us say. The capacity of that room is very limited. Either God can stay there or man can stay there. There is not sufficient room for both. I am sure you have read my story, <em>Go Alone.</em><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> On that flimsy bridge only one person could go at a time, not two. If two had gone, then the bridge would have broken. The mind is also weak like that. If you try to keep God and your ex-wife there together, then the mind will collapse. The best thing is to keep only God. Always try to feel that God is more than enough for you. Then nobody else can come into your mind. What God has and what God is are more than enough for you or anybody. If you do not feel this, then immediately everybody will come into your mind.</p>
