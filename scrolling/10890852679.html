<p>One day Mahavira was meditating peacefully at the foot of a tree. A cowherd brought his cow to that place and said to Mahavira, "Please take good care of my cow. I will return later."</p>
<p>Mahavira was in deep meditation and he did not reply to the cowherd. The cowherd felt that the sage's silence meant that he agreed to accept the responsibility of the cow and so he went on his way quite happily, leaving the cow behind.</p>
<p>Mahavira continued in his meditation as before. After a few hours, the cowherd came back. He was shocked to discover that his cow was no longer there. It had wandered away. He was furious with the sage and began striking Mahavira mercilessly. Then the cowherd climbed up the tree and broke off a small branch. He started thrashing Mahavira with the branch, but Mahavira did not utter a word.</p>
<p>Finally, the cowherd took two sharp sticks and drove them deep into Mahavira's ears to seal them up. He shouted, "Since you pretend to be deaf, let me make it true!" Then he left the place.</p>
<p>Mahavira's ears were now bleeding profusely and he was in acute pain. He rose to his feet and walked to the next village. When the villagers saw him, they were simply horrified that someone could have treated him so badly. They gave Mahavira proper medical treatment and they were able to cure him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The question of fate</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The question of fate" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Mahavira's first disciple was called Goshalak, but Mahavira used to call him Goshal. Goshal stayed with Mahavira for six years. Then they had a difference of opinion and Mahavira had to ask Goshal to leave.</p>
<p>The main reason they disagreed had to do with Mahavira's philosophy on fate. Goshal believed that, as human beings, we have to reap the fruits of our past actions. Everything depends on what we did in the past.</p>
<p>Mahavira said, "It is true that we reap the fruits of our past actions, but at the same time we have the capacity to go beyond our past. We are not completely subject to fate. If we pray and meditate, we can go far beyond the results of our past actions."</p>
<p>Goshal felt that fate is the last word in human existence, and Mahavira was of the same opinion as Sri Aurobindo, who said: "Fate shall be changed by an unchanging Will."</p>
<p>Eventually Goshal left his Master. He went out and started practising austerities on his own. He practised for many years and was able to acquire great yogic powers. He also gathered a number of disciples. Unfortunately, on several occasions his moral conduct was deplorable.</p>
<p>Many years later, after Mahavira's enlightenment, Goshal was to reappear in the life of his former Master.</p>

<p>A particular king was killed in a battle and all his wealth was taken away. As a result, his young daughter, whose name was Chandana, was left completely helpless. One day she was walking along the street in a very sad mood. A rich merchant passed by. Seeing the princess, he enquired after her welfare. Chandana asked him if she could obtain work in his house as a maid. The merchant felt very sorry for Chandana and immediately offered her a position in his household.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Chandana was so beautiful that the merchant's wife became very jealous. "This girl will create all kinds of problems for me," she said to herself. The wife did not dare to ask Chandana to leave the house but she took the opportunity to torture her whenever she could.</p>
<p>It happened that Mahavira once came to the merchant's house. As soon as Chandana saw him, she ran and fell at his feet. She begged Mahavira to accept her as his disciple. Mahavira gladly accepted Chandana, and with her he began his order for women.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Mahavira and the learned pandit</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Mahavira and the learned pandit" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In the course of time, Mahavira became very well known. When he gave talks, he used to speak in Prakrit, which was the language of the people. He used simple words that they could understand. Most of the sages and pandits of that time spoke in Sanskrit, which was infinitely more difficult.</p>
<p>People used to flock to hear Mahavira's lectures. He would stay one or two nights in each village and then move on. He never stayed more than a few nights in any one place.</p>
<p>Once he entered a certain village and, as usual, all the villagers left their places of work to come and listen to him speak. In that village there was a very learned pandit. He had studied the <em>shastras</em> and he was a supreme authority on the teachings of the sacred scriptures.</p>
<p>The pandit noticed that everybody seemed to be hurrying somewhere and he asked one group, "What is happening? Is there a circus or something of that nature?"</p>
<p>The men replied, "We are going to hear Mahavira. He is fully illumined."</p>
<p>"What!" exclaimed the pandit. "He is nothing but an upstart! I have read <em>all</em> the scriptures. There is nothing he can tell you that I cannot. I will punish this rogue for fooling innocent people. I will expose him!"</p>
<p>So saying, the pandit followed the crowd to where Mahavira was seated in meditation. Thousands of people had gathered. Mahavira gave a very simple talk. He asked them to pray and meditate, to have more compassion for each and every soul on earth and to renounce the life of pleasure.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his talk, Mahavira started calling out, "Indrabhuti, Indrabhuti!" It was the name of the pandit. Mahavira said to him, "What are you doing there at the back of the crowd? Come closer to me."</p>
<p>The pandit was astonished. He asked, "How could you know my name? I did not reveal it."</p>
<p>"I know your name," answered Mahavira compassionately. Then he continued his talk. Everybody listened enraptured and nobody paid any further attention to the pandit.</p>
<p>When Mahavira had finished speaking, Indrabhuti said to him, "How do you know all these things? Have you studied the scriptures?"</p>
<p>"No, my son," replied Mahavira. "I know these truths because of my inner realisation. Books can never give us illumination. Illumination can only come from prayer and meditation. I want everybody to pray and meditate. This path is for everyone."</p>
<p>"How can it be?" protested Indrabhuti. "How can monks and householders, men and women, all follow the same path and keep the same standards?"</p>
<p>"Everybody <em>can</em> follow the same Truth," said Mahavira. "By forgiving all beings, having friendship towards all and malice towards none, you will realise the Truth."</p>
<p>Indrabhuti felt so much love and compassion in Mahavira that he became his disciple.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Goshal&#039;s curse</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Goshal&#039;s curse" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Many years after he had attained enlightenment, Mahavira went to a particular village to spread his message. His former disciple, Goshal, was also in the same village with his own disciples. Mahavira said publicly, "Some people have sincerely realised the Truth, while others have only false realisation. My ex-disciple, Goshal, is one of that type."</p>
<p>Goshal soon came to hear what Mahavira had said concerning him and he became furious. He came with some of his disciples to challenge Mahavira.</p>
<p>"Withdraw what you have said about me!" demanded Goshal.</p>
<p>"No, I cannot do that," replied Mahavira.</p>
<p>"Then tell me why you said 'my ex-disciple Goshal'," said Goshal. "How dare you claim that I was your disciple? I was never your disciple."</p>
<p>Mahavira looked at Goshal. "You were our Goshal," he said. "You stayed with us for six years."</p>
<p>"No," insisted Goshal. "I am not your Goshal. I have changed my name. It is now Udaye Kundiyajan."</p>
<p>"Oh, I was only talking about our Goshal," said Mahavira. "If you were not our Goshal, then why do you have to identify with him? Why do you have to be affected at all? If it is true that Goshal was someone else, then why do you have to worry about what I said?"</p>
<p>But Goshal was not satisfied with Mahavira's reasoning. He began to threaten Mahavira verbally. "You must never again say that I was your disciple," he screamed.</p>
<p>Mahavira remained unmoved. "I know you were my disciple," he said. "You were with me for six years."</p>
<p>Then a heated discussion ensued. Goshal became so enraged that he literally wanted to kill Mahavira. He used a special kind of occult power to attack Mahavira. The name of that occult force is <em>tejoleshya.</em> It is a kind of deadly heat.</p>
<p>When Goshal directed this force towards Mahavira, the destructive force penetrated Mahavira's body and then rebounded back to Goshal. Both of them were in severe pain. Their bodies were burning, burning.</p>
<p>Then Goshal faced Mahavira and said, "I am cursing you! Within six months you will die!"</p>
<p>Mahavira said, "I am sorry, but you will die in seven days and I will live sixteen more years."</p>
<p>Mahavira's disciples and Goshal's disciples all witnessed this scene. They saw that Mahavira was protected by his purity and spiritual height.</p>
<p>It came to pass that on the seventh day after this encounter Goshal died, while Mahavira went on to live for another sixteen years.</p>
<p>Occultly Mahavira knew that Goshal was in the village when he first gave the message about Goshal's false realisation. Goshal had misused his occult power on many occasions and the time had come for him to be exposed to the whole world.</p>

<p>Although Goshal could not kill Mahavira, he did create serious physical problems for this great soul. Because of Goshal's destructive attack, Mahavira suffered from a burning sensation in his body. This went on for many years.</p>
<p>Mahavira's disciples were very distressed to see their Master in this condition. They begged him, "Please tell us how you may be cured."</p>
<p>"Only one person can cure me," Mahavira said. "Her name is Revati. She is an extremely devoted seeker. She is beautiful in her heart and in her life. You will find her in the village of Shavasti. If you go there and beg for alms, she will give you sweetmeats. Those sweets will immediately cure me."</p>
<p>The disciples hurried to that village and Revati gave them sweetmeats. As soon as Mahavira ate them, his pain disappeared completely.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Mahavira attains Nirvana</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Mahavira attains Nirvana" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Lord Mahavira was now 72 years of age. It was the rainy season and he was staying in Pava. Tirelessly and selflessly, Mahavira passed his days and nights in giving discourses and answering questions in a large hall. Many people had gathered, including the members of various royal families. All gazed at the sage, who was seated in the lotus position before them, and drank in his every word.</p>
<p>After preaching more than 110 sermons — the final one lasting no less than 48 hours — Mahavira entered into deep meditation and withdrew from his physical body. This is the fifth and final auspicious event in Lord Mahavira's life. Like the Buddhists, the Jainas refer to this state as <em>nirvana.</em></p>
<p>When the assembled crowds realised that Mahavira's soul had departed, they said, "The light has gone from this world. Let us now light clay lamps." Countless small lamps were lit to soulfully observe the passing of their beloved Teacher. Some people believe that this is one of the origins of our Indian Dipavali festival.</p>
<p>Lord Buddha was residing nearby at Samagrama at the time. Within a few fleeting hours, messengers brought him the news that Mahavira had attained <em>nirvana.</em> Although Lord Buddha and Lord Mahavira did not meet on the physical plane, they had tremendous respect for each other.</p>

<p>Mahavira had eleven main disciples. The Jainas refer to them as <em>ganadharas.</em> Among them, the first and foremost was Indrabhuti Gautama, the learned pandit who had come to one of Mahavira's discourses with the intention of exposing him as a fraud.</p>
<p>Like Ananda, who was the Buddha's dearest disciple, Indrabhuti was deeply devoted to his Master. On the last day of Mahavira's life, in the year 527 BC, Mahavira gave a most moving sermon for Indrabhuti's benefit. In it, he urged his disciple not to halt before reaching the final Goal, but to make all haste to cross to the other Shore.</p>
<p>It is said that Indrabhuti was so inspired by the words of his Master that he achieved enlightenment the same day.</p>

<p>In the sixth century before the birth of Christ, the Supreme's Light descended very powerfully to earth in the form of spiritual Masters of the highest order, visionary prophets and wisdom-flooded philosophers.</p>
<p>In India, Lord Buddha and Lord Mahavira attained enlightenment and established spiritual paths to guide humanity to the goal of <em>nirvana;</em> in Persia, the prophet Zoroaster spread his lofty teachings on the nature of goodness and the reality of Heaven and hell; in China, the sage Confucius taught moral and social precepts that were to become the foundation of the Chinese way of life; and in Greece, the philosopher-giant Socrates, with his indomitable inner spirit, ushered in a new mode of thinking and a new standard of morality.</p>

<h2>Foreword to the Jain Declaration: by Dr. L.M. Singhvi</h2>

<p>The Jain tradition which enthroned the philosophy of ecological harmony and non-violence as its lodestar flourished for centuries side-by-side with other schools of thought in ancient India. It formed a vital part of the mainstream of ancient Indian life, contributing greatly to its philosophical, artistic and political heritage. During certain periods of Indian history, many ruling elites as well as large sections of the population were Jains, followers of the <em>Jinas</em> (Spiritual Victors).</p>
<p>The ecological philosophy of Jainism, which flows from its spiritual quest, has always been central to its ethics, aesthetics, art, literature, economics and politics. It is represented in all its glory by the 24 <em>Jinas</em> or <em>Tirthankaras</em> (Path-finders) of this era whose example and teachings have been its living legacy through the millennia.</p>
<p>Although the ten million Jains estimated to live in modern India constitute a tiny fraction of its population, the message and motifs of the Jain perspective, its reverence for life in all forms, its commitment to the progress of human civilisation and to the preservation of the natural environment continues to have a profound and pervasive influence on Indian life and outlook.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century, the most vibrant and illustrious example of Jain influence was that of Mahatma Gandhi, acclaimed as the Father of the Nation. Gandhi's friend, Shrimad Rajchandra, was a Jain. The two great men corresponded, until Rajchandra's death, on issues of faith and ethics. The central Jain teaching of <em>ahimsa</em> (non-violence) was the guiding principle of Gandhi's civil disobedience in the cause of freedom and social equality. His ecological philosophy found apt expression in his observation that the greatest work of humanity could not match the smallest wonder of nature.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Extracts</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Extracts" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>These extracts on the Jaina philosophy are taken from a keynote address delivered by His Excellency Dr. L.M. Singhvi, High Commissioner for India to the United Kingdom, at the Summit on Religions and Conservation held in Atami, Japan, on 7 April 1995.</em></p>
<p>The premise of the Jain religion is that the goal of human life is liberation, which is defined as perfect knowledge, perfect intuition and eternal bliss. The path to liberation is paved by enlightened world-view, enlightened knowledge and enlightened conduct.</p>
<p>The Jaina theory of knowledge, known as <em>anekantavada</em> or the doctrine of manifold aspects, describes the world as a multi-faceted, ever-changing reality with an infinity of viewpoints, depending on the time, place, nature and state of the one who is the viewer and that which is viewed. It is this doctrine and the discipline of non-violence which lead to the doctrine of <em>syadvada</em> or relativity, which states that truth is relative to different viewpoints ( <em>nayas</em> ). What is true from one point of view is open to question from another. Absolute Truth cannot be grasped from any particular viewpoint alone because absolute Truth is the sum total of all the different viewpoints that make up the universe.</p>
<p>Because it is rooted in the doctrines of <em>anekantavada</em> and <em>syadvada,</em> Jainism does not look upon the universe from an anthropocentric, ethnocentric or egocentric viewpoint. It takes into account the viewpoints of other species, other communities and nations and other human beings.</p>
<p>According to the Jaina tradition, maximum abstinence from violence is of pivotal value and is the foundation of all virtues. Self-restraint is the hallmark of non-violence. Compassion and reverence for life are the sheet-anchor of the Jain quest for Peace, Harmony and Rectitude, based on spiritual and physical symbiosis and a sense of responsibility and restraint arising out of the ethical principle of cause and effect.</p>
<p>Although the term <em>'ahimsa'</em> is stated in the negative ( <em>a</em> = non, <em>himsa</em> = violence), it is rooted in a host of positive aims and actions which have great relevance to contemporary environmental concerns. <em>Ahimsa</em> is an aspect of <em>daya</em> (compassion, empathy and charity), described by a great Jain teacher as "the beneficent mother of all beings" and "the elixir for those who wander in suffering through the ocean of successive rebirths." <em>Jiva-daya</em> means caring for and sharing with all living beings, tending, protecting and serving them. It entails universal friendliness ( <em>maitri</em> ), universal forgiveness ( <em>kshama</em> ) and universal fearlessness ( <em>abhaya</em> ). Jains, whether monks, nuns or householders, therefore affirm, prayerfully and sincerely, that their hearts are filled with forgiveness for all living beings, that they crave the friendship of all beings, that all beings give them their friendship and that there is not the slightest feeling of alienation or enmity in their hearts for anyone or anything. They also pray that forgiveness and friendliness may reign throughout the world and that all living beings may cherish each other.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the Jaina tradition, as indeed the Vedic and Buddhist traditions, established the principles of ecological harmony centuries ago, not because the world was perceived as heading for an imminent environmental disaster or destruction, nor because of any immediate utilitarian exigency, but because of its quest for spiritual and physical symbiosis, synthesised in a system of ethical awareness and moral responsibility.</p>
<p>Jaina ecological philosophy is virtually synonymous with the principle of <em>ahimsa</em> (non-violence) which runs through the Jaina tradition like a golden thread. Non-violence is the supreme religion and is the keynote of the Jaina tradition. Lord Mahavira threw new light on the perennial quest of the soul with the truth and discipline of <em>ahimsa</em> and said:</p>
<p>"There is nothing so small and subtle as the atom, nor any element so vast as space. Similarly, there is no quality of soul more subtle than non-violence and no virtue of spirit greater than reverence for life."</p>
<p><em>Ahimsa</em> is a principle of compassion and responsibility. It should be practised not only towards human beings, but towards all animals and nature. The Jaina scriptures tell us:</p>
<p>"The <em>Arhats</em> (Venerable Ones) of the past, present and future discourse, counsel, proclaim, propound and prescribe thus in unison: Do not injure, abuse or press, enslave, insult, torment, torture and kill any creature or any living being."</p>
<p>Suffused with the theory of <em>karma</em> and transmigration of souls, Mahavira sums up the rationale of his philosophy of compassion and non-violence when he says:</p>
<p>"You are that which you intend to hit, injure, insult, torment, persecute, torture, enslave or kill."</p>
<p>It is the same sense of compassion and non-violence which is the basis of the ancient Jaina scriptural aphorism <em>Parasparopagraho Jivanam</em> (all life is bound together by mutual support of interdependence). Lord Mahavira proclaimed a profound ecological truth for all times to come when he said:</p>
<p>"One who neglects or disregards the existence of earth, air, fire, water and vegetation disregards his own existence which is entwined with them."</p>
<p>Jainas do not acknowledge an intelligent first cause as the creator of the universe. The Jaina theory is that the universe has no beginning or end. It is traced to <em>jiva</em> and <em>ajiva</em>, the two everlasting, uncreated, independent and co-existing categories. Consciousness is <em>jiva.</em> That which has no consciousness is <em>ajiva.</em> There are five substances of <em>ajiva: Dharma</em> (the medium of motion), <em>Adharma</em> (the medium of rest), <em>Akasha</em> (space), <em>Pudgala</em> (matter) and <em>Kala</em> (time).</p>
<p><em>Pudgala</em> (matter) has form and consists of individual atoms ( <em>paramanu</em> ) and conglomerates of atoms ( <em>skandha</em> ) which can be seen, heard, smelt, tasted and/or touched. According to Jains, energy, or the phenomena of sound, darkness, shade, heat, light and the like, is produced by conglomerates of atoms.</p>
<p>The <em>jiva</em> (soul) has no form but, during its worldly career, it is vested with a body and becomes subject to an inflow of karmic 'dust' ( <em>asravas</em> ). These are the subtle material particles that are drawn to a soul because of its worldly activities. The <em>asravas</em> bind the soul to the physical world until they have brought about the karmic result, when they fall away 'like ripe fruit' by which time other actions have drawn more <em>asravas</em> to the soul.</p>
<p>With the exception of the <em>Arihantas</em> (the Ever-Perfect) and the <em>Siddhas</em> (the Liberated), who have dispelled the passions which provide the 'glue' for the <em>asravas</em>, all souls are in karmic bondage to the universe. They go through a continuous cycle of death and rebirth in a personal evolution that can lead at last to <em>moksha</em> (eternal release). In this cycle, there are countless souls at different stages of their personal evolution: earth-bodies, water-bodies, fire-bodies, air- bodies, vegetable-bodies, and mobile bodies ranging from bacteria, insects, worms, birds and larger animals to human beings, infernal beings and celestial beings.</p>
<p>The Jain evolutionary theory is based on a grading of the physical bodies containing souls according to the degree of sensory perception. All souls are equal but are bound by varying amounts of <em>asravas</em> (karmic particles) which are reflected in the type of body they inhabit. The lowest form of physical body has only the sense of touch. Trees and vegetation have the sense of touch and are, therefore, able to experience pleasure and pain, and have souls. Mahavira taught that only the one who understood the grave demerit and detriment caused by the destruction of plants and trees understood the meaning and merit of reverence for nature. Even metals and stones might have life in them and should not be dealt with recklessly.</p>
<p>Above the single-sense <em>jivas</em> are micro-organisms and small animals with two, three or four senses. Higher in the order are the <em>jivas</em> with five senses. The highest grade of animals and human beings also possess rationality and intuition (<em>manas</em>). As a highly evolved form of life, human beings have a great moral responsibility in their mutual dealings and in their relationship with the rest of the universe. It is this conception of life and its eternal coherence, in which human beings have an inescapable ethical responsibility, that made the Jaina tradition a cradle for the creed of environmental protection and harmony.</p>
<p>The Jaina tradition lays great emphasis on an integrated code of conduct, austere and exacting for the monks (<em>Mahavratas</em>) but comparatively moderate and flexible for the householders (<em>Anuvratas</em>). The five vratas (vows) in the Jaina code of conduct are:</p>
<ul><li>non-violence in thought, word and deed,</li>
<li>to seek and speak the truth,</li>
<li>to behave honestly and never to take anything by force or theft,</li>
<li>to practise restraint and chastity in thought, word and deed,</li>
<li>to practise non-acquisitiveness.</li>
</ul><p>The vow of <em>ahimsa</em> is the first and pivotal vow. The other vows may be viewed as aspects of the larger concept of <em>ahimsa</em> which together form an integrated code of conduct in the individual's quest for equanimity and the three jewels ( <em>ratnatraya</em> ) of right faith, right knowledge and right conduct.</p>
<p>Underlying the Jain code of conduct is the emphatic assertion of individual responsibility towards one and all. Indeed, the entire universe is the forum of one's own conscience. The code is profoundly ecological in its secular thrust and its practical consequences.</p>
<p>The transgressions against the vow of non-violence include all forms of cruelty to animals and human beings. Many centuries ago, Jains condemned as evil the common practice of animal sacrifice to the gods. It is generally forbidden to keep animals in captivity, to whip, mutilate or overload them or to deprive them of adequate food and drink. The injunction is modified in respect of domestic animals to the extent that they may be roped or even whipped occasionally but always mercifully with due consideration and without anger.</p>
<p>Except for allowing themselves a judicious use of one-sensed life in the form of vegetables, Jains would not consciously take any life for food or sport. As a community, they are strict lacto-vegetarians, consuming neither meat, nor fish nor eggs.</p>
<p>By taking the basic vows, the Jain laity endeavour to live a life of moderation and restraint and to practise a measure of abstinence and austerity. They must not procreate indiscriminately lest they overburden the universe and its resources. Regular periods of fasting for self-purification are encouraged.</p>
<p>In their use of the earth's resources, Jains take their cue from "the bee that sucks honey in the blossoms of a tree without hurting the blossom and strengthens itself." Wants should be reduced, desires curbed and consumption levels kept within reasonable limits. Using any resource beyond one's needs and misuse of any part of nature is considered a form of theft. Indeed, the Jaina faith goes one radical step further and declares unequivocally that waste and creating pollution are acts of violence.</p>
<p>Accumulation of possessions and enjoyment for personal ends should be minimised. Wealth creation must have a philanthropic goal. Giving charitable donations and one's time for community projects generously is a part of a Jain householder's obligations. That explains why the Jain temples and pilgrimage centres are well-endowed and well-managed. It is this sense of social obligation born out of religious teachings that has led the Jains to found and maintain innumerable schools, colleges, hospitals, clinics, lodging houses, hostels, orphanages, relief and rehabilitation camps for the handicapped, old, sick and disadvantaged, as well as hospitals for ailing birds and animals. Wealthy individuals are advised to recognise that beyond a certain point their wealth is superfluous to their needs and that they should manage the surplus as trustees for social benefit. The five fundamental teachings of Jainism and the five-fold Jaina code of conduct are deeply rooted in its living ethos in unbroken continuity across the centuries. They offer the world today a time-tested anchor of moral imperatives and a viable route plan for humanity's common pilgrimage for holistic environmental protection, peace and harmony in the universe.</p>
