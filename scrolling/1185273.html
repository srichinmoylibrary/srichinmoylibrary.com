 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Why have some of America’s greatest and most spiritual leaders been killed by hostile forces?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It proves that ignorance is still here on earth. The world is far from perfection. The hostile forces are much more vigilant than the divine forces. That is why they are able to attack. Normally the divine forces are supposed to win the victory, but here on earth, we know how many hours we remain in ignorance, how many hours a day we are open to ignorance and hostile forces. Out of twenty-four hours we sleep seven or nine hours. To some extent sleeping is necessary for our health, but at that time we don’t aspire at all. So to some extent when we sleep, we make friends with ignorance. Physically it is necessary, but if we have to separate good from bad, then we will see that when we are unable to aspire, it is as bad as being attacked by hostile forces. Therefore, we have to be always alert. During twenty-four hours, if we spend most of the time praying, meditating and doing dedicated, devoted service, then for the remaining few hours of sleep, we will be protected by the divine forces.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we get rid of wrong forces, other than by just trying to do the right thing?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we get rid of wrong forces, other than by just trying to do the right thing?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You may have suffered from a wrong force for five minutes, but you have to feel that that force is not yourself; it is an attack by an enemy. Unfortunately, at that time, you think that you have to go to school and when you come back from school the hostile force will be taken care of. You feel that since no one knows that you have been attacked by a hostile, undivine force, then everything is all right. But I advise you that when you are attacked, if at all possible, do not go to school at all. If you do not go to school, your teacher may fail you for one day, let us say. But if you fail for one day in the inner world, ignorance gets more powerful. Then again tomorrow or a few days later, you will be attacked most powerfully. So when the power of ignorance is comparatively weak, at that time use your own power to attack it. Otherwise, if you allow ignorance-power to grow, it becomes very, very powerful. These hostile forces cannot be taken lightly. Before you get an attack, be careful. And if, unfortunately, you get an attack, try to fight it. Become a hero. The spiritual life is the life of a hero.</p>
<p>In the ordinary life, when you go to war, either you die in battle there or you come back. But in the spiritual life, the war is never over; the battle must be fought at every second. Some of you suffer from attacks for two weeks or three weeks or two months or even four months. But you do not realise what you are doing at that time. You may have had a good meditation at the centre or at home, but you are really weakening yourself when you allow those forces to attack. If you do this, a day will come when you will not have any power to fight those forces. They are the real enemies inside us. Either you have to transform them into friends with your spiritual power, or you have to chase them away. You have to know what is God’s Will. If it is a negligible force that has just come, then it will be very easy to transform it. If it is just a tiny force that has entered you, use your willpower and transform it into a positive force.</p>
<p>If you have lost faith in me and think that I am bad, immediately try to imagine something I gave you two months or two years ago which gave you joy. I always tell you people that the disciple who was the depression king is not the king of depression any more. There is not a single disciple who can say that I have never smiled at him or said a nice word to him. I tell you that if somebody has been with me for six months and if he is sincere, then I have smiled at him or said something nice to him at least once. When I do or say something nice to you, please write it down. Then when you doubt me or when you are angry with me, immediately remember that particular incident. Even if you feel that you are right and that I have been indifferent to you for some time, then just remember the incident that took place two years ago when I smiled or said something nice to you. With that memory you can forgive me. Your imagination of that incident has tremendous power. It will immediately conquer this negative force and make you again my own. It will help you gain faith in me and love for me.</p>
<p>Many of you suffer and think that I am indifferent to you or that you have done something wrong. Try to remember the day I smiled at you. Sometimes my smile is insincere; I can’t smile properly because I am tired and exhausted and some silly people are trying to bother me. If I were to smile and sympathise with them, then I would be insincere. But my heart is always there. The only thing is that sometimes these unfortunate people don’t need my smile, but when others are looking at them, they want to show off that they spoke to me. Nobody is going to hear what they tell me, but the very fact that they have spoken to me is enough for them to show others that they are very dear and close to me.</p>
<p>But you know when you have done something right. At that time I give you my soulful smile. That soulful smile is enough. Here you see me three or four times a week. When some other Masters smile at a particular person, it has to last two weeks — three weeks or more. Just a smile or any good word or encouragement is enough. Feel that this is your treasure. If I have encouraged you and appreciated you for something, feel that that is your most precious possession; then use that diamond when you need it. If you do good meditation, you are getting this most precious thing, the satisfaction-diamond, every day. But if you cannot meditate for a month or so because of some difficulty, I tell you your best weapon against depression or frustration is to know how many times I have appreciated you and encouraged you. This appreciation is not false. If you feel that my appreciation is sincere, try to remember it. It has tremendous power to conquer your depression-power or any vital world difficulties. I tell you, it is bound to conquer them.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do lower forces come to the fore to be purified or is it just because I am unconscious?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do lower forces come to the fore to be purified or is it just because I am unconscious?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When there is a divine inner urge, an inner pressure, they come to the fore for purification. Sometimes they come only to destroy. We have to be aware when the force has struck us, and when it has come to the fore for purification. We have to know whether it has come to the fore for illumination or for the destruction of the divine within us and around us. Sometimes, out of a malicious feeling, lower forces come and attack us. They don’t care for illumination and we do not have the necessary capacity to illumine them. Sometimes we acquire enough capacity to illumine them. Then if they come to the fore, we illumine them instead of destroying them.</p>
<p>The divine forces do not destroy the undivine forces, they only illumine them. When we see a radical change in a hostile force, we feel that we have destroyed it because we do not still see it in its previous form. But actually we have only transformed it. If we don’t see the night but only the day, then we are apt to feel that the night has been destroyed because we don’t see it any more with our outer vision. But if we know that the night has been transformed into day, then we know it as the illumination of something that once existed in a negative form. It has now been transformed into a positive form.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can one be constantly surrendered and at the same time deal with hostile forces?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can one be constantly surrendered and at the same time deal with hostile forces?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you really surrender to the divine in you, then the hostile forces are automatically conquered. It is just because you don’t surrender to the divine Will within you that you encounter these hostile forces. Surrender means that you remain in the light. If you are in light, how can there be darkness? You have two rooms, a room of darkness and a room of light. When you are in the room full of illumination, the undivine hostile forces cannot attack you. If you remain in the illumination-room, then you have the quality and capacity of that room. It is the same with the other room, which is full of darkness.</p>
<p>It is not like doing two things simultaneously. If you live in the dark room, you will be conquered by the darkness, and if you live in the light-room, then you are not only conquered by light but you conquer light. When you are in the ignorance-room, ignorance conquers you; you do not conquer ignorance. You become a victim, because you are not going to claim ignorance as your very own. But when you are in the light-room, not only does the light conquer you, but you also conquer the light and you claim light as your own.</p>
<p>So you have to decide whether to stay in the room that has light and surrender to the light, or in the room that has darkness. What you want, you will get. If you stay in the room that has light, the hostile forces cannot enter. But if you want hostile forces, they can claim you to such an extent that you won’t have the right to claim them as your own. If you want divine forces, they become yours and you can claim them as your very own.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Asuras are like powerful gorillas. Their eyes are very big. They are very strong, stout and fit, like jungle men or monkeys. Asuras can attack you most powerfully. A great spiritual Master was once asked, “You are divine. What can the hostile forces do to you?” The Master mentioned two or three of his closest disciples and said that the hostile forces could take them away. That is true. These forces can take away the Master’s absolutely dearest disciple. Inside a tiny little fly, you can see a huge hostile force. A thought is tiny, but it takes months to get rid of the hostile force inside it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A demon is an undivine force within us. It is an undivine entity, or an undivine being in us that tries to devour our divine possibility and potentiality. Each time we consciously or unconsciously surrender to ignorance, we strengthen the power of the demon inside. And each time we surrender to Light, to our Inner Pilot, to the Will of God, then the demon is bound to starve. It gets frightened. When you aspire, the demon starves. But when you remain in the world of desire, then the demon is fed by your own conscious or unconscious choice.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, the Supreme will never send hostile forces to give us an experience. He will not instigate something like that. He will never ask the hostile forces to go and attack some person so that after he is attacked the person will understand his Master’s compassion.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That was on a Thursday. The destructive forces were attacking me even before they had touched the physical. They touched the physical before they actually entered the physical plane. And today, after so many days, the forces finally entered the physical.</p>
<p>I am not trying to frighten you or threaten you, but you have to be aware of these things. These hostile forces can exist on the mental plane, and then all of a sudden, the vital plane and the physical plane become the victims. At that time, total destruction takes place. Right now, the Supreme and I are using tremendous power to fight these forces. Otherwise, God knows how many disciples would find their aspiration falling like anything. You can see that this happens from time to time. I have to explain all this to you, or total destruction could take place. Either you will fall like anything or you will get protection from me to the end of your life. Either destruction or perfection will take place this year (1972).</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It means that it has touched the body-consciousness. Let us take doubt and fear, for example. First they enter into the mind, then they come into the vital and then into the gross physical. When they touch someone’s gross physical, then tremendous fear controls his actions. The physical is scared because wrong forces have entered. But if the wrong forces exist only in the mind or the vital, then you can still go on. It is when they touch the physical that you become terrified, as if you were guilty of a crime and the police or someone are coming to catch you. At that time, you are terrified right from your mind to your physical.</p>
<p>It is as if a rat or some other destructive animal has eaten holes in a tree trunk right from the top to the bottom. The whole tree may collapse at any moment. But if it has been destroyed only at the top, then that part can be cut off. The tree becomes shorter, but it is not completely destroyed. Similarly, if a force enters into the vital, you can cut it out there. But if it enters the gross physical, the tree is so destroyed that you have to cut and cut until only the root remains.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does this mean that everybody will have to fight until the end of this year (1972), and then achieve perfection or destruction, or does it mean that people will be getting more and more perfect so that they won’t be bothered by destruction?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does this mean that everybody will have to fight until the end of this year (1972), and then achieve perfection or destruction, or does it mean that people will be getting more and more perfect so that they won’t be bothered by destruction?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On one day the disciples will be fighting hostile forces, and on the next day the forces of perfection will come forward. But gradually, those things meant for destruction will see that they are going to be destroyed. If we know that our enemy is stronger than we are, it is always better to wait to assimilate more power before fighting with him. We have to wait until we have enough strength to conquer him, otherwise, we will be defeated. Again, when the destructive forces come and act like enemies, they must not be allowed to touch our pure part. We have to threaten them, so that they cannot touch our aspiring heart. We have to be vigilant and then, little by little, consciously we can try to transform them. But if we consciously ignore them, we may think that we are safe because at a particular moment they are not bothering us. But when we relax, they can really attack us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, could you talk about what kinds of forces enter the body, how they enter, where they come from and also how we can get rid of these forces?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, could you talk about what kinds of forces enter the body, how they enter, where they come from and also how we can get rid of these forces?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Divine forces always come from above. Again, there is a divine force, the soul, that is already inside us. Either the divine force can come from above, from the Supreme, or it can come from within, from the inmost recesses of our heart, directly from the soul. There are also undivine forces that you have already accumulated inside your body. Again, these undivine forces are also in the atmosphere. Sometimes an undivine force can come from outside and attack you, and sometimes one that you have already housed within yourself may attack you. The undivine forces within you have to be brought to the fore through your aspiration.</p>
<p>It is like this. Because of your constant negligence and your lack of aspiration, some undivine forces have been attacking you, and you have surrendered to them. Now they are housed inside you. So you have to be vigilant at every moment. You must not allow anything undivine to come into your system, and you must fight to the end to throw out of your system anything undivine that is already there. The undivine forces are constantly attacking you, and the divine forces are constantly trying to save and illumine you.</p>
<p>You have to take the side of the divine forces all the time. Your friends are the divine forces, and your enemies are the undivine forces. If an enemy is inside your house, then you have to grab him and throw him out. And if he wants to enter your house, you will not allow him. If a friend is inside the house, you will ask him to stay, and if another friend wants to also come in, then of course you will let him in. You have to be very careful at every moment to make certain that the undivine forces will have no place within, without or around you. But you will keep the divine forces inside you, around you and everywhere because they are your real friends.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do the hostile forces enter us? How do we open ourselves to them?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do the hostile forces enter us? How do we open ourselves to them?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is like you are a building full of various holes and the dark forces enter into you through these holes. One big hole is called doubt. Then there are other holes called depression, fear, anxiety and worry.</p>
<p>The dark forces attack you most vehemently, especially when you want to make a major decision in your spiritual life. This is because if you are successful in the spiritual life, then you will enter into the sea of eternal Joy. You will be constantly playing with God’s Consciousness and dancing in God’s Consciousness. You will be totally freed from bondage, ignorance and death.</p>
<p>When you are asleep, when you are weak, nobody bothers you. But the moment you assert yourself, the moment you want to show that you are something and that you want to do something for the world, then all the forces will plague you. If you are very weak, if you can’t walk, people will show you sympathy. They will not come to attack and kill you. But if you assert that you are going to do something great and get divine Light, or that you will enter into the spiritual path and do wonderful things for the Supreme, then naturally you are creating a new rhythm, a new harmony and a new divine fulfilment on earth. If you are successful, you will create a new world in yourself and in all of humanity. So, the hostile forces will want to stop you and prevent you from doing the right thing. But if you do not care for the inner life, the spiritual life, and if you are satisfied with ordinary human life, then they will not attack.</p>
<p>We see millions and billions of people on earth who are most ordinary. For them either God does not exist, or God is all in the mind, or He is, God knows, somewhere in Heaven. And where is Heaven? Nobody knows. So it is all vague. But when you become conscious, then you try to act. First you become conscious of something and then you try to act on it. You want to realise and possess the highest; so you make an effort. Either you will be successful or you will fail, but if you make a sincere effort with tremendous, soulful inner aspiration, then you are bound to succeed. Your success means boundless realisation and infinite wealth.</p>
<p>Why should your enemies, darkness and the hostile forces, allow you to become the richest person in the inner world? If you remain a beggar they are satisfied and they won’t bother you. But if you really want to be the richest person, an emperor in the inner world, then naturally darkness, your worst enemy, will try to stop you. So you have to fight. If you have spiritual light, darkness becomes more arrogant, conscious and vigilant in its attempt to disturb you and prevent you from realising and achieving the highest and deepest Truth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> By becoming more open to the positive forces. If the goal is in the north, then you should walk towards the north and not go to the south. But if you walk towards the south one day, then you will be lost. Just walk towards the goal and you will reach the goal.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What is the best way to bring my consciousness to a stage where there is no fear?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One way to conquer fear is though the expansion of your consciousness. You are not afraid of your hand, your leg or your eye. Your consciousness pervades you from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head. You feel that these parts are yours, and that is why you are not afraid of them. But if you are afraid of someone who is beside you, around or near you, it is because you have not enlarged your consciousness to include them. I am not afraid of any of my limbs because they are mine. I claim them as my very own. But when we go beyond our own boundaries and do not want to enlarge or expand our consciousness, we feel that we are alienated and that everybody is a stranger to us. So when we practise Yoga, we try to enlarge our consciousness until the time comes when our consciousness pervades the length and breadth of the world. With our conscious awareness, we become one, totally one, with the universe. When we become consciously one with the universe, there can be no fear.</p>
