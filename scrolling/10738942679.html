  <h2 id="page-title">Ganapati sees his mother in the eyes of a tiger</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Ganapati sees his mother in the eyes of a tiger" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>It was at the house of his maternal uncle that Ganapati himself almost lost his life.</p>
<p>When Ganapati was around eight years old, he went to visit his eldest maternal uncle in the village of Kelishahar, which was six miles away. The village was near a chain of mountains which were covered with dense forests. Ganapati was extremely fond of roaming in these mountains.</p>
<p>About two o’clock one afternoon, when his friends were all in school, he decided to go for a walk on one of the mountains. He had been to that mountain many times before with his friends and relatives, but they had never gone beyond the edge of the forest.</p>
<p>This time, since he was alone, Ganapati was getting more joy from his adventure, so he decided to wander into the thick of the forest.</p>
<p>Ganapati was very fond of a certain kind of fruit called jujub. There were many jujub trees in the forest, so he climbed one of them and ate to his heart’s content. When he climbed down — lo and behold! — facing him, only ten feet away, was a tiger!</p>
<p>But rather than showing a ferocious face, the tiger seemed all mildness. Furthermore, Ganapati saw his own mother’s face reflected in the tiger’s eyes.</p>
<p>Seeing his mother in the eyes of the tiger, Ganapati felt no fear and raised no cry; he remained calm and serene. The more he looked into the tiger’s eyes, the more affectionate he felt the tiger was.</p>
<p>After about five minutes, very slowly he turned his back to the tiger and started walking away very slowly and cautiously. When he had covered about a quarter of a mile, he looked back to see if the tiger was following him. There was no sign of the animal.</p>

<p>Some of the villagers showed Ganapati sympathy while others scolded or mocked him. But his aunt was holding him with such affection, as if he had really been killed by the tiger. She was acting as though he had died and then come back to life by some miracle.</p>
<p>Although it had been decided that Ganapati would return home after spending four days at his uncle’s house, his mother arrived quite unexpectedly that same day. While she was taking her afternoon rest, in a dream she had seen her youngest son being attacked and killed by a tiger. She came with her servant to her brother’s home, practically insane with grief, assuming that her son was dead.</p>
<p>Ganapati was literally bathed in the sea of tears shed by his mother and aunt in their joy at seeing him alive and safe.</p>

<p>When Ganapati’s maternal uncle committed suicide because of his concern and worry for Ganapati’s family, he left behind his wife and three daughters. His wife never, never, never blamed Ganapati’s family for her husband’s death because she knew what kind of love her husband had for Ganapati’s father. His daughters felt the same way as their mother.</p>
<p>One of his daughters, Shephali, was staying at Ganapati’s house at the time her father committed suicide. But her sorrow and suffering were nothing in comparison to that of Ganapati’s mother.</p>
<p>When Ganapati’s mother heard the tragic news, she began to scream. She and her elder brother had been so close to each other. She was so grief-stricken that she was practically doing somersaults in the air. How bitterly she cried!</p>
<p>Shephali tried to console Ganapati’s mother in so many ways, but she was not successful. Her own father had died, but she was desperately trying to console her father’s sister!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The father fulfils the uncle’s request</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The father fulfils the uncle’s request" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This maternal uncle was closer than the closest to Ganapati’s father. When he was alive, so many times he had begged Ganapati’s father to give up smoking for the sake of his health. But Ganapati’s father did not listen to his repeated requests. Ganapati’s mother also used to smoke the Indian hookah, but less than his father. Then when the father used to come home on the weekends, the mother was a saint; she never smoked. She was afraid of her husband, so she never smoked on Saturday and Sunday. She did not want her husband to know that she smoked, but he knew.</p>
<p>The day that the uncle died, Ganapati’s father said to himself, “What kind of love do I have for him if I cannot give up smoking?” On that day he gave up smoking for good. He never touched cigarettes or Indian hookahs again.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">His first and last time smoking</h2><span property="dc:title" content="His first and last time smoking" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Ganapati’s parents never allowed their children to smoke or even to drink tea. Ganapati drank tea once in Chittagong and at the Indian spiritual community two or three times. Later when he would visit India, he would drink tea like anything. In his childhood home, tea and coffee were forbidden, and chicken was also forbidden, although in Chittagong the children could eat duck or goat meat. Then in the spiritual community there was no meat or fish allowed.</p>
<p>Once one of the servants instigated Ganapati’s eldest brother Samrat to smoke. After tasting cigarette smoke for a few seconds, the poor brother’s head began rotating. He was on a swing, and he fell down and got hurt. His right eye was very badly damaged.</p>
<p>Ganapati’s eldest sister was quite short, like a dwarf, in comparison to this brother’s height. When she discovered the cause of his fall, she commanded him to come inside a particular room. She bolted the door from inside and started beating him. He was crying and crying. He was much stronger than his sister, but how could he beat her? Respect is respect. How could he stop her? So he had to accept her beating. Then he took an oath that he would never smoke again because he was so badly beaten. That was his first and last time smoking.</p>
<p>Luckily, little Ganapati never wanted to smoke. When he saw his brother’s fate at the hands of his sister, he said, “Who wants to be beaten?”</p>

<p>The story of Suren did not end with the bank robbery.</p>
<p>After Suren disappeared with the money, his wife stayed at Ganapati’s house for about a month. She was so sad, embarrassed and miserable at what her husband had done.</p>
<p>But Ganapati’s family was not at all against her. On the contrary, they showered her with affection and concern. Ganapati’s parents treated her as part of the family, like another daughter.</p>
<p>And neither Ganapati’s father nor his mother held anything against the culprit.</p>

<p>After some time, Suren began telling people that he would sue Ganapati’s father if his wife was not returned to him. By now, the poor woman was missing him too, but she could not decide whether or not to go back to him.</p>
<p>Ganapati’s father thought that since she missed her husband, the best thing would be for her to go back. So he gave her a very large sum of money and asked her to go back to her husband.</p>
<p>That was the last time Ganapati ever saw her. He was about eight years old at the time.</p>
<p>She had been extremely, extremely kind and affectionate to Ganapati — just the way her husband had been.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A cruel punishment</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A cruel punishment" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There is still another unfortunate episode in connection with Suren. After the theft, one of Ganapati’s aunts insulted Suren mercilessly for what he had done. So Suren decided to punish this particular aunt.</p>
<p>He went to her house and told her that Ganapati’s father had touched the electric wire in the bank and had been electrocuted instantly. He said Ganapati’s brothers had brought their father’s dead body back from the bank to the village. How could he tell such a lie!</p>
<p>Ganapati’s aunt believed him. She was also grateful to him for bringing her this news, although it was extremely sad. She had great affection for Ganapati’s father, and she immediately began walking to Ganapati’s house. The house was three miles away, and she was crying pitifully the entire way.</p>
<p>When she was only eight or ten blocks from Ganapati’s house, she saw the village doctor and said to him, “You do not know what has happened?” Then she told him the sad story.</p>
<p>He said, “If your brother-in-law had died, I would definitely have been called to the house. I do not think that story is true.” But Ganapati’s aunt did not believe him. She continued walking to Ganapati’s house, crying and screaming.</p>
<p>The first thing she saw when she came near the house was Ganapati’s mother basking in the sun, reading the Mahabharata. Then she noticed that all the other members of the family were acting very normally.</p>
<p>Suren had been following his aunt secretly the whole time. He was wearing some kind of disguise and watching her from a distance. The moment she realised the truth, he threw off his disguise, gave her a smile and ran away.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Encounter at the high court</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Encounter at the high court" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Ganapati enjoyed going to the Chittagong High Court to watch the lawyers and jailbirds. Usually one of the family servants, either the maid or the cook, would bring him. Then he would stay at his second maternal uncle’s house, where his sister Madhuri lived.</p>
<p>On one particular occasion, about two years after Suren robbed the bank, it was decided that Ganapati and the servant would spend the whole day in town and go back home in the evening.</p>
<p>At the court, they were both enjoying themselves listening to the speeches of the lawyers. All of a sudden, Suren appeared out of the blue and grabbed Ganapati’s hand. Ganapati got the shock of his life to see his cousin again.</p>
<p>Suren said, “Please tell your mother that I have spent all the money that I stole from them and now I am living only on potatoes!”</p>
<p>What a pathetic scene; what a pathetic story!</p>
<p>When Ganapati came home that evening and told his mother the story, she was furious. “Why did you have to talk to him?” she said, and she went on insulting and scolding him.</p>
<p>Ganapati said, “He came up and grabbed me and told me about his suffering. What could I do?”</p>
<p>“So much money he took!” she said. She found it difficult to believe that it was all gone. Then she said, “Perhaps he has squandered the money.”</p>
<p>In a few moments she began shedding tears for her unfortunate nephew: “My sister’s son has no money. Alas, he is living on potatoes only!”</p>
<p>Such was Ganapati’s mother’s compassionate heart!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The story continues</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The story continues" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Many years later, a doctor came at around midnight to the house where Ganapati’s brothers and sister were living. Their house was in a spiritual community thousands of miles away from their village home. The doctor, who was a very nice, well-educated man, said that he was Suren’s son. He was able to tell correctly the names of all of Ganapati’s family members, so everything was absolutely true.</p>
<p>The only thing he did not know was that his father had robbed Ganapati’s father’s bank. Suren did not have the heart to tell his children what he had done, and neither did his wife. They had simply told their children that Ganapati’s relatives were now all living in a spiritual community.</p>
<p>Ganapati’s eldest brother was virtue incarnate. He took this doctor to his aunt’s house. His aunt was fighting with herself over whether she should hold a grudge against Suren’s son. But after a while she just went and embraced her grand-nephew.</p>
<p>Afterwards, this doctor brought his mother, his wife and his four-year-old daughter to visit Ganapati’s family and they all stayed at the family’s house. His mother started asking to be forgiven. She said, “Because you people are not married, it is easy for you to forgive. For others, it would be impossible, but we feel that you will forgive us.”</p>
<p>Ganapati’s sister, Chanchala, and his aunt were trying desperately to end the conversation so that the son would not find out what his father had done.</p>

<p>At this time, Ganapati was no longer living in India. He was running his spiritual centres in America.</p>
<p>Suren’s wife told Ganapati’s family that her husband had seen something in Ganapati even when he was just a child of three or four. She said that her husband had told her that he knew all along that the little fellow Ganapati would one day become a spiritual giant like his predecessors.</p>
