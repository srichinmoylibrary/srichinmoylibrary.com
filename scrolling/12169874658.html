<p>So many times this telephone operator tried and tried to get through to India for me. Finally I told her, "Please cancel my call."</p>
<p>She said, "Yes."</p>
<p>After 15 minutes the phone rang. I said, "I have cancelled it."</p>
<p>She said, "No, Sri Chinmoy, you told me to cancel it, but I didn't listen to you. Now I have got through."</p>
<p>My brother was on the line, and I was very happy.</p>

<p>The abbots of the temples we visited in Chiang Mai had such depth. I also liked the little children who are practising spiritual life there. Such strict discipline they have to observe! They have genuine aspiration.</p>
<p>Still, children are children, and these were no exception. Everywhere children have to learn how to behave. Definitely I talk to the Lord Buddha when I visit temples, but these children were not aware of it. Perhaps they show more respect to the Buddhist monks when they come there.</p>

<p>Last night at the temple we visited, I was meditating on the statues of the monks praying and giving them marks for their meditation — the way I sometimes give marks to my disciples. One was so nice that he got 100 out of 100. Another got 79 and one got 61.</p>

<p>When I was in the Bangkok Airport en route to India, I saw a very fat, middle-aged man standing on one side watching everything. He was the supervisor. As soon as he saw me, he said, "I remember you, I remember you, I remember you!"</p>
<p>I said, "From where?"</p>
<p>He said, "I have seen your picture in the newspaper, and I have also seen you on television. I am sure it is you."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, yes."</p>
<p>Then he said, "What are you doing nowadays?"</p>
<p>I told him, "Just yesterday I set a new record; I lifted a man weighing 317 pounds."</p>
<p>He said, "So much weight? No good for your heart! No good for your lungs! Don't do this anymore!" With such concern he was advising me.</p>
<p>Then I smiled and thanked him and went away.</p>

<p>After we went through security and immigration, there was a long line of passengers boarding the plane. I said, "Let me just relax and be the last person."</p>
<p>After everybody else had entered the plane, I was about to give my boarding pass to the lady when, O God, I see that fat man running towards me. He was the one who tells them when to close the gate after everybody has boarded the plane.</p>
<p>When he saw me, he said, "Can you give me a picture?" Luckily, I had a picture of my lifting the man who weighed 317 pounds, so I gave it to him.</p>
<p>I was the last person to enter the plane, but he was delaying me. He said, "Now tell me, are you a vegetarian? I have been a vegetarian for five years."</p>
<p>I said, "I have been a vegetarian for 45 years."</p>
<p>Then the lady collecting the boarding passes said to me, "Can you lift him?"</p>
<p>The fat man told her, "Easily, easily. I am not 317 pounds."</p>
<p>Then she asked the fat man if he could lift me.</p>
<p>He said, "Not yet! I have to be a vegetarian for another 40 years. Then easily I will be able to lift him."</p>

<p>On the plane from Bangkok to India, I was being blessed by children, as usual!</p>
<p>Just in front and to my right there was a woman with a little child. At first the child was fast asleep on her shoulder. But the mother wanted to show her fondness, so she was lifting up the child and massaging his shoulders very hard. Then, of course, the child woke up and started crying.</p>
<p>Then another child began crying right near me. He was with his mother two seats away. I was on the aisle and next to me was a middle-aged man. The child and his mother were next to the man.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the flight they gave us two forms to fill in. The middle-aged gentleman beside me didn't have a ballpoint, so he asked the lady whose child was crying if he could borrow her pen.</p>
<p>Immediately the lady said, "No!" But that was not enough. Then she stood up and started insulting him.</p>
<p>Then I said to the man, "You can use my ballpoint."</p>
<p>The man said to me, "This lady and I used to be married, but now we are separated. Do you know why we are separated?"</p>
<p>I said, "I don't know anything, and I don't want to know."</p>
<p>But he didn't listen to me. He just continued, "That child is not mine, but she claims it is."</p>
<p>I said to myself, "Oh, I have to hear this kind of thing!"</p>
<p>Then the lady started screaming at him- using such foul language. O my God!</p>
<p>I put away my ballpoint and pretended I had to go to the bathroom. For more than ten minutes I stood near the bathroom door. Finally I went back to my seat, but the fight was still going on! So again I left, all the time praying to God that this story would end. When I came back the second time, it had stopped.</p>
<p>I was so lucky not to get involved. Such a foul tongue the lady had!</p>

<p>How the tourists ruin the consciousness of Hawaii! If you enter into the heart of the island, you will see it is flooded with serenity, beauty, purity-every divine quality. But when you walk along the beach and see the tourists, it becomes something else. There is an immediate transformation. So we tourists are the culprits.</p>

<p>I asked him, "What is your name?"</p>
<p>He said, "My name is Normand."</p>
<p>I said, "Normand is not a Hindu name."</p>
<p>He said, "You do not know? There are four castes, and I come from the Brahmin caste. So Brahmins can have the name Normand."</p>

<p>The lady in one store in Bali was a perfect rogue. I wanted to buy something, but she quoted a price which was very high-30,000 rp. I said to her, "7,000."</p>
<p>She looked at me very nicely and said, "All right, 19,000-no less."</p>
<p>I said, "I won't pay 19,000. I will give you 8,000."</p>
<p>Then she said, "17,000." I took one step backwards and she said, "15,000."</p>
<p>I said, "No, 8,000 is enough!" and I started walking away. After I took seven or eight steps, she called out, "14,000!"</p>
<p>I said, "I am not going to come to your price."</p>
<p>Finally she said, "All right, all right- 8,000!"</p>
<p>In my mind I had been willing to go up to 10,000, but she accepted 8,000. So from 30,000 I shamelessly brought her down to</p>
<p>8,000. If they ask for 30,000, who else would dare to say 8,000?</p>
