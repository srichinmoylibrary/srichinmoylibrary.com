<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can begin by having good thoughts: “I want to be good, I want to be more spiritual, I want to love God more, I want to exist only for Him.” Let these ideas grow within you. Start with one or two divine ideas: “Today I will be absolutely pure. I will not allow any bad thought but only peace to enter into me.” When you allow one divine thought to grow inside you, you will see that immediately your consciousness changes for the better.</p>
<p>The best thing is to identify with your Master’s consciousness, but if you find that difficult then start with divine ideas: “Today I want to feel that I am really a child of God.” This is not a mere feeling but an actual reality. Feel that the Virgin Mary is holding the child Christ. Feel that the Divine Mother is holding you in her arms like a baby. Then feel: “I really want to have Wisdom-Light. I want to walk with my Father. Wherever He goes I will go with Him. I will get Light from Him.”</p>
<p>Some people don’t have ideas like this. Creative thoughts and ideas don’t come. There is just a vacuum. You may ask which is better — to have many silly messages in the mind or no messages at all. But there is a negative, inconscient way of meditating which has no life in it. This is not the silent mind. It is not productive. In real meditation, the mind is silent but at the same time constantly creating.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Think of the time when you had your highest meditation, three months ago, or yesterday, or this very morning. Just imagine it, and try to enter into it. After a while, imagination will grow into reality, and you will enter into deep meditation.</p>
<p>Another way is to feel that your Guru is hungry. Feel, “I have not fed my Guru and he is very hungry. It is time for me to feed him. He asked me to feed him, but I am loitering or roaming about in the streets. I am such a bad fellow, such a rascal.” You can immediately increase your aspiration by thinking that through your meditation you are feeding me. If you have that idea, immediately your heart will compel you to meditate.</p>

But after a few days, I didn’t have the same inspiration and it became very difficult." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we start something for the first time, we get inspiration. Anything that is new gives us tremendous inspiration, just because it is something new. But if we continue doing it we do not have the same enthusiasm, the same impetus, the same inspiration. We want to get something very deep, very high and very sublime, something most illumining from our early morning meditation. We are like a long distance runner. When the starter fires the gun, at the very beginning he is really inspired and he starts running very fast. But after about two or three miles, he becomes very tired: running becomes tedious and difficult. Now if he gives up running just because he is tired and because his inspiration is gone, he does not reach the goal. But if he continues running he will finally reach the goal. Then he will definitely feel that it was worth the struggle and suffering of the body.</p>
<p>It is like that in the spiritual life also. When you start your journey at three o’clock in the morning, feel that tomorrow is the continuation of that journey. Do not take it as a new beginning. And on the third day, feel that you have travelled another mile. Every day feel that you have travelled another mile. The day you start your spiritual journey is actually the most important. At that time you will have the most inspiration. But if you can feel that each morning during your meditation you are travelling a little farther, you will know that one day you will reach your Goal. Even if your speed decreases, you have to continue running and not give up on the way. When you reach the Goal you will see that it was worth the struggle. So every day when you meditate, it will help you if you think that it is a continuation of your previous day’s meditation. By taking one step at a time you reach the Goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I was really inspired to meditate for five or six days, and then I woke up one morning and did not have the feeling that I wanted to practice my meditation.

What can I do to spark myself without having to force things?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You said that for five or six days your aspiration lasts, then it disappears, and even if you try to meditate it does not come. But continue! Sometimes you don’t feel like eating, but you know that the body needs food. So you still eat every day. It is a natural habit, the body’s demand. So even if you cannot meditate properly or have your best meditation every day, you should not be worried.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the same level of meditation, you have to be very spiritually advanced. I am not throwing cold water on you; far from it. I wish to say that in the beginning you should be happy if just at times you get very good, very high, sublime meditation. When you don’t have a good meditation, don’t allow yourself to become a victim to frustration. If you get frustrated, you are losing your capacity to an even greater extent. Then on the following day, at that time also, it will be impossible for you to meditate deeply.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a good meditation today, then try to forget about it. Tomorrow if you have a meditation that is a little better, try to remember it. The past is dust. The past has not given you realisation; that’s why you are still praying and meditating. So why should you think of the past? You have to forget all that did not inspire you or encourage you to go farther. So if today’s meditation does not inspire you or has not given you most satisfactory results, try to forget it altogether.</p>
<p>You have aspiration and then you lose it. Then you cry for it, but you may not get the same aspiration back again. But here you have to realise that you are not an expert in meditation. Now your meditation is at the mercy of your inspiration or aspiration. When you are inspired, you have aspiration and you are ready to meditate. But this aspiration, this inner urge, will last only for a day or a few weeks and then it disappears. But when you become an expert, meditation will be at your command.</p>
<p>How can we become expert in anything? If we want to be a singer or a poet or a dancer, we have to practise daily. It is the same with meditation. When we practise meditation daily, there comes a time when it becomes spontaneous. If we regularly meditate once or twice a day, then we develop a kind of inner habit. Eating every day is an outer habit. If we did not eat, we could not exist on earth. Similarly, if we do not feed the soul, our inner being, every day, then the soul or the aspirant in us starves. And what happens then? We cannot reveal, we cannot manifest our own divinity.</p>
<p>If you meditate regularly for five months, six months, or a year or two, then automatically meditation will become spontaneous and natural. After a while, at such and such an hour, you will feel compelled to meditate. You will feel that meditation is your soul’s necessity and the inner urge to meditate will never be able to leave you. It will always inspire you and energise you. Early every morning when it is time for your meditation, your inner being will come and knock at your heart’s door.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The problem is that you are going to extremes. Sometimes you overeat and then you can’t digest what you have eaten; sometimes you don’t eat at all and you feel weak. When you don’t meditate you feel miserable, and when you meditate beyond your capacity you feel worn out. But you don’t have to pull, you don’t have to push. You only have to know how much capacity you have. In your case twenty minutes in the morning and in the evening is more than enough. If you meditate for only two minutes or five minutes, naturally you will not be inspired: but if you meditate for an hour or two you will strain your capacity. So meditate devotedly and soulfully for twenty minutes in the morning and twenty minutes in the evening, and in the afternoon if you have a chance you can meditate for two or three minutes more. That will be ample in your particular case.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When we miss a meditation, would it be a good idea to meditate for a longer time at the next meditation to make up for it?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When we miss a meditation, would it be a good idea to meditate for a longer time at the next meditation to make up for it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us say that you regularly meditate four times daily. Then at two of those times you are hard-pressed by mundane things and you don’t get the opportunity, so you only meditate twice that day. Whether you should meditate for twice as long in those two periods depends on your inner capacity.</p>
<p>Suppose you eat three times a day. Now early in the morning you didn’t have breakfast. At noon you missed your lunch. When it is time for dinner, if you want to eat all that you have not eaten in the morning and at noon, it will only upset your stomach. If you fast and don’t eat for two days or four days, then if you start trying to make up for the food that you didn’t eat during your fast, then you will run into trouble.</p>
<p>With meditation it is the same. You have inner capacity to meditate at fixed hours. You meditate early in the morning, at noon, in the evening and at night. If on a certain day you cannot follow this routine, it is better just to meditate most soulfully at the hours you have at your disposal. But if you try to increase the length of time, if you want to meditate two or three hours instead of half an hour because you missed the previous time, then it will be harmful. Your physical mind will not be able to bear the pressure. Instead of creating more capacity, this will break your capacity. It will create tremendous tension in your aspiration-self. Everything has to be done systematically, gradually. Gradually you will increase your capacity. Eventually you will be able to meditate for eight hours or ten hours at a stretch, but right now it is not necessary. When it is time you will be able to do it.</p>
<p>There are many stories about how aspirants get better results when they meditate soulfully and are not concerned about the number of hours. I wish to tell one story:</p>
<p>Narada was a great singer, a divine singer, and a great devotee of the god Vishnu. Once he became bloated with pride because he was Vishnu’s dearest devotee. Lord Vishnu wanted to smash his pride, so one day he said to Narada. “I want you to go into the world and visit my dearest disciple on earth.” Narada could not say it out loud to his Master, but inwardly he felt, “Your dearest disciple on earth? Who is it? Who could be dearer than I?” Vishnu said, “In a certain village there is a man who is a farmer, and this farmer is extremely devoted to me. I want you to go and visit him.” Narada went to the farmer’s house and stayed there for a few days. The farmer had a big family, with children and grandchildren. He shouldered a heavy responsibility, but early in the morning, before he went to cultivate the land, he uttered the name of Lord Vishnu three times most soulfully. Narada followed him into the field, and saw that at noon again he uttered the name of Lord Vishnu three times most soulfully. When he came back home he repeated Vishnu’s name three times more, and then he entered into his household affairs. For two or three days Narada observed the spirituality and daily meditation of the farmer.</p>
<p>Narada came back to Vishnu and said, “How can you say that that farmer is your dearest disciple? He repeats your name only three times in the morning, three times at noon, and three times at night? I repeat your name thousands and thousands of times during the day, and I have been doing it for so many years! How many years I have been praying to you, meditating on you, and chanting your name to inspire people!”</p>
<p>Vishnu said, “Wonderful, Narada. Now, I am thirsty. Please bring me a glass of water from the nearest pond.”</p>
<p>Narada went to fetch water for Vishnu, and there in the pond he saw a beautiful girl swimming. Narada fell in love with the girl and forgot to bring water for his Master. He married the girl and started a new life. They had a few children and in this way, many years passed. Then there was famine in the place where Narada was living and all his children died, and his wife died also. He was crying to relieve his suffering, “O, Lord Vishnu, save me, save me!” Vishnu came to him and said, “What about my glass of water?” and brought him back to reality.</p>
<p>Vishnu said, “It is just a minor thing to bring me a glass of water. But in the world of ignorance and illusion you lost all your devotion, aspiration, spirituality, everything. Now look at this farmer. He has such a big family; every day he is shouldering such heavy responsibilities, but even then he has the time to think of me, to meditate on me. I gave him his work of cultivating the fields; I gave him the responsibility of supporting a family. He discharges all his family responsibilities, but still he has time to think of me and meditate on me. But when I gave you something to do, you immediately forgot me.”</p>
<p>From this story we come to realise that it is not how many hours you meditate but how soulfully you meditate that is important. To come back to your question, I wish to say that if aspiration is really intense, if God really comes first in the aspirant’s life, then he can easily adjust his outer life to make time to meditate. He can change his outer circumstances. The inner aspiration has infinitely more power than the outer obstacles. If one utilises one’s inner strength, then circumstances have to surrender to inner aspiration. If you really want to meditate four times a day, then I wish to tell you that your inner aspiration will give you the power to meditate four times. Outer obstacles can easily be overcome, because the inner life is the living expression of our infinite Power. Before the infinite Power, outer obstacles have to surrender.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are three spiritual exercises to develop will power:</p>
<p>One. Hold the end of your thumb tightly in your first finger, and try to feel a pulsation only in the tip of your thumb. That pulsation is your life energy, your breath, your mission, your realisation, soul and Goal. It is all there in the tip of your thumb. Then look at your thumbnail and feel that there is your dream and reality. When an idea comes to you to do something, you will get all the will power you need from your thumb. Incidentally, the thumb can also be used to determine whether or not a person has will power. If a person’s thumb is pointed at the end, generally that person has will power. The more pronounced the point, the more will power he is likely to have.</p>
<p>Two. Sit cross-legged in front of a very small mirror, with your back straight. Do not hold the mirror in your hand, but set it up at eye level so that you will be able to see only your face. Try to see your third eye. Inside your third eye imagine a deep hole, and try to see inward, not downward, through the hole. Go as far in as possible. When you reach your ultimate capacity try to see all your love there — the love that you have for your life. When you have seen all your love, try to imagine me in that place. Feel there is your love-field and give it to me. When you can give it to the Supreme in me, then you will be able to accomplish in the inner world all the things that you wanted to do.</p>
<p>Three. Stand about three and a half feet away from a wall. Then, make a very tiny black circle on the wall at eye level, and inside the circle make one dot. It has to be black. With your eyes half open, gaze at the circle, focusing all your attention on it. Try not to see anything else except the circle. After two or three minutes, try to feel that you are totally one with the circle, that your whole existence is inside it. Then go beyond the circle to the other side of the wall. When you go through the circle and beyond it, try to look back at your own physical reality, the reality that is standing in front of the wall. You started from the physical body but now you have sent your subtle body to the other side of the wall. From there try to look back at your physical. This will give you some satisfaction.</p>
<p>Complete satisfaction will come when you look at only the dot inside the circle and not the circle itself. Try to see your own self there, your own face of aspiration. Feel that you exist only there and nowhere else. Then try to feel that your existence, your face, your consciousness, everything, is replaced by me. Once you feel that your previous existence has been totally replaced by me, you will have established your inseparable oneness with me, and my will power is bound to come into your life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we meditate on the soul?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we meditate on the soul?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please feel that you are not the body, you are not the vital, you are not the mind, you are not the heart, you are only the soul. Think of the most beautiful child on earth. Imagine the most beautiful child you have ever seen. Then feel that your soul is infinitely more beautiful than this child. Those of you who have children know that parents always think that their own children are the most beautiful. There is nothing wrong in it; they are absolutely right. But think that your soul is infinitely more beautiful than your children. To some of you I have told your soul’s qualities. If you know, think of the qualities that your soul wants to manifest. Think of your soul in this way and then feel that you are the soul at this very moment. Feel that you are that — <em>Tat twam asi</em>. This is how to meditate on your soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it helpful to concentrate upon the golden aura, or should one hold a thought of God or some of His aspects in mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it helpful to concentrate upon the golden aura, or should one hold a thought of God or some of His aspects in mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the individual. God is personal and impersonal at the same time. A person may feel that he wants to adore the personal aspect of God. At the end of his spiritual search, he wants to see God in His personal aspect. If he feels that he wants to see God in divinised human form, as a being infinitely more beautiful than any being on earth, it is best for him to think of God, to meditate on God, to concentrate on God as the personal God.</p>
<p>But if he wants to see God as Light, golden Light without form, or God as dynamic Energy, then he can approach God the infinite Energy or God the infinite Light. The seeker has to make the choice as to what he wants to see at the end of his Self-discovery: God the personal or God the impersonal, God the Form or God the Formless. God is both Form and Formless. But some people are more fond of God the Form and some are fond of seeing God the Formless. And again, there are some seekers who want to see God in all His Forms, God as a Person and also God in His impersonal aspect. It entirely depends on the seeker’s own aspiration. God is ready. It is you who will make the choice.</p>
<p>In your case, the best thing will be for you to concentrate on the golden aura, to take God as a golden Light. This golden Light is the Supreme’s Light for manifestation on earth. This is a most significant Light for you, because in you there is abundant Light. Each person has an aura, and in your case your own aura is golden. If you can concentrate on God’s golden aura, on the golden colour, this will be most effective in your case.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Concentration and meditation give us certain power, even if we are not looking for it. Should we pray to God to keep us from misusing that power?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Concentration and meditation give us certain power, even if we are not looking for it. Should we pray to God to keep us from misusing that power?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the course of his meditation, when one knows how to meditate well, naturally he gets power. Sometimes one misuses this power and sometimes one uses it properly. Now, how can you use it divinely? If you can feel that this power is an act of God’s Grace that has descended into your life, then the first thing you will observe is that your responsibility diminishes. Since it has come from God, the power is His.</p>
<p>When you get any inner power, the best thing to do is not to use it until the psychic being is fully developed and you become totally one with your psychic being. At that time you can truly be the possessor of power. What happens when you get power from your meditation is that the power comes and possesses you; power becomes the owner of your outer life. When power possesses you, although you feel that you have got the power, at that time there is every possibility that the power is using you; then you feel that you are using the power wrongly. But this is not true; it is the power that is using you for a wrong purpose. But when the psychic being is fully developed and you become one with the psychic being, when you are able to speak to the psychic being and you are growing in its consciousness, there is no problem. You become the lord of your power; no matter what power enters into you or what power you develop, your inner being will guide you, protect you and show you how to use the power for a divine purpose.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, until one has become totally one with God’s infinite Consciousness, it is not advisable to use power. People accumulate money and hold it. The spiritual power that you get during your meditation, I wish you to collect it and hold it. Then a time comes when you are fully realised and there is no chance of your misusing the power. Then you will use the power for the manifestation of the Truth, not to break the cosmic harmony. If power is used before realisation, most of the time it is used wrongly and then it creates more problems than harmony in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>So if you have power, hold it to the last. This power is bound to help humanity at God’s choice Hour. Without the divine power, nothing can be manifested on earth. At the same time, the divine power has its own time, and that time one can know only when one is on the threshold of realisation or when one is totally one with God’s Will.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I seek strength when I meditate; am I seeking the wrong thing?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I seek strength when I meditate; am I seeking the wrong thing?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are doing the correct thing when you seek strength and get it. The Upanishadic seers used to chant this prayer thousands of times: “Give me strength. Give me valour. Give me virility. Give me patience.” As light is strength, strength is also light. This we can see with our own eyes. We feel that light is one thing and power is something else, but it is not like that. In light there is power and in power there is light. So when you are praying to God for strength, please feel that not only strength, but light is entering into you, to drive away your darkness and to keep you constantly in the lap of the Supreme, to fulfil you both in your inner and outer life.</p>
<p>This power is not the power of a boxer, who will knock me down. That is only human power, unlit power. But the divine power is light itself. So when you pray to God to give you strength, you are really praying to God for light as well.</p>
<p>If there is no strength, then God-realisation can never be achieved. The Upanishads say, “The soul cannot be won by a weakling.” You have to aspire for strength. One has to be divinely powerful in order to realise his goal.</p>

How can I avoid trying to have a strong meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Do not try to have any particular type of meditation. When you start to meditate, do not care what kind of meditation you will have. Not only do you have to give up the idea of having a strong meditation, you have to give up all ideas about your meditation.</p>
<p>The first thing you should do when you meditate is try to make your mind calm and quiet, and then let this calm, quiet mind, this silent mind, this tranquil mind, carry you. If you try by yourself to go toward the goal, it will be impossible. It is the meditation that can carry you. Just dive into the sea of this mind, which is far beyond the physical mind, and let the meditation carry you.</p>
<p>It is not the intensity, it is not the eagerness to possess the truth or be possessed by the truth that counts most. It is a spontaneous, cheerful feeling of self-offering that is required in meditation. This is what the soul expects from the aspirant — spontaneous, cheerful self-offering. If the aspirant has this, the soul is bound to bring to the fore infinite Peace, Light and Bliss from above.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do we not sometimes mistake the strong concentration of the vital for a good or strong meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do we not sometimes mistake the strong concentration of the vital for a good or strong meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Concentration and meditation are two totally different things. One can easily know whether one is doing concentration or meditation. When it is concentration, there is tremendous intensity; it is like an arrow entering into the target. But in meditation, there is peace all around, specially in the mind. intensity is there, but the intensity is flooded with luminosity. In concentration there need not be, and at times there is not, the highest luminosity. Concentration wants immediate results. It is ready to do anything, by hook or by crook, to achieve its goal. But meditation won’t do that. Meditation feels that it has infinite time at its disposal. That doesn’t mean that meditation neglects fleeting time. No! It appreciates fleeting time, but inside fleeting time it sees endless time. That is why meditation has infinite Peace inside it.</p>
<p>Intensity of the vital during meditation is not bad if it is the purified vital and not the demanding vital. The vital is a real dynamic horse, but we have to know how to utilise it. We are now using the vital in the world of passion, in the world of argument, greed, and so on. But this same vital can be used as a dynamic strength to fight against ignorance, imperfection and death. So if the vital is pure at the time of concentration, then our success is very satisfactory, and it assures us that the fulfilment of our goal on earth is not a dream.</p>

Is there a method that would be helpful in holding onto that joy?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two reasons why you lose your joy. One reason is that your mind starts functioning most powerfully, vehemently. While functioning in this way it allows obscure, impure, undivine thoughts to come in either consciously or unconsciously and then its joy has to disappear. But if purity is well established in the mind, then the joy will last for a long time.</p>
<p>Another reason you might lose your joy is because your vessel is small and you have taken Light, which is joy itself, beyond the capacity of your vessel. The quantity of Light that you have gotten during your meditation has satisfied you, but the excess you were not in a position to hold in your vessel; so you felt miserable.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: The spiritual life and meditation should be the simplest of things; yet I always seem to complicate it. How can I keep my meditation simple?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: The spiritual life and meditation should be the simplest of things; yet I always seem to complicate it. How can I keep my meditation simple?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we think that we are doing meditation, then it will always be complicated. When we think of what we are doing, whether it is meditation, physical work or even eating, we will feel some complication in the action either today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>True meditation is done when we are consciously aware of the Supreme. We have to know that it is He who is fulfilling Himself in and through us, that He is doing the meditation Himself. We are just the vessel and we are allowing Him to fill us with His whole Consciousness. When we are aware of this, after five or ten minutes of meditation we will enter into the very world of meditation. We do not have to do anything; we are there in that world because the Supreme has taken charge of our meditation.</p>
<p>We start with our own physical and mental effort, but once we go deep within we see that it is not effort that allows us to enter into meditation. Meditation will be complicated so long as we depend on ourselves, feeling, “If I don’t meditate at six o’clock, then my world will certainly collapse.” But when we feel that meditation is being done by the Supreme in us with our conscious awareness and consent then meditation cannot be complicated.</p>
<p>At that time we will see that our meditation is free and spontaneous. God is fulfilling Himself through us and enlarging His Consciousness within us. But it has to be done with our consent; otherwise there will be no end to our complicated feelings.</p>
<p>For a grown-up person to surrender even to the Highest is impossible, because the mind has started functioning. But a child surrenders to anyone, even to a stranger. If the stranger says something is to be done, he will do it because he has perfect faith in the stranger. That is because he does not use the mind. In our case, we don’t have faith in anybody and, at the same time, which is worse, we don’t have faith in ourselves.</p>
<p>When you meditate, please try to feel the river or meditation flowing through you without coercion or exertion. Let the divine Consciousness flow through you. That flow is the real meditation which you have had many, many times. You can always have the real meditation if you allow the river of Consciousness to flow in and through you.</p>
