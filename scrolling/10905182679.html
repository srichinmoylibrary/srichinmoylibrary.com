<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In most cases it was destined that you would come to me. There are many souls who have been connected with me in previous incarnations, and there are quite a few whom I knew in the soul's region — friends, admirers and others. Here on earth they started to aspire, so they looked for me.</p>
<p>Today at the United Nations, the friend of a disciple said to me, "When I come here I get joy from you, but I have accepted someone else as my Guru." His soul is pulling him towards me, but his vital is pulling him away. I didn't encourage him. I only told him to stay with his Guru.</p>
<p>Not all souls are meant for me. But most of the souls that have come to me are meant for me, even those that have left, except for one or two whom the Supreme didn't want me to have and whom He took away in His own Way. He will take care of those people, but the others will have to wait for me to give them a push again. Disciples who have left may leave me on the physical plane, but on the inner plane their souls remain with me. There they are my real disciples.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: But when disciples come to you, do you already see that they will go up very high or fall down, or is it all open?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: But when disciples come to you, do you already see that they will go up very high or fall down, or is it all open?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In some cases I definitely know, and in other cases I deal with possibility. In some cases I can totally break and mould them. There, as the Christ said, "I am the Way and the Goal." In these cases I know the outcome. In other cases, I am only the way, and then I am dealing with possibility. Here my grace, the Light of the Supreme, gives the fastest progress according to the disciple's capacity. In most of the cases, I am the way. But in some cases I know that I am also the Goal. Where I am the Goal, I totally break those individuals and mould and shape them. But mine is not my way; it is the Supreme's own Way.</p>
<p>Why with some do I break their mould and make my own impression on them, whereas with others I will leave the speed either slow or fast, according to my own grace? In the cases where I break, the disciples have come to a position where they were able to accept that kind of breaking. Someone may want to become a first-class disciple, but if I ask that person to do something, he will say, "Oh, what will my father think, what will my mother think?" But if I ask the other disciple, there will be no father, no mother — only cheerful obedience.</p>
<p>When we started here, we gave the same chance to everyone. When I accept someone as a disciple, each person starts from the same starting point. But some run very fast, and others do not run fast at all.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it spiritually good for us just to be near you?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it spiritually good for us just to be near you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is extremely good if you can be near me because my inner and outer presence are one. If you have a spiritual friend in me, then you can't separate my inner existence from my outer reality. If you can live near me, and if you can utilise the opportunity properly, then you will make very fast progress.</p>
<p>Again, you may stay near me physically but at the same time only be thinking of others: "Oh, today I have the opportunity to come to a special meeting and see Guru. Many others were not invited, but I am allowed to go." If you have these thoughts, then pride will enter into you. Again, you may be very afraid that since you are not the only one who is invited, your glory will go away. Then you will become sad, depressed, and you won't get anything from me. The soul has to convince the vital and the mind that I am doing the best thing for you and I am also doing the best thing for others whom I have not invited to something. When you go deep within, you will believe it.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna and many other spiritual Masters used to say that the whole cow has milk but there is a particular place in the cow to get the milk. When you squeeze the udder, you get the milk; you don’t get the milk if you cut the tail. But first you have to come to the cow and then you get the milk. Similarly, if you can be with your Master, if you can come to see me, then you receive my blessings, my compassion and my concern. Then if you enter into my heart, and you can constantly stay inside my heart, you will get Peace, Light and Bliss.</p>
<p>So by staying here, you get more of an opportunity. The negative side is that you may be bloated with pride or afraid that somebody else will come and take me away, or you may feel that if you don’t meditate well today, then Guru will not ask you to come back to work at the Centre. Then you are not utilising the opportunity properly. If you can utilise the opportunity then you are really gaining something. When you are in my physical presence, if you can utilise each second in a divine way, then you can make the fastest progress. This is why some people are dying to remain with their Master. But for others, this can create doubt or other problems, which is why some spiritual Masters do not keep their dear ones near them.</p>
<p>There is an old Indian tradition in which the Master says, "I will initiate you, but on the condition that you will leave." This is because if the particular disciple stays with the Master, he will not aspire at all. He will think that his Master will do everything for him. Some of my disciples who have become close to me are now relaxed. They have become relaxation-kings and queens. They think that I will do everything for them. But some people who are away from me will have the fear, "Oh, if we don't do the right thing, why should Guru? We have to do everything we possibly can, and only then he will do the rest."</p>
<p>If those disciples who live here in the vicinity feel that they can rest, then this is the end of their progress in realising Peace, Light and Bliss. And what they have already gotten is nothing in comparison to what they could have received. Disciples who are near me get the best opportunity to run the fastest because they are receiving from me in both the inner and the outer worlds. If they do not properly utilise their time with me, it is a veritable curse. But if they do utilise it properly, then naturally they run the fastest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are devoted and totally surrendered, then any idea that you have will come through me. If that is the case, you can take your own initiative. But if you are not totally surrendered, you may do something, and then I will say, "No, this is not what I want." If the channel is perfect, then it is I who pass through that channel.</p>
<p>When I leave the body, I will see how many people really want to stay in the spiritual life and work for me, and how many people will go back to normal life. Those who leave the spiritual life are totally lost. They enjoy neither the joy of spirituality nor the pleasure of the normal life. That is why I say to people, "If you don't want to please me when I am on earth, do you think you will be able to please me when I have left?" When the Master is in his physical body you can make the utmost progress. Then, if you have established your inseparable oneness with the Master, you can continue at the fastest speed. Now is the time to make the greatest progress.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the contrary, I get utmost joy that a particular person cares for me. Occasionally while opening up presents, I get attacked. Tremendous wrong forces are there. I do not know whose present it is, but when I open it, it is just like eating some fire. It is not the fault of the shopkeeper or the shop from which the gift was bought. It is the consciousness of the disciple who bought the gift for me. This has happened only six or seven times. At those times, the gifts went right to the wastepaper basket without my even opening them. At such times, unfortunately, I did not dare to open the gifts. Again, of the thousands of gifts I have received, it has only happened a few times.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What should I do if I see you on the street?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What should I do if I see you on the street?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to remember your relationship with me. If I am your Father, your eternal Father, then you don't have to always reach a certain height in order to come near me. A child runs to his father whether he has said his morning prayers or not. He knows he is in his father's heart, and he is happy. Whether he steals something or quarrels with someone or does any other undivine thing, he feels his presence is inside his father's heart. He doesn't have to become something in order to approach his father.</p>
<p>Everything in our life has to be spontaneous. If you are in a meditative mood when you see me, well and good. But if you are in your ordinary consciousness, do not worry. As I have said, if you meditate twenty-four hours a day, you will become insane. So, if you see me in the street, just get an inner thrill, an inner joy, and do not try to hide anything. Just because you think you are not in your highest meditation, do not try to hide. The whole problem is that you are hiding. You have forgotten something which you are trying to discover. You have to come forward and look for it. I am the person who will help you look for it. I am your eternal Father. But as soon as you see me, if you start hiding, then how am I going to help you?</p>
<p>When you see me in the street, sometimes I am deeply absorbed, and very, very serious. Sometimes I'm in a childlike consciousness. Just look at me and if I am in the mood to speak, then come and talk. If I am not, then just repeat the name of the Supreme with utmost, soulful devotion until I pass by. If I call you and cut jokes with you, don't think that I am not in my highest consciousness; far from it. For me highest and lowest are the same. When I cut jokes, it is the best time for you people to catch me. Always have confidence in yourself and in me. Confidence in yourself means you feel that you have established an inner connection with me. You don't have to acquire something or prove something in order to speak to me. If I have pressing things to do, then you should not approach me. But there should be no fear separating your existence from my existence. Do not have fear, either in the mind, the vital or the physical. If fear enters, at that time, I become a different person. But I am not a different person; I am the most illumined part of your own existence. If you have the capacity of oneness, then this problem will not arise. No matter where I am, if you see me, then you will get an inner joy and thrill.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When I think of you, are you aware of my thought?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When I think of you, are you aware of my thought?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you are eating potatoes and tomatoes, if just an idea comes to you that Guru is nice or Guru has a sweet smile, that idea will not come and strike me. But when you think of me sincerely and devotedly, immediately that idea comes to my soul's abode. If it is a most urgent thought, immediately my soul will give me the message. When a major decision is going to take place, if something most important is taking place, if something is changing your nature, if you are aspiring like a mounting flame, then these thoughts immediately knock at my heart's door. Then my soul will come and tell my physical being, and I will respond immediately.</p>
<p>At night when I meditate, I get all the important messages from my dearest disciples. I might not say anything in the outer world because the Supreme has told me that it is not to be dealt with on the outer plane, but if anything has gone wrong, I will know. My inner beings are like my emissaries. They come and give me information about everything. Sometimes I get such sad information about the impurity of the vital, and sometimes good news about the aspiration of the soul. My inner beings roam and they give me authentic information. Sometimes I shed tears of joy; sometimes I shed bitter tears.</p>
<p>We have to know where we actually stand. Those who have accepted me as their Guru, as their spiritual Master, have made an inner connection with me. In some cases, it is extremely tight; in others it is looser. If a disciple is extremely close to me and wholeheartedly devoted to me, if he soulfully listens to my inner and outer requests, then this disciple is bound to have a close inner bond with me. If the Master tells him to jump from the Empire State Building, this kind of disciple will do it immediately. There will be no hesitation. That does not mean that the Master will ask him to jump from the Empire State Building. No! But his inner love, his inner oneness will make him feel that his Master is totally and unreservedly for him. For disciples like this, no matter what I am doing, even if I am in my highest meditation, if they are in need of help, I have to go to them. Others I cannot help in this way. Again, if I want to know something about my other disciples, immediately I can do it. But that kind of intervention I will not make. When I was in India, I did it many times, but I felt that I really created more problems for these people. Then, they would never dare to think of anything. It was all torture for them, since they knew that I would be able to tell. It was because of my love for them that I did this, but still they were tortured.</p>
<p>So I always say, "Enjoy. But do not enjoy to such an extent that you will feel that you are totally lost." To the disciples I say, "When you are in front of me, try to remain in your highest consciousness. When you are outside my immediate aura, try to remain your purest." But I wish to tell all my sincere disciples not to do anything which you cannot do right in front of me. If you want to be my dearest disciples, do not do anything that you cannot do right in my presence. Do not say anything that you cannot say to me. If you have that kind of living connection and living oneness with me, then no matter where I am, whether I am here or in India or Japan, you are protected by the Supreme in me. So I am praying to all of you, always try to feel the Supreme inside your heart. We have to always behave as though the Supreme is not only inside us, but outside us, around us and constantly aware of us. Otherwise, the moment you leave this meditation hall, you will go to the cafeteria or some place and squander all your spiritual truth and spiritual achievements. I have seen many times that when you leave the meditation hall, you throw your spiritual wealth into the street.</p>
