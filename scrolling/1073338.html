<h2>Question: How should I love God and how can I love Him more?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you know why you want to love God more, then it will be extremely easy for you to love Him in the right way. You want to love God for satisfaction. When you love God for your own satisfaction, you will definitely get some satisfaction, but it will be only a small amount. But if you want to love God for His satisfaction, then you yourself will get the highest satisfaction. Your satisfaction will be complete because you will try to please God in His own way.</p>
<p>How can you love God more? By feeling that He loves you infinitely more than you love yourself. This is absolutely true. If you can feel even once a day that God loves you infinitely more than you love yourself, then automatically you will love God more. How many times do you hate yourself? Every time you expect something from yourself and you don’t get it, you hate yourself; if you do something wrong, you just curse yourself. But God within you, the Inner Pilot within you, never, never hates you and never curses you. He loves you all the time in His divine, supreme way. He who loves you constantly in spite of your repeated mistakes deserves to be loved by you all the time. You find it difficult to love yourself all the time, but God does not find it difficult. He loves you constantly. If you realise this, it will be very easy for you to love God more than you do now.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I achieve humility?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I achieve humility?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In our human life when we have something, immediately pride, vanity and many other undivine forces enter into us. We extol ourselves to the skies. But let us think of the example of a tree. When the tree is in full bloom, when it is laden with ripe fruits, when it really has something to offer the world, the tree bows down. If we can become one with the consciousness of a tree, we will feel that the more we have to offer, the more humility we will have.</p>
<p>Whenever we aspire we get an iota of Peace, Light and Bliss. When we practise concentration and meditation regularly and devotedly we get abundant Peace, Light and Bliss. When we get these qualities in abundant measure, automatically we feel that it is our bounden duty to become inseparably one with the rest of the world. The higher we go, the more we feel our universal oneness. At that time, real humility dawns. The deeper we go the sooner we see the root. Once we become part and parcel of the root, we cannot be proud. We see that it is from the root that the trunk, the branches, the leaves, the flowers and the fruits have come into existence, yet the root mingles humbly with the earth and clay. If you want to develop more humility, I wish to tell you to dive deep within or climb up high, higher, highest, on the strength of your inner cry. Your inner cry will lift you up into the freedom of the Vast and make you inseparably one with the rest of the world. When you reach the Highest, automatically your divine oneness makes you humble.</p>
<p>There is also a practical way to achieve humility in the outer life. If you are a good singer and you are bloated with pride at your achievement, what you have to do is think of the world’s best singer. Immediately your own achievement will pale into insignificance because this other singer is undoubtedly far better than you. Pride comes when you feel that you are in some way superior to other people or that you have something which they do not have at all. But if you will compare your capacity or your achievement with that of someone who has it in far greater measure, then your pride will have to fade. When pride diminishes and disappears, humility increases and looms large.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How important is a Guru?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How important is a Guru?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This entirely depends on how soon the seeker wants to reach God. A Guru is a necessity if time is a great factor. If you want to reach your destination as soon as possible, then a spiritual teacher is very important. There are a few very learned men who have not gone to school but who have achieved great wisdom nevertheless. But most of us do go to school. Why? Because we know that the help of a teacher will expedite our journey. If we just go out and buy some books and study by ourselves, we will very often be confused and uncertain. We will read something and not get the proper meaning. Or, if we do get the real meaning, we will doubt whether our understanding is true. This is why we go to a teacher for help. Once we get our degree, the teacher’s role is over. He cannot take our knowledge away from us at that time. It is our permanent achievement.</p>
<p>If we want to make the fastest progress in the spiritual life, a spiritual teacher is necessary. Otherwise, we will be uncertain about the direction we are going in and we will have no one to guide us with divine advice. If we doubt our inner experiences, who is going to illumine us and reassure us at that time? We will be doomed to live with our constant self-doubt and inner uncertainty.</p>
<p>If we consider time a great factor, then if we can do something today, we shall not wait for tomorrow. Tomorrow there will be a further goal to reach. Today our goal is God-realisation. Tomorrow our goal will be God-revelation. And the day after tomorrow our goal will be God-manifestation. Since we have three goals, the sooner we can arrive at our first goal, the sooner we can start running toward our second and our third goals.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: How can I be more thankful to God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just by thinking of gratitude, we cannot become grateful. Our gratitude is like a magnet that pulls God’s Compassion down to us. But before our gratitude begins to operate, first God has to pull us toward Him. Once God has started to pull us up, then our gratitude begins to grow and we can pull Him down into us.</p>
<p>There is a special way for a seeker to offer thanks or gratitude to God. It is through cheerfulness, constant cheerfulness. A seeker cannot allow depression to enter into his life of aspiration at any time. He always has to be happy in order to be truly grateful. But if his happiness comes from wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance, that is not the right kind of happiness. Real happiness is something within us which constantly makes us feel that we are expanding our consciousness and wholeheartedly embracing the entire world.</p>
<p>Today is St. Patrick’s Day. In Ireland people commemorate this saint with sports, dancing, singing, drinking and being as happy as they can. Ordinary human happiness is found in this kind of fun and enjoyment. But the seeker within us will have a different type of happiness. On St. Patrick’s Day green is worn. Spiritually, green signifies new hope and new satisfaction. For the seeker, happiness is a feeling of new hope, new life, new dawn, new promise, new achievement. These feelings the seeker has to nourish and treasure within himself. If the seeker in us cherishes these divine qualities, automatically our thankfulness to God will grow; our gratitude-flower will blossom and we will be able to offer it at the Feet of the Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>In spiritual happiness, in the happiness that comes from self-giving and aspiration, gratitude looms large. When we have inner happiness, we don’t have to search for gratitude here and there. In our devoted cheerfulness, in our soulful cheerfulness, we are bound to discover constantly-increasing gratitude to the Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between prayer and meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between prayer and meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I pray to God most sincerely, immediately my inmost cry reaches high, higher, highest. And who listens? God. When I pray, I am the talker and God is the listener. But when I meditate, I open my heart, widen my consciousness and allow God to enter into me. At that time God talks and I listen.</p>
<p>If you pray most soulfully, you will feel that a current is flowing from the soles of your feet to the crown of your head. Praying to God is like reaching upward, or climbing up to the topmost bough of a tall tree. While you are climbing, God is observing you. While you are praying to God, you can feel that God is listening to you.</p>
<p>When you meditate, if you keep your mind calm and quiet, you will hear a voice from deep within. In the beginning that voice will be very faint. But when your meditation becomes profound, the voice becomes clear and distinct. At that time, God is talking to you.</p>
<p>When you pray with utmost aspiration and devotion, your intense inner cry is your way of speaking to God. You start your conversation with God through prayer. Then God gives you the capacity to make your mind calm, quiet, tranquil and vacant so that during your most soulful meditation you can hear His Voice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the West prayer is not given the same importance that it was once given. We Indian Masters in a sense are the culprits. We always speak of meditation, meditation, meditation, so the Westerners who follow Indian teachers have begun to ignore prayer. But both prayer and meditation are significant ways of communing with God. If you pray most soulfully and devotedly, your prayer can take you to the highest pinnacle, the Lord Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When one sincerely prays to God one can pray for tranquility or some other divine quality. For the beginner-seeker, it is always advisable to pray to God to make him genuine, sincere, devoted, soulful and so forth. But his prayers must not be repeated mechanically. They have to come from the inmost recesses of his heart. He has to feel each time he prays that he is climbing up a rung on the ladder of his inner evolution. But the highest type of prayer is to pray to become a surrendered instrument of God. When one becomes a divine instrument, he feels that he does nothing; it is God who does everything in and through him.</p>
<p>When a beginner-seeker prays, we can say that his prayer has a kind of innocent motive. He prays to God for a certain boon because he feels that if he does not have this quality or thing, then he will not be a receptive channel and he will not be able to realise or manifest God. But when he becomes a little more advanced, the seeker becomes unconditional. He always prays for God to make him what He would like to make him. He does not ask God even to make him a surrendered or perfect instrument. He prays to God only to fulfil Himself in His own way. If God wants him to remain imperfect, he won’t mind. He only wants God to be pleased in His own way. If the seeker’s prayer is to please God in His own way, then God will naturally make him perfect at His choice Hour and in His own way. God is bound to make him perfect eventually, because God will not manifest Himself in and through an imperfect instrument.</p>

I know I will never attain it in this short life." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In one incarnation we cannot achieve everything. Even our ordinary earthly desires, which are comparatively easy to fulfil on earth, are often left unfulfilled at our death. When we follow the path of desire we see that at the fulfilment of one desire, another desire immediately looms large. Even before one desire is fulfilled, another desire comes to the fore. There is no end to this chain of desires, nor is there any satisfaction at all. But when we follow the path of aspiration, when we get an iota of peace, light and bliss we do get some satisfaction. At the same time, we are inspired to cry for more of these divine qualities.</p>
<p>God means absolute satisfaction; God means total fulfilment. God wants to fulfil Himself in and through us. Being divine, He wants to offer us His infinite Peace and Light. But this infinite Peace and Light cannot be achieved in one incarnation. It is impossible for us to attain our divine Goal in one incarnation.</p>
<p>If we pray to God and meditate on God in this incarnation, then we definitely achieve something in our inner life. This achievement is stored up by our soul. Then, when we start our spiritual journey in our next incarnation, we will have a good head start because our soul will be stronger. We come and go on this earth and nothing is lost. None of our inner efforts will be wasted. We will come down into the world again to continue our journey toward the Highest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A seeker can give himself to God by being constantly aware of his inner reality. If the seeker thinks of God and remembers that he has come from that Source, then he will be able to give himself back to that Source. Since we are conscious of the fact that he has given us what He has, let us give Him something in return: gratitude. When we feel that we have received something, it is the tendency of our human nature, unless we are absolutely ungrateful, to try to establish a reciprocal feeling. You give something to me and I give something to you. Let us begin to count our blessings. When we are consciously aware of the myriad blessings that He has given us, then it will be quite easy for us to give Him whatever we have and are.</p>

When you stand at your heart’s door, you are bound to hear some people knocking there. If you open the door, you will see that there are quite a few people outside — both friends and enemies. Your enemies are fear, doubt, anxiety and many others, while your friends are faith, courage, love, inner determination and so on. Since it is <em>your</em> door, you will allow only your friends to come in. Then you will bolt the door from the inside and start conversing with your friends.</p>
<p>Each time you listen to a friend of yours when he speaks to you, immediately the capacity of your friend increases. When your love-friend speaks and you listen, immediately your love for God increases. When your courage-friend speaks and you listen, immediately your own inner courage comes to the fore. When your surrender-friend speaks and you listen, you will see that surrender becomes quite easy.</p>
<p>Previously you thought that surrender meant self-extinction, but when this friend of yours tells you what surrender is, immediately you will be eager to throw yourself into the sea of surrender. Previously you were afraid of losing your individuality, but when your surrender-friend explains to you what divine surrender is, you will be eager to make that surrender. In divine surrender you do not lose anything. On the contrary, you become the vast infinite.</p>
<p>When you allow these friends to enter into you and tell you what their qualities actually represent on earth, undoubtedly you will make the fastest progress. But if you allow fear, doubt, anxiety and jealousy to enter, they will come into your room most gladly, only to destroy all the beautiful things that you have there. They are eagerly waiting for you to allow them in.</p>
<p>When doubt assails you, it will try to make you feel that it is good to doubt. It will say, “Doubt as much as you can. Only then can you discover the reality.” Doubt will send its best friend, the reasoning mind, to live with you. The reasoning mind will come and tell you that it can offer you the greatest satisfaction and fulfilment. But you have to know that in the spiritual life the reasoning mind is useless and doubt is worse than useless. You should not doubt or reason; just give yourself wholeheartedly and unreservedly to the divine Father. A beginner should always act like a child in his approach to his divine Father. He should run toward the Supreme with no hesitation and give Him everything that he has. When he becomes advanced, the undivine forces will realise that they are knocking at the wrong door when they come to him.</p>
<p>A beginner’s progress entirely depends on the friendships he makes in the inner world. The easiest and the most effective way for a beginner to make the fastest progress is to choose only divine friends. Each time he allows a divine force to enter into him and operate in him, he gains that divine quality in his inner being. Gradually, as all the divine qualities enter into him, he blossoms like a flower, petal by petal.</p>

<h2>Question: How can I differentiate between a real inner feeling of God and a thought that comes from my subconscious mind?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can easily differentiate between our inner feeling of God and thoughts from our subconscious mind if we practise prayer and meditation. Especially when we meditate, we will know what is actually happening within us and whether or not we are receiving messages from God. If we remain in the heart and meditate on God, we won’t have to search for reality; reality will loom large within us. We will see and feel how close God is to us.</p>
<p>Our true feelings of God will immediately convince us that God is everywhere, that He is like a flood of Light within us. But when we are in the subconscious mind, we will find light only in an infinitesimal measure, like a spark. We will not feel certainty or reality there. God does exist in the subconscious mind, but His Light is veiled by dense clouds of darkness.</p>
<p>God is in everything, in dirty water as well as in pure water, in unspiritual people as well as in spiritual people. But divinity is manifested in an infinitesimal measure in the dirty water; therefore, we will drink the pure water instead. If a person has been praying and meditating sincerely for fifteen, twenty, or forty years, God will be more prominent in him than in someone who has never meditated; therefore, we will go to him for inspiration and spiritual advice. Through our own conscious and constant prayer, we make God a living reality for us. Everyone has God within him, but for those who pray and meditate, God is a conscious and constant reality, whereas for others God is just a vague idea.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The method is aspiration. If we dig into the earth, when we reach a certain depth we find water. In the spiritual life when we aspire, we are digging within. When we go deep enough, we finally come face to face with the inner sun. If we are in a room where all the doors are locked and the windows are closed and covered, then we do not see the sun. But when we leave the room and go outside, we do see the sun. Similarly, when we come out of the body-consciousness, the consciousness of ‘I’, ‘my’ and ‘mine’, then we see the inner sun.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some breathing exercises are of real help to meditation. But we should not exercise for an hour or two before we meditate. If we do, by the time we start our meditation, we will be totally exhausted and have no energy left or we will be unnecessarily agitated. If we do breathing exercises for five or ten minutes first, it will be of great help to our meditation. If we want to do more than that, then we should do the rest at some other time,</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You may call God by one name and I may call God by another name, but your God and my God are not really different. You may say that this is God and I may say that that is God, but when we attain the highest realisation we will both see God as the ultimate Truth. Therefore, let us call God the ultimate Truth,</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: One time the Christ said, “I and my Father are one,” and another time the Christ said, “Our Father who is in Heaven.” How can we resolve this apparent contradiction?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: One time the Christ said, “I and my Father are one,” and another time the Christ said, “Our Father who is in Heaven.” How can we resolve this apparent contradiction?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the father of the family has a car, the child has every right to say, “It is our car,” or even, “It is my car,” because he has established his oneness with his father. When he says this, his father will not contradict him. The father will not say, “What do you mean? It is <em>my</em> car. I bought it with <em>my</em> money.” The father will be very happy that the child feels real oneness with him and claims all that he has as his own.</p>
<p>At times the Christ felt that God was his divine Father and at times he identified himself completely with that Father. When he was in the consciousness of absolute Oneness with God, he had every reason to say, “I and my Father are one.” When the river flows into the sea, it becomes the sea itself. The Christ was both the Father and the son. That he was the son of God, we can never deny. Again, when he became one, absolutely one with God, he became nothing other than God Himself.</p>
<p>Not only the Christ, but each and every one of us will one day be able to proclaim, “I and my Father are one.” Man is God yet to be realised totally and God is man yet to be manifested fully. We are all God, but we have yet to realise our highest Divinity.</p>
