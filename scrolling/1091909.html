 July 18, 1970, Sri Chinmoy Centre, San Juan</h2>
 
<p>I wish to tell you that to remain with us at the Centre for about a year is not an easy task. The temptations of the world, anxieties of the world, doubt, fear, ignorance, imperfection, the limitations and obscurities of the individual human being, as well as the earth-consciousness, take people away from the right spiritual path. So those of you who have been with us for over a year <em>should</em> feel and <em>must</em> feel that, by the Grace of God, the Supreme, you have remained with us. It is a tremendous task, an inner battle. The outer battle you can win in a day or in two-to-three months, or even in a year or two. But the inner battle has to be fought constantly and it has to be won every day. These battles against fear, doubt, ignorance, limitation and death have to be won again and again.</p>
<p>Let us start with doubt. If you start doubting the Centre, doubting me, doubting your own capacity for the spiritual life, then you will unfortunately end in failure. Once you have accepted the spiritual life, and once you feel that this is your path and that I am your Master, I assure you, each individual seeker, once and for all, that the Goal of the Beyond is your divine Destination. Your Master has the capacity to take you to your Destination and he will offer this capacity to you, to all those who consciously and soulfully want to remain seated in my Boat. God's chosen Boatman I am. God's chosen passengers you are. I assure you, on the strength of my highest Oneness with the Absolute Supreme, that it is my bounden duty to take you, carry you in my heart to the Golden Shore of the Beyond. These are not mere words: these are my solid realisations, inseparable from the Highest Truth.</p>
<p>I am most grateful to you; I don't want to use the word "pleased." Being grateful is one thing: when you do something for the Centre, come here and work regularly, do selfless service, I am grateful. If you give me a smile, I am grateful to you. If you do anything for me, I am grateful to you. But when I say that I am pleased with someone, with some seekers or with my disciples, that is much more important. If you give me a dollar, I am grateful to you. But when I say I am pleased with someone, that means that my concern has touched the very depths of the individual seeker. All those who have been here for over a year have done me favours many times in terms of aspiration, devotion, surrender, money and all that. For all this I am truly grateful to each individual disciple who has stood in front of me. But again, if I have to say that I am pleased with everyone who has stood in front of me, I am not. I am not. I am pleased with a very few, not one or two, but a very few, who have given me their true love, their pure concern, their utmost feeling of oneness. They have pleased me. When I say that I am pleased with someone, please rest assured that that person has captured my lifelong concern. Otherwise he may be with me for two, three, or even twenty or forty years and not get my inner concern.</p>
<p>Yesterday I told you about a certain disciple who made that serious and harmful mistake of telling others about our activities at the United Nations. So in that way, in that type of consciousness, you may stay with me for six years, ten years or twenty years. God knows how many years you may want to stay. Then again, if you stay here out of habit or lethargy, no divine progress can be achieved. Each time you come, you can make progress, you can run towards your Goal. In fact, each time you come here, you should feel that you have climbed up a rung on the ladder of evolving consciousness.</p>
<p>So dearest ones, you have been with us for one year, over a year, some of you two, three, four, five years. But I wish to say that everyone has to please me <em>every day</em> in your daily activities. Then you will really please me. Selfless service you do. But you do this selfless service when you don't have family problems, when you don't have school problems, when you don't have other activities. . . in other words, when you are free to come here. At that time, if I get your help, then you feel that you are doing selfless service. But from the highest spiritual point of view, real selfless service is done only when you are ready to dedicate your entire life, totally, integrally, at every moment. When Lord Sri Krishna used to play on His flute, the gopis, his devotees, admirers and seekers used to leave everything: husband, children, household, and run towards His music, His soul-charming music. What was there in His music? The message of the Highest Beyond. So here also, I call you with the message of God, the Supreme. I represent Him for you, for the disciples, but not for others. Otherwise I am just another spiritual man, and if people don't have the vision, they will go to the extent of saying that I am nothing. If they feel that I am nothing, they are perfectly right in their own view. But for the disciples who have accepted me consciously as their spiritual Master, when they go deep within, they see and realise where I stand, what I stand for. And if they come to realise that I really represent God for them, then they should also realise that a day will come when they have to give up everything for the Supreme in me. They have to give up mental power, physical power, vital power, money power and everything. Then and then only is God-realisation possible.</p>
<p>In New York the other day I spoke about selfless service. I said that if I call you at midnight when you are fast asleep, if I call you while you are in the office to do something involving a very important service, if I call while you are studying wholeheartedly for your examinations, then if you are ready to come and serve the Supreme in me, this is called "selfless service". Otherwise, if you come only when you have free time and you think that you are doing me a favour, then you are doing nothing for me or for God. And this favour I do not need. I have come into the world with the highest mission, so I know that the Supreme will bring persons to me who will be really ready to be at my beck-and-call twenty-four hours a day. It will not be my ego which will draw someone to me, it will not be my personality that will bring him or her to me, but my inseparable oneness with the Highest which demands this kind of selfless oneness with me.</p>
<p>Please forgive me. Today I see a few newcomers. Please bear with me and listen to what I am saying. Right now you are not my disciples, you may not become my disciples, but I see that the day will come when you will be the disciples of somebody, either of me or of someone else. If you want to make the fastest, greatest and deepest progress, then what I am saying will apply to you also. Here you have come as seekers. You have done nothing wrong and I am in no way displeased with you, but I am telling you the secret of secrets, that when you are with your Master, you have to behave the way I am instructing my disciples just now.</p>
<p>Now to go on: In the spiritual life, if you accept the spiritual life, it is different from the ordinary life where everything is duty. To think of the children is duty, to do household work is duty; each moment and every action is some kind of duty. It is good and true that there should be in one's life the very high call of duty. To make breakfast for the children is a duty, to please the husband is a duty, to please the wife is a duty. These are all duties; they can be considered the highest duty. To maintain harmony, peace and love in the family is also a duty. But the highest duty for a spiritual seeker is to please the spiritual Master who is the conscious representative of God. The highest duty for a spiritual seeker, at that time, is not the mother, not the father, not the brother, not the sister, not the wife, not the children, but the dearest in Heaven or on earth, who is God, the Supreme. If you make others feel that they are the dearest, you will be sadly disappointed, I tell you.</p>
<p>When I say that the Master is the dearest, you have to know that it is not my body, not my personality, not my ego, but the Divinity in me, the Supreme in me, who is your Master, your real Master. I have consciously realised Him. Tomorrow you will also consciously realise Him. The moment you consciously realise the Supreme, you will not need me, because you yourself will have become one with the Absolute as I am now.</p>
<p>So, for a sincere, spiritual seeker, the Master has to come first and foremost. When you enter into the Master, you are entering into him with your divine, as well as your undivine, qualities, with your imperfections, limitations, everything. If you keep aside your undivine qualities and try to enter into me only with your divine qualities, who will take care of your undivine qualities? They will come to grab you and devour you. That is, if you give me only one per cent of your undivine qualities, the hostile forces will naturally devour you. But if you enter into me with all your limitations and imperfections, surrendering them to me, saying, "Let thy will be done," at that time, my will, being one with His Will, can and will transform your undivine qualities and make them into divine qualities. I tell you, once and for all, that to please me is to please the Supreme. You will be pleasing the Supreme in me, who is also the Supreme in you.</p>
<p>Christ prayed, "Let Thy Will be done. " There can be no greater prayer, no greater realisation than this: "Let Thy Will be done." Whose Will? The Will of the Supreme. And for the disciples and seekers, the Master's Will, which is absolutely identified with the Will Divine, with the Supreme's Will, must be accepted as God's Will.</p>
<p>I wish to say that in the future you will be given the opportunity in boundless measure to prove your true surrender. If you please me, you are bound to get the highest and best of everything, on earth and in Heaven. If you don't please me, I myself will not be displeased with any of you, but you will not be granted by the Supreme what He Himself thinks to be the best for you. For example, if, right now, you want to eat a candy because that is what you yourself feel to be best for you, then you can eat the candy and remain satisfied. But if you want to drink divine Nectar, then at that time you will have to refer the matter to the Supreme, saying, "Supreme, I need divine Nectar." He will reply, "I have asked someone to give you the Nectar, but you did not surrender to him, and the best for you, the Nectar, has to be indefinitely delayed."</p>
<p>Other spiritual Masters, especially fake Masters, are growing like mushrooms all over the world... innumerable false Masters. But true spiritual Masters are very few on earth who have the capacity to give Nectar just as the Supreme gives it. They are eager to give it, but you are not receiving it. You are not receiving the Nectar.</p>
<p>To come back again to responsibility and duty: If you really want to be fulfilled on earth in infinite measure, if you really want to be happy, successful in both your inner life of aspiration and your outer life of dedication, then you have to listen to your Master if you are really sincere and wise. He will tell you what is best for you. However, if you feel that there is no Master, there is no God and it is all you... you... you, if you make the decision and feel that this is best for you, then you are not really ready for our Path. But if you feel that there is someone who has been dearest to you in all your incarnations — that this is not your first and last life — then you will listen to Him. If you think that this is your first and last incarnation, you are totally mistaken. Those who think that this is their one and only life are making a Himalayan blunder; they are only deceiving themselves. In one incarnation alone nobody has realised God; nobody can realise God.</p>
<p>In one incarnation, you can't satisfy even ordinary things: you can't satisfy even ten individual desires. At the age of eighty, all your unfulfilled desires come forward, unsatisfied. You say, "O God, I have had so many desires and now I am eighty years old and on my deathbed; I have not fulfilled even one of my important desires." God will answer, "My stupid child, who asked you to start your journey in the wrong way, with desires? Why did you not start your journey with aspiration? Why did you not have only one aspiration, that you wanted only God?"</p>
<p>When you reach God, it is all Eternity, Infinity and Immortality. If I want to reach Rome and I walk along a wrong path, how will I reach Rome? My destination I know, but if I am following a wrong path, how can I reach that destination? So here I am saying that when God is my Destination, but the road I have taken is a wrong road, a wrong path full of desires, then how can I reach Him? But if my road is the Path of Aspiration and my Destination remains the same — God, then I am bound to reach Him by walking along the right Path.</p>
<p>Now in the spiritual life, the necessity of surrendering one's will to the Divine Will is the only thing. There can be no other thing, no other way. There can be only one choice; there cannot be two choices in the spiritual life. There can be only one need, and that is to offer one's individual will, to surrender one's individual will, to the Will of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Everything I am saying is intended for the sincere spiritual seekers. You seekers are considered to be spiritual: that is why you have come to a spiritual man. On the strength of your sincere approach, I am here, telling you all these things. Now all over the world, there are millions and billions of people who are still sleeping on earth. We cannot call them spiritual at all. You people are spiritual, and that is why I am telling you what spiritual people should do, not what unspiritual people habitually do. Unspiritual people can do millions of things, all foolish, all wrong, all absurd. But from you, God expects something else. He does not expect you to do anything wrong, either consciously or even unconsciously, because He has chosen you as His very Own. He has not chosen others. Once He has chosen you, you have to deserve His Affection, His Concern, His Blessings, everything He gives you. Others who are not ready are not invited. So let them take their time. But you have already made commitments to your inner being, to your soul.</p>
<p>At this point, you know that one thing is truth; another thing is falsehood. You now have the capacity to discriminate. You know how to be sincere because millions of times you have done and said sincere things. Again you know what insincerity is because you have many times said and done insincere things. So you have developed inner insight and discrimination. And here, nobody has compelled you to accept the spiritual life; your choice has come from deep within. Nobody has forced you. If you don't want the spiritual life, neither your friends, nor your parents, no matter how hard they try, will be able to bring you. And again, if you <em>want</em> the spiritual life and your parents don't want it, no matter how hard you try to bring them here, you will be unsuccessful. So you see, in the case of your parents, they cannot bring you, and in your case, you cannot bring them. Why? Because either the parents do not have that sincere call for God or the children do not have that sincere call for God. But if the parents and children <em>both</em> have the same sincere call and care for God, then you will see: the moment you tell your parents about your spiritual life, they will run with you towards God. They will say, "My children have seen the Goal." Conversely, if your parents have seen the truth and they tell you about it, then if you are sincere, you will run with them towards the Goal. Now what is the thing that prevents both of you, parents and children, from being one, being united and running together towards your Goal? It is the absence of the inner cry, the inner hunger.</p>
<p>When you are hungry, you immediately eat. That is your outer hunger. But inside, if you don't have inner hunger, then you won't cry for God even for one second. When you have inner hunger, you have to feed that hunger, not with potatoes or tomatoes, no, but with inner Peace, Light and Bliss. Now you are all hungry, inwardly hungry. That is why you have come to this spiritual place. Whoever comes to any spiritual organisation, spiritual church, synagogue or temple, is considered to be spiritual. But again only his own sincerity can tell him whether he is really a seeker. Everyone calls himself a seeker. Sudha here is a seeker and somebody else is also a seeker. But between Sudha and somebody else is a yawning gulf. Similarly, when you are in a church, someone sitting beside you will pray to God, "O God, give me thousands of dollars." This fellow is sitting beside you and crying, "God, please give me thousands of dollars." And you are praying, "O God, please fulfil me in Your own Way. I want nothing from You. I only want You to utilise me in Your own Way." Look at your prayer and look at the other man's prayer. Both of you are sitting side by side. The difference between your prayer and his prayer depends upon where you stand in your inner, spiritual development. The difference in your status as a seeker depends on the quality of your inner aspiration.</p>
<p>Dearest ones, you have to aim at a certain goal and then only will you be really satisfied and fulfilled in your life. What do you want — the Ultimate or the mundane? If you really want the Ultimate, then you will realise the Ultimate. Then that Ultimate can function here on earth in the mundane world. A realised soul comes into the world, for the world. He is crying and begging you to also realise the Highest like him. Then only God's perfect Perfection can dawn on the earth and not one second before. Right now the perfect Perfection of God is only in our imagination. But it can be and will be a Divine Reality when we as seekers and all the realised souls make it so.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Disciple: Sometimes You Try To Help A...</h2>

<p><em>Disciple:</em> Sometimes you try to help a person by your prayer, and he improves for a short time but then falls back again.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The first thing in such cases is to have infinite patience. This patience is not a passive quality; it is something dynamic and it is light, true light. So the first thing is patience, which feels to us like going up and then going down. It goes up and down all the time. But we have to know the meaning of patience. It is not something weak, not at all. It only indicates that what you want is not being doing according to your own time. In our own minds, we have a fixed time. We say, "By tomorrow, he will be perfect. Since I am praying and he is praying, how is it that this is not producing results?"</p>
<p>We have to know that we have played our part and that time is a great factor. A farmer cultivates the land and goes on cultivating for three, four or five months. He plants the seeds and evens the surface and so on; then he can expect a bumper crop. Similarly, in the spiritual life, all this preparation is going on.</p>
<p>It is a battlefield, constantly fighting for that person who is coming back again from his weakness. We know that he is fighting against his weakness, but his weakness is acting, right now, like a hostile force. The fight is going on. One moment he is achieving something and the next moment he becomes the victim once more. So let us have patience. Then, secondly, we have to give more importance to the victory than to the defeat. We have to know how many times he has succeeded and not how many times he has fallen down. Remembering the number of times he has succeeded in coming up will give him true courage. It will give him true confidence in going higher, farther and deeper.</p>
<p>But if he continually deals with his downfalls and is reminded of how often he has fallen from his standard, then he is paying attention to his own weakness and this weakness will give him constant frustration. The thing is not to look down but to look up. "Up" is God's Light; "down" is our darkness. So if his aim is to go to the Highest, he has to know how many times he has put the right foot forward and not the wrong foot. The more he thinks of the correct act, the more he pays attention to his success. Then there will automatically develop within him an inner confidence. This will grow and he will say, "If I was able to do something marvellous yesterday, how is it that I am not able to do it today?" Then a new wisdom will dawn in him. "I made a particular mistake and for that reason, I was not able to get satisfactory results." He will see that his mistake is preventing him from getting results.</p>
<p>But he has to remember constantly that he was once successful and has to have a determined will, saying, "If once I achieved the victory, how is it not possible for me to repeat the victory?" So on the strength of his determination, he will be able to stay at his new level. But he has to look forward towards the light and not towards the darkness; not to his downward fall, but to his highest achievement. Then he will be able to ascend.</p>
<p>If you look at the light, you get the light. Look at darkness and you get darkness. And you have to know which direction you are taking. Are you going towards the North or towards the South? If you wish to go North, then you must constantly face the North.</p>
<p>I have to look ahead towards the North. Once I do it consciously and know that North is there and South is in the other direction, then everything will be all right. We have to know where the goal is; which side it is on. If it is North, let us go towards the North, towards light and not towards the South which is darkness. Think of success and not of failure.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy and the disciples were speaking about the benefits of burning incense.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In addition to creating an atmosphere of worship and purity, the ascending fragrance and aspiration which accompany the burning of incense bring down from Heaven certain spirits and higher beings. They are invoked through the consciousness of sincere devotion. Incense has been used for thousands of years in India and when it is used, it invokes certain ancient, divine forces. Incense brings certain beings down from Heaven.</p>
<p>If you want to go from here to New York, you have to spend $120. But these spirits come from the higher planes out of their infinite love for us. In this world, if you have money, you can travel, but for that world, money will not do. It is something which only from their love you can have.</p>
<p>Sometimes when these beings come, they have their own language. Your physical minds, your bodies with their human tongues have their own language, but when these spirits come, they teach you their language. In a second or a minute they can teach you to speak to them in their own language. This language you forget afterwards. When they come, they teach your physical mind and then you can talk to them for some time and then they go away and you forget them and their language.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Twenty Questions And Answers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Twenty Questions And Answers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span><h2 id="page-subtitle">
 October 29, 1970, Sri Chinmoy Centre, San Juan</h2>
 
<p>Dearest children, when we were coming to San Juan on the plane, I was inspired to write down about twenty questions and answers.</p>
<p><em>What does the human in us want? What does the divine in us want?</em></p>
<p>The human in us wants constant satisfaction. The divine in us wants everlasting fulfilment.</p>
<p><em>What is the difference between the divine lover and the divine Beloved?</em></p>
<p>God is the divine Beloved and we are the divine lovers. The divine lover cries; the divine Beloved smiles. But the moment the divine lover smiles, the divine Beloved makes the divine lover feel that they are both eternally and inseparably one.</p>
<p><em>What is life and what is death?</em></p>
<p>Life is man's present bewilderment but future fulfilment. Death is man's present necessity but future non-inevitability.</p>
<p><em>What is ego?</em></p>
<p>Ego is today's destroying gain and tomorrow's liberating loss.</p>
<p><em>What kind of loss?</em></p>
<p>The loss that liberates you when you understand the ego.</p>
<p><em>God means what?</em></p>
<p>God means existence.</p>
<p><em>Truth means what?</em></p>
<p>Truth means discovery.</p>
<p><em>Man means what?</em></p>
<p>Man means the eternal traveller.</p>
<p><em>What does the past mean? What does the present mean? What does the future mean?</em></p>
<p>The past means intention. The present means determination. The future means liberation.</p>
<p><em>What is God's contribution?</em></p>
<p>God's contribution is creation.</p>
<p><em>What is man's contribution?</em></p>
<p>Man's contribution is dedication.</p>
<p><em>What is aspiration?</em></p>
<p>Aspiration is God-crying.</p>
<p><em>What is realisation?</em></p>
<p>Realisation is self-finding.</p>
<p><em>What is revelation?</em></p>
<p>Revelation is self-transformation.</p>
<p><em>What is manifestation?</em></p>
<p>Manifestation is self-perfection.</p>
<p><em>What does my mind say?</em></p>
<p>My mind says that its goal is religion.</p>
<p><em>What does my heart say?</em></p>
<p>My heart says that its goal is Yoga, with God-Oneness.</p>
<p><em>What does my soul say?</em></p>
<p>My soul says that its goal is spirituality.</p>
<p><em>What does my Goal say?</em></p>
<p>My Goal says that I am its fondest choice.</p>
<p><em>What is the difference between humanity and divinity?</em></p>
<p>Humanity is God's compassionate investment. Divinity is God's constant Self-illumination.</p>
<p><em>What is the difference between inner and outer education?</em></p>
<p>Outer education explains everything outwardly, yet without satisfying anybody. Inner education feeds us within and without.</p>
<p><em>Who is a fool?</em></p>
<p>He is a fool who thinks there can be a compromise between the aspiring life and the unaspiring life. Yes, he is a fool who thinks that the aspiring life and the unaspiring life can go together. The aspiring life must go with the aspiring breath and the unaspiring life must go with the unaspiring breath.</p>
<p><em>Who is the wisest of all?</em></p>
<p>He who feels and realises that God or the Master is infinitely more important than human love and human satisfaction.</p>
<p><em>What does God do when I concentrate on Him?</em></p>
<p>When I concentrate on God, He proudly and divinely roars. When I concentrate on God, He becomes so proud, so pleased that I am concentrating only on Him.</p>
<p><em>What do I do when God concentrates on me?</em></p>
<p>When God concentrates on me, I just sleep and snore.</p>
<p><em>What does God do when I meditate on Him?</em></p>
<p>When I meditate on God, He triumphantly sings.</p>
<p><em>And what do I do when God meditates on me?</em></p>
<p>When God meditates on me, I fear Him and hide from Him.</p>
<p><em>What does God do when I contemplate on Him?</em></p>
<p>When I contemplate on Him, God unreservedly embraces me.</p>
<p><em>What do I do when God contemplates on me?</em></p>
<p>I consciously, deliberately and willfully invite ignorance and wallow in the pleasures of ignorance.</p>
<p><em>Is it faith that increases aspiration or is it aspiration that increases faith?</em></p>
<p>They are reciprocal and mutual.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is the end of the questions and answers that I wrote on the plane. Now I will read out <em>Man and God. (Sri Chinmoy reads.)</em></p>
<p>Now, from <em>My Yogi Friends and My Avatar Friends.</em></p>
<p>Is surrender to the Master something necessary? Yes.</p>
<p>Is surrender to the Master something essential? Yes.</p>
<p>Is surrender to the Master something indispensable? Yes, yes, yes.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Talk At The Beginning Of The New Year</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Talk At The Beginning Of The New Year" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span><h2 id="page-subtitle">
 January 13, 1971, Sri Chinmoy Centre, San Juan</h2>
 
<p>This year, 1971, a striking outer manifestation along with the inner realisation will take place. To spread the Light of the Supreme, we have many more Centres this year than we have had before. In many, many parts of the world, the message of the Supreme will be spread through the selfless service of the disciples and through publishers, colleges and universities.</p>
<p>In silence and with utmost love, devotion and surrender, please now offer your love, devotion and surrender to the Supreme and say that you are offering this to Him for His manifestation here on earth. Please do this. Now, one by one, please come up and chant AUM and sit down.</p>
<p>This promise you have made to the Supreme, who is everybody's Guru: my Guru, your Guru, everyone's Guru... the Supreme. And we must try to keep this promise to Him: that we shall be totally surrendered to His Will. We shall love Him. We shall offer Him our devotion. We shall offer Him our unconditional surrender.</p>
<p>We were in Europe for about a month: England, Ireland, Scotland, Switzerland and a few other places. I gave talks in about twenty universities, including Oxford and Cambridge. Almost all the universities responded extremely well. We had tremendous success.</p>
<p>I have told you several times that last year we were <em>entering</em> into the wide world. Now I wish to say that we have definitely <em>entered</em> into the wide world and it has been a tremendous success precisely because the Supreme wants His own Mission to spread all over the world. I am sure all of you have read the newspaper cuttings from Ireland... how devotedly they have accepted your Master. In one newspaper, it says, "Ireland's Guru."</p>
<p>In all the universities, seekers asked most sincere, soulful and enlightened questions. And in many universities the professors and principals themselves asked significant questions. We will not only have the lectures published, but the questions and answers will also be eventually published, which will be of tremendous importance to the sincere seekers everywhere.</p>
<p>Yes, it is true that we have entered into the wide world. We have recently established three important Centres: one in London, England; one in Glasgow, Scotland; one in Dublin, Eire. The success of these three Centres is joyfully expressed in their letters. They are growing spiritually, full of enthusiasm, inspiration and aspiration... these three Centres. I am sure we shall have a Centre in Switzerland, most probably in Zurich, and one in New Zealand and one in Australia.</p>
<p>The idea of having many Centres must not be misunderstood. It is not like the missionaries who are going out to convert people. Far from it. Our aim is not to convert others. If others are following any spiritual or religious path, we are most happy. But there are people on earth who don't have a path of their own and who are crying for a path. To them, we say, "We have a path. If this path suits you, you are most welcome to join us. Ours is the path of love, devotion and surrender. If you feel that this path is going to make you happy and make your life meaningful and fruitful, then do join us."</p>
<p>We don't say that ours is the only path or that ours is the best path. No, never. We say and we sincerely feel that our path is one of the paths, but those who want to follow our path must be totally dedicated to our principles of love, devotion and surrender. And then, if the newcomers feel that this is their path, they should start running inwardly. On the spiritual path, one can walk, one can march, one can run the fastest. So if they feel that this is their path, then instead of walking, they have to be given ample opportunity to run the fastest. In almost all our Centres, there are some disciples who are actually running the fastest.</p>
<p>Now today there are quite a few visitors or, I should say, seekers here. I come here very often, but I do not come to convert you. I come here to inspire you. This land of yours, this island, welcomed me first. This is our Mother Centre, and when I see the disciples who started our journey here in this Centre, it gives me the greatest joy and pride. Sudha and Ananta were with us the day we started, and they are still with us. Very soon Gauri joined us and then Agni and Vijaya, his wife. They are also still with us. There are some early disciples who are missing, who have left us.</p>
<p>So if one wants to reach the Goal, the destined Goal, one has to remain in the Boat. If one jumps out of the Boat, the Boatman cannot be responsible for him. The Boatman cannot wait for him, hoping that he will come back again. No, he has other passengers; sincere and dedicated passengers in the Boat. He has promised them that he will take them to the Golden Shore of the Beyond. So you have to know that he is for those who are constantly with him in his Boat.</p>
<p>And again I say: when we are here among the disciples, most of them come here, but the moment we go away, they also disappear. This is absolutely wrong from the spiritual point of view. In our ordinary human life, it may be "Out of sight, out of mind." But in the spiritual life, it is not like that. It is the bond of inner love, inseparable love, which keeps disciples in the heart of their Master. Those who are coming here faithfully, and meditating devotedly, must feel our presence, our spiritual presence here. Otherwise they would not come; they would not have continued to come. Now how do you feel our presence? How do you communicate with us inwardly? With your love, devotion and surrender. Those who do not have love, devotion and surrender will naturally come only when we are here because they think that the Master's presence is the only thing they need. No, this is a great insult to the spiritual life and also to your own aspiring heart. If you really have an aspiring heart, then your aspiring heart will make you feel that no matter where the Master is, his guidance, his inner guidance, will be there because he has realised the Truth and can move freely in the inner worlds. For him, there is no time or space; they have been conquered by his realisation.</p>
<p>This is the thirteenth day of the New Year, 1971, and I wish to tell you that we will come here this year a few times more, at least twice more this year. I wish to see all the disciples (who claim to be disciples) coming here regularly. In our physical absence, when I see your attendance, I see that twenty or twenty-five disciples only are attending regularly; at most thirty or thirty-one. But when we are here physically in Puerto Rico, we see forty-five or fifty who claim to be our disciples. Why do you disappear? Right now I can see forty disciples who <em>can</em> come and <em>should</em> come and must come regularly simply because they feel themselves to be disciples. These people, when they are elsewhere, also claim to be my disciples. So where do they disappear? Others who are visitors and who come here occasionally do not say anything because they have not accepted me, and this is understood. But the disciples who are so irregular, when they are in need of inner guidance, cry to me at their time of difficulty. When they are in danger, they cry, cry! At that time, I come to their rescue, but they can't receive my help because their receptivity is poor due to their irregular meditation and irregular attendance. So this is what happens. They create a barrier between my assistance and their desiring life. Their life of aspiration lags behind and their life of desire comes forward. That is why they do not come to the Centre regularly. But, as I said, when difficulty arises, when there is real trouble or danger, at that time I am helpless. I cannot help them adequately because their receptivity is very limited.</p>
<p>If you do something every day, you increase your receptivity. Every day, for example, if you read, you develop your mental power. Similarly, every day if you pray and meditate, you develop your psychic power, your inner power. When that happens, it becomes extremely easy for me to be of help to you. Otherwise the vessel that we call "receptivity" is filled with darkness and ignorance. So, as I said in my talk "The New Year's Message," I will not scold you, and this is no scolding at all. This is my sympathetic concern. I am crying for your cause. One thing is to scold; another thing is to sympathise with others' problems. I am trying to sympathise with your unconscious, unaspiring mind and your unaspiring heart! Look at those who are coming regularly and devotedly, doing selfless service here and attending meditation regularly here. Look at their faces. You are bound to see and feel that they made considerable progress in their outer lives (as well as their inner lives). All those who are coming regularly, even if they do not have deep aspiration — one or two may not have deep aspiration — but because they are coming regularly, they are making some progress. It is because of their regular attendance. And those who have aspiration along with their regularity are naturally making tremendous progress. So if one has aspiration along with regularity, naturally one will make enormous progress.</p>
<p>Now if one or two do not have deep aspiration right now, they are bound to get aspiration sooner or later because God is pleased with their regularity. When God is pleased with someone for some reason, He tries to offer His Help in other fields as well. So these one or two unaspiring disciples will also make considerable progress too, because God is pleased with their regularity.</p>
<p>Now my sincere request to all the disciples who are really in my Boat: you should come regularly to the Centre. Otherwise what will happen? In your day-to-day life, you will fall behind. I am seeing it happen. You become depressed, disheartened. You lose your inner contact and finally you become frustrated. Then you feel that the spiritual life is not meant for you; the Master is no good; this path is not the best one; etc. These are the things that you will, consciously or unconsciously, cherish.</p>
<p>Now before we enter into meditation, this is my last request to the sincere seekers: be regular, be as regular as possible. If someone is sick or if you are sick or if something very serious has taken place in the family, it is fully understood that you will not be able to come. Unavoidable circumstances will fully excuse you. But just because you are feeling lazy, or going to see a movie, or watching TV or going out with your friends, that is not acceptable.</p>
<p>So with your kind permission, I wish again to ask my disciples who have come here today to please stand up. We will count the number and when we return to New York, we shall find out the attendance from here. Today most of you have come. So we shall see the attendance list and see how many of you are fulfilling your promise. As I have said countless times, regularity is of paramount importance in the spiritual life. If you are regular, then you can go one step ahead with your love, devotion and surrender. But if you fail in regularity, that means that you are failing at the very first step.</p>
<p>Thirty-seven aspiring seekers are here and two or three unfortunately have not been able to come. Now we will see, out of forty, how many will come regularly. We will be here for three weeks: our next meeting will be on Sunday; then one on Monday, then Wednesday and one on Friday.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Looking For A New Centre</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Looking For A New Centre" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span><h2 id="page-subtitle">
 February 23, 1971, Sri Chinmoy Centre, San Juan</h2>
 
<p>Manuel, Juan, Ivan and a few others have collected $40.00, which is not bad. We need perhaps forty thousand dollars! I deeply appreciate their sincere concern for us, but unfortunately we need the impossible amount of forty thousand dollars or more.</p>
<p><em>(Terrible banging and drilling noise from the upstairs apartment which was being renovated.)</em></p>
<p>Such a noise, unbearable noise. This is absolutely the interference of the hostile forces. Positively. Now the thing is that if we want to ignore them, yes, we can ignore them. We can remain in our own light, poise and peace. But again in the world, Mother Earth is kind to us. There are many places where we don't have this kind of noise. So why not try to have that kind of place? When we were in Manhattan, we used to have this kind of unbearable noise, this very destructive noise, but then we moved to Queens, a quiet borough of New York. Where we are now staying, it is practically a street in the suburbs. And if you come down four blocks, it is again right in the city. But our present Centre is really peaceful and calm and quiet. We can do our meditation; we can have our meetings in almost pin-drop silence.</p>
<p>This place on Miramar Avenue has played its part. Now every real disciple and those who have recently become disciples I am sure will want to sail in the same Boat and will not misunderstand me: the feeling now is that we need a spiritual place where we can avoid unnecessary tension. We are on a most beautiful island. Let us therefore have also a beautiful place to hold our meetings without such outside commotion. You will be surprised to learn that upstairs young boys come, not unconsciously but consciously, acting as instruments of the hostile forces. In spite of knowing that so many people are trying to meditate sincerely and devotedly, they deliberately make a noise. On other nights, when the group is not here, when you people are not here, they do not make any noise. Then they are very good. But when you are here, they have to go down the stairs thumping and crashing, whistling and all that. This is what they are doing. It is the unmistakable hostile forces. Sudha has spoken to the mother of the boys, but it is useless. She herself becomes hostile to us. On the days we hold our meditations and not on other days, her sons are behaving like hooligans and worse.</p>
<p>So please I am asking every disciple and friends to look for another Centre for us.</p>

<h2>All The Disciples Who Have Been With...</h2>

<p>All the disciples who have been with us for a long time and those prospective disciples who sincerely want to sail in our Boat are requested to come up here, one by one, and speak on my philosophy.</p>
<p>I want you to speak in one, two, three or four sentences. It must not exceed four sentences. So one by one, you will come up and speak on Sri Chinmoy's philosophy according to your own understanding; what you feel about my philosophy.</p>
<p>And I wish to say that it has to come directly from your heart and not what you hear others say. It will be what you feel. You have read my writings, you have meditated on my writings many times. Now from your own inner experience, tell us what you think of my philosophy, so that in the future, it can be published in book form and can be distributed.</p>
<p>In New York we got quite a few comments on my philosophy and also in other places. Here also we want to have your comments. Those who cannot speak English well, no harm. Come up and speak in Spanish. Afterwards, it will be translated into English.</p>
<p>So please meditate first for two or three minutes. We shall start with Sudha, then Agni, Vijaya, Sanjivan... then one by one all will come up. But please don't give a long talk; only four sentences at the most.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Sudha: By Accepting Life As It Is,...</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Sudha: By Accepting Life As It Is,..." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>SUDHA:</em> By accepting life as it is, we are transforming our ignorance. Life as it is, is the workshop where we can work out our limitations and enter into the path of love, devotion and surrender. Illumined by our spiritual Master, we will be guided to the Feet of the Supreme. AUM.</p>
<p><em>AGNI:</em> Sri Chinmoy's philosophy is that God can be felt, can be realised, nay, has to be realised by every person on earth. All of us are God's chosen children, but the time it takes for a person to realise God depends on his aspiration and the help of a competent spiritual Master or Guru. The wisest and safest way to realise God is the path of love, devotion and surrender. Life has to be accepted fully and then transformed, so that God's Qualities of Light, Peace, Love, Bliss and Power, which are our divine heritage, are manifested on earth with the help of our Guru's grace.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy's philosophy for me is love, devotion and surrender. He is the one who is carrying me to the Supreme. I have no fear. For me, he is light, love and everything in this life.</p>
<p>The key concepts of Sri Chinmoy's philosophy to me are purity and absolute faith. In these two words, in this two marvellous ideas, all the divine qualities are comprehended. He has affected such a wonderful influence in my inner soul, in the innermost recesses of my heart, and in myself, that really I have been turned inside out. He offers, with his philosophy, the most beautiful panoramas, the most beautiful vistas of happiness, felicity, bliss and consciousness of unity with the whole world, that we feel that our fellow men, all nations, the whole universe, along with God Himself, are ours. So I am more than pleased and honoured and grateful to Sri Chinmoy Kumar Ghose for all he has done for me. Thank you.</p>

<p><em>ASHPRIHA:</em> To me, my Master's philosophy is a superb combination of God's Compassion and the aspirant's sincere aspiration. In this supreme combination, there cannot be and never will be a dark force that can overcome the aspirant on his way to the Goal.</p>

<p><em>A:</em> Sri Chinmoy says that there is only one Being, God. Life is a transcendental Blessing from God: we have come here to experience the earthly Form of God. We are all one. We are experiencing the finite and have not yet transcended to the Consciousness of the Beyond. But as a growing consciousness awakens in us, we will see that there is only One Existence. AUM.</p>
