<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The heart got the vision, not the mind. When a vision comes from the heart, your mind cannot claim it. Just throw the mind away. However, if the mind wants to claim the vision and glorify itself, if it says, "I want to bask in your divine glory," then you can allow the mind to keep the vision.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best that you can expect from your mind is mental illumination and your mind's acceptance of your heart. The heart has accepted the soul as its advisor; similarly, the mind has to accept the heart as its advisor. The mind has not accepted a teacher: it wants to remain its own teacher. But it should have the heart as its teacher. The best thing you can <em>ask</em> of the mind is for it to accept the heart's blessingful advice. The best thing you can <em>expect</em> from the mind is mental illumination. Illumination of the mind is the most important thing, and this illumination of the mind can take place only when the mind really goes to the heart, the aspiring heart and becomes totally one with the heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When everything is dull, when you are absolutely in the world of nowhere, you do not care for liberation, perfection, realisation or anything. At that time what actually happens is that you do not aim at any goal. When you work there should be always a goal. This goal should not be that in five minutes you will finish, but that you will do well, that your work will be perfect and flawless.</p>
<p>You have a spiritual goal, but that doesn't mean you should try to reach your goal by hook or by crook or by using foul means. God is in front of you, within you and around you; but you are unconscious of it. When you become conscious you will see that the distance between your eyes and your nose is infinitely further than the distance between you and God. Just because you are unconscious now, He is distant. So always try to remember your goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it true that you see a difference between the mind with its ideas, and the soul? Could you please explain the difference between the soul and the mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it true that you see a difference between the mind with its ideas, and the soul? Could you please explain the difference between the soul and the mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul is absolutely conscious of God. When we speak of the soul we speak of the conscious representative of God on earth. But it is not so with the mind. In this lifetime you have your present mind, and in your next incarnation you will have a totally different mind. But in each incarnation of yours, it is the same soul that is evolving in the process of ever-increasing perfection.</p>
<p>When the soul sees the truth, the soul feels that the truth is something of its very own because of the soul's own conscious oneness with the truth. Unfortunately, the mind does not have this indivisible consciousness or conscious oneness with truth or light. The mind is groping in the darkness, searching for the truth. And when it sees an iota of light it feels it has discovered God. But that is not enough. The soul, on the other hand, always sees infinity all around, and it tries to bring down the possibilities of infinite light into the field of manifestation.</p>
<p>The mind is very limited. It cannot think of infinity. It can think only of a finite object or person. It cannot think of two things at one time. We say that someone is thinking of so many things, but if we ask him whether he is actually thinking of two things at once, he will say no.</p>
<p>The soul does not think: the soul sees. In this room there is light, electric light, and I am seeing it with my eyes. But my two eyes cannot see everyone. Now I am looking at you, and I cannot see the other people. But we have another eye, the third eye, which is located between and a little above the eyebrows. This eye sees everything. It sees the past, the present and the future. The soul is in constant communion with this eye, the third eye, the eye of real vision. But the poor mind can never have free access to the third eye. That is why we say that we should either go beyond the mind or catch the mind and place it at the feet of the heart, which has a free access to the soul.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the difference between the mind and the soul is that the mind is bound and it is trying to bind others, whereas the soul is boundless and it is trying to free us. If I am bound, I will try to bind you also. Misery loves company. But as the soul is already free from the meshes of ignorance, naturally it will try to free the rest of the being and to free other human beings as well.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When we look at very young children sometimes they seem so receptive. They seem to be conscious, as though the soul is right there. Can you see a real universal Consciousness in them?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When we look at very young children sometimes they seem so receptive. They seem to be conscious, as though the soul is right there. Can you see a real universal Consciousness in them?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely. Especially when a child smiles, at that time we see everything. When Sri Krishna was a child, his mother saw the universe in him. It is not an exaggeration, it is absolutely true. You can easily see the consciousness of the soul in children. The universal Consciousness, the transcendental Consciousness is there in seed form. Its potentiality is there. Then it germinates and becomes a plant, a small tree and then a huge banyan tree. The potentiality, the possibility, everything is there, but the problem is how to develop it once ignorance comes.</p>
<p>In a baby there is no mind at all. But after five or seven years, the mind begins to be developed and the mind separates everything. It gets pleasure in separating. As soon as the mind starts functioning, it gets tremendous delight in separating. If there are two things, immediately the mind will separate them. Even if there is only one thing, the mind wants to get satisfaction by dividing the thing into half.</p>
<p>In contrast to the mind, the heart gets satisfaction in oneness. If you live in the heart, two things will become one. Even if it sees two things, the heart will try to unite them and feel them as one.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I feel oneness?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I feel oneness?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you feel oneness for even a fraction of a second, you will feel that your human life is totally transformed and immortalised. Pray to the Supreme to grant you conscious, constant and inseparable oneness with Him. Then the question of separativity will automatically be solved. You will feel that what you have always wanted, from the dawn of your aspiration, is actually oneness, conscious oneness.</p>
<p>The mind has been deeply absorbed in ignorance. You have to catch the thief red-handed and take it to the judge. Then the mind problem will be solved. Here the judge is the soul. When the mind is brought to the judge, the punishment is illumination.</p>
<p>If you don't want to catch the mind, just take it as something unnecessary. Who wants to keep something unnecessary in his life? Even a child at the age of four doesn't keep the things that are unnecessary. If he has two pieces of bread and the second piece is unnecessary, he throws it out. If you also think of the doubting, suspicious mind as something unnecessary, you will automatically strengthen yourself and the mind will go away. When you feel that the mind is necessary, you give it some strength, but if you know that it is unnecessary, then half its strength goes away.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can concentrate anywhere: on the heart, on a candle or on any object. But if you are concentrating on a candle flame, please feel that nothing exists between you and the flame. Feel that nothing exists in your aspiring world but the flame; and while concentrating, feel that the inner flame is climbing high, higher, highest. The candle flame means aspiration. When you look at the flame, try to feel that you are aspiring, that there is no thought, nothing, in you or around you.</p>
<p>If you are concentrating on the picture of a spiritual Master, try to feel the spiritual and divine qualities of the Master. Otherwise the picture will only be a piece of paper to you. When you are looking at the picture, try to feel peace at one point. Feel that this man has peace and that that peace and nothing else is what you are going to have.</p>
<p>Then, when nothing is coming into your mind, you are ready for meditation. You will feel a sea of peace right in front of you. Either you are swimming in the sea of peace or someone is sailing a boat and you are there inside the boat.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes it can be a blessingful gift from above.

Then the mind can inspire the heart to go deeper and to become wider. So the mind can achieve something unique for the heart.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How can it be impossible? If it is impossible, then how have I done it?</p>
<p>The thing is not to pay any attention to the mind. Just feel that there are two boys in front of you. One is a mischievous boy. The other is kind, polite and nice in every sense of the term. The bad one will try to disturb you, but don't pay any attention to him. You pay attention to the nice one.</p>
<p>Now in this world there is something called prestige. You may think that only good people have a sense of prestige. If that bad boy bothers you for a long time, and you are not paying any attention to him, then he will say that it is beneath his dignity to bother you. I tell you, it is absolutely true. You are ignoring him, and you should ignore him because he is a very bad boy. He is pinching you all the time like a monkey, but you don't pay any attention. You just let him go on, go on, go on. He will see that all the time you are paying attention to this other boy, the heart, who is very kind, affectionate and loving. If you go on showing all your affection and love to the nice boy, then the other one will stop bothering you.</p>
<p>Afterwards you will see that while you are showing affection, love and concern to the heart and becoming one with the heart, there will always be competition. The mind will say, "By disturbing and bothering this person, I have gained nothing. On the contrary, he is ignoring me like anything." So the mind will immediately try to imitate the heart. First it will say, "I can also become a nice boy. I want to become nicer than he is so that I can get more attention, more affection from this person." In the beginning it will try to imitate. So here imitation is very good. I always say that in order to try something, we have to start by imitating.</p>
<p>After a few months or a few years, the mind will say, "I am imitating the heart, but why have I to imitate it? What is it doing? Let me try to become good in my own way. Let me try to please this person in my own way." But when the mind tries to please you in its own way, it finds this very, very difficult. Then it says, "How is it possible for the heart to please this man? How is it that I can't please him? All right, let me go deep within." When it goes deep within it sees that inside the heart is the soul. The soul is constantly offering light to the heart. That is why the heart is able to please the human being. So the mind will try to enter into the soul.</p>
<p>The mind finds it very difficult to enter into the soul because the soul is like the vast ocean. The mind thinks that if it enters into the ocean, it will be totally lost, like a tiny drop. It will see how much light the heart has, and when it makes a comparison between the heart's light and the soul's light, it sees that the soul has much more light than the heart. At the same time, it will see that the light that the heart has is more than enough to satisfy the person. Now the mind will feel that the light of the heart is within its reach. Just five minutes ago the mind and the heart quarrelled and fought. Even if the heart can get the soul's light, still the mind is ready to fight with the heart; but the mind is not ready to fight with the soul. The mind does not dare to fight with the soul, because it knows how powerful the light of the soul is. So the mind tries to compete with the heart's light, and while competing, it comes very close to the heart in a positive way. At that time the soul, out of its infinite compassion, offers light to the mind through the heart. The soul knows that the mind is only able to grasp or to know the capacity, quality or quantity of the heart's light and not that of the soul's light. The soul is so kind that it tries to offer a little light to the mind through the heart, according to the mind's capacity.</p>
<p>So from the very beginning, always try to think of the mind as a naughty boy who is creating problems all the time, and just ignore it. Think that the mind does not exist. In Indian villages, there are thousands and millions of people who don't use the mind. Does this mean that they do not exist? No, they <em>do</em> exist. They have the heart. Let us ignore the mind for one year or two years or ten years. We will not ignore it forever, because we know that if any part of our being remains imperfect, then we are not totally perfect or complete. But for the time being we have to be wise. It is not that we shall neglect and ignore the mind forever, far from it. But we will let the mind know that it is not sufficient, it is not complete, it is not perfect. The mind wants to convince us all the time, but let us convince the mind that it is not perfect. It is imperfect, it is weak, it is helpless. Let us go our own way to convince the mind that what it wants to be is not enough. We do not need it. We need something higher, something deeper, something infinitely more meaningful and fruitful. Previously we surrendered to the mind, but when we convince the mind, then the mind will surrender to us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Suppose you have sincerity. Unless you bring it forward through your heart, how are you going to convince yourself that you have it? If you have money in your pocket, what good is it if you don't take it out of your pocket and buy the thing that you need?</p>
<p>Let us say that you have sincerity. Now, if you don't bring it forward and give it to mankind, then why should mankind be satisfied with you and how can you yourself be satisfied? So it is a matter of give and take. Inner cry comes from the inside to the outside. It is there already, but you have to bring it forward. It is like material wealth. If you don't bring the money out of your pocket, then how are you going to buy anything or achieve anything? It is impossible. All divine qualities you have, but you have to bring them forward. If they are not manifested, then nobody will get any benefit. You are not getting any benefit, not to speak of the world at large.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What does it mean when they say, "The mind is the slayer of the real."?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> "The mind is the slayer of the real." Inside the mind we have the physical mind, the mind proper, the higher mind, the overmind, and the supermind. The mind they are referring to here is the physical mind. This physical mind is always blind to something that is large, vast or infinite. Whatever exists on earth has its infinite part all over the world. When you enter into a tiny thought or a small thought, you will see that this thought covers the whole universe. But when the physical mind wants to observe or see the thought, it says that it is a tiny thought. Whatever the physical mind wants to see, it sees in an infinitesimal part. If you bring a vast amount of material in front of the physical mind, it will see one part here, another part there and still another part someplace else. It always divides, breaks and kills the entirety, the wholeness of the Truth. The very function of the physical mind is to limit the Truth, the Light, or whatever can uplift your heart and soul. That is why they say that the mind is the slayer of the Truth. The mind can never see the Truth in its entirety. It has to break, it has to give ideas, it has to make the Truth very tiny so that it can see and can appreciate it. When something is vast, the mind fails to see it. So the mind has to kill in order to appreciate.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you live in the ordinary world, the unaspiring world, you have to see in order to believe. But when you aspire, first you believe the truth and then you see the truth. You have faith in something, and your faith is the precursor of your being. Normally you say, "Seeing is believing." But if you have belief in something, then only you can say that believing is being. You have to have faith in your Master. You have to have faith that your Master is a realised soul and that he can grant you realisation. It is not only the Master who decides when to give you God-realisation: it is the Supreme who tells the Master the exact hour when realisation will take place. You are the instrument of God. If you have faith in your own life, that is to say, in the life of aspiration, and if you have faith in the divine Grace, then you can say that you are going to see, feel and become the Truth. So faith is the precursor of realisation. When you actually realise the Truth, at that time you will see that realisation is totally one with faith. Faith sees what is coming ahead; faith becomes totally one with what you are going to realise.</p>
<p>So the higher you go the more clearly you will be able to see that faith is clearing the way. It is your own faith in yourself, in your spiritual Master and in your life of aspiration that is hastening your realisation. What is realisation? Realisation means that you know that you are not the finite, you are the Infinite. It is in the finite that the Infinite is playing its favourite tune. You are also revelation, the revelation inside your Master. You are the revelation that is operating in and through your Master. When the Infinite plays through the finite and uses the finite as his very instrument, and when the finite can claim the Infinite as its own in the field of realisation and in the field of manifestation, then only God the Infinite and God the Finite become totally fulfilled in each other.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can sentimentality be transformed?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can sentimentality be transformed?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sentimentality is sometimes in the mind, but it is usually in the vital. Now, if we want to transform sentimentality, then we have to transform it into something that gives us the feeling of constant and conscious progress: progress in the Light, with the Light and for the Light. When someone is sentimental, we have to know that that person is cherishing only a part of the whole. He feels that the way in which he observes the truth is the only way. If anyone hurts him, then he feels that his way of growing into the truth and becoming the truth differs from the way of that person. Sentimentality arises because truth or reality is not getting the scope to manifest itself. If we want to conquer our sentimentality, if we don't want to be hurt, then we must grow into the Light. We must feel that we are of the Light and for the Light: the Light of the Infinite that grows in infinite shapes and forms.</p>
<p>We are sentimental because we don't want to be approached by some person and he has approached us. A sentimental person has a way of seeing and dealing with the truth, but he feels that his way should be the only way. But we always have to give freedom to the truth, to life and to reality so that everything can grow in its own way. That doesn't mean that when we hurt someone we will try to justify it; far from it. We have to feel inside us an adamantine will that always remains unaffected by others who want to hurt us or enter into us. Let them try to enter into us in their own way. We have to feel that we are the mighty ocean and others are only tiny rivulets. We have to know that we are the Life Infinite and we are for the Light Infinite. If we have this kind of feeling within us and if we are conscious of it, then sentimentality gives way to an infinite variety of self-expression. This expression of the Infinite Will wants to be manifested on all levels, both human and divine. If we give the proper scope to each sentimental feeling, then we will not be affected by anything. Inside us and inside others we shall let Light grow. Inside Light there is tolerance. Once we have this tolerance, we shall not suffer anymore from the sentimentality-disease.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes the physical is very tired, exhausted, and the mind does not want to participate in what I am saying. Sometimes the mind wants to participate, but it feels that what I am saying is not something new. It says, "I am not gaining anything." If the mind is not gaining anything new, then it does not care for what I am saying. But when the heart wants to achieve something, the heart gets tremendous joy. Whether the answer is pleasing to the heart is of no importance. The heart will accept the message on the strength of its identification with the soul. Today the heart is very happy, so the aspiring heart is satisfied with the answers.</p>
<p>Sometimes you like my voice and sometimes you don't like my voice. At times the disciples say, "He has spoken too much." It entirely depends on the individual disciple's consciousness and his physical standard. If the standard of the disciple is very, very low, then what I am saying will be of no interest.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When we feel like going to sleep, how can we tell if it&#039;s just our mind or if we really need this sleep?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When we feel like going to sleep, how can we tell if it&#039;s just our mind or if we really need this sleep?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> After your meditation early in the morning, you should feel that life is an opportunity. You should feel that if you go to sleep even for a minute, then you are really going to miss something or lose something that is extremely important to your life. This is not a threat to your conscious mind. Sometimes you don't need sleep at all; it is only your mind that is telling you that for the last two or three days you have not slept enough. But who knows, perhaps for the past few days you meditated well. You have not slept for more than seven hours during these days, true; but during these three days perhaps your meditation was extremely powerful. When your meditation is extremely powerful, then you don't need to sleep for seven or eight hours.</p>
<p>If you feel that your meditation was not good and that now you need or deserve sleep, at that time you can try to be the master of the body. Do not allow the body to dictate to you. If the body comes and tells you, "I am so tired, please let me sleep," then it is just as if a worker were leading his boss. The workers always say, "I am so tired and exhausted. Please let me go home." But you are the boss. If you feel that your system, the worker, is really tired and exhausted, then you allow the body to sleep. But you be the judge. Otherwise, it is natural for the body to act like that. It will always try to convince you that it is very sick and weak. It knows that when it is hungry you will feed it. It is like a worker who knows that the boss has a big heart. The boss will always give him his salary because he has convinced the boss that he is sick all the time. So when you give in to the body, please feel that you are the owner of the body. Your soul is the owner of the body and you are one with the soul. If you see that the body is tired and exhausted and it cannot move an inch, then naturally at that time the body deserves sleep. But if you allow the body to dictate to you, then the body will tell you every day that it needs more sleep. Right after meditation it will say, "Now that I have done my duty, I deserve three or four hours of sleep." So you be the judge, and not the body. Let your soul and your aspiration be the judge of the body. Then, I tell you, you are not going to make any mistakes.</p>
