  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Should we pray for more capacity or more willingness? When I pray, my prayers get confused and I usually end up praying for the Will of the Supreme, so I don’t really pray for anything specific.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Should we pray for more capacity or more willingness? When I pray, my prayers get confused and I usually end up praying for the Will of the Supreme, so I don’t really pray for anything specific." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is the best thing! Again, you can pray for willingness and eagerness, but you must not care for the result. When I request someone to call you in the evening and ask you to go to Mexico to get an exercise machine for me, how eagerly you go there! Sometimes you do not find anything. Sometimes you bring something and it does not work, but you just try again. How many miles you drive to get something for me! Is that not your readiness, eagerness and willingness? So, eagerness and willingness we always have to have.</p>
<p>At every moment use the heart. If you use the heart, at every moment you will be able to please me. But if you use the mind, you will say, “Oh, it is late. God knows whether I will be able to get what Guru wants or not.” Once you use the mind, you have polluted your aspiration, you have destroyed your inspiration. Never use the mind! The mind is only for limited purposes. If you see right in front of you a snake, then you will not use your heart, because God inside you is telling your mind that this snake will bite you. But there will be millions of instances in your life when you will not see any snake or any other danger, and the mind will not be needed. Again, if you use the heart, you will be at that particular place where the snake is either five minutes later or five minutes earlier. You will see that there is no snake there.</p>
<p>Readiness, willingness and eagerness you need, but readiness, willingness and eagerness have to come from the heart, not from the mind. The mind’s readiness will take you two steps and then you will say, “I should go and get my sweater. Perhaps it is going to rain; I need an umbrella. Who knows what will happen?” That is the mind’s readiness. The mind will always try to be ready by looking to this side and that side. The mind will always try to protect itself. But the heart has no time to think of rain or sun or anything else; it only acts.</p>
<p>Always we have to think of Hanuman, Sri Ramachandra’s disciple. For him there was no sun, no moon, no day, no night. And such a significant lesson he taught humanity! When he received a most expensive locket as a gift, he opened it and saw that Ramachandra’s picture was not inside. So he broke the locket into pieces. He said, “My Lord Rama is not inside. So is this of any value?”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Was Hanuman really a monkey, or was he a member of a tribe of people?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Was Hanuman really a monkey, or was he a member of a tribe of people?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He was a donkey! Only a donkey can take that kind of load. Sri Ramachandra’s whole life fell on him. To save Sri Ramachandra, only a faithful donkey could carry such a weight. The whole of Sri Ramachandra’s life he kept on his shoulder. I do not have anybody to keep my life on his shoulder, as Sri Ramachandra had Hanuman.</p>
<p>Hanuman was not a monkey. His was a kind of evolved tribe. It was so evolved that it was almost on the level of human beings. Hanuman had infinite inner strength from his surrender to his Lord Sri Ramachandra’s will. He knew Sri Ramachandra was the direct descendant of God Himself, an Avatar, and his bounden duty was to serve his Master sleeplessly and breathlessly. So Hanuman was not just a monkey with a huge body — far from it! Sri Ramachandra’s Hanuman had very, very high and lofty previous incarnations. His was a kind of tribe, but in terms of evolution, it was very advanced.</p>
<p>There are some elephants I have seen whose souls are so fully evolved that, when they take human incarnation, they will immediately far surpass many human beings. The height that they will attain in one incarnation, many human beings will take forty or fifty incarnations to reach — specially in the mind, the vital and the body. When those animals take their first human incarnation, they will far, far surpass the human beings who have already visited earth quite a few times.</p>
<p>So, to come back to your question, Hanuman was exceptional.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I like to be outdoors running and cycling, but then I think I should spend more time meditating and being with you, learning songs.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I like to be outdoors running and cycling, but then I think I should spend more time meditating and being with you, learning songs." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Always we need a balanced life. Early in the morning before meditation if you go out and eat a nice breakfast, will it be good? Early in the morning, do your prayer and meditation. Then go out to run or do anything else. First things first. After meditation you can enter into the hustle and bustle of life. But if you do not do the right thing at the right time, then you will be making a mistake.</p>
<p>Cycling is good for you, to keep your body fit. Definitely it will help your meditation. Again, if you meditate well, the inner joy that you get from your meditation and prayer will make you feel that you are flying while you are riding. So, everything has its own time. If you do everything at its proper time, then the previous things will always give you joy while you are doing the next thing, and those things will also give you tremendous joy. There is always time to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Our difficulty is that when we miss one thing, our whole world collapses. Early in the morning, at six o’clock if you do not meditate, then meditate at seven o’clock or seven-thirty, even eight o’clock, before you go out. If you do not meditate at six o’clock, you feel that God is so displeased with you that He is coming with an iron rod to break your head. You say, “My day is all over!” But that is not the right attitude. Just do the thing that you have missed before you do the next thing that you are supposed to do — specially in the case of prayer and meditation. These things have to be first and foremost. In the spiritual life, nothing should be taken as seriously as your prayer and meditation. Then the beauty and fragrance of your prayer and meditation you have to feel in all your activities during the day.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If a friend is suffering from a negative emotion, from hostility or anger, how can you help that person?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If a friend is suffering from a negative emotion, from hostility or anger, how can you help that person?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First you have to see how much capacity you have. To help your friend, you can go only so far. You may be near the shore, and your friend may also be very near the shore. Let us say that you have given your hand and you are about to pull your friend from the sea of ignorance. You have to know if you have the capacity to lift your friend and bring him to the shore, or if your friend will take you into the water. You have to be careful. You have to see how much strength you have. Your friend desperately needs your help, but will you succeed, or will he pull you into the water?</p>
<p>When a friend suffers, in your prayers you have to say to the Supreme, “If it is Your Will, then do give me the capacity to be of service to You inside my friend. If it is not Your Will, then please, please, I do not want to be involved. I shall only offer my goodwill. If it is Your Will, I will become involved because I know I will be protected. But if it is not Your Will, then I am only using my self-styled concern and compassion.” If your friend is suffering from problems — depression, frustration, emotional problems and so on — the best thing is to pray to the Supreme and get an inner message about what you should do at that point. From your prayers you will get inner guidance, and this inner guidance will tell you what to do. Then whatever help you are supposed to give to that particular person you will be able to give.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes when we tell you that a person is doing something wrong, that person gets furious. Once someone would not speak to me for two years because I told you something that he had done wrong. What is the best way to deal with that?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes when we tell you that a person is doing something wrong, that person gets furious. Once someone would not speak to me for two years because I told you something that he had done wrong. What is the best way to deal with that?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Did you come into the world for the forgiveness of Tom, Dick and Harry, or did you come into the world to be loyal to your Master? Ask yourself! Will you get your God-realisation by being loyal to your Master or by being afraid of so-and-so? If you had not confided in me, would that person not have gone from darkness to deeper darkness to deepest darkness? Would he not have entered into the abysmal abyss? Who would have been responsible at that time? You would have been responsible. God would have blamed you.</p>
<p>I chose you to be the leader of one of our Centres. Is it not your bounden duty to inform me about what is happening in your Centre? Who gave you the authority? Sri Chinmoy. Who gave Sri Chinmoy the authority? The Supreme. Did you come to our Centre to be loyal, faithful, surrendered and devoted to me, or did you come to please someone else in his own way?</p>
<p>You did absolutely the right thing by telling me. Even if that person does not speak to you throughout Eternity, you are not going to lose an iota of your spirituality. But if you do not tell me what you are supposed to tell me, then you may lose all your spirituality. So ask yourself if to be loyal to the Master at every second is not of supreme importance in your life. Is there anything else as valuable? No. You have done the right thing. If that person does not speak to you for one year, he is not living in the heart, he is not living in the soul.</p>
<p>By telling me, you have proved that you care. In a family, if somebody has cancer, then what happens? If the sister knows that the brother has developed cancer, she will go running to the father so that the father can bring in a doctor. But what happens in the spiritual life? Fear, fear, fear comes into the picture. One person is doing something wrong, and the other one hides it. Then it becomes a hopeless case.</p>
<p>You have to ask yourself if your loyalty, your faithfulness, your devotedness, your surrender to my will is of supreme importance or is the only thing you need. The answer will definitely be positive. Just forget about the person who is not going to speak to you for a year. So much the better! If he does not speak to you for a year, you do not have to look at his faults or his misdeeds. Then he will be all by himself.</p>
