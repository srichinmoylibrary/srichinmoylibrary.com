<p>In the newspaper it was mentioned that one parrot on Long Island can say over three hundred words. I wanted to see it for myself, so yesterday one of the boys drove me there. The weather was extremely cold, and we had to drive a long distance.</p>
<p>The man who owned the parrot was unbearable and his wife was only a little bearable. They were screaming at the bird as though it were a child. They were trying to get it to say something. But out of its three hundred-word vocabulary not even one word was coming.</p>
<p>So we wasted nearly two hours and did not hear a single word! The bird may not talk for strangers, but in front of the owners — who brag about it in the newspapers — the parrot says three hundred words!</p>

<p>Sometimes Kanu will not allow me to play. He starts biting the bow. But when I play the cello, the bow is too high for him to reach. So he just goes and plays around my feet.</p>

<p>Kanu does not allow me to sleep! He cries and cries all night. So many hours during the day he sleeps, but at night, when I am ready to sleep, at that time he is moving around. For more than two minutes, he will not stay in one place. He jumps and jumps and wants to come up onto my bed. At night he is not interested in sleeping.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">I beg Sona to eat pizza</h2><span property="dc:title" content="I beg Sona to eat pizza" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>From time to time, I feed my dog Sona. Sometimes he will not eat, but when I feed him pizza, he will take the cheese from my hand in a very, very cute way.</p>
<p>Four or five days ago, I wanted to feed him, but Sona was too restless to eat. He was only barking. So I just looked at him and contacted his soul. There were ten or twelve disciples on my front porch and I said to them, “Now his soul has told him to eat and, believe it or not, he is going to eat!” Then, as soon as I gave him pizza, he started to eat it.</p>
<p>This dog, in front of so many people, obeyed me. Twenty times at least he ate. Sona did not want to eat at first, but when I asked his soul, the soul convinced the vital.</p>
<p>When I ask the soul of one of the disciples to do something, the soul desperately tries to relay the message to that disciple. But quite often the mind comes and blocks the message. The mind is so powerful! Most of the disciples have ‘wonderful’ minds, so they do not always listen to their souls.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for the soul to convince the human mind. It is also extremely difficult to convince the vital. How desperately the souls of the disciples try to convince their vitals if they are doing the wrong thing! But it does not always work.</p>
<p>In Sona’s case, the soul contacted the vital of the animal and convinced it so easily. The vital of a dog may be more willing to listen to the soul than the vital of a human being. In terms of evolution, man is far, far superior to the animals. But in terms of obedience, it is a different story. Human beings can be much more complicated!</p>

<p>This morning I was seeing real tears in Sona’s eyes. I was on the couch, and Sona was standing on his hind legs with his front feet up in the air. Absolutely there were tears in Sona’s left eye because Sona wanted to be with me on the couch. But I had to go to the United Nations.</p>
<p>When I came back, I stood in front of Kanu and Sona for at least five minutes. Both of them were showing off — showing how high they could jump. So with both hands I had to bless both of them.</p>

<p>This morning Savyasachi was holding Sona as I was walking to the car. Three dogs happened to pass by, and Sona started barking. One German lady who is so nice to me tried to console me. She smiled and said, “All dogs bark.”</p>
<p>Then a gentleman greeted me. The man was laughing. He said, “I am sorry he is barking, but he is the boss!”</p>

<p>Kanu’s soul has come to me so many times. When Kanu was a month and a half old, his soul started talking to me. At that time, Kanu was lying on my chest, and then he began looking at me. It happened at two or three o’clock in the morning.</p>

But here, you can call Sona’s name again and again, and still he does not come!</p>

<p>Now, does Kanu want a human incarnation? Kanu has come from the planet worlds, from Neptune. Look how peaceful Kanu is. When Kanu starts crying, he cries in a particular key, in intervals, as though he were playing a musical instrument.</p>

<p>When I go out to run early in the morning, as soon as Sona hears me coming, he comes out of his bed where he sleeps to see me and get attention. Sometimes he cannot open his eyes even; he comes to me with his eyes closed!</p>
<p>Then he lies down and makes unconditional surrender at my feet. The trouble is that his surrender lasts only for a second — like my disciples’ surrender!</p>
<p>Sometimes when I am going out, Sona looks at me so soulfully and pitifully. Then, when I come back inside, he will not let me come in unless I bless him and show him affection.</p>
<p>See how the animal world is responding to my love and concern! The amount of affection, love and concern that I shower on human beings is unimaginable! But these innocent dogs are responding to my divine qualities most satisfactorily.</p>
