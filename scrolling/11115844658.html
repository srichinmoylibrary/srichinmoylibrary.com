I was going up when she was going down, and she was going up when I was going down. I didn't know it was her birthday at the time, but later I found out.</p>

<p>In the two-mile race at the park where Cahit's running club practices, I will never forget that my first rival was Mitali. Next came Melissa and third was Amita. Then at the end it was Lavanya. I was telling her to go and she was telling me to go. In this way we finished the race. After the race the singers sang the song about Cahit.</p>

<p>Gary Fanelli is now growing long hair and a beard and moustache. So at first I could not recognise him when he started running with me in the Philadelphia Marathon. He ran alongside me for at least three hundred metres. He said to me, "Guruji, I didn't know that you would be here. Otherwise, I might have run."</p>
<p>I told him, "Outwardly I could not contact you on your birthday, but I meditated on you inwardly." His birthday was the day before the New York Marathon.He said, "I thought of you on my birthday."</p>
<p>He said he was going to Honolulu to run the marathon on December 13th.</p>

<p>The first mile of the Philadelphia Marathon was no good. The road went up into the sky. After two or three hundred metres it went up, up, up — like a building! As soon as I started the race, I had no life energy.</p>
<p>I am very tricky. I just run the course and if I don't complete it, I call it practice. Otherwise, if I take it too seriously, I suffer. I think, "Oh, I have to complete it." But this way I don't have to worry. I just start and do as many miles as I can.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Pace problems</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Pace problems" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Pahar has given me a schedule for seventy miles a week. Up to Saturday, it is possible for me to follow the schedule. With greatest difficulty I do it. But when Sunday comes, I am totally lost. How can I do twenty more miles in one day? I am not able to fulfil Pahar's desire. I stop at seven or ten miles, so it doesn't add up to seventy miles.</p>
<p>I feel that if I run very slowly, I will be able to run a higher mileage during the week. Sometimes before I start out, I am determined to run at a twelve-minute pace. Since it is an Indian bullock-cart pace, I think I will be able to run farther. But what happens is that I start at about a 10:15 pace. Then it becomes 9:50 and then 8:15. Each mile that I do in a good time gives me such joy. But by the time I reach five miles, I am finished.</p>
<p>The problem is that when I run at a ten-minute pace, it is boring. An eleven or twelve-minute pace is out of the question. It is not even running! But a nine-minute pace becomes too difficult. So I can't figure out what to do. One moment it is too slow, but if I speed up, the next moment I am completely exhausted.</p>
