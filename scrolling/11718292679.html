  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can you explain to us your philosophy of love, devotion and surrender?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can you explain to us your philosophy of love, devotion and surrender?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We all know human love. Human love is to possess and be possessed. We feel that today or tomorrow we will possess someone. But to our wide astonishment, we find that before we possess that person we ourselves are mercilessly possessed by that person. Once we have possessed someone, we feel that we are strangling that person in the name of love, or we are already strangled in the name of love. But divine love is not possession. Divine love is only expansion. Real love is total oneness with the object loved and with the Possessor of Love. Who is the Possessor of Love? God. Love is the inner bond that connects man with God. We must always approach God through love. Love is the first step. The second step is devotion. The third step is surrender.</p>
<p>In the human world, devotion is attachment. We feel that if we are attached to someone, then we will get Peace, Light and Bliss from that person in abundant measure. But eventually we come to realise that our attachment is nothing short of our ignorance. We feel that if we are attached to a human being, we will get what he has and what he is. But, unfortunately, what he has is darkness and what he is is ignorance. And when he is attached to us, we do not feel that we are able to give any light to him. So attachment is something that constantly is taking us away from our reality. But if we have real devotion, devotion to a higher cause, to some higher reality, to the light within us, to the truth above us, at that time the highest Truth can operate in and through us. Attachment is to the world around us, the world which is full of ignorance. But when we are devoted, we enter into a higher world to bring down Peace, Light and Bliss from above and bring to the fore our own inner divinity. This is devotion.</p>
<p>Then comes surrender. We can surrender to our boss, who is equally ignorant and who will lord it over us, or a slave can listen to his master out of fear. That is one kind of surrender. But spiritual surrender is different. It does not arise from compulsion; it comes spontaneously from our joy, inner joy. In surrender to God, I become one with Infinity and I feel Infinity as my own reality.</p>
<p>There is a great difference between the surrender of laziness or utter helplessness and dynamic surrender, which is surcharged with aspiration. If out of laziness or helplessness we say, "I have surrendered. Now I don't have to do anything," this is not enough. Our surrender has to be dynamic, constantly aspiring to grow into or merge into the Infinite. Our surrender has to be conscious and spontaneous. When we surrender consciously and spontaneously to the infinite Truth, Peace, Light and Bliss, we become a perfect channel for these qualities to manifest in and through us on earth. In the West, surrender has been badly misunderstood. Here surrender is seen as submission to something or to somebody else. It is seen as a loss of individuality, an extinction of individuality. But this view of spiritual surrender is a mistake. If we really want to be one with the Infinite, the Ultimate, the Boundless, then we have to enter into it. It is like the tiny drop surrendering its individuality and entering into its source, the vast ocean. At that time, it doesn't lose anything. It becomes the ocean itself. When we enter into the Ultimate, we do not lose our so-called little individuality. On the contrary, we become the Infinite itself. On the strength of our total oneness, we and the Infinite become indivisible.</p>
<p>When we surrender to God, we feel that God is our most illumined existence. The difference between man and God is this: man is God yet to realise totally who he is, and God is man yet to be fully manifested. Man is God; he is definitely God, but he has not realised fully who he is. And God is man, but He has not yet fully manifested Himself on earth. When we surrender our earthly existence to the divinity within us, we come to realise that man and God are one and identical.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the cause of this separation between man and God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the cause of this separation between man and God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The cause of this separation is ignorance. We feel that 'I' and 'my' will give us real joy. It is like a child. If he is very energetic, dynamic or aggressive, he feels satisfaction only when he strikes someone or breaks something. That is his satisfaction; that is his peace. But a grown-up gets joy only by remaining calm and quiet and tranquil. Unfortunately, individuals feel that by maintaining their individuality and personality they can be happy. But that is wrong. Only by entering into universality can we be happy. Individuality and personality will derive satisfaction only from universality. A tiny drop, when it enters into the ocean and loses its individuality and personality, becomes what the infinite ocean is. But before that, if it fights for its own individual existence, what can it do as just a tiny drop? So it is the ignorance in the drop that makes the drop feel that it can be satisfied by maintaining a sense of separativity. It is absurd.</p>

Isn&#039;t that separation right there? I mean, just the fact that we all live in individual homes and do different tasks and things like that?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, but this is not individuality; It is only the necessity that comes from having respective tasks. With my hand I write, with my mouth I eat, with my eyes I see. But even though I do different things with the different parts of my body, we have to know that all are members of the same family. Each individual also will do what he is supposed to do, but not with a sense of ego. He will do it with a sense of oneness. God has given me the capacity to do a particular thing. He has given you the capacity to do something else. So let us combine our capacity. But I will not say that my capacity is superior to yours and you will not say that your capacity is the only capacity worth having. The difficulty with the world is that everyone feels that he is infinitely more important than everyone else. Here is where the problem starts. You stay with your capacities, I stay with mine, and we don't unite our capacities. That is why problems start.</p>

But now people are beginning to form communities to work together and to develop a little bit of that sense you were talking about. What is your view of the relation between spirituality and social consciousness?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spirituality and social consciousness must go together. Spirituality is not for the recluse. It is not only for a limited number of people who go off to the Himalayan caves. If someone feels that by entering into a Himalayan cave he will do the best type of meditation, he is making a deplorable mistake. Again, if someone feels that he will go to Central Park and sing and dance, and that this is spirituality, he is also wrong. We are going from one extreme to another. We have to have a balance. In my own way, I shall pray and invoke the Supreme, who comes first in my life. Then I shall go to the office and share with my colleagues the inner wealth which I have achieved, or I shall throw light on the activities that I am involved in. Meditation and the everyday life have to go together.</p>
<p>But first we have to know the supreme secret. The supreme secret is God comes first. From the One we go to the many. It is like a tree with many branches. How am I going to get to the branches unless I first climb up the trunk? Early in the morning, if I pray and meditate, that means that I am climbing up the tree. Then after two hours, when I enter into the office, that is like going to the different branches of life. This is how we can combine spirituality with society. Society is like the branches and spirituality is the tree trunk.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the purpose of ignorance?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the purpose of ignorance?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this world there is light, more light, abundant light, boundless light and infinite Light. If we take ignorance as destruction, then we are mistaken. We have to see that what we call ignorance consists of limited light. Even in the darkest night there is some light. Otherwise, we couldn't exist at all. A child, in comparison to his elder brother, naturally is ignorant; but the child also has some light in him. So what we call ignorance is light in a different form. I as an individual, you as an individual and she as an individual have limited light — let us say infinitesimal light — compared to God, who is infinite Light. But through our prayer and meditation, we are growing into God's boundless and infinite Light and becoming all that God is and all that God has.</p>
<p>This life, as you know, is a kind of game that we play; we call it a cosmic Game. What we call ignorance is nothing short of an experience which God is having in and through us. If we become conscious of the fact that we are only His instruments, then we are not bound by ignorance. We see that there is someone, the Inner Pilot, who is playing His cosmic Game in and through us. If we know that we are mere instruments, then there is no ignorance, there is no light; there is only the Supreme, who is everything. He is the Doer, He is the action, He is the result; He is everything, everything. But if we feel or think that we are doing everything, we are making a Himalayan mistake.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it necessary to have a Guru, or teacher, to come to this realisation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it necessary to have a Guru, or teacher, to come to this realisation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The person who realised God for the first time didn't have a human Guru; God was his Guru. But, at the same time, we have to be wise. In this world for everything we need a teacher. Knowledge we can get from books, but still we go to a school for years and years and study under the guidance of a teacher. We feel that if there is a teacher, then the teacher can expedite our journey. Otherwise, in the morning I shall study something and in the afternoon I will doubt whether the thing I learned is correct or incorrect. I am confused. But if the teacher says, "Yes, it is correct," then immediately I will believe it. We need a spiritual Master in order to expedite our realisation.</p>
<p>A spiritual teacher is like a private tutor. In the ordinary life, when we go to school, the teacher gives us marks. If we fail the examination, then we have to study again and again. In the spiritual life it is not like that. In the spiritual life the tutor privately, and with much affection, teaches us how to stand bravely in front of ignorance and fight ignorance. A private tutor does not give marks; he only teaches the student how to pass the examination. This is what a spiritual Master does.</p>
<p>When I go to school and advance from primary school to high school to college and university, my teachers give me a diploma. But once I have my diploma, I don't remain in the school. No. My professor has helped me in getting knowledge, wisdom; but once I have it, I don't always remain his student. In the spiritual life also, once I realise the highest Truth, at that time I don't have to be under the guidance of a Master.</p>
<p>If I know there is a way to reach my destination sooner than otherwise, then why should I act like a fool? I can come to Boston from New York by plane or by car. By plane if I come, it is a matter of half an hour, or forty-five minutes, whereas by car it takes me five hours. Now, if I can come here in half an hour, then I can do many things. I can have a most significant interview with you; I can hold a meditation in the evening, I can do many things. So time is a great factor. The sooner we can accomplish something, the better for us. God-realisation is our first goal, God-revelation is our second goal, God-manifestation is our third goal. We have three supreme tasks to fulfil. Our first task is still a far cry. So if we have a little wisdom, naturally we will try to run the fastest.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: The opportunity is not open to everyone. Not everyone finds the right teacher.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: The opportunity is not open to everyone. Not everyone finds the right teacher." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No sincere effort will end in failure. If I am sincere and if you are meant to be my teacher, God will bring us together. But again, there are many wrong forces operating in the world, and I may be deceived by somebody who is not meant for me. But this cannot go on forever. After some time, my own inner being will tell me that this Master is not meant for me.</p>
<p>There are many ways to know which Master is meant for me. The person who gives me the greatest joy is my Master, even if he is not someone who has millions of disciples. Many people make a Himalayan blunder. When they see that somebody has thousands and millions of disciples, immediately they think that he has something; otherwise, nobody would have gone to him. But this is absolutely wrong. Yes, he may have many disciples, but that doesn't mean that you have to become his disciple. If you feel inner joy in his presence, if you feel from within that he is the right person, this is what matters. Unfortunately, it usually does not happen like that. People have no sense of discrimination; they don't go deep within. To accept a Master is a most important thing, because it is the Master who guides, moulds and shapes the student in his life of aspiration.</p>
<p>If somebody says that there is a set fee, that if you give him thousands of dollars then God-realisation will come, kindly don't believe him. If God-realisation could be achieved by material wealth, then all the rich people on earth would have realised God. But, unfortunately, it is not like that.</p>
<p>We are in a terrible hurry. If we hear that somebody can give us God-realisation overnight, we go. In the ordinary life, it takes us twenty-two years to get a Master's degree, which represents ordinary human knowledge. So how can we expect to get the highest knowledge, inner knowledge, if we don't study for ten or fifteen or twenty years? Our difficulty is that we want to simplify everything. We want to get everything ready-made, like instant coffee. But it is not like that. How can one get a Master's degree in one day? He goes to kindergarten, high school, college and then one day he gets his Master's degree. But if a kindergarten student feels that he can get his Master's degree today just because his elder brother has got it, then he is just fooling himself. His elder brother has studied hard for twenty years. But then again, there are, unfortunately, some false Masters who tempt the seekers and say that they can give it overnight. Unfortunately, I don't have that capacity.</p>
<p>I take my disciples' spiritual life as a serious matter, a most serious matter. What I can give you will take time, and what you have to offer me, your aspiration, will also take time. Aspiration has to increase little by little. My role is to bring down Compassion from above and this also has to increase little by little. It is like this. On your part you will climb up and on my part I will come down and bring down light. There should be a simultaneous effort by the spiritual Master and the disciple. With his inner cry the disciple goes up, and the Master comes down with the Smile of God. This is the role of the spiritual Master. At this moment he identifies with the seeker and he climbs up with his disciple's inner cry. Then the next moment he comes down with God's Smile. The perfection of the seeker is his cry and the perfection of God is His Smile. When a seeker can cry from the inmost recesses of his heart, this is perfection. And when God smiles with his heart's Delight, this is perfection.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life there should be only one teacher, because spirituality is one subject. It is not like history, geography and science. In school we study different subjects and we need different teachers. But God-realisation is one subject, so we don't need more than one teacher. But if you have studied under the guidance of a teacher and that teacher is unable to take you any farther, then what will you do? History you studied in primary school and you are also studying it in college. The teacher who taught you in primary school was not in a position to teach you in college. So naturally you had to find a different teacher since your first teacher could not take you to the highest course.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the Master is the right one, then the student is bound to feel the truth in the Master's words, because the Master is the disciple's own higher reality. If somebody is my Master, I have to know that my Master is my own illumined reality. He is not a different reality. No! Just because he is my higher, more illumined reality, I have to listen to him. If he is a different person, a different reality, then naturally I won't be able to listen to him all the time and subscribe to his views. This moment he is telling something right, but the next moment he may tell me something totally wrong. But if he is my reality, which is infinitely more illumined, then how can he be different from me? And it won't be difficult for me to listen to my highest reality.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What you are saying right now does not apply. There was a time when the West did not feel the need of a teacher. But now the West does. Now you see the Indian Masters are coming and many people go to them to get inner instruction. There was a time when the West felt that it was beneath its dignity to listen to Eastern philosophy. But right now Eastern philosophy is not only accepted but embraced by the Western world.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I was twelve years old, I realised God. Actually this realisation took place in a previous incarnation, but it took me twelve years to revive and assimilate my inner powers in this incarnation. The inner book that I studied I knew well, but in this incarnation I had to revise it. To revise the book it took me about twenty years. I lived in an ashram in south India from the age of twelve to thirty two.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Then I came to America. I did not have the vaguest thought of coming to the West, but my Inner Pilot commanded me to come here to be of service. I was brought up in a very small place in India and from there I was thrown into New York, the capital of the world, let us say. From where to where!</p>
<p>So again, it was my obedience that brought me here. I listened to the dictates of the Inner Pilot. Tomorrow if He tells me to go to some other place and be of service to Him there, I will gladly go, because for a God-lover there is no specific home. Wherever he is needed, wherever he is wanted, wherever he is commanded by the Supreme to go, there he has to be.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have written considerably, That is to say, the Supreme in me has written about 240 books. Whether they are worth reading or not, God alone knows. But as I said, I am the instrument; He is writing in and through me. I just entered into the art world. Very recently I completed ten thousand paintings in three months' time. But if I say that I did it, then I am telling the worst possible lie. The Supreme in me is doing it. And according to my receptivity, I am offering Him the opportunity to act in and through me.</p>
<p>It is just like sunlight. I can leave my windows and doors open and, again, I can keep all my doors and windows shut. If I allow the sunlight to enter into my room, then my room will be illumined. If I don't allow it, then my room will be all darkness. It is the divine Grace that is operating.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the greatest thing we can do for our children?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the greatest thing we can do for our children?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here in the West, there is a kind of freedom that I do not endorse. Some parents say that America is the land of freedom and they give their children the freedom to find out for themselves what is best for them. I tell you, this policy has ruined thousands and millions of young children. In the formative years, when children are being brought up, parents should always tell the children what is best for them.</p>
<p>Parents say, "Let them grow up. When they get older they will see for themselves what is best for them." This is what many parents have done in America and they have lost their children. When the child comes into existence I know the child needs milk. I feed the child milk. I do not say, "Let the child drink milk or water, whichever he prefers, and when he gets older he will realise that milk is better for him." By that time he will have left the world. So what I know is best I will give. Let the child drink milk until he is ten or twelve years old and then, if he does not like milk, I shall let him drink something else.</p>
<p>If I know that the best thing for me to do early in the morning is to pray, I will encourage my child to do this. But if I say, "No, I have come to this realisation at the age of forty, so let my son also wait until he is ready," then I am making a deplorable mistake. For forty years I did not accept the spiritual life but wallowed in life's ignorance. How much I suffered and how much suffering I caused for my dear ones! But now I know that the spiritual life is the answer. So when I have the child in front of me, I will inspire him to pray and meditate. The thing that I feel is best I will tell my child. Then, when he grows up, if he feels that what I have said is not the right thing for him, then he can accept something else. But I shall guide him along the road I have discovered to be right until he is old enough to choose his own road.</p>
<p>In the beginning, if the child is not instructed, if the child is not taught, how will the child learn? The child cannot be left to learn in his own way. The lesson has to be given right from the beginning. I know a truth which I will tell my children. Later, if they discover that there is a higher truth or that the truth I have taught them is wrong, then let them reject it. But unfortunately, it is not happening this way in the West. Here I see thousands of children who have been misguided by their parents in the name of freedom.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: At what age can you get a child to start meditating?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: At what age can you get a child to start meditating?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Anytime, at the age of six months, even. Perhaps the child cannot utter a word, but if you are Christian, you can show him a picture of the Christ or something beautiful. God is expressing Himself through beauty. A child can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At that time, the flower itself is God for the child. Then, when the child can speak, let him say, 'God' a few times as his prayer. As he advances in years, he can be taught higher meditations. We give our children the only real freedom when we give them the truth, the reality. Real freedom is not just to go and strike someone and move around like a vagabond. No. Real freedom is not to do anything we like. Real freedom is to do everything the way God wants us to do it. That is our freedom. God is all-Light, all-Freedom, and if we listen to Him, only then do we enjoy freedom.</p>
