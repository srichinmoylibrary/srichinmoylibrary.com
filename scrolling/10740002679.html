<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If hope is just a mere wish, if it is just like making friends with fantasy, then consciousness will not respond to it. But if it is something significant, like a vision that is trying to blossom inside the heart of an individual, then consciousness will be elevated. If it is real hope and not mere fantasy or false hope, then there is every possibility that the consciousness-flower will blossom petal by petal with its nourishment.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Someone new to meditation can easily tell whether his consciousness is rising, steady or falling. If he feels purity inside his heart, inside his entire being, then his consciousness is steady. If he feels sincerity, then his consciousness is rising. But if he becomes a victim to doubt concerning what he is feeling or observing, then his consciousness is falling.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, not necessarily. Because the child does not have a developed mind, the loving consciousness of nature’s spontaneous beauty can be seen in him. We love the child because of his loving and loveable consciousness, but that does not mean this consciousness is very high.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, a parent can and must guide a child to a higher consciousness; otherwise what is the use of bringing children into the field of creativity from God? It is deplorable when parents do not want to take the due responsibility to guide, mould and shape the child here on earth for God-realisation and God-manifestation. When it is God’s Will for the parents to bring children into the world, they must feel that this kind of guidance is their very purpose as parents.</p>

Are we affected in the same way when we must take vitamins containing animal by-products?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I maintain the conviction that animal consciousness enters into us when we eat meat. But we have to know that vitamins do not have the same animal consciousness. We can see that when an animal is butchered and cooked fresh the animal consciousness remains in a most powerful manner. But when it goes through all the chemical processes to make vitamin pills it loses considerably its strangling animal quality. The animal power still remains to some extent, but it will not affect the consciousness the way eating meat will.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we are threatened by negative forces we have to feel that we have the strongest friend within us, and that friend is the soul. Let us take shelter under the wings of the soul. Let us invoke the soul and pray for its guidance. And if we call on this friend, naturally he will fight against the negative forces on our behalf; the soul will save us, protect us, illumine us and perfect us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Consciousness is a tiny seed. Oneness is a tree. In due course the seed germinates and gradually becomes a huge banyan tree. Consciousness can be personal and individual. Consciousness can be egocentric. But once oneness is established in our aspiring consciousness on any plane of existence, then the seeker starts tasting the delight of freedom from his earth-bound life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It does and again it does not. If you discovered that you were a thief in your previous incarnation, you would be horrified. You would not be inspired at all. You would think, “Oh, I was a thief; I was stealing all the time. In this incarnation it is simply useless for me to aspire.” And if you discovered that you were a great saint in a previous incarnation, then you would blame yourself. You would think, “Oh, I was a saint in my previous incarnation and in this incarnation I have done so many undivine things; it is a hopeless case. In this life, spirituality is not meant for me.” You would be doomed to disappointment and again you would not aspire. If you discovered that you were bad, you would be disturbed, and if you discovered that you were extremely good you would also be disturbed when you compared your past to your present state.</p>
<p>But suppose you discovered that in your past incarnation you began your spiritual life but were not sincere or serious enough, or that you were afraid to dive totally into the spiritual life or make a total commitment to a spiritual Master. Since in this incarnation you have made a total commitment, you are making progress. In your last incarnation you were on the first rung of the spiritual ladder and in this incarnation you have climbed up quite a few rungs. This would give you tremendous inspiration and this time you would think, “Oh, I have climbed up quite a few steps, now only a few more remain; let me try.” In this case, it is a great advantage when you come to know what you were, what you are now becoming and what you will eventually be.</p>
<p>If you see a gradual progress in your inner life, then it is a great blessing. But if you don’t notice this inner progress you will be miserable. So the best thing is to pray and meditate. If it is God’s Will, He will show you your gradual inner progress. If it is not God’s Will, you must wait for the moment when you become totally divine and perfect. Otherwise the past may create unnecessary problems for you.</p>
