<p>A spiritual man arrived at his destination and started to come out of a taxi. He already had given his money to the driver while he was inside. As he was getting out of the taxi, one of his shoes somehow got stuck in the door of the taxi. Then what happened? The taxi driver drove away taking the man's shoe with him. At this, the man calmly took off his other shoe and left it on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>His friend said, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>The spiritual man answered, "What am I doing? You fool, do you not know that in this world there are so many poor people. If a poor person finds only the shoe that was stuck in the taxi, how will he be able to use it? But if he finds both my shoes, he will be so happy. The person will thank God that he now has a pair of shoes. In my case, I will be able to buy new shoes.</p>
<p>"When you want to help people, never hold back. Always be a wholehearted giver."</p>

<p>A man from Texas came to New York to visit his friend. His friend took him to so many important places.</p>
<p>When his friend showed him anything new, the Texan said, "We have better than that at home — far, far better."</p>
<p>First his friend took him to an excellent restaurant. The Texan said, "In Texas we have better restaurants than this. The owners are better, the waiters give better service and the food is far better in Texas."</p>
<p>Then the New Yorker took his Texan friend to visit the Statue of Liberty. The Texan said, "The Statue of Liberty has so many defects. I can see that it is cracked here and there. We have so many statues that are not cracked at all."</p>
<p>Finally, the friend took the Texan to the Empire State Building. The man declared, "The Empire State Building is useless! Because there are so many businesses inside, it has no peace, no glory. True, it is tall, but inside there is no beauty at all."</p>
<p>The man's New York friend got so disgusted. He said, "Brother, you need something that is not here. Your Texas is far more beautiful and far better in every way than my New York. If ever you think of coming to New York again, please do not stay at my place. Go visit somebody else. I have nothing to give you.</p>
<p>"Better yet, go to some other state, because New York has nothing to give you. If you feel that there is another state that can equal your Texas, or another state that has something better or more significant to offer you, then go there. Please, do not come back to New York!"</p>
<p>People who live in the mind always criticise. They feel that they are superior. Here, the man from Texas was full of criticism. His friend was showing him New York's most famous landmarks with such love, care, concern and joy. But the Texan was not satisfied, because he was inside his dry mind. Nothing in New York could give him joy. His rigid mind had the idea that everything was better, more beautiful and more significant in Texas.</p>
<p>People who live in the mind cannot appreciate others' achievements. They cannot become one with others' ways. If we are in the heart, then we can appreciate equally what we ourselves have and what others have.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Even God Cannot Enter The Church</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Even God Cannot Enter The Church" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A policeman was guarding the church in a very special way. Only very rich people or very well-educated people were allowed to go inside. Others were turned away. The priest would interview each new person who wanted to enter the church to be certain that they were qualified to go inside.</p>
<p>One day an ordinary man came there and spoke to the priest. The priest asked, "Are you rich?"</p>
<p>"No," answered the man.</p>
<p>"Are you well-educated?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then this is not the place for you. You have to go away. You have to be either very rich or very well-educated to enter into our church."</p>
<p>The next day the man borrowed quite a lot of money. A few days later, he came back to the church.</p>
<p>The priest asked him, "Do you qualify? Are you either rich or well-educated?"</p>
<p>The man replied, "How can I be well-educated in just a few days time? But because I borrowed a lot of money, I am now quite rich." The man showed the priest all his money.</p>
<p>"You have borrowed money and now you say you are rich," said the priest. "But this is not enough."</p>
<p>The man said, "I do not believe it! Here I have thousands of dollars and still you will not allow me to go in?"</p>
<p>The priest answered, "I am sorry, no. By the way, tell me what you did to get this money. Did you pray to God to be able to borrow the money?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I did."</p>
<p>"What did the Almighty say?" asked the priest.</p>
<p>The man replied, "The Almighty told me that even though I was bringing so much money to show you, you might not allow me to enter. The Almighty also said something more. He said, 'I have been trying to enter that church for forty-five years, and I have never been allowed in.'</p>
<p>"I was so shocked. I asked, 'How can You not be allowed in?'</p>
<p>"The Almighty explained to me, 'I am neither rich nor well-educated, so they do not allow me to enter the church. Do not be surprised if they do not allow you to enter either. You have no money of your own, plus you are not well-educated.'"</p>
<p>Alas, even God was not allowed to enter the church, His own rightful Home.</p>

<p>A watchman was guarding a church, when a man who was not properly dressed came by. He wanted to enter the church.</p>
<p>The guard stopped the man and asked, "What are you doing here? You are so dirty and filthy!"</p>
<p>The man answered, "I am not coming to pray. I am here to clean the church."</p>
<p>"All right, you can go in to clean. But remember, you are only allowed to clean the church and then you must come out. You are not allowed to pray!"</p>
<p>The man went inside the church and did all his cleaning. As he was coming out, God came up to him and said, "My son, can you not do Me a big favour? Can you not pray here? All these people inside the church are fast asleep. I feel so sad and miserable. These people came here to pray to Me, and now they are in deep slumber. Can you please pray now?"</p>
<p>The man immediately started praying. The guard noticed that it was taking the man a long time to do his work. When the guard found the man, he saw that the man was praying. "I told you that you are not allowed to pray here!" the guard screamed at the man. "You are only allowed to clean the church."</p>
<p>The man replied, "What am I going to do? I finished cleaning the church and sincerely wanted to leave, but God stopped me. Since all the people who were supposed to be praying were asleep, God begged me to pray. What could I do?"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Favourite Son Inherits A Crucifix</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Favourite Son Inherits A Crucifix" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>An old father was very, very kind. He had four sons. Before leaving the body, he wanted to show all his loving kindness to his sons. To one son, he gave his house. When the father would die, that son would inherit the house. To another son, he gave lots of money. To the third son, the father gave property. Finally, to his fourth child, he said, "Son, I love you the most. I am giving you a crucifix." A short time later, the father died.</p>
<p>After his father's death, the fourth son said, "What is this? One of my brothers got the big house, one got money, and one got property. Father is so bad! He told me that he loves me the most and that is why he gave me a crucifix! What is this — a cruel joke? Father is so bad! I am not going to his funeral! He has really fooled me! He liked me the most, so he gave me a silly crucifix. Yet to each of my brothers he has given something so valuable!"</p>
<p>The fourth son did not even go to his father's funeral. Everyone was unhappy that this son was so ungrateful. He only said over and over, "My father is so mean and so unjust!"</p>
<p>For two weeks, the son's anger was increasing and increasing day by day. He said, "Such a bad father I had! He made fun of me right before he died! I will never even think of him."</p>
<p>The son became more and more furious. He decided to throw the crucifix away. "I will have absolutely nothing to do with this crucifix! I hate my father!"</p>
<p>The son took the crucifix and threw it very hard against the ground. The crucifix broke into many pieces. Immediately shining jewels and most expensive stones fell out. They had been hidden inside the crucifix. These jewels and stones were far more valuable than the money, the house and the property that the other brothers inherited. With these jewels, the son was able to buy many expensive things.</p>
<p>The fourth son finally learned to have faith in his father. Before, he was telling the whole world that his dying father was playing a cruel joke on him. But the son learnt that his father did not lie. His father really claimed him as his nearest and dearest son.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Four Drunkards At The Railway Station</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Four Drunkards At The Railway Station" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There were hundreds of people at the railway station. A train had just arrived and most of the people were entering into the train. There were four drunkards standing nearby. Unfortunately, they did not have any idea what to do. One kind-hearted station worker was so concerned. He grabbed the drunkards, one by one, and threw them into the train. With great difficulty — one, two, three — the worker threw each of them into a car. Unfortunately, it was too late for him to throw the fourth man into the train, as it was going very fast by then. The kind-hearted man was satisfied that at least he was able to be of service to three of the drunkards. But he felt extremely sorry that he could not throw the fourth drunkard into the train.</p>
<p>The remaining man was lying down on the ground. After about one-half hour, the railway stationmaster came and saw the drunk man's condition. He felt sorry for him and said, "Tonight there are no more trains. Since you are just lying on the cement, please come with me if you want to take a little rest. There is a tiny room in here. You can rest in our room."</p>
<p>By this time, the drunkard had come to his senses. He said, "What is happening? What have I done?"</p>
<p>The station master asked, "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>The man said, "Can you imagine? I was supposed to go somewhere on that train, and my three friends came to see me off! Now my friends have gone away, and I am left here alone!"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Chittagong&#039;s Greatest Revolutionary Hero: Surjya Sen</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chittagong&#039;s Greatest Revolutionary Hero: Surjya Sen" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Chittagong produced a great many revolutionaries who fought to throw the British rulers out of India. The revolutionaries of Chittagong embraced death happily and proudly while singing <em>Bande mataram,</em> "Mother, I bow to Thee." They were uttering the sacred heart-offering, <em>Bande mataram,</em> invoking Mother India's name.</p>
<p>These revolutionaries had quite a few leaders, but their main leader was Surjya Sen. Everybody had such love, admiration and adoration for him. The entire city of Chittagong loved him unreservedly. His very name gave them immense joy and courage. In earlier years, he had been a school teacher; but he gave up teaching and entered into the revolution. In the vortex of the revolution, Surjya Sen was the most prominent.</p>
<p>Surjya Sen happened to be a distant relative of my Mother's younger sister's relatives. A few times he came to my Mother's sister's place to hide. The last time I was in India, I went to see her. She left Mother Earth at the ripe old age of 103.</p>
<p>The British Government was always in search of Surjya Sen. They wanted to arrest him and kill him. But secretly he used to go from one village to another and instruct his people about what to do. These revolutionaries did many, many heroic things. From the British Armoury, they stole arms to fight against the British. It is a long story. They were extremely strong and extremely courageous. Their love for Mother India was unparalleled, and their actions were in the vanguard of the sacrifices of the revolutionaries.</p>
<p>They used to call Surjya Sen <em>Mashtar-da</em> — Mashtar means 'teacher' and <em>da</em> is for the affectionate respect for the elder brothers of the family and also for those who are older. Everybody knew Mashtar-da. Even West Bengalis knew him so well.</p>
<p>The British Government offered a 50,000 pound reward for anyone who could give them information leading to the arrest of Mashtar-da. He had a relative named Netra Sen. This Netra Sen also was a revolutionary under Surjya Sen. When Netra Sen heard that he could get 50,000 pounds, tremendous greed entered into him. Along with other revolutionaries, Netra Sen knew where Surjya Sen was hiding.</p>
<p>Alas, Judas is everywhere. For 30 pieces of silver, Judas betrayed Jesus and told the authorities where to find Jesus. Then they gave him the money. After Jesus was captured and crucified, Judas committed suicide.</p>
<p>Netra Sen told the British Government where Surjya Sen would be found, and the great leader supreme was arrested. Where was he going to be found? In Netra Sen's own house! Because they were so close, Netra Sen invited Surjya Sen to come and eat with him. Can you imagine? They lived only three or four miles away from each other.</p>
<p>The British soldiers came while Netra Sen's wife was serving food. The wife was also a revolutionary, and she was extremely, extremely fond of Surjya Sen. All the men and women loved and treasured Mashtar-da in the very depths of their hearts. He was their unparalleled Hero.</p>
<p>Surjya Sen and Netra Sen were both eating. The wife was serving them food and she knew nothing about her husband's treachery. The British soldiers knew that they could easily arrest Surjya Sen while he was eating, so they chose that moment to come and arrest him. They put him in the Chittagong Jail. Even before Surjya Sen was arrested, they gave Netra Sen his money.</p>
<p>The wife became furious. She cried and cried. Other revolutionaries came to her place, and they were cursing her husband. They knew that Netra Sen had betrayed Mashtar-da.</p>
<p>The wife said to their friends, who were all revolutionaries, "Please, please do me a big favour."</p>
<p>"What is the favour?" they asked.</p>
<p>"I am telling you, you must do me this favour!"</p>
<p>"We will do any favour you ask of us," the friends replied.</p>
<p>"Now we have lost Mashtar-da. But I want to punish my husband." She added, "Tell me, who is going to fulfil my only desire?"</p>
<p>They said, "Whatever you say, we shall gladly and immediately do."</p>
<p>The wife said, "I want my husband to be killed while I am serving him food. I shall tell you at what time we eat in the evening. If you people really love your Motherland, then I want one of you to cut my husband's throat while I am serving him dinner."</p>
<p>"You will not feel sad and miserable? Your own husband will be killed right in front of you!"</p>
<p>"No! No! Our Mashtar-da was arrested because my husband wanted the money. I do not even know where he has hidden it. Even if I found the money in my house, I would just throw it away."</p>
<p>All the revolutionaries were extremely devoted to Mashtar-da. Those who were listening to Netra Sen's wife were disgusted and sad, because Surjya Sen had been betrayed by Netra Sen, her husband. The British even set a date when he would be hanged. First there would be a court hearing and other proceedings. Surjya Sen himself was completely shocked when he heard what Netra Sen had done.</p>
<p>"I do not want to live with my husband," the wife cried. "I do not want even to look at him! My husband happened to be a revolutionary! Now he has cast a slur on all the revolutionaries. This is what money can do." She begged the revolutionaries to kill her husband. She said that she would not tell her husband what was going to happen to him.</p>
<p>In a few days time, while Netra Sen's wife was serving him dinner and he was eating, one of the revolutionaries came and cut Netra Sen's throat. He died immediately. Netra Sen was assassinated by one of the revolutionaries at the request of his own wife!</p>
<p>When the police came, they demanded that Netra Sen's wife tell them the name of the person who killed her husband. "You have to tell us!" they said.</p>
<p>She answered, "No! You can kill me. I will not tell you. I do know who the person is. I know, I know. But I will not tell you. If you want to arrest me, arrest me. If you want to kill me, kill me. I am ready. I can't have a husband who has betrayed our beloved Mashtar-da."</p>
<p>The police could do nothing. The wife was not crying at all for her husband. When Mashtar-da was arrested, she was crying so bitterly and was filled with grief. She kept saying, "How could my husband do this to our Hero supreme, our beloved Leader, Mashtar-da!"</p>
<p>The police demanded, "You have to tell us!"</p>
<p>When the police demanded, "You have to tell us," she said, "No! Do anything you want. I am not going to tell you the name of the person. I know the person very well, because I myself made the request."</p>
<p>This story is one hundred per cent authentic. The wife lived for many more years, serving the revolutionaries most devotedly and most faithfully. Women like Netra Sen's wife did not even go outside of their homes, but they made such significant contributions to the revolution!</p>
<p>This incident took place around 1932, when I was one year old. It shows how much people can love their Motherland. For India's freedom and independence, they revolted. As other places in India revolted, Chittagong also revolted and Chittagong's supreme leader was Surjya Sen.</p>
<p>On January 12th, 1934, before the sun rose, Surjya Sen was hanged. The evening before he was hanged, he sent a farewell message to his followers from the Chittagong Jail. He wrote:</p>
<p>"Rope is hanging over my head. Death is knocking at my door. At such a solemn moment, what shall I leave behind for you? Only one thing — that is my dream, a golden dream — a dream of Free India. If you die before the goal is reached, then give the charge of your further pursuit to your followers, as I do today. Onward my Comrades, onward — never fall back. The day of bondage is disappearing and the dawn of freedom will be ushered in. Be up and doing. Never be disappointed. Success is sure. God bless you."</p>
<p>Netra Sen's wife went to to the place where Surjya Sen was to be hanged. Just before he died, Surjya Sen blessed her and said, "I am not the hero. You are the hero. I am not the real leader. You are the real leader. The sacrifices that you have made for Mother India have made you the real leader of Chittagong's revolution for our liberation."</p>
<p>As he was dying, Surjya Sen was only saying over and over, " <em>Bande mataram! Bande mataram! Bande mataram!"</em> Mother, I bow to Thee....</p>
<p>All around him, people were shedding tears. Surjya Sen asked, "Why, why, why? Why are you doing this? I am bowing to my Mother. If they arrest you, I want all of you to say, 'Mother, Mother, Mother — for you, for Mother India, for Chittagong, I embrace death.' By invoking the Mother, I am embracing death. Indeed, there is no death for a revolutionary. My love of my Motherland is infinitely stronger than death. <em>Janani Janma Bhoomischa Swargaadapi Gariyasi.</em> " Mother and Motherland are superior to Heaven itself.</p>
<p>Once more he chanted, "Bande mataram! Bande mataram! Bande mataram!" Then he passed behind the curtain of Eternity to be in the galaxy of the immortals.</p>

<p>For a couple of weeks, it had been very, very hot. People were suffering so much. Members of the local church were all praying and praying for rain. After they had been praying for about a week, during a meeting of the entire congregation, the priest said, "You have to pray very hard for rain. If you pray sincerely, rest assured that it will rain."</p>
<p>The people continued praying most sincerely, but still there was no rain. Finally they got angry with the priest and said to him, "We have been praying and praying sincerely, but still there is no rain. That means you are wrong!"</p>
<p>The priest replied, "No, I am not wrong! You people are wrong!"</p>
<p>The people argued, "How can it be that we are wrong?"</p>
<p>The priest said, "Look here! You are praying to God for rain. Do you have any faith in your prayers? You should have brought your umbrellas. If God fulfils your prayers right now and if it starts raining heavily, then what will you do? You will all be soaked and you will suffer miserably. How can God protect you and fulfil your prayers at the same time? Where is your faith in your prayers?"</p>
<p>After that, the people all brought umbrellas.</p>

<p>A priest had a driver who was very, very devoted to him in every way. The man used to drive the priest everywhere and also serve him in many other ways. The priest was always very pleased with the driver, and they became very close to each other.</p>
<p>When the driver was only 25 years old, all of a sudden he developed severe chest pain. The priest took his driver to the hospital to see what was wrong. Such terrible pain he had! The doctors discovered that the young man had a terminal case of cancer.</p>
<p>The priest felt miserable. He fervently requested all the members of his congregation,"Please, please pray for my driver."</p>
<p>They all said, "Yes! We shall pray. We shall definitely pray for him."</p>
<p>The priest added, "He is such a good driver! He does everything for me." Then he said, "If he does not survive, I will give him a very good funeral and do all kinds of things in his memory. He has been so devoted to me." The members of the congregation all started praying very sincerely.</p>
<p>Every day the priest would go to the hospital to see his driver. One day he went there and the driver was suddenly and completely cured. Then the priest got another surprise. The driver and his nurse, who was very beautiful, had fallen totally in love with each other!</p>
<p>The priest said, "You two are in love! I am so happy. Would you like to get married?"</p>
<p>Both of them were thrilled! The priest said, "I will pay for your wedding." The priest paid for all the costs of the wedding and lovingly officiated at the marriage ceremony as well. The driver started serving the priest again with utmost care and devotion. In time, the driver and his wife had children. Always the priest was giving them money and taking care of them.</p>
<p>One day the priest said to his driver, "I am so grateful to you. How lovingly and self-givingly you have been serving me for so many years! I am also so happy for you. God definitely answers our prayers. We prayed to Him to save your life. Miraculously, God saved your life. What is more, He has given you a wonderful wife and sweeter than the sweetest children. I am so happy and proud that I made the suggestion for you and your wife to get married. Now you and your family are so happy."</p>
<p>The driver said to the priest: "Father, today I have changed my name. My new name is GRATITUDE."</p>
<p>God listens to our prayers. Indeed, out of His infinite Love and Compassion, God grants us far more than what we ask for.</p>

<p>An old lady came to listen to the priest's sermon during the morning service. The priest was saying such nice things, and all the people were listening to him very devotedly. They were all deeply appreciating his sermon.</p>
<p>As he was speaking, the priest saw that the old lady was crying bitterly. He stopped the sermon and came up to her. With sincere concern and compassion, he asked, "What has happened? Why are you crying? Have you lost your husband? Have you lost your son or daughter? Why are you so grief- stricken?"</p>
<p>The lady answered, "I have not lost anyone. But I cannot tell you why I am crying."</p>
<p>The priest said, "Why can you not tell me? I am the priest here. So many people will sympathise with you if I tell them why you are suffering and ask them to pray for you. You need consolation, so we shall all pray for you. If you do not want to say what calamity has taken place, I fully understand. In any case, we shall pray for you right now."</p>
<p>The priest said, "Let us all pray for this old lady." They started praying most soulfully for her.</p>
<p>While they were in the midst of their prayers, the old lady asked, "May I tell you why I have been crying and crying?"</p>
<p>The priest answered, "Certainly. Please tell us."</p>
<p>The lady said, "My son is studying to become a priest. When I heard you delivering your sermon, I got the shock of my life. You are giving us such an uninspiring sermon. If my son does not preach better than you, then I am wasting all my precious money on him! That is why I am crying! I pray to God that my son becomes a better preacher than you!"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Medical Emergency</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Medical Emergency" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In the middle of the night, a hospital doctor phoned up his doctor-friend at home. The doctor who was at home knew that there had to be a very serious medical problem for him to be called at that hour.</p>
<p>The hospital doctor said, "Please come right away! Two priests and I are at a bar now, and we desperately need one more person to play cards with us."</p>
<p>The doctor said to his wife, who heard him speaking to the other physician, "My friend is telling me that there is an emergency. I have to go immediately. Two priests are already there to administer the last rites."</p>
<p>The wife said, "Go, go, go!"</p>
<p>Instead of going to the hospital, the doctor went to the bar to play cards. Day began to break, and still he had not returned. His wife had become extremely worried. She said, "Why is my husband not coming home? Is the case so serious?"</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the wife phoned the hospital. A colleague of her husband answered. He was not one of the culprits; he was actually working. The wife started crying when the other doctor answered. He asked her, "Why are you crying?"</p>
<p>The wife replied, "I am crying and crying because my husband has such a good heart. In the middle of the night, he got a call from his colleague saying that a patient was in very serious condition. Two priests were already there to give the last rites. By now I am sure the patient has passed away. My husband is probably consoling the relatives at this moment. Can you try to trace where my husband has gone?"</p>
<p>The doctor said, "What? What are you saying? I have been here since last night, as I was the doctor in charge. There was no emergency at all."</p>
<p>When her husband finally came home later in the morning, the wife asked, "How is the patient?"</p>
<p>The husband sadly moaned, "Oh, he passed away; he passed away!"</p>
<p>"He passed away?" the wife said. "The priests' prayers could not do anything? You and your friend could not do anything? Have you been to the funeral yet? How can you come back so soon from the funeral?" the wife asked.</p>
<p>"The funeral will take place in a few days," answered the husband.</p>
<p>The wife said, "All right! I am waiting for your funeral, your friend's funeral and the two priests' funerals. You go and join the patient! I shall gladly attend all of your funerals."</p>

<p>The teacher in a classroom once asked a question: "Where is God?"</p>
<p>The children were giving their answers. Many said, "God is in Heaven."</p>
<p>Some of the children added, "God is not only in Heaven, but also on earth. God is everywhere."</p>
<p>One boy said, "God cannot be everywhere. My father has told me, 'God is just like us. He is a man, and He is full of love.' If God is like us, then He can only be in Heaven. He cannot be in both places at the same time."</p>
<p>The argument went on and on. Some said, "God is in Heaven." Others firmly replied, "God is also on earth."</p>
<p>To end the discussion, the teacher said, "Tonight ask your parents, and let your parents say where God is. Please ask them if God can be both in Heaven and on earth."</p>
<p>One student, whose father was a scientist, came back to class the following day and said, "I asked my father. My father said, 'God is in Heaven, and He also has an office inside the church. God needs a representative on earth, so that is why He has an office here. For years and years, God has been searching for a good priest who is capable of taking care of His office and representing Him. But poor God is not yet successful.' That is why my father says that God lives in Heaven, but His office on earth is unattended."</p>

<p>A young maidservant came regularly to clean the house of an old man. One day, the young lady was crying and crying.</p>
<p>The old man said, "Why are you crying? I will gladly give you money, if that is what you need."</p>
<p>"I do not need money. I am upset because I am so vain. Since I feel I am very beautiful, every day I look at myself in the mirror. I appreciate my beauty and adore myself. This is not good at all!"</p>
<p>The old man said, "Please do not worry!"</p>
<p>"But I know that it is a sin to appreciate one's beauty excessively. I spend so much time looking in the mirror. I look at my eyes, my hair and everything. How beautiful I am! But it is such a sin to be as vain as I am."</p>
<p>The old man replied, "No, no! It is not a sin. It is only a mistake. Just do not make the same mistake again."</p>
<p>The maidservant said, "I cannot get out of this habit. Every day I have to spend so much time appreciating my limbs, hair, nose, ears, eyes — everything. What can I do?"</p>
<p>The old man offered his advice. "You know that I am an old man. I have lost all my hair, and I am not at all beautiful. In a few years, I shall die. I am so old! You love me so much, and I love you so much. What you can do is, when you look in the mirror, immediately think of me. Imagine that my face is on the other side. Imagine my face with wrinkles everywhere. See my bald head and think of my eyes and my face."</p>
<p>She said, "I have such love and admiration for you. You are my boss. You know how much I love and adore you. How can I do that?"</p>
<p>"No, you can do it. If you think of me with all your love, you will be able to see me in the mirror and not yourself."</p>
<p>The maidservant said, "I simply cannot do it."</p>
<p>The old man said, "All right. Do not listen to me. Go and appreciate your beauty for hours. What I do not understand is how you can come on time every day."</p>
<p>"Every morning I get up very early so I will have plenty of time to look in the mirror and see just how beautiful I am; then I come to your house. Every day I have been committing so many sins!"</p>
<p>Her boss said, "I already told you that this is just a mistake. Do not worry about it. If you really want to solve your problem, then do exactly what I have suggested."</p>
<p>She said, "All right. Tomorrow I shall try."</p>
<p>The following morning, the maidservant looked in the mirror and thought of her boss. Then she saw an old face, with wrinkled skin and no hair. She said to herself, "This is terrible! I do not want to see this!"</p>
<p>When she got to work, the maidservant said, "Boss! Boss! You have saved me! Today I did not spend any time in front of the mirror. On other days I usually spend at least half an hour appreciating my beauty. Today, as soon as I looked in the mirror, I was able to see you. Then I lost all my inspiration to look in the mirror. While we are here together, I see how kind, compassionate and loving you are. But while I was looking in the mirror, I did not like what I saw at all!"</p>
<p>The boss said, "I am so happy. I have given you the medicine. Every day, when you look in the mirror, I will solve your problem. You will see me there — just how ugly I am — and you will not have to waste your precious time. You will definitely be able to fully overcome your vanity."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Loving God And The Stolen Mangoes</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Loving God And The Stolen Mangoes" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once there was a priest who had an orchard on his land. He had many trees bearing all kinds of fruits. The priest liked one particular tree very much, a mango tree. He used to give away mangoes to all his friends, and everyone felt that he was extremely kind-hearted.</p>
<p>Some mischievous boys had started stealing the ripe mangoes, and this made the priest so sad. One day he put a large note on the tree in bold letters: "The loving God sees everything." He thought that from then on his problem would be solved. The culprits would realise that God was watching them steal and then they would stop. The priest was certain that the following day all his ripe mangoes would still be there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the next day as on previous days, the boys again stole all the ripe mangoes. The priest could see from a distance that all his ripe mangoes were gone. He was so miserable. Then he came very close to the tree. Where he had previously written, "The loving God sees everything," the priest saw that underneath someone had written: "The loving God does not punish anybody."</p>

<p>There was once a very, very old man who was extremely poor. He could not find work as, at that time, there was a serious problem with unemployment. Even young people could not find jobs. Who would give a job to an old man?</p>
<p>He said to himself, "I am unemployed and have only one dollar left." Then he heard that somebody had a job for an old man — to be a gatekeeper. The person said that only an old man would be hired for this job and that the person would have to do next to nothing. It was the perfect job for an old man. The old man was so hopeful.</p>
<p>At that moment, a beggar came by and asked the old man for some money. The old man thought, "Tomorrow I have to look for a job. But now this beggar is here. What am I going to do?"</p>
<p>The old man could see from the beggar's face and eyes that he was famished. The old man thought, "All right. What can I do?" He gave half his dollar to the beggar saying, "Let us share equally. I am giving you half of my money, and I am keeping the other half."</p>
<p>The gatekeeper job that the old man was applying for was quite far from his house, so he took the bus. He thought he could ride the bus all the way there. Alas, the old man had gone only half-way, when the bus driver said, "Your ride is over here. Now you have to get off, because you only paid fifty cents." He had no more money, because he had given the beggar fifty cents the day before.</p>
<p>The old man started walking and walking. The place was still quite far away. His mind was saying, "Why did I give away my money to the beggar?" But his heart was very happy saying, "With my little money, just fifty cents, perhaps the beggar was able to get a sandwich." The mind said he did the wrong thing and heart said he did the right thing. A very nice argument was going on between the old man's mind and heart.</p>
<p>Just then, a middle-aged man approached the old man and said, "You are so old and so tired. What are you doing? You seem so exhausted; why are you walking? Please come and rest inside my house."</p>
<p>The old man said, "No. No. I have to go. I am looking for a job. Somebody told me that there is a gatekeeper job and they are looking for an old person to do it. That is why I am going there. I have such a long way still to go."</p>
<p>The other man said, "No! You do not have to go anywhere else. Come to my house. I will give you a job. But first, please eat. Every day you will come to my house and you will do a very simple job. By the way, where do you live?"</p>
<p>"I live quite far away from here."</p>
<p>"Do you have any relatives?"</p>
<p>"No, I do not have any relatives."</p>
<p>"Then my house is yours. You stay here. You are free to do whatever you want to do. You become the boss and keep the house clean in your own way. I have a big family, and I am taking you as our grandfather."</p>
<p>The old man said to his new boss, "Yesterday I gave fifty cents to a very poor man. I showed just a little kindness to a poor beggar. Today you have given me the whole world. You are inundating me with a sea of kindness, affection and love."</p>
