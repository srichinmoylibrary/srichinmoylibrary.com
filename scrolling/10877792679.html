<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some of the boys and girls don't follow basic hygiene. Sometimes when I go to you while you are sleeping, when I go to show you compassion in the inner world, I literally hate myself for doing it. I see that you people are dirty, filthy. Some of you don't take the trouble of washing your face or brushing your teeth even. So how are you going to accept God-sleep, sound sleep? Then, if you are unclean and you perspire while sleeping, the impure vital becomes much stronger, because the physical uncleanliness adds to the inner impurity.</p>
<p>You people don't realise how much I suffer. Naturally, I go to you out of compassion and gratitude to give you a blessing. "Let me give him something in the soul's world," I say. But when I see the physical, I die. The physical is like the door. If the door is filthy, dirty, how can I enter into the room without touching it? And if I don't enter into the house, how am I going to see the beautiful soul inside? So I open that filthy door.</p>
<p>Many times I do things for you while you are sleeping. Sometimes, at night, there are quite a few serious problems waiting for me, just lined up. And I have to enter into your dark, lowest vital. But what can I do? Many times I have to deal with the disciples' problems inwardly. If I tell you outwardly to do something, then I become your enemy. Bad children don't like it when the parents tell them things. But inwardly, when the parents tell them, they discover the thing for themselves. Hundreds of times I knock at your door to tell you when you do something wrong. If you are sleeping, how will you know? If your mother and father come by your bed and pray for you, you will not know. Only you will say, "Oh, something nice has come into my life."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The positive approach</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The positive approach" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Some of the disciples feel that by not doing certain things, they will be able to please me. They feel that by not doing something, they will be able to please me more than by doing something wrong. But this is the wrong approach. If you say that by not doing an undivine action you are gaining strength, then I wish to say that you are getting thirty per cent or forty per cent out of a hundred. But if you can do the right thing, at that time you are getting one hundred out of one hundred.</p>
<p>Suppose an evil thought comes to your mind and you are not bringing it down to the vital plane or the physical plane. But why do you have to allow the undivine thought to enter even on the mental plane? At that time, you should consciously take a divine thought and let it come to your vital and physical plane. Let it manifest on the physical plane. By not doing the wrong thing, the mark that you will get will be forty at most. But by doing the right thing in the mental plane, the vital plane, the physical plane, you are going to get at least ninety out of a hundred.</p>
<p>When you people say that you have not done something bad, I will say, "You have not done something bad. You have conquered your temptation. God bless you. I am so proud of you." But by conquering your temptation, the mark that you get will not be the same as the mark that you would get by doing something positive.</p>
<p>You wanted to do something undivine, but by some miracle or stroke of luck you did not do it. So you bless yourself. But tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, the same temptation will come and kill you. But if you take the positive approach and do not even allow the temptation to enter into you, that is much better. Once you allow temptation to come, you can try to fight it. But you have to know that ignorance has much more power than your so-called mental will. So if you say, "I won't do a bad thing," then certainly God will be pleased. But if you do the right thing, at that time God will be much more pleased. You are meditating here and a little boy is shouting, screaming. If you just ignore him and wait for him to go away, that is one approach. But if you scold him and teach him how to behave, that is the positive approach. If you tell him not to do the wrong thing, you are getting one hundred out of one hundred. But if you just ignore him and say, "Let him stop in his own way," he will not stop. He will go on, go on, go on.</p>
<p>Many times you people have a vital desire, an evil desire, or jealousy or any wrong force, and you just conquer it. For that I will give you forty per cent. But if you offer your love and devotion to the Supreme and try to bring down Light and other positive qualities, you are going to get one hundred out of one hundred. By trying to resist the negative qualities or avoiding them, you don't get much strength, because the negative qualities have tremendous power. Today you are strong, so they have not attacked you. But tomorrow they will attack you. Tomorrow you will become a victim to their whim. But if you take the positive side all the time, through prayer, through meditation, through invoking Peace, Light and Bliss, then you become really divine. Then these forces will not bother you any more.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What can I do to please you in your own way?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Is there anybody who does not know how to please me in my own way? Everybody, even a child of three, knows: only he has to do it. There is nobody in God's creation or among my disciples who can say that he does not know. The first thing he will do is please the Supreme. The Supreme comes first in the disciple's life; everything else is secondary. Then, when he realises the fact that the Supreme comes first in his life, at that time he has to go one step ahead. He has to please only the Supreme in himself and in everybody. He has only one obligation and that is to please the Supreme. Then all the truths will reveal themselves to him. Every moment ignorance is making us feel that our life is very difficult, very hard. But if we live in wisdom or light, then we see that our life's journey is not a difficult task. It is very easy if we can feel that there is only one Person in our life and that this Person is the only one whom we have to please. How do we please Him? If we want to please Him, then He has to come first in everything that we do. Every thought must be preceded by the word 'Supreme'. Every idea must be preceded by the word 'Supreme'. In everything that we do, from beginning to end, we have to keep the Supreme in mind.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we know if we are really pleasing you or not?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we know if we are really pleasing you or not?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are pleasing me if you are making progress. In the outer world, each day you are eating new food, fresh food. You don't depend on yesterday's food; today again you have to eat. Similarly, if you can think of today as the beginning of a new dawn in your life, then you make progress. In the spiritual life, dawn means progress, gradual progress. Light is increasing gradually, convincingly and unerringly inside your heart. So every day try to feel inside your heart a new dawn, new and convincing progress. If you feel a new dawn, then undoubtedly you are pleasing the Supreme in me.</p>
<p>Early in the morning when you get up, if you feel deep inside your heart a new hope, new inspiration, new aspiration, at that time you will feel inside yourself the speed of a deer. Then immediately you become more energetic and enthusiastic. At that time there is a forward movement, and this forward movement is your progress. So when you are making progress, automatically you are pleasing me.</p>
<p>There is also another way. Suppose you are feeling a constant joy inside you. Outwardly your mind cannot account for it: you have done nothing spectacular during the day. So how is it that you are getting such joy? There may not be any outer reason. The joy is spontaneously coming from the soul. If you feel joy and claim this joy as your own, then you will know that you are making progress.</p>
<p>The third way is by thinking of me, the Supreme in me. During the day, count how many times you have thought of me, and how many times consciously and soulfully you have offered loving gratitude to the Supreme in me. The Supreme is also inside you, but it is easier for you to see God in somebody else — especially in a spiritual person — than in yourself. Why? Before you realise God, you always feel that you are swimming in the sea of ignorance. You think of God, you pray to God, you meditate on God, but you don't think of yourself as the chosen instrument of God. You don't think of yourself as the supremely chosen son or daughter of God. So naturally it is very difficult for you to see the Supreme inside yourself. But I am your spiritual Master. You do not think that I am swimming in the sea of ignorance. You feel that I am standing on the shore. So if you think of me and meditate on the Supreme in me, it is infinitely easier for you to realise the Supreme. Don't think of the body-consciousness; think of the soul, which has a free access to the Universal Consciousness. Think of my soul, which embodies Light, Peace and Bliss in abundant measure. I try to represent the Supreme in His own Way; therefore, it becomes infinitely easier for you to see the Supreme in me. But once you sea the Supreme in me, you have to know that the same Supreme is inside you. So, if you think of the Supreme all the time, then you are pleasing me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How should we feel when you tell us that we aren&#039;t pleasing you?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How should we feel when you tell us that we aren&#039;t pleasing you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, don't be displeased with me. Do not say, "Who cares for that Indian? Let him go back to India." On the contrary, you should be extremely grateful to me. When I say I am not pleased, that means that I really am paying attention to you. When I walk along the street in Manhattan, hundreds and thousands of people I see. They are in their own world and I am in my world, which is a little bit of spiritual world. They pay no attention to me and I pay no attention to them. On he outer plane I have nothing to do with them, but on the inner plane I have everything to do with everybody.</p>
<p>But since you are a disciple of mine, I feel I am duty-bound to be of service to the Supreme in you, even on the physical plane. It is my duty to perfect the seeker for whom I am responsible. You have given me the responsibility and I have accepted. So when I say that I am displeased, it means that I am offering to you my Concern-Light.</p>
<p>You want to run fast, faster, fastest. If I don't tell you that you are not running, that you are stumbling, stumbling, stumbling, then you remain in a self-complacent world. You will do everything wrong and think that you are doing the right thing. Then your progress will be delayed. If you are really doing the right thing, then without fail I will tell you. When I say that I am not pleased, then you should feel that it is a great blessing to know the truth, for this way you can run the fastest to the ultimate Goal. But if a spiritual Master remains indifferent, it will be a spiritual disaster. I always tell my disciples that when I stop perfecting them, when I don't scold them, when I remain indifferent, at that time my indifference is like an atom bomb. If I am really indifferent, then my disciples will take a very, very, very long time to reach their destination.</p>
<p>It is like a mother. How can the mother be indifferent to her children? If they do something wrong, the mother immediately points it out. And if they do something good, the mother extols them to the skies with her joy and pride. So, when I say that I am displeased, you have to feel that it is my concern which is speaking.</p>
<p>It is like my right hand telling my left hand, "Please be as strong as I am." My right hand is stronger than my left hand, so the right hand is telling the left that it is ready to help in every possible way. When I say something to you, you have to feel that I am your own highest illumined part. Your own highest part is asking the lowest to be as good, as divine, as itself. It is the highest in you that is speaking to the lowest, asking it to become perfect. If you take it in that way, then you will never be displeased. If the head asks the legs to do something, the legs will do it. They know that they are part and parcel of the body. There the question of anger or fear or other negative qualities cannot arise. When you feel that your highest is speaking to your lowest for its perfection, then you will be very happy because you know one part of your existence has already become what God wants it to become. One part has become what God wants, and the other will also become that way eventually.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Awareness of the Master&#039;s height</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Awareness of the Master&#039;s height" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>It is difficult for you to be aware of my height all the time because always I am mixing with you people. On the sports field I run the hundred metres and I suffer from leg cramp. Then you say, "Oh, so-and-so defeats Guru; that person also defeats him. What kind of Guru is he? If he had spiritual power, then naturally he could beat them." When ordinary people think of spiritual height, they feel that constant miracles must be performed, they feel that I have to beat everybody at everything, that I have to be always on the Himalayan peaks while everybody else is at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>But you have to know that a spiritual Master comes into the world not to be a sports champion and not to do miracles at every second. Miracles I do perform. Every day I do millions of miracles. But they are of a different kind. When I concentrate on you people, when I feed your souls, that is my miracle. So many people on earth are crying for light, but there are very few spiritual Masters on earth who have really realised God. I am not the only one who has realised God but I wish to say that there are very few Masters who are really realised and who are really serving God in humanity. Others are just fooling the world, and those who are being fooled naturally are greater fools. That is why the so-called spiritual world is being exploited.</p>
<p>You have been coming to the Centre for one year or a few years. I am sure that at least one day when you looked at me, you saw something in my eyes. So many times I have meditated in front of you and brought down my highest consciousness. Definitely you must have seen something in my eyes. When you see something in me during the meditation, I tell you, like a magnet you are pulling it towards you and then it becomes your property also. Once you see something in me or receive something from me, it does not remain my sole property. Immediately it becomes your property. When we meditate and our consciousness goes up, we just spread our wings. Then it is for others to see and feel and grow into the Reality that we embody.</p>
<p>The consciousness that you liked best, that gave you the greatest joy, you may have seen perhaps six months ago or eight months ago. But try to remember that that is your goal. Try to feel that this very thing you will have tomorrow or two hundred years from now or four hundred years from now. Or even the next moment you may reach that consciousness.</p>
<p>Sometimes during meditation, some of you try to imitate the way I look and the movement of my eyes. But you have to know that there is a great difference between the way I meditate and the meditation that you show. Some of you stand in front of me and pretend to be in your highest, but I know what kind of meditation you are doing. You are thinking that everyone should come and look at you, because you are doing what I do. When I do this kind of thing, I am feeding all the souls; but you are doing it only to attract the attention of the people who are beside you and in front of you. I am a spiritual thief. Secretly I enter into you and I try to bring something into you. But I see that you are only trying to attract attention.</p>
<p>Now, whom are you fooling? You may be fooling the rest of the disciples, but you are not fooling me. I come with utmost compassion and say, "This stupid fellow is deceiving all the other disciples and they are trying to imitate him. They think that he is the best seeker. Now, what will I do? If I tell others that he is exploiting their innocence, then he will be mad that I have exposed him. And if I don't tell, others will have the wrong impression and will try to imitate him." But I feel that it is better to tell the truth. If I tell, then I will hurt only the one individual who was deceiving the others. The rest of the disciples will immediately try to rectify the same failing in themselves. Also, they will not try to imitate that particular person in their own meditation.</p>
<p>During meditation all of you have seen my height. But later, when you see me playing with toys and all kinds of things, you have to feel that still I have not cut off my link with the Highest. Look at the root of a tree. It is under the ground, but it always keeps its connection with the topmost branches which are going up, up, up. So, you have to think of me as a tree. I am the highest, topmost bough and, again I am the root. Even when I come down, I don't lose my height because I know that the highest, topmost branch is also mine. When I play with you people, when I cut jokes and do all kinds of things. then you say, "Guru eats the same food that we eat and does everything else that we do. So, if he can realise God, what is wrong with us?" Your mind may ask, "If he has realised the Highest, then why is he not there all the time?" But in one part of my consciousness I am always in the Highest; again, in another part I have come down to your level so that you can go up. Otherwise if I remain always on the topmost branch of the tree, you will only strain your neck and say, "Oh, it is beyond our capacity to reach his height." But I do come down and at that time if you say, "Guru, I am ready now; I want to be on your shoulders," then I will lift you up. I will climb and you will go up with me, for my highest is your goal.</p>
<p>Once you touch something, you get the consciousness of that thing. But it is up to you to enter into that consciousness. When you place your hand on even a drop of the sea, you get the vibration of the vast ocean.</p>
<p>When you touch the foot of a tree, you get the consciousness, the vibration, of the whole tree. The tree is aspiring to grow into the highest and its vibration is soothing, protecting, compassionate and full of patience. When I am playing with you people or cutting jokes and all that, you are catching me at the foot of the tree, but you are getting the vibration, the consciousness of the whole tree. When you climb up the tree, it gives you great joy. You go so high. What I can give you when you enter into my highest consciousness is boundless Peace, Light and Bliss. But again, if you cannot remain all the time at the top of the tree, then try to touch any part of my consciousness and you will get the vibration of the highest. Even if you remember the sweetest, most innocent thing on the earthly level, that will also help you to remain in my consciousness. You don't have to worry about my highest. Think of me on any level; get me at any level. Then, from there, automatically you will get the pull to go to the highest. You won't remain all the time at the foot of the tree. There comes a time when you will climb up. You don't remain in front of the ocean all the time. There comes a time when you enter into the ocean and swim. Similarly, you don't have to remain all the time in my relaxed consciousness or my joking consciousness. After some time you will be able to go up. And that is your goal: to reach my highest consciousness.</p>
