<p><em>This article appeared in </em>The Star Tribune/, the Twin Cities' largest circulated newspaper on Saturday, 14 October 2000. Sri Chinmoy responded to questions asked by Martha Sawyert Allen. Ms. Allen writes a column called "Faith and Body". Sri Chinmoy actually answered the questions over the telephone on Sunday, 8 October at 9:30 a.m./</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I feel that Westerners have always been open to our Eastern concepts. They readily, lovingly, soulfully and self-givingly have accepted our Eastern concepts.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Does it take extra training?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it does not. Their hearts are completely ready. Therefore, it does not take extra training for them to accept the spiritual way of India.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Jealousy means division. Anything that divides us will eventually ruin us. When we are jealous, we see only our little self as our own, our very own. The larger self, which is the world-self or universal self, we forget entirely. Jealousy is one of the things that divide us, and these things will eventually destroy us unless we conquer them.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can reach one's own pure heart in two ways: either by soulfully repeating the word "purity, purity, purity" or by cultivating sincere tears in one's heart. In these two ways, one can automatically be blessed or inundated with most genuine purity. Again, to have a pure heart we have to bring devotion, sincere, genuine devotion, to the fore in our life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation is both the way and the goal. In the beginning, meditation plays the role of a staircase. We need a staircase to climb up to a certain height. Then there comes a time when we see that this meditation not only leads to the highest but actually embodies the highest. We say that God is the Boat, God is the Boatman, God is the Way and God is the Goal. In exactly the same way we can describe meditation. With meditation we go up, up, and up until finally we become the meditation itself. And this meditation embodies the universal Light, the universal Delight, God the Creator and God the Creation at the same time.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do accept that all faiths are valid. They are all equally important.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Do you have some standard for what is a valid faith?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. All the religions embody divinity in infinite measure. I take them all as one. But in my case, I say there is only one faith, one religion, and that is love of God. I love God according to my capacity. You love God according to your capacity. Someone else loves God according to his capacity. All religions, all faiths, are equally true and equally divine. Again, the universal truth is that there is only one religion, and that religion is our love of God.</p>

<p><em>Question:</em> How would the world be if it followed your hope for it?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the world becomes one with my hope, then there will be no misunderstandings, no disputes, no conflicts and no fights, no wars. Only harmony will reign supreme. Harmony will cover the length and breadth of the world.</p>

She understood me, I feel, more than anybody else, because she herself was the most devoted child — the darling, you can say — of the Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, for like everyone, I have both the divine in me and the human in me. The human in me does get discouraged. But the divine in me is never discouraged, because the divine in me embodies infinite poise and peace. The divine in me accepts the world as it is. It is the bounden duty of the divine in me to be of service to mankind and to pray to the Absolute Supreme to elevate the consciousness of mankind. Therefore, the divine in me is never discouraged. The human in me at times is definitely discouraged. But again, this discouragement does not last long. The divine in me illumines the human in me so that it does not suffer for a long time from discouragement.</p>
<p>Each individual can become discouraged when his desire is not fulfilled, when his aspiration is not fulfilled, when his sincere and devoted service is not accepted by the world. But again, if he sees that the Supreme Pilot within him is guiding him and piloting him to the destined goal, to what we call the Golden Shore of the ever-transcending Beyond, then his discouragement does not last more than five seconds or five minutes, or a maximum of an hour. In my case it does not last more than 35 minutes, no matter how discouraged I am. After five seconds or 35 minutes, the human in me becomes inseparably one with the divine in me, and then there is no such thing as discouragement or sadness. At that time, I am dealing with Infinity's Joy, Light and Bliss. Infinity's Joy, Light and Bliss are blessing me and showering their wealth upon my devoted head and surrendered life.</p>

<p><em>The following questions were answered by Sri Chinmoy on 26 September 2004 at Aspiration-Ground in Jamaica, New York.</em></p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Guru, these past few years have been so difficult...</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This year has been very difficult.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> These past three or four years have been very difficult in our manifestation. Many of us have been unable, for whatever reason, to do what we would have liked to do in terms of serving the Supreme. What can we do for the time being until things clear up a little bit and we can go on and do our work in the world?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Outwardly, for certain reasons, we cannot do some things right now, but inwardly we can increase our aspiration. As we have outer aspiration, outer dedication and outer manifestation, even so, we have inner aspiration, inner dedication and inner manifestation. The other day when I said to Charles Osgood, "For the time being we are unable to do our peace work," he immediately said, "But your spirit is doing inwardly, your spirit."</p>
<p>So there are things we cannot do outwardly, owing to some reason. But inwardly we can intensify our inspiration and aspiration. And again, when the time comes, we will be able to do the things that we once did more vigorously, more powerfully and more satisfactorily than we did before.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we become anxious, we weaken our nerves. To be eager and to be anxious are not the same. We can be eager to do something, but when we are anxious, nervousness enters. The best thing is to increase our eagerness to do something, but if any kind of anxious feeling comes, it ruins our pure joy. Immediately nervousness is there.</p>
<p>When we are anxious to do something, sometimes we even adopt foul means. Eagerness on the other hand is something really divine. So we have to be always eager, eager, eager. Eagerness will automatically keep us aware of our goal.</p>
<p>If eagerness is there, real eagerness, then God's Grace descends spontaneously and unconditionally. So the best thing is to be always eager, eager to do something good, divine, illumining and fulfilling.</p>

There are so many ways to pray -— we can pray with a cry, we can pray with a smile and so forth. Is there any way that God prefers to hear our prayers that would make our prayers reach His Ears or be more effective?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. When we pray, not with the tears of our eyes but with the tears of our heart, that prayer is by far the best. Not with the prayer of smiling or laughing, not with a complacent feeling and not with a merely devoted feeling, no. There should be burning tears inside the heart. For anything that we pray, God will be the Judge.</p>
<p>The best kind of prayer has to be inside the heart, not in the mind, and that prayer has to be full of tears. Then God is bound to listen.</p>
<p>Again, if God fulfils our desires, it can take a different form from what we imagined. We are trying to get our prayers fulfilled in one way, but when God is satisfied with us, pleased with us, He may fulfil the same desire in a totally different way, in a way that is far beyond our imagination. Then we become so grateful to God.</p>
<p>While we are praying for something, we do not know how the outcome or result will come to us. So the best thing is to cry in the heart with tears. This prayer expedites its own fulfilment.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Remain silent, silent, silent! Even while you are walking, do not allow any thought to come. Do not say, "Oh, this is a good thought, that is a bad thought." No. Try to have no thought, no thought. Let God think inside you. Let the Supreme think inside you. Let Him do the needful. If any thought comes, stop it, stop it, stop it. Then you will see how much energy you get, how much willingness, eagerness and everything that you need; the way will be shown to you.</p>
<p>Only keep the mind absolutely quiet — even for two minutes, three minutes. It is like the development of a muscle. Today if you can keep the mind completely still for two minutes and tomorrow for three minutes, then gradually, gradually, if you do this for a long time, you will see how much you can improve in your inner life — not only in your inner life, but also in your outer life. You will be able to make tremendous improvement.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: At this particular time in history, what is the best way for each of us as individuals to help our own country go forward?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; At this particular time in history, what is the best way for each of us as individuals to help our own country go forward?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The only answer is via prayers and meditation. There is no outer way. No discussion, no advice — nothing will work at this point in the outer world. Only in the inner world we have to gain more wealth through our prayers, our meditation, and our love, devotion and surrender to God's Will. We have to accumulate inner strength, inner strength, inner strength. Sometimes we desperately need inner strength to come forward. So this is the time when, if you want to do something for your country, you have to pray deep within and accumulate the strength that will be used later on.</p>
<p>Now only try to accumulate and hold as much as you can in the inner world, in the inner life. Then the time will come when you will be able to use that inner wealth in your outer life, to serve your country.</p>
