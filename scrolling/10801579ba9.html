<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Immediately. I am at His behest. If the Supreme asks me at this moment to go back to India and be of service to Him there, I will be most happy to go. As I said before, for me there is no division between East and West. And I have no personal preference. Only to follow His Will, only to abide by His will, do I stay on earth. "Let Thy Will he done". This is the supreme message that the Son of God offered to mankind, and every day, every hour, every minute, every second, I try only to listen to His inner dictates and execute His Will, never, never my own.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A simple life, a sincere life and a life that feels the necessity of an inner cry.

If one really wants to please God in God's Way, according to his inner capacity and receptivity, then I feel that he is entitled to try my path.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Far from it. That would be a mistake on my part. Suppose I am a spiritual leader and you are a spiritual leader. God wants me to have specific seekers in my boat. and God wants you to have specific seekers in your boat. If I try to grab the seekers that are meant for your boat just to have as many as possible, it will be an act of injustice. God will not be pleased with that. God wants you to have the ones that are meant for you. Ultimately you are taking them to the same Goal as I am.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the outer world it is a very, very slow process. In the process of time, definitely, people who are following our path will reach the destined Goal. If they have a sincere cry, no sincere cry will meet with frustration, disappointment or failure. So since my students have a sincere cry, the day is bound to dawn when their sincere cry will meet with satisfaction, supreme Satisfaction, which is illumination within and without.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, my work is not like that. It is a slow and steady process. We have to sow the seed, which has to germinate, then become a sapling, and gradually become a huge banyan tree. We are now in the process of consciously becoming that which we always were in the inner world. But this process of growth is an ever-transcending process. We can grow eternally. We need never stop.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is a most inspiring, encouraging question. I have been asked thousands and thousands of questions all over the world, but this last question of yours so far nobody has asked me, not even my disciples. We have sown the seed. Now we have a tiny plant. This tiny plant will grow and become a strong tree. If storms of doubt and hurricanes of jealousy and other undivine things enter, then naturally the progress can be very slow. But if there is implicit faith and devoted oneness, naturally the plant will very soon grow into a tree. Now we are in the plant stage: we have sown the seed, and it is no longer a seedling. It has germinated properly. Previously it was only a seedling, but now it has become a tiny but healthy plant. So there is every hope that it will weather all the buffets and blows of human doubts and weaknesses, and grow into a huge tree.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The United Nations has a seeking heart and also a oneness feeling. This seeking heart and this feeling of oneness we may not outwardly see; and even if we do see these, we don't see them all the time. But in my case, I see and feel them all the time. These two things please me most: the United Nations feeling of inner oneness, its feeling of world family, and also its seeking heart. These two achievements of the United Nations always please me most.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the individual seeker feels that the world community, the outer world, is something outside himself, then he will not be able to offer his aspiration to the world community. But if he feels that the world community, the entire world, is within him — inside his body, inside his soul — then he can pray and meditate in order to raise the standard of the world community, which is part and parcel of his own life.</p>
<p>First he has to feel his oneness with the world community, and then he has to feel that the world community is not outside his sphere of existence, it is not something else, or somewhere else, it is within him. When he can feel that, he will be able to contribute much more to the improvement of the world community. Then, anything that he does for the world community is also for his own nourishment, his own success and his own progress. So the most important thing is for him to feel that the world community is inside him, part and parcel of his own aspiring consciousness. Then, his own prayer and meditation will help the world considerably. That is the easiest way to raise the standard of the world community.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the best aspect of the Supreme to concentrate on for transformation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the best aspect of the Supreme to concentrate on for transformation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is always advisable to concentrate upon the Compassion aspect of the Supreme for your personal transformation or world transformation because it is the Compassion aspect of the Supreme that expedites our progress. When the Supreme offers His Compassion, it is all unconditional. If we concentrate on His Heart aspect, or Delight aspect or Peace aspect or any other aspect, we may have in our mind the thought that we have given the Supreme something. We have given Him a drop and now He may give us the ocean. Always there is a feeling of an exchange. He is infinitely richer, infinitely more powerful than we are in every way. He has infinite Capacities whereas our capacities are very limited, so we are giving him what we have and He will give us what He has. If we have that kind of feeling, transformation will take time.</p>
<p>But if we approach His Compassion aspect, we make ourselves feel that we are in no way adding to what He has, or offering Him anything that He needs. Instead, we feel that we need our own transformation and world transformation, and out of His infinite Bounty, unconditionally He is giving this to us. If we have that kind of approach to the Supreme, then our heart's gratitude will overflow and it will accelerate our progress. So the Compassion aspect is always best if we want to accelerate our own progress and the progress of world evolution. This is the fastest way to make individual and collective progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Which is the best way for a nation to contribute to the world at large?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Which is the best way for a nation to contribute to the world at large?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each nation has to feel that there is only one nation: one world nation and one world family. We are not only of the One but also for the One. The Source is One and that means that the end is also One. When we say that we are of the One but for the many, we create a problem. As soon as we say "many," we feel that there are many different minds, different approaches and different realities; there is no feeling of oneness. But if we say that we are of the one and for the one, then there is no problem. Take a tree, for example. A tree has branches, flowers, leaves and fruits. If we don't take the tree as one unit or one reality — if sometimes we appreciate the flowers, sometimes the fruit's and sometimes the branches, if each time we pay attention to one particular part or achievement of the tree — then we are unable to pay full attention to all the things that the tree embodies, and this creates problems. But if we take the tree as one reality and simply water the tree or sit at the foot of the tree for our prayer and meditation, for our own illumination, then all our problems are solved.</p>
<p>So, each Nation should feel that there is only one nation, one reality, and inside that one reality are all the nations. Otherwise, if one nation is meditating, it may say, "Let me pray and meditate for all the nations." And then, in a few days' time, if the other nations make some mistake or say something wrong, immediately that particular nation will feel displeased and will stop praying and meditating for the others. But if that particular nation feels that all the nations have been combined and amalgamated into one reality, then there will be no problem. It will all the time pray and meditate for the other nations.</p>
<p>The best way for the individual nation to make progress and also to add to world progress is to feel that there is only one reality. This reality is the source, the goal, and it is also the traveller. In that way, the individual nation will make fastest progress and also will be able to contribute much to the world at large most satisfactorily. Always it has to think of the source, of the course, the journey, the road and the destination — everything — as one, all one.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is a good idea, if it is possible, to have other meditation groups connected or, you can say, affiliated with this one. We have to feel that we are one and try to feel this oneness through our dedicated and sincere efforts. All individuals have the same goal and that goal is perfection. This perfection comes only when we have the feeling of oneness. In aspiration we are one, in realisation we are one, in revelation we are one, in manifestation we are one. Since we are one it is a very good idea to have as many meditation groups as possible in the United Nations international community affiliated with this one.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is the Supreme pleased with the world progress?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is the Supreme pleased with the world progress?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, the Supreme is pleased with the world progress. Again, the Supreme believes in continuous progress. Whatever the world has already achieved has pleased Him, but He expects something more, and that something more has to be achieved by the sincere efforts of the United Nations, that is to say, by the people who work at the U.N., the people who love the U.N. and the people who are one with the ideals and the goals of the U.N. We can achieve what the Supreme wants by virtue of our joint efforts in the field of aspiration and dedication.</p>
<p>We believe in the world's continuous progress. For that continuous progress we have to aspire and dedicate ourselves more to the cause of the United Nations. Satisfaction is not a finished product. If we have come up to a certain standard, then our progress becomes like a stagnant pool; only in continuous progress do we find satisfaction. First we come up to a certain standard, which is what we originally wanted. Then we look around and see that somebody else has achieved something higher, something deeper, and we also try to do the same. It is not out of jealousy or a feeling of competition, no; only it is an inner urge that makes us want to try to surpass ourselves, to surpass our own capacities.</p>
<p>So the Supreme is definitely pleased with the sincere aspiration and dedication that the United Nations has offered so far to Him. But again, this achievement or this offering is not enough, for the Supreme wants continuous progress. Therefore, we have to make a special effort to make more progress if we want to please Him continuously.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme created the soul of the United Nations the day the vision dawned in the heart of Woodrow Wilson. But the vision did not manifest for many years. And when it did manifest, it did not manifest properly. On the one hand, it was a failure. On the other hand, it was not actually a failure; it was only that the vision was taken over by others. But it was the flow of the same river; it was the same flow and the same force of universal peace.</p>
