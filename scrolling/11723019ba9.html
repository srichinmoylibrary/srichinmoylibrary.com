<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When one realises God, it does not mean that he will remember all the millions and billions of outer experiences he has had during his lifetime. But his inner experiences, the significant higher experiences that he had in the inner world, he can bring to the fore at his command. If he wants to bring his whole inner life in front of himself he can.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The experience of the Beyond is calm, but it is not static. In it, dynamism and tranquillity exist together. In one of the Upanishads we find this definition of the Beyond: “That moves and that moves not. That is far and that is near.” How can something move yet move not? It seems impossible. But when you are in the Beyond, you will see the universe in movement and, at the same time, tranquil. There is also another description of the Beyond: the experience of the Infinite. “Infinity is that. Infinity is this. From Infinity, Infinity has come into existence. From Infinity, when Infinity is taken away, Infinity remains.”</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You yourself are the unmanifest. That is to say, your highest Self is still unmanifested. You, who represent God on earth, and you, who in your highest consciousness are absolutely one with God, are still unmanifested. Your highest is not manifested right now, but this does not mean that it will always remain unmanifested. No, your highest has to be manifested on earth, for then only can the perfect Perfection of the Supreme take place.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Vast expansion of mind the aspirant can have for a few minutes when he is in a very high, deep meditation. Only the realised soul can enter into this vast expansion of mind and stay there indefinitely. But we are actually making a mistake when we use the term ‘expansion of the mind.’ In the state I am referring to, there is no mind; the mind has been transcended. We feel that what we experience is the expansion of the mind, but it is actually the transcendence of the mind. In the mind there is form, there is limit; but when we speak of the vast expanse, it is something beyond the domain of the mind. It is a vast expanse of Light, Consciousness, Peace, Bliss.</p>
<p>When we are meditating, we always try to go beyond the mind. When we want to expand our consciousness, our physical reality, we have to enter into the soul. But when we come back from the highest level of consciousness, we try to understand and express the state we were in with the help of the mind. That is because the mind right now is the highest product of human life. But because the mind is limited, it can never understand and express the infinite, the unlimited.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sri Aurobindo once said that the biography of a spiritual Master is all written inside. If you write the biography of an ordinary person, it can be thousands of pages long. But if you want to write about his inner life, you will not be able to fill even one page. But in the case of a spiritual Master, hundreds and hundreds of pages can be written about his inner life, but they are not written. A spiritual Master, who is dealing with the inner world, gives and receives hundreds of significant experiences every day. A Yogi’s inner experiences are the predominant experiences of his life, whereas for an ordinary person inner experiences are a very rare occurrence.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Once you said that transcendental Delight is one of the divine qualities not manifested on earth. Why is that?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Once you said that transcendental Delight is one of the divine qualities not manifested on earth. Why is that?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the highest plane there is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss; we call it <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda</em>. <em>Sat</em> is Existence; <em>Chit</em> is Consciousness; <em>Ananda</em> is Delight. Consciousness is the source of everything, but Consciousness cannot stay without Delight and Existence. If there is no Existence, there can be no Consciousness. If there is Existence and Consciousness, Bliss is required for Self-fulfilment.</p>
<p>Great spiritual Masters from time immemorial have brought down the <em>Sat</em> and <em>Chit</em> aspects. But <em>Ananda</em> is much more difficult to bring down. Some could not bring it at all. Some brought it, but it lasted for only a few seconds or a few minutes and then went back up again. Peace is accessible; we can bring down Peace. Light and Power can easily be brought down. But the Delight which immortalises our inner and outer consciousness has not yet been established on earth. It comes and then goes away because it sees so much imperfection in the earth-atmosphere that it cannot remain.</p>
<p>Even spiritually advanced people are often confused. They feel an inner ecstasy which comes from the vital world, and they think this is the real Delight. But it is not so. Real Delight comes from the highest world to the soul, and from the soul it saturates the whole being.</p>
<p>This <em>Ananda</em> is absorbed differently from physical delight, or what we call pleasure or enjoyment. The supramental Delight is totally different from the world of pleasure and enjoyment. Once you get even an iota of it, you feel your entire inner being dancing for joy like a child with utmost purity, and your outer being feels true Immortality in its outer existence. If you get this Delight even for a second, you will remember it all your life.</p>
<p>All around us is the cosmic Game, the cosmic Play. The universe is full of joy, inner joy and outer joy. When realisation takes place, we have to feel the necessity of manifesting this constant Delight in our heart. This Delight glows, but does not actually burn. It has tremendous intensity, but it is all softness and absolutely sweet-flowing Nectar. One day I brought it down into my gross physical, so that when I was smiling, at that time I was scattering the highest Delight to each of you. But I must say that it has all disappeared. There is nobody among the disciples who has kept any of it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do children sometimes experience this kind of Delight?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do children sometimes experience this kind of Delight?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. Children do not have the highest Delight. They get psychic delight. They get some delight from the psychic being, from the inner being, or from the soul, which they express spontaneously. And very often children express their joy through their pure, uncorrupted vital. But the highest Delight, which comes from the plane of <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda</em>, children do not get. One can feel it only in one’s deepest, highest meditation. Children also have to go through meditation, concentration and contemplation in order to experience this quality.</p>
<p>[ Sri Chinmoy then asked his disciples to try to invoke <em>Ananda</em>]</p>
<p>Please place your right hand on your heart. Try to feel the most beautiful child on earth and in Heaven inside your heart. This is the soul. The men will naturally see the child as masculine, and the women will see the child as feminine. The soul is neither masculine nor feminine, but when it takes human incarnation, it takes a form. Try to see the child as only seven days old. In terms of spiritual evolution, some of you do not have even that seven-day-old child, forgive me to say. Although the souls started their journey millions of years ago, there are one or two individuals here who have had only one or two human incarnations. Naturally their souls’ evolution is perhaps only a few hours old or a few minutes old in purely spiritual terms. Now, please think of the seven-day-old child. Then in absolute silence, please say <em>Ananda</em> seven times.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a difference between the realisation of one Master and the realisation of another?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a difference between the realisation of one Master and the realisation of another?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As there are men and men, similarly there are Yogis and Yogis. Yogis are not all at the same level. A fully realised Yogi is he who is constantly one with God’s Consciousness, constantly aware of his oneness with God. Again, there are half-realised or partially realised Yogis. A few hours of the day, when they are meditating, they will be one with God, and the rest of the time they will be like ordinary human beings. Their oneness with God depends on what kind of realisation the Yogis have achieved.</p>
<p>God-realisation is like a tree. One can run and touch the tree of realisation and say, “I have realised.” But this realisation is only touching the foot of the tree. One is very happy in touching the foot of the tree, for he has seen that the fruit is there, the leaves and branches are there; he can touch them, hold them, feel them, and he knows that he has reached his goal. But another person will say, “No, I am not satisfied. I want to climb up a little and sit on a branch. Then I will feel that I have reached my goal.” He goes one step higher, so naturally his realisation is superior. Again, there will be someone who will climb up to the topmost branch and eat the delicious fruit there. His realisation is higher still, because he has not only seen and touched the Highest, but has actually climbed up to the Highest. But he has no intention of coming down, because he feels that the moment he comes down he will again be an ordinary person and will be caught in the meshes of the ignorant world. He feels that once he climbs down, he will not be able to climb back up again.</p>
<p>But there is another type of realised soul who will not only climb up to the Highest for realisation, but will bring down the fruits of the tree for the world. He will come back for manifestation. He says, “I am not satisfied with sitting at the top of the tree. This is not my goal. What I have received I want to share with humanity.” He has the capacity to climb up and climb down at his sweet will. When he climbs down, he brings down Compassion, Peace, Light and Bliss from above. And when he climbs up, he takes humanity with him. He places a few human beings on his shoulders and then climbs back up. He will keep those souls up there and come down again to take a few more up on his shoulders. His capacity is infinitely greater than that of the person who just comes and touches the tree. His realisation is the fullest.</p>
<p>In India, there have been quite a few spiritual Masters who were partially realised. They touched the foot of the tree, but did not climb up to the topmost branch. They are considered very great by the aspirants, but when you compare their standard with that of Sri Krishna or the Christ or the Buddha, you have to say that those who only touched the tree achieved only a partial realisation.</p>
<p>If a Hindu touches a drop of water from the Ganges, he will feel a sense of purity. But if somebody has the capacity to swim across the Ganges, naturally he will be more convinced that his entire body is purified. When it is a matter of realisation, also, one can be satisfied with a drop of nectar or one can say, “No, I need the boundless ocean.” Again, one can say, “This boundless nectar is not only for me; it is for everybody. I want to share it with others.” The realisation of the individual who actually has the capacity to share his highest realisation with others is undoubtedly superior to that of the other two.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna used to speak about the <em>jivakoti</em> and the <em>ishvarakoti</em>. The <em>jivakoti</em> is one who has realised God but does not want to enter into the field of manifestation again. A person who has a raft, a tiny boat, can cross the sea of ignorance himself, but he cannot take others. But the <em>ishvarakoti</em>, who has a big ship, can accommodate hundreds and thousands of human souls and carry them across the sea of ignorance, Hi comes into the world again and again to liberate mankind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are various minor samadhis, and among the minor samadhis, <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi happens to be the highest. Right after <em>savikalpa</em> comes <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi, but there is a great yawning gulf between <em>savikalpa</em> and <em>nirvikalpa</em>. However, even though <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi is one step below <em>nirvikalpa</em>, we do not use the term ‘lower’. We do not call <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi lower than <em>nirvikalpa</em>; they are two radically different samadhis. Again, there is something even beyond <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi called <em>sahaja</em> samadhi. But <em>savikalpa</em> and <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi are the most well-known samadhis. / In <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi, for a short period of time you lose all human consciousness. In this state the conception of time and space is altogether different. With the human time you cannot judge; with the human way of looking at space you cannot judge. In that samadhi, for an hour or two hours you are completely in another world. You see there that almost everything is done. Here in this world there are many desires still unfulfilled in yourself and in others. Millions of desires are not fulfilled, and millions of things remain to be done. But when you are in <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi, you see that practically everything is done; you have nothing to do. You are only an instrument. If you are used, well and good; otherwise, things are all done. But from <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi everybody has to return to ordinary consciousness.</p>
<p>Even in <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi there are grades. Just as there are brilliant students and poor students in the same class in school, so also in <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi some aspirants reach the highest grade, while less aspiring seekers reach a lower or a middle rung of the ladder, where everything is not so clear and vivid as on the highest level.</p>
<p>In <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi there are thoughts and ideas coming from various angles, but they do not affect you. While you are meditating, you remain unperturbed, and your inner being functions in a dynamic and confident manner. But when you are a little higher, when you have become one with the soul in <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi, there will be no ideas or thoughts at all. Here nature’s dance stops. There is no nature, only infinite Peace and Bliss. The Knower and the Known have become one. Everything is tranquil. Here you enjoy a supremely divine, all-pervading, self-amorous ecstasy. You become the object of enjoyment, you become the enjoyer and you become the enjoyment itself.</p>
<p><em>Nirvikalpa</em> samadhi is the highest samadhi that most spiritual Masters attain, and then only if they have achieved realisation. It lasts for a few hours or a few days, and then one has to come down. When one comes down, what happens? Very often one forgets his own name. One forgets his own age. He cannot speak properly. But through continued practice, gradually one becomes able to come down from <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi and immediately function in a normal way.</p>
<p>There were spiritual Masters in the hoary past who attained <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi and did not come down. They maintained their highest samadhi and found it impossible to enter into the world atmosphere and work like human beings. One cannot operate in the world while in that state of consciousness; it is simply impossible.</p>
<p>Generally, when one enters into <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi, one does not want to come back into the world again. If one stays there for eighteen or twenty-one days, there is every possibility that he will leave the body.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> But there is a divine dispensation. If the Supreme wants a particular soul to work here on earth, even after twenty-one or twenty-two days, the Supreme takes the individual into another channel of dynamic, divine consciousness and has him return to the earth-plane to act.</p>
<p><em>Sahaja</em> samadhi is by far the highest type of samadhi. In this samadhi one is in the highest consciousness, but at the same time he is working in the gross physical world. One maintains the experience of <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi while simultaneously entering into earthly activities. One has become the soul and at the same time is utilising the body as a perfect instrument. In <em>sahaja</em> samadhi one walks like an ordinary human being. One eats. One does the usual things that an ordinary human being does. But in the inmost recesses of his heart he is surcharged with divine illumination. When one has this <em>sahaja</em> samadhi, one becomes the Lord and Master of Reality. One can go at his sweet will to the Highest and then come down to the earth consciousness to manifest.</p>
<p>After achieving the highest type of realisation, on very rare occasions one is blessed with <em>sahaja</em> samadhi. Very few spiritual Masters have achieved this state — only one or two. For <em>sahaja</em> samadhi, the Supreme’s infinite Grace is required, or one has to be very powerful and lucky. <em>Sahaja</em> samadhi comes only when one has established inseparable oneness with the Supreme, or when one wants to show, on rare occasions, that he <em>is</em> the Supreme. He who has achieved <em>sahaja</em> samadhi and remains in this samadhi, consciously and perfectly manifests God at every second, and is thus the greatest pride of the transcendental Supreme.</p>

Is it in any way related to sahaja samadhi?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is the &lt;em&gt;turiya&lt;/em&gt; consciousness a form of samadhi? Is it in any way related to &lt;em&gt;sahaja&lt;/em&gt; samadhi?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The <em>turiya</em> consciousness is the Transcendental Reality. It is not a form of samadhi in the accurate sense of the term. When an individual soul establishes permanent and constant union with the Supreme Being, we say that he is enjoying the <em>turiya</em> consciousness. The possessor of <em>turiya</em> consciousness usually does not come down for manifestation because he likes to remain immersed in <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda</em>, Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. Here the seeker reaches the absolute height of evolution. This loftiest realisation has no direct link with <em>sahaja</em> samadhi.</p>
<p><em>Sahaja</em> samadhi holds the <em>turiya</em> consciousness. A possessor of <em>sahaja</em> samadhi embodies the <em>turiya</em> consciousness, and it is he who challenges earth-ignorance with a view to transforming it into the perfect creation. He embodies the highest transcendental Truth, Light, Peace, Bliss, Power and all divine qualities in boundless measure in his being, and he manifests these divine qualities in the easiest and most effective way in his multifarious day-to-day activities. In his outer life he acts like a divine child who has Eternity’s Height and Infinity’s Light at his disposal, sharing them with aspiring humanity cheerfully and unreservedly.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you speak a little more extensively about the experience of /nirvikalpa /samadhi?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you speak a little more extensively about the experience of /nirvikalpa /samadhi?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> <em>Nirvikalpa</em> samadhi cannot be explained by any individual, no matter how great he is. It is an experience which can be understood only by trying to identify and become one with someone who has attained the experience. We must try to enter into the experience rather than ask the experience to come to our level. When we enter into <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi, the experience itself is the reality. But when we want to tell others, to put it into words, we have to come down very far and use the mind; we have to couch the experience in human concepts. Therefore, the consciousness of <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi can never be adequately explained or expressed. The revelation of the experience can never be like the original experience.</p>
<p>I am trying my best to tell you about this from a very high consciousness, but still my mind is subtly expressing it. In <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi we have no mind. We see the Creator, the Creation and the Observer as one Person. There the object of adoration and the person who is adoring become totally one; the Lover and the Beloved become totally one. We go beyond everything, and at the same time we see that everything is real. Here in the ordinary world I will say you are unreal and you will say I am unreal because of our different opinions. But in <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi we go beyond all differences; there the mind does not function at all.</p>
<p>When we enter into <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi, the first thing we feel is that our heart is larger than the universe itself. Now we see the world around us, and the universe seems infinitely larger than we are. But this is because the world and the universe are now perceived by the limited mind. When we are in <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi, we see the universe like a tiny dot inside our vast heart.</p>
<p>In <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi there is infinite Bliss. There is nothing in comparison to the quantity, not to speak of the quality, of that Bliss. Bliss is a vague word to most of us. We hear that there is something called Bliss, and some people say they have experienced it, but most of us have no firsthand knowledge of it. When we enter into <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi, however, we not only feel Bliss, but we grow into that Bliss.</p>
<p>The third thing we feel in <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi is Power. All the power that all the occultists have put together is nothing compared with the Power we have in <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi. But the power that we can take from samadhi to utilise on earth is infinitesimal compared with the entirety. It is like what we require to blink our eye. All this I am expressing through the mind; it is not exact. But I cannot express with words more of the truth that I have realised.</p>
<p>I wish to say only that to enter into any level of samadhi is infinitely easier than to transform the human consciousness into the divine consciousness. That I have been trying to do, you have been trying to do, the Supreme has been trying to do. All of us here are trying for only one thing, and that is the transformation of human nature — physical, vital, mental and psychic. When that is done, perfect Perfection will dawn both here on earth and there in Heaven.</p>
<p>How can this transformation take place? Through aspiration. The world has to aspire, creation has to aspire, and only then can the spiritual Masters bring down Heaven onto earth. Heaven, as we say, is a state of consciousness. In samadhi, all is Heaven, all is Bliss, Light, Peace. But when we come down into the world again, all is suffering, darkness, fear, worry. How can we make a conscious connection between this world of ours and the highest state of samadhi? Through constant aspiration. There is no other medicine but constant aspiration, not for a day or two, but for a whole lifetime. To realise God takes many, many incarnations. But when you have a fully realised spiritual Master, it becomes much easier. It may take you one incarnation, or two, or three or four. Otherwise, for a normal human being it takes many, many hundreds of incarnations, even to attain the higher experiences or so-called minor realisations. But a realised Master knows the souls and stays in the souls. Since he can do this, it is easy for him to deal with each aspirant according to his soul’s necessity, for his soul’s development and fulfilment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between samadhi and God-realisation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between samadhi and God-realisation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Samadhi is a realm of consciousness. Many people have entered into samadhi, but realisation comes only when we have become one with the highest Absolute. We can enter into some samadhis without realising the Highest.</p>
<p>Entering samadhi is like knowing the alphabet, but realisation is like having a Ph.D. There is no comparison between samadhi and realisation. Samadhi is a state of consciousness in which one can stay for a few hours or a few days. After twenty-one days usually the body does not function. But once one has achieved realisation, it lasts forever. And in realisation, one’s whole consciousness has become inseparably and eternally one with God.</p>
<p>There are three stages of samadhi: <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi, <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi and <em>sahaja</em> samadhi. <em>Savikalpa</em> samadhi is an exalted and glowing state of consciousness, whereas realisation is a conscious, natural and manifesting state of consciousness. When realisation dawns, the seeker enjoys freedom from the human personality and human individuality. He is like a tiny drop of water which enters into the ocean. Once it enters, it becomes the ocean. At that time, we do not see the personality or the individuality of the one drop. When one realises the highest Truth, the finite in him enters into the Infinite and realises and achieves the Infinite as its very own. Once realisation has taken place, a Master can easily enter into <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi. <em>Nirvikalpa</em> samadhi, too, is not difficult for a God-realised soul to attain. Only <em>sahaja</em> samadhi, which is the highest type of samadhi, is a problem, even for the very highest God-realised souls.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When one is in the highest transcendental samadhi, the physical personality of others disappears. We do not see others as human beings. We see only a flow of consciousness, like a river that is entering into the ocean. He who is in the highest trance becomes the ocean, and he who is in a lower state of consciousness is the river. The river flows into the sea and becomes one with the sea. The one who is enjoying the highest samadhi does not notice any individuality or personality in the others. A human being who is not in this state of samadhi is a flowing river of consciousness, while the one who is in samadhi has become the sea itself, the sea of Peace and Light.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One need not be a realised soul in order to enter into <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi. If someone is a great aspirant and if he has been meditating for many years, he can have <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi. It is not that difficult. <em>Savikalpa</em> samadhi can last for several hours. When Sri Ramakrishna used to touch seekers and give them a kind of trance and samadhi, it was for a few hours. In <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi one does not stay more than a day or two, because it is not necessary and not advisable. Only <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi goes on for seven, eight, nine, ten days, because <em>nirvikalpa</em> samadhi is more important in terms of our inner life.</p>
<p>For a spiritually realised person there is no definite boundary to his <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi. At his will he can come and go. At any moment he can enter, and he can stay a few hours or days. Certainly it is not an easy thing for an aspirant to do, but it is not the most difficult thing for a Yogi. If someone is a realised soul, if he is a real Yogi or spiritual Master or Avatar, for him <em>savikalpa</em> samadhi is just like playing with toys. In his case it is very simple, but for an ordinary aspirant, certainly it is difficult.</p>
