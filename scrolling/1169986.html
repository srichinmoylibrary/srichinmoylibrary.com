<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to tell the school authorities that meditation is not religion; far from it. Religion deals with the physical plane, the vital plane and the mental plane, whereas meditation does not deal with these planes. Meditation deals only with the oneness plane.</p>
<p>As long as we remain in the physical, vital and mental planes, we shall have differences. We shall have confusing, binding and blinding ideas. But if we remain in the world of meditation, which is oneness-reality with God's entire creation, then we far transcend the barriers of religion.</p>
<p>So the young students must know that meditation does not claim that any religion is superior to others. It does not feed the superiority or inferiority of any religion. Meditation feeds only the individuals who cry for God-manifestation and all-loving self-expansion.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is simply impossible to be a good teacher without being spiritual. But spirituality is a vast field. Spirituality does not mean only concentration, meditation and contemplation. It also means an honest life, a moral life, a sympathetic heart. One does not have to be strictly spiritual in order to gain these qualities. One may have these qualities as his inborn right. In that case, one can become a good teacher without being spiritual in the strict or pure sense of the term.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it is the other way around. It is the spiritual life that will further technical education. Technical education is founded on the prosperity of matter, whereas spirituality is founded on the reality of spirit.</p>
<p>God the Spirit came into existence long before God the Matter. Therefore, if the God that is in spirituality comes first in our life, then only will the God who is in technical education be able to prosper. The elder brother has to lead the younger brother to the destination. This is normal and natural. Since the elder brother was born long before the younger brother, he knows the way and he knows the goal. He knows the way and the goal long before the younger brother has even thought of the way or the goal.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The outer education and the inner education can go hand in hand provided one knows what the outer education is and what the inner education is. The outer education is concern for humanity. The inner education is oneness with humanity. If there is no concern there can be no oneness. But if there is oneness, then concern is automatically there.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the ultimate analysis, there is no difference between training and education. Training is preparatory to a fulfilling achievement; education is also preparatory to a fulfilling achievement.</p>
<p>When we train ourselves, we see more light within us and without. When we educate ourselves, we see light within and without. Therefore, both training and education ultimately serve the same purpose.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can create a more spiritual atmosphere in the classroom by telling the children that they have a friend who is coming from a very far, very distant place to visit them. Since this friend is taking so much trouble to visit them, they should be ready to welcome him and offer to him all their love. And when the children ask the teacher who that friend is, the teacher will say, "God, the all-loving Father."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You don't have to memorise with the heart. Just become one with the heart. When you become one with the heart, at that time you are the heart. Then try to become one with the subject that you are studying. Your oneness, your heart's oneness with the subject, is bound to bring to the fore the essence and the substance of the subject. And when both the essence and the substance are brought to the fore, automatically you will be in a position to memorise the thing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If children are unruly and undisciplined, that means that they have consciously or unconsciously surrendered to some undivine force. The undivine force here is restlessness, the mischievous monkey-consciousness. But the force that the restless monkey-consciousness embodies can easily be challenged and overcome by an infinitely higher force. That force is called inner poise.</p>
<p>If the teacher uses his inner poise, no matter how undivine and unspiritual the children are, still he can bring the children under control. When the children behave like animals, if the teacher also becomes an animal and tries to fight them or conquer them with his greater animal power, then he is making a serious mistake. Animal consciousness has to be conquered by human consciousness. Again, it is not actually a matter of conquering; it is a matter of illumining. The animal consciousness has to be illumined by the human consciousness, and the human consciousness has to be transformed and illumined by the divine consciousness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can learn to always listen to our heart if we can consciously make ourselves feel that what we have and what we are is only the heart. And what is the heart? The heart is love, the heart is oneness. If we know that the heart is the only thing that we have and that we are, then all the good qualities of the heart become part and parcel of our reality-life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is absolutely necessary for the parent, the teacher and the child to love one another. The parents, the teacher and the child must all feel that they belong to the same family. The parents were the child's first friends. Then his teacher came to him as a friend. The more friends that the child has, the easier it will be for him to conquer his enemy: Ignorance. So when he gets more friends, new friends, then he must always welcome them.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The quickest way to learn the language of a different country is to love the soul of that particular country. Then you have to love the heart of that country and finally you have to love the consciousness of that country. When the consciousness, heart and soul of the country are loved, immediately the outer vehicle of the country — which is language — tries to befriend the student who wants to learn it.</p>
