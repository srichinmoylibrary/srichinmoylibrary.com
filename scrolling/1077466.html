<h2>Aum</h2>

<p>AUM is the soundless sound. It is the vibration of the Supreme. It is called the Seed-Sound of the Universe, for with this sound, the Supreme set into motion the first vibration of His creation. The teeming universe is sustained perpetually by the creative vibration of the Divine AUM.</p>
<p>The syllable AUM is indivisible, but each portion of it represents a different aspect of the Supreme. The Sanskrit A represents and embodies the Consciousness of the Creator, Brahma; the Sanskrit U. the Preserver, Vishnu; the Sanskrit M, the Transformer, Shiva. Taken together, A U M is the spontaneous cosmic rhythm with which God embraces the universe.</p>
<p>The universal AUM, put forth by the Supreme, is an infinite Ocean. The individual AUM, chanted by man, is a drop in that Ocean. It cannot be separated from the Ocean but nevertheless even the tiniest drop can claim the Ocean as its very own. Chanting AUM, man touches and calls forth the cosmic vibration of the Supreme Sound. When one can hear the Soundless Sound within oneself, when one can identify oneself with it, when one can live within the AUM, one can be freed from the fetters of ignorance and realise the Supreme within and without.</p>
<p>The unknown embraces ignorance with its self-limitation. The unknowable embraces AUM with His absolute Self-revelation.</p>
<p>Without birth is the Supreme; without birth is AUM. Without end is the Supreme; without end is AUM. Immortality is AUM’s universal Identity.</p>
<p>When we are in ignorance, AUM feeds us, for AUM is God. When we are in Knowledge, AUM still feeds us. When we are beyond both ignorance and Knowledge, AUM continues to feed us, for it is the nectar which gives life to creation, born and unborn.</p>

<p>The Self-Division of the Supreme proclaims the birth of creation.</p>
<p>Creation is the descent of Consciousness. Creation is a never-tiring march which marks the beginning of an inner and outer development.</p>
<p>What is evolution, if not the veiled determination of an apparent unconsciousness seeking conscious formation and growth.</p>
<p>Nature is the evolving phenomenon, while Consciousness is its guide in evolution. At each stage, nature transcends the limits of its own species and presses forward to new conquests.</p>
<p>The real development and Progress of life must always sit at the feet of the Dynamic Divine and not at the feet of the Static Divine.</p>
<p>In the march of evolution, each period has a demand of its own. Each incarnation of God fulfils that very demand.</p>

<p>It has been delightfully claimed that: “Love in France is a comedy; in England a tragedy; in Italy an opera serial and in Germany a melodrama.” In the true Indian tradition love has always been a self-offering and a self-fulfilment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Love: human and divine</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Love: human and divine" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Divine Love is a flowering of delight and self-giving.</p>
<p>Human love is the gambol of sufferings and limitations.</p>
<p>Love is a bird. When we encage it, we call it human love. When we allow love to fly in the all-pervading Consciousness, we call it Divine Love.</p>
<p>Ordinary human love with its fears, accusations, misunderstandings, jealousies and quarrels is a fire clouding its own brightness by a pall of smoke. The same human love, arising from the meeting of two souls, is a pure and radiant flame. Instead of smoke, it emits the rays of self-surrender, sacrifice, selflessness, joy and fulfilment.</p>
<p>Human love is often the terrible attraction of bodies and nerves; Divine Love is the ever-blossoming affinity of souls.</p>
<p>Divine Love is detachment; human love is attachment. Detachment is real satisfaction. Attachment is quenchless thirst.</p>
<p>Ascending love, arising from the soul’s joy, is the smile of God. Descending love, carrying with it the passion of the senses, is the kiss of Death.</p>
<p>Human love is usually self-embracing and self-persistent. Divine Love is all-embracing and self-existent.</p>
<p>Love can be as brittle as glass or as strong as Eternity, depending upon whether it is founded in the vital or in the Soul.</p>
<p>Our higher emotions. taken away from their human objects and offered to God, are turned into Divine Nectar by His magic. Our lower emotions, if not transmuted and transformed, are turned into poison by our own hand.</p>
<p>Disappointment skilfully dogs vital love. Satisfaction divinely consummates psychic love.</p>
<p>When our vital wants to see something, it has to look through self-love. When our Psychic Being wants to see something, it sees through self- giving.</p>
<p>Human love says to Divine Love: “I can’t tolerate you.” Divine Love says to human love: “Well, that is no reason for me to leave you.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Love: attachment and detachment</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Love: attachment and detachment" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>If human affection is not always reliable, it is also not always harmful. Foolish is he who thinks that affection should be turned into indifference in order that God might come to him. Alas, he has yet to learn that God is All-Affection.</p>
<p>Affection and attachment need not always go together. An entire rejection of all relations can never be the promising sign of progress towards Realisation.</p>
<p>Controlled desire is good. Better is non-attachment. Best is it to feel oneself removed from the snare of nature. Suppression is as hostile and undeserving as attachment. It is our non-attachment that is the only master of nature.</p>
<p>Desires and hungers have one common enemy: detachment.</p>
<p>Detachment and not possession should be the bridge between you and the object of your love. Spiritual detachment intensifies the seeking of our hearts, purifies the vibrations of our bodies, transforms the ignorance of our consciousness into knowledge.</p>
<p>Granted, loneliness is a kind of spiritual disease. But human association can never be its lasting medicine. The only permanent cure for it is Inner Experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Blue eyes say: “Love me or I die.” Black eyes say: “Love me or I kill thee.”</p>
<p>— Spanish proverb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Red-angered eyes say: “Whether thou lovest me or not, I have come to kill thee.” But soul-illumined eyes say: “I see God in thee and love thee whether thou killest me or not.”</p>
<p>No doubt, life precedes love. But if love does not follow life faithfully, life is no better than death.</p>
<p>Love in the process of its manifestation is conscious truth enjoying itself.</p>
<p>If you ever dare to fight against hatred, then there is but one weapon: Love.</p>
<p>When I love a man, I live within his ever-blossoming heart.</p>
<p>When I hate a man, he lives within my ever-torturing vital.</p>
<p>Love has a power of its own. It can be used to see and feel both the lowest and the highest.</p>
<p>The noblest love of man constitutes his purest vision of God.</p>
<p>Love is always expensive, whether heavenly or earthly.</p>
<p>Like death, man’s love is capable of levelling all ranks.</p>
<p>To have no love for others is in no way a step towards God-Realisation. On the contrary, fellow-feeling helps one considerably to live in the Divine Consciousness.</p>
<p>Vital love lacking in purity is not only a stumbling-block but a dangerous limitation of consciousness that prevents our nature from turning towards the Divine fully and unreservedly.</p>
<p>Marriage is at the mercy of love. At times love allows itself to be caught by marriage; at times it does not.</p>
<p>Ascending love makes friends with the Everlasting. Descending love makes friends with the fleeting breath of death.</p>

<p>It's better to have loved and lost,<br /> Than never to have loved at all.</p>
<p>— Tennyson</p>

<p>But can true love ever be lost? True love enlarges the giver and brings him closer to God, even if he loses the object of his love.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Devotion</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Devotion" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Devotion is the complete submission of the individual will to the Will Divine. Devotion is adoration. Adoration is the spontaneous delight that springs from the heart. Who can be the object of our adoration? God. How can we adore Him? Through our self-surrender.</p>
<p>Man loves. He expects love in return. A devotee loves. But he loves human beings for the sake of his sweet Lord who abides in all. His love breathes in humility, spontaneous joy and selfless service.</p>
<p>Devotion is the feminine aspect of love. It is sweet, energising and complete. Sri Aurobindo says, “After I knew that God was a woman, I learned something from far-off about love; but it was only when I became a woman and served my Master and Paramour that I knew love utterly.”</p>
<p>A devotee sees a circle which is God. He enters into it with his soul’s cry. He then silently comes and stands at the centre of the circle and grows into a tree of ecstasy.</p>
<p>A child does not care to know what his mother is. He just wants his mother’s constant presence of love before him. Similar is the devotee’s feeling for his Lord. Many come forward to help him in his life’s journey. But he cares not for their help. God’s Grace is his sole help and refuge. The tortures of hell are too weak to torment him while he is there with his Lord. His life in hell is a life of perfect bliss. His sufferings and tribulations in Heaven know no bounds if he is there without his Lord beside him.</p>
<p>Devotion is a soul-stirring emotion. It dynamically permeates the entire consciousness of the devotee. Devotion is action. This action is always inspired by the devotee’s inner being.</p>
<p>Devotion brings in renunciation. True renunciation is never a life of isolation. Renunciation is an utter distaste for the animal life of the flesh. It is also a total absence of the ego. A life of true renunciation is a life that lives in the world but does not derive its values from the world.</p>
<p>Devotion is dedication. Dedication gives a devotee his self-fulfilment. Self-fulfilment is God’s infinitude.</p>
<p>Unlike others, a devotee sincerely feels that he has nothing else in his Possession save his desire for God. His desire is his jewel. God’s Grace is His jewel. In offering his jewel to God, the devotee binds God. In giving His jewel to His devotee, God liberates and fulfils him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Surrender</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Surrender" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Surrender knows that there is a guiding Hand and feels that this guiding Hand is ever present. This Hand may strike or bless the aspirant. The surrendered aspirant has discovered the truth that whatever comes from the Supreme is always fruitful of Good and Light.</p>
<p>In life, everything may fail us, but not surrender. Surrender has a free access to God’s omnipotence. Hence the path of surrender is the perfect perfection of protection.</p>
<p>Surrender has the strength to meet the Absolute and stay and play with Him eternally. God may at times play hide-and-seek with man’s other divine qualities, but never with His devotee’s genuine surrender.</p>
<p>Inner surrender transforms life into an infinite progress. It gives life the soulful assurance that life lives in God and God alone.</p>
<p>Surrender is the soul of the devotee’s body. Surrender is the unparalleled fulfilment of the devotee’s life. Surrender takes I him to the Source. When he is in the Source, he becomes the Highest and reveals the Deepest.</p>
<p>Individuality hates surrender. Surrender illumines individuality. Individuality is self-will. Self-will is self-love. Surrender is God-Will. God-Will is God-Love.</p>
<p>Surrender is the purest devotion that sees through the eye of intuition. Surrender is freedom, perpetual freedom, for it always stays with God, in God and for God.</p>
<p>The eye of surrender does not see the face of the Hostile Forces. It always sees the Face of God’s Compassion, Protection and Divinity. The life of surrender divinely rings true. It is always filled with abiding inspiration, revealing aspiration and transcending realisation.</p>
<p>Surrender is the wisdom that sees and becomes the Truth. Surrender wishes nothing other than God. Surrender gets pure God. Nothing is as practical as surrender, for it knows the supreme secret that to offer itself integrally to God is to possess God absolutely.</p>
<p>Surrender clings to God with all the might of the soul.</p>
<p>Surrender clings to God with all the love of the heart.</p>
<p>Surrender clings to God with all the will of the mind.</p>
<p>Surrender clings to God with all the dynamic energy of the vital.</p>
<p>Surrender clings to God with all the snow-white emotions of the body.</p>

<p>The occult power is taught, as it were, in God’s private Primary School; the spiritual power in His High School; the omnipotent Will in His University.</p>
<p>An occultist, in wielding his power from one plane to another, flies faster than sound. The Yogi, embracing each plane of consciousness, marches forward more confidently than a commander.</p>
<p>The occultist, fighting endless battles for supremacy over the vital planes of consciousness, develops a rigid and inflexible mind. Difficult, if not impossible, is it for him to have an amenable and adaptable consciousness.</p>
<p>The Yogi alone knows how to attain an inner level of poise. He alone can embrace the Infinite.</p>
<p>An occult power and a spiritual freedom often fight shy of each other. Occult power is a restricted force used to serve a particular purpose. Spiritual freedom reveals the universal consciousness in its vast totality.</p>
<p>The march of time bows to the occultist; the glory of distance surrenders to him; the secrets of humanity prostrate before him. Yet strangely enough, the occultist himself finds no escape. He, too, has to sit at the feet of the Omniscient Vision and the Omnipotent Will.</p>

<p>The Occultist says, “God is a deer.”</p>
<p>The Yogi says, “God is also a tortoise.”</p>
<p>The Occultist says, “God is Power.”</p>
<p>The Yogi says, “God is also Peace.”</p>
<p>The Occultist says, “In my victory, God Himself applauds.”</p>
<p>The Yogi says, “In my victory, God’s Face is a sweet smile.”</p>
<p>The Occultist says, “To me, fear has no existence.”</p>
<p>The Yogi says, “To me, even impossibility has no existence.”</p>
<p>The Occultist says, “My strength is God’s dynamic Will.”</p>
<p>The Yogi says, “My strength is God’s all-sustaining Poise.”</p>
<p>The Occultist says, “My speciality lies in my one-pointed Will.”</p>
<p>The Yogi says, “My speciality lies in my transformed consciousness.”</p>
<p>He is truly a divine warrior who uses not only his occult power as a sword, but also his spiritual power as a shield.</p>
<p>The occult powers used by most primitive tribes are those capacities lying latent in man’s unlit vital nature. They are used to propitiate and battle the beings and elements of the vital worlds. As human evolution is now proceeding along mental lines, most men are no longer interested in the vital plane and have lost the capacity to function there. Generally, they are no longer fascinated by the spell of the vital worlds. Humanity now cares little for the powers below the mind, aspiring, as it does, for a truth and light far above it.</p>
<p>Oh, Black Magician, to me, you are a snake-charmer! If you know the art, the snake becomes your toy. If you err, its venom will reduce you to a piteous victim.</p>
<p>What exactly is ‘black magic'? It is a violent art which has nothing to do with the Divine Will. It can never elevate man’s consciousness, even by a fraction. On the contrary, it ruthlessly harms and blights the consciousness, first of the victim, and later of the magician himself.</p>
<p>Just as it is impossible for a man to square the circle, so is it impossible for an occultist to live always in the sea of divine Peace.</p>
<p>Look at the eyes of an Occultist. He is likely to look care-laden. Look at the eyes of a Yogi. You are likely to observe that peace and serenity flood his atmosphere. Where indeed is the choice between the Occultist’s intensity and the Yogi’s immensity?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Philosophy</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Philosophy" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>All riddles of life can be unriddled, for a sweet concord in secret sports within us mortals.</p>
<p>It is a true truth that life was fast asleep in matter, and mind was fast asleep in life; now without the least hesitation we can say that something lies fast asleep in mind. The wheel of evolution ever moves — it stops not.</p>
<p>Fast asleep in mind lies the Consciousness Divine, fully illumined and patiently awaiting the moment of its unveiling.</p>
<p>When will Nature stop working? She will stop working only when she sees Immortality marching across the giant breast of Death.</p>
<p>Matter is the pride of Europe. Spirit is the pride of India. Neither of the two can possess a complete satisfaction, for the former is in the dark about the potentialities of the Spirit, and the latter about the cogency of Matter. There can be no abiding happiness until Matter and Spirit are amalgamated into one Reality.</p>
<p>Agnosticism is of various types. Fruitful agnosticism has every right to its own teeming knowledge. It is from agnosticism that we come to suspect that an Unknowable Reality engenders all our values: physical, intellectual and spiritual.</p>
<p>We ought to feel extremely happy at the thought that materialism today is no longer an impediment to our upward journey. At most it has the power to make us suffer an indefinite delay. True knowledge has become its soul’s real need.</p>
<p>If we cast aside the pall of ignorance and don the robe of knowledge, we find matter, life and mind to be nothing but energy. Though each has a world of its own, there is no yawning chasm separating them.</p>
<p>From its very beginning, Consciousness has been consumed with the snow-white desire to bestow on man a deathless Life, an infinite Knowledge, and an omnipotent Power.</p>
<p>God, the Inner Pilot, hides within us with His Vision of Unity, Omniscience and Omnipotence. And in His own time, He will appear before us. Doubtless we are ignorant of our ultimate aim. Yet for all our ignorance, we are proceeding in all our activities towards our Goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Realisation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Realisation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Experience is a rented house, while Realisation is a permanent Palace.</p>
<p>If you have sincerity, God-Realisation becomes easy. And in addition to sincerity, if you have patience, God-Realisation becomes easier. And in addition to sincerity and patience, if you have self-sacrifice, God-Realisation becomes the easiest.</p>
<p>A perfect renunciation and a complete self-surrender are the obverse and reverse of an ambrosial coin.</p>
<p>As the prayer, so the answer. As the sacrifice, so the reward. As the realisation, so the union.</p>
<p>What does liberation teach you? It teaches you that like Purusha, Prakriti is also above all disturbances, although she is to be found ever in the whirlwind of work.</p>
<p>An individual perfection and liberation are far from God’s supreme and ultimate intention. What He wants is the universalisation of the individual perfection and liberation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Immortality</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Immortality" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Consciousness is the only truth that is immortal in mortality.</p>
<p>Speech is the bosom friend of fleeting moments; Silence, the Lover of Eternity.</p>
<p>Hell welcomes the ill-doer. Heaven welcomes the man of virtue. The fulfilment of Immortality welcomes the realised man.</p>
<p>The gods are the divinely individualised branches of the all- sheltering and all-protecting Tree, the Supreme.</p>
<p>An ordinary life plays with ignorance. A religious life plays with rites and ceremonies. A spiritual life plays with the inner planes of consciousness. A divinely transformed life will play with the consciousness of Immortality.</p>
<p>Self-realisation is only the childhood of the greatest Yogi’s Immortality.</p>
<p>What is Immortality? Immortality does not mean that we shall be granted an indefinite prolongation of life with all our human desires fulfilled for the asking. The true Immortality is to live in the Divine and to possess the Divine Consciousness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Guru, part 1</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Guru, part 1" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The man-Guru shows you the Throne of the infinite. The God-Guru makes you sit on the Throne.</p>
<p>The Guru is at once the sigh of unaspiring disciples and the ecstasy of aspiring disciples.</p>
<p>A real Guru is the selfless, dedicated and eternal beggar who begs omnipotence and omnipresence from God to feed his unconsciously hungry and consciously aspiring disciples, in perfect conformity with their souls’ needs.</p>
<p>The Guru has only one compassionate Weapon: Forgiveness. The disciple has three naked swords: Limitation, Weakness and Ignorance. Nevertheless, the Guru wins with great ease.</p>
<p>A man may have hundreds of companions. But a spiritual seeker has only one companion: his Preceptor.</p>
<p>The Guru is the one who closes the Door at the Will of God and opens It to the tears of the disciple.</p>
<p>When you go to a doctor, you must tell him all about the disease you have been suffering from. Otherwise he will not be able to help you fully. Likewise you must make a clean breast of your errors and misdeeds to your Guru. Mere acceptance of a Guru, while you secretly move and act at your sweet will, can be of no avail.</p>
<p>There is no better way for a disciple to serve his Guru than to listen to his advice.</p>
<p>He alone is the real disciple who finds no wrong in his Guru. Being one with the Guru, he discovers his Guru’s Consciousness to be perpetual molasses and he himself a lump of transformed sugar.</p>
<p>The Guru is at once the source of his disciple’s achievements and a most faithful servant of his disciple’s love.</p>
<p>The Guru and the disciple must test each other sweetly, seriously and perfectly before their mutual acceptance. Otherwise, if they are wrong in their selection, the Guru will have to dance with failure and the disciple with perdition.</p>
<p>The Guru is the consolation for the disciple’s despair; also is he the compensation for the disciple’s loss, if there be any, during the seeker’s endless journey towards the all-fulfilling Goal.</p>
<p>The Guru’s love for his disciple is his strength. The disciples’ surrender towards his Guru is his strength.</p>
<p>The Mother aspect of the Guru is sacrifice. The Father aspect of the Guru is compassion.</p>
<p>The Guru is not the body. The Guru is the revelation an manifestation of a Divine Power upon earth.</p>
