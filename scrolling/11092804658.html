<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is God's Will that everything ultimately has to be perfect. He will never be satisfied unless and until He has become perfect in everything. In everything that we do and everything that we become, perfection is of paramount importance.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> True, at every second the Supreme is transcending Himself, but self-transcendence itself is perfection. A child's perfection might come the moment he can crawl. For some time he cannot crawl, and he only lies in his bed crying and crying. But the moment he starts crawling, his mother says, "Oh, now my child knows how to crawl. He is perfect!" Then the same child learns to stand up and stumble, and his mother says, "My child could not even crawl before, and now he is standing up!" In her eyes he has now achieved another kind of perfection. The child eventually starts walking; then he starts marching; then he starts running; then he starts running the fastest. There is no end; in his constant progress is perfection. Each time we reach a goal, that goal is our perfection. Each time we move forward, upward or inward, that is called perfection. So progress is always perfection.</p>
<p>When we start our journey, the first step forward is our goal. As soon as we reach this goal, we achieve perfection. But today's goal, today's perfection, is tomorrow's starting point; and tomorrow's goal becomes the starting point for the day after tomorrow. Continuous progress is perfection. Self-transcendence is the song of constant inner progress and constant outer progress. The Supreme is transcending Himself all the time, going on and on with no end. That is why we call His Life perfect Perfection.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is through constant self-giving that you can march towards your self-perfection. There is no other way. Give yourself to the Supreme soulfully, devotedly and unconditionally, and feel that there is nothing that He will not do for you. And again, even if He does not do anything for you, it is His business. He knows what is best for you. What you think you need is not the right thing. What He thinks you need is the right thing. Your self-giving is absolutely the right thing, because this is the one thing in your life that the Supreme wants from you. So only through self-giving can you march towards perfection.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I ask you to draw a straight line, but you draw a circle instead, then that is not perfection. If you are supposed to draw a triangle, but you draw a square instead, then where is the perfection there?</p>
<p>Again, perfection is in love. The mother loves her youngest child, and to her he is always perfect even though he is at the age where he constantly breaks things, makes noise and causes all kinds of problems. Since my spiritual children love me, to them I am all perfection. When you come to me full of love and devotion, at that time I am all perfection, but when you are angry or displeased with me, at that time you feel that I am all imperfection, totally undivine.</p>

If you realise God for God's sake, if you reveal God for God's sake, if you manifest God for God's sake, this is the heart of perfection. Real perfection lies in God-realisation today, in God-revelation tomorrow and in God-manifestation the day after tomorrow. That is perfection.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How can you water your perfection-tree? Very good! I am proud of you if you already have a perfection-tree. To get a perfection-tree is very, very difficult. It takes millions of years to get a perfection-tree. People cry and cry to get a perfection-tree somewhere, somewhere, somewhere. You have to cry for a perfection-seed in your life. After it germinates, it becomes a tiny plant, then it becomes a sapling and finally it becomes a tree. It takes such a long time to have a tree inside us.</p>
<p>Now, once you have a perfection-tree, if you want to keep it in perfect condition, you have to offer gratitude at every moment. You touch the root of the tree and offer gratitude. With gratitude you touch the foot of the tree, the trunk of the tree, the branches of the tree, the flowers of the tree, the fruits of the tree. When your heart's gratitude comes to the fore, when you become all gratitude, this gratitude is like a flow, a flow of consciousness. When your consciousness is flowing, feel that this gratitude-flow is like a river that is watering the root of the tree and the tree itself. So always it is through gratitude that your consciousness-river will flow and water the perfection-tree inside you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What keeps us from attaining perfection?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What keeps us from attaining perfection?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What keeps us from attaining perfection? It is our self-indulgence. In self-indulgence we feel that there is something absolutely necessary in our life, and that is pleasure. When we cry for pleasure and want to remain in pleasure, to become pleasure itself, perfection is a far cry. But when we cry for divine Joy, Delight, Bliss, at that time we enter into the ocean of perfection. If we cry continuously, we learn how to swim in the sea of perfection.</p>
<p>When we have an inner cry for Delight, we jump into the sea of perfection. This is the first step. But when this inner cry becomes constant, we swim in the sea of perfection. When we keep Joy and Delight as our goal, perfection automatically grows in us, and slowly, steadily we become the sea of perfection. But, what now keeps us from perfection is our fondness for pleasure-life and our indulgence in pleasure-life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Feel that you have a dedicated heart and an illumined soul, and allow the dedicated heart and the illumined soul to work in the mind. Or become one with the dedicated heart and the illumined soul, and then enter into the mind and try to transform the doubting mind into the searching mind. Then enter into the vital, the aggressive vital, with your searching mind, dedicated heart and illumining soul. Immediately the aggressive vital will become the dynamic vital. Then bring the dynamic vital, searching mind, dedicated heart and illumining soul into the lethargic body. The body will try to respond to the light of the vital, mind, heart and soul. At that time, your body will no longer sleep. It will cry for more light and keep its eyes wide open to receive more light from above.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our inner perfection-life is our constant remembrance of God as the highest Absolute and our feeling of God as the absolute Transcendental. Our outer perfection-life is our feeling of God as the immanent, omnipresent Universal. When you think of inner perfection, go as high as possible; and when you think of outer perfection, spread your wings and become one with everything else. When you think of inner perfection, think of God within you as the transcendental Absolute. When you think of earth-perfection, think of God as the Universal Consciousness. When you have established your oneness with the Universal Consciousness, that is the perfection of your outer life; and when you have established your oneness with the Transcendental Height, that is the perfection of your inner life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you play music, you have to feel you are playing not to satisfy your vital, not to compete with others, not for the applause of the audience and not for name and fame. You have to feel that you are the instrument and the Supreme is playing in and through you. You are His instrument and He is playing you. He is the musician and, at the same time, He Himself is the listener. You have to feel that He is the player, He is the listener, and He is the instrument itself.

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we intensely aspire for perfection without having greed enter in?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we intensely aspire for perfection without having greed enter in?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know the consequences of greed. A child can eat only one piece of bread, but he is so greedy that with greatest difficulty he takes two pieces. As soon as this happens, he gets indigestion because he does not have the capacity to eat two pieces of bread. If you are greedy and want to get God's Light by hook or by crook, or by pulling beyond your capacity, what happens? If you have a tiny vessel inside you, and you try to bring down Peace, Light and Bliss beyond its capacity to hold these qualities, then the vessel gives way. So always you have to see the capacity of the vessel which you have within you. If it has so much capacity, fill it to that capacity. Then gradually, gradually its capacity increases. The capacity of your inner vessel is like the strength of a muscle, which gradually increases as you take exercise.</p>
<p>Now, how can you be free from greed and, at the same time, get what you want in abundant measure? When we suffer from greed, we try to satisfy the individual in us. If I am greedy, at that time I want to eat everything myself and leave nothing for you. The moment greed enters into me, I separate my existence from yours, because greed is the song of individuality. Immediately my individuality starts singing and my individuality starts dancing, and my universality goes away. I want to eat, I want to be strong; I want to be very powerful. But the moment I feel that I am universal-that you, he, she and everyone all comprise my existence-at that time I have twenty mouths at least, and I also have the capacity of twenty stomachs. When I as an individual am greedy, I have the capacity of only one individual. If I get food for twenty people, how am I going to eat it? But when I become universal, at that time I become twenty people, and naturally I can eat the food of twenty people.</p>
<p>The very fact that you are free from greed allows you to enter into something vast and infinite. When individuality goes away, universality comes. Individuality and greed go together, but universality and Infinity go together. We have to feel that greed limits us to such an extent that we cannot eat more than one piece of bread. But we will be really happy only if we can eat twenty pieces of bread, so we have to transform our individuality into universality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What can I do every day to perfect my emotional life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What can I do every day to perfect my emotional life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day in order to perfect your emotional life you have to bring down purity into your system. This purity is the purity of oneness. Begin with oneness with your soul; then try to establish oneness with your heart, then with your mind, then with your vital, then with your body.</p>
<p>Now, when you are trying to establish oneness, you have to see whether the thing with which you are going to establish oneness is perfect. The soul is perfect and the heart is about to reach perfection; but the mind is still far away from perfection, the vital is still far away and the body is also far from perfection. So what you should do is enter into the soul's perfection first and then bring it into the heart. Feel that you have entered into the perfection-river and you are flowing from the soul to the heart. And feel that your aspiration is the river's speed. After you come to the heart, if you feel that you need a little rest because you have already covered such a great distance, you can remain in the heart for a few days or a few months.</p>
<p>When you feel that you are again energetic, use your aspiration-speed, and the perfection-river will start flowing to your mind. Again, if you feel that you have covered a very good distance and need some rest, you can wait indefinitely there. Then, from the mind, you start your journey to the vital, and from there you come to the physical. In this way you proceed like a runner. You come to a place and halt there because you are tired, and after a while you stand up and start running again. If you can journey from your soul to your body, you will have perfection in your everyday life, in every sphere of your life. You have to start from the source, the soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I get rid of the feeling of ego when I work with others who have less capacity than I, and achieve perfection in my dealings with my spiritual brothers and sisters?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I get rid of the feeling of ego when I work with others who have less capacity than I, and achieve perfection in my dealings with my spiritual brothers and sisters?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you are working with your spiritual brothers and sisters at the divine enterprises, please feel that they are equally important in the eye of the Supreme, in the eye of your Master, in the eye of your soul. You have two eyes, and you feel that both are equally important. You don't feel that the left eye is more important than the right eye, or vice versa. When you have two things which you claim as your very own, you try to be impartial. When your left hand and right hand are doing something, you do not separate your right hand and say, "Oh, I don't need my left hand; I need only my right hand." Even if your left hand is weaker, still you claim it as your own. When you claim something as your own, at that time partiality goes away.</p>
<p>Look at your little finger and look at your thumb. Your little finger has very little capacity and your thumb is very powerful, but they have established such oneness with each other, and you have established such oneness with them, that there is no ego involved. You do not identify yourself with your thumb and criticise your little finger. No! Whatever capacity your little finger has comes from God, and whatever capacity your thumb has also comes from God. Ego comes when the feeling of oneness is missing, or when you want to show your capacity to others. If you separate your little finger from your thumb, at that time ego comes into play. If you don't make this separation, you will say that everything and everyone is good in God's eye.</p>
<p>Now, a little child cannot carry a heavy burden on his shoulders, while his eldest brother can. But that does not mean that his father or mother will be less fond of the little child. No! The parents know that God has now given to the child only so much capacity. After a few years the child will grow up and have the same capacity as his eldest brother. If I have the capacity to carry twenty mangoes and my little brother has the capacity to bring only one mango, if I go to my Father with my twenty mangoes, He will not be pleased unless he sees that my little brother has also come carrying his one mango. When He sees that all His children have come together according to their capacity, with twenty mangoes, ten mangoes, five mangoes or one mango, He will be so happy because He is seeing in them the bond of oneness.</p>
<p>So if we want to have perfection, immediately we have to feel our oneness with others. Only by satisfying our Eternal Pilot, the Supreme, can we have perfection. There is no other way. And we satisfy Him only by having the feeling of oneness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does the perfection of the body result in a superman?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does the perfection of the body result in a superman?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The German philosopher Nietzsche used the term 'superman,' but his superman was nothing but a vital force, a vital being that wanted to lord it over the world and rule the world. Sri Aurobindo also wrote considerably about the superman, but his superman is the totally transformed human being. The totally transformed human being will be most luminous, perfect in every way. He will not go through the human process of birth and death. He will not come into the world from human parents: his soul will descend from the psychic world and take a human body, but a perfect one.</p>
<p>So, perfection is only a kind of evolution in nature. But again, real perfection, divine perfection, is not only the transformation of human life, but also the manifestation of the divine Love here on earth. A superman can be perfect in his own way because of his intense aspiration, but absolute perfection in life depends on one's total surrender to God's Will. If we let the Will of God act in and through us, that is called real perfection.</p>
<p>The cosmic gods and goddesses are more powerful than we are, but in absolute terms they are not perfect because sometimes they do not listen to the Supreme. With their own individual will sometimes they act against the Supreme's highest Will. So how can one call them perfect? Somebody is perfect in the category of aspiration; somebody else is perfect in self-dedication; somebody else is perfect in some other inner or outer sphere of life. But absolute perfection lies in our inseparable oneness with, and unconditional surrender to, the Will of the Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I get perfection in my meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I get perfection in my meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just before you start meditating, say four things: "Fear, get out of my life! Doubt, get out of my life! Jealousy, get out of my life! Insecurity, get out of my life! I don't need you and I will never need you."</p>
<p>Then they will all come out of you and ask, "Whom do you want?"</p>
<p>"I want only meditation; I want only God," you will say.</p>
<p>"Now where is the proof?"</p>
<p>"The proof is that I can live without you, but you can't live without me. Jealousy, you can't live without me; that's why you come and take shelter inside my vital. Doubt, you can't live without me; that's why you come and take shelter in my mind. Insecurity, you can't live without me; that's why you come and take shelter in my heart. Fear, you can't live without me; that's why you come and take shelter in my body."</p>
<p>When you challenge these four in a divine way, they say it is beneath their dignity to remain inside you.</p>
<p>"If you can live without us, how is it that we can't live without you?" they ask, and then they go away. At that time you will have your perfect meditation.</p>
