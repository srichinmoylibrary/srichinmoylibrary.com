<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are not bound to ignorance. When our soul enters into the physical world, ignorance enters from without. When we live in the soul there is no ignorance, but when we live in the physical body, in the mind, ignorance makes its presence felt. Then a time comes when you can bring the light of the soul to the fore and start transforming the physical mind. Then ignorance will leave you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Would you explain about how dark forces enter into us and how we open ourselves to them at certain times in our lives, especially when we are about to make a big step spiritually?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Would you explain about how dark forces enter into us and how we open ourselves to them at certain times in our lives, especially when we are about to make a big step spiritually?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dark forces enter into us through various holes. One big hole is called doubt. There are other holes: depression, fear, anger. We are like a building and through these holes the dark forces enter into us. When you want to make a big decision in your spiritual life, the dark forces attack you most vehemently. They know that if you are successful in your spiritual life, then you are entering into the sea of eternal joy and you will be blessed constantly with God's Consciousness. You will be dancing in God's Consciousness; you will be totally freed from bondage, ignorance and death. When you are sleeping, when you are weak, nobody bothers you. But the moment you assert yourself, the moment you show that you are something and want to do something for the world, all the blows will land on you. You are crying to create a new harmony, a new divine fulfilment on earth, and that is the time for the wrong forces to attack. If you are successful, then a new world dawns in you and in the entire humanity. So, at that time the hostile forces want to stop you and prevent you from doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Millions and billions of people in the world are not aspiring. They are leading an absolutely ordinary life. But you have been granted the opportunity to cry for God. If you make an effort, then either you will be successful or you will fail. But if you make a sincere effort with your soulful aspiration, then you are bound to succeed. Your success means boundless realisation, infinite wealth. So why should your enemy-that is to say, darkness-allow you to be the richest person in the world? If you remain like a poor beggar, then they won't bother you. But if you want to be the richest king in the inner world, then they will fight you. At that time darkness becomes more alert and consciously tries to prevent you from realising and achieving the highest and the deepest Truth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The superconscious is the possessor of direct wisdom and clear truth. It is unthinkable to reduce everything to the so-called sex drive. When we enter into the spiritual life with our aspiration, we can see that we are bringing the light of consciousness into our being. Then we will see everything differently. At that time life's occurrences are handled consciously with the light of the soul, instead of looming large as problems constantly to be solved.</p>

<h2>Question: Why do people die when they do?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is like a bird when its cage is broken. The bird flies away. If the body is not making any progress or if the body is not suitable for the manifestation of the soul's light, then the soul leaves the body. Then again, sometimes undivine, hostile forces attack, and break and smash the cage, like mischievous boys. The bird naturally will fly away if the cage is destroyed. There are many hostile forces on earth, and these hostile forces can attack the body and destroy the body untimely. Then naturally the soul will go back to the soul's region. The bird will fly back to its own region. And again, at the proper time it will descend with a new body with new hope, new aspiration and new determination.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What should we do with the body after it dies?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What should we do with the body after it dies?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on where you were born. When you die, your soul-bird flies away from the cage. Once the bird, or the soul, has gone away, you can do anything you want to with the body. When you see that there is no bird inside, the cage is useless. You can break the cage, you can throw it into the sea, you can burn it, you can bury it underground.</p>
<p>Indian Hindus will be cremated. The Western people think that it is good to be buried. In the Parsee tradition they keep the body on the top of the roof, and the vultures and other animals eat the flesh and bones. The members of the family see all this. That is their tradition. Other people, when their own parents die, keep the bodies under the same roof that they sleep under. That is their culture. Who can challenge any culture? Some feel that they don't want to keep bodies of their dear ones around. They feel that they cannot keep a dead body in the same house with living people because it is frightening, and for other reasons. But other people do keep the body in the house. Again, Indians feel that since the body was so kind to them, now they should purify the body. And some people will want to throw the body into water, into the sea or the ocean, because water is consciousness. The body wanted to have infinite consciousness, so they throw the body into the water and let the ocean take care of it. And again, others will think that since the body came from earth, let it go back to earth. This is also true.</p>
<p>Who is wrong, who is right? When the soul goes away you can do anything you want with the body. We are spiritual people, but ordinary people feel that they must get some satisfaction when their dear ones die. Since it is only a matter of a few hours or a couple of days, let the relatives get satisfaction in their own way. If they feel that burning is the best thing, let them do it. If they feel that immersing in water is the best thing, let them do it. It is the individual's choice. Since the bird has left, you can do anything you want to do with the cage.</p>
<p><em>(The following remarks were made after the passing away of a disciple.)</em></p>
<p>Today we shall honour the immortal soul in Asim. Again, who is honouring whom? It is his soul that is giving us the opportunity to think of him, to love him and to become one with him. We are thinking of him, and the Supreme in him is blessing our soul's concern and our soul's oneness with him.</p>
<p>He has gone. Where has he gone? If it is true that he has gone, that he has left us, then it is more true that he lives deep inside us. Look around, you won't see him. But look inside, he is there singing, dancing, playing. I wish to tell the dearest mother, dearest sister, and those of you who are close to him, that if you say that you miss him, you miss him only in the outer world. You can never miss him in the inner world. In the inner world he is more than alive. Each moment his soul is getting an opportunity to think of his next incarnation, his future incarnation. He will come back, his soul will incarnate here in America and we all shall see him. His parents, his sister and the other members of his family will be able to see him and once again they will be able to possess him.</p>
