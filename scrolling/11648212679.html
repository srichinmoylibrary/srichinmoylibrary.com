<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, at times your souls do come to me when you are fast asleep. If it is at all necessary for your physical mind to know why your soul came to me or how much spiritual food it received from me, then either your soul or I will let your physical mind know. If your soul comes to me during your sleep, the following day, early in the morning, you will be in a very cheerful frame of mind without being able to account for it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not a question of five or six hours, but if you really sleep more than your body's necessity, then a disproportionate amount of lethargy attacks your body. Because of this merciless attack, you feel more tired.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In your sleep when you feel that you are half awake, that means you have some mastery over the plane of ignorance and some oneness with the illumination of the inner life. This force keeps you from awakening completely, because it wants you to assimilate Peace, Light and Bliss which it has brought down from above for you. Once it sees that you have assimilated the divine qualities that it has brought down for you, then it helps you wake up and be wide awake to the outer world of aspiring realities.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to meditate well immediately after we wake up, we must take a few deep breaths, and as we breathe, offer most soulful gratitude to the Supreme. But, before we actually sit down to meditate, we have to wash our face and clean ourselves thoroughly in order to chase away all drowsiness from our consciousness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When you look at the disciples, do you see that a lot of them are falling asleep or are they awake but just meditating badly?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When you look at the disciples, do you see that a lot of them are falling asleep or are they awake but just meditating badly?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes their meditation is very poor because there is no aspiration in it. They are not actually falling asleep, they are meditating badly. One or two may be sleeping, but as for the others, their meditation is clumsy and awkward because they are meditating in the mind. They are cherishing all kinds of nonsense, which I call jealousy, insecurity, fear, doubt and anxiety. They may be looking at me most intensely, most devotedly, but for hours or days they have cherished these and other undivine qualities. When they try to meditate, these undivine forces come and say, "Where are you going?" and try to prevent them from entering into the Light.</p>
<p>First you have to empty the inner vessel. If you start meditating without emptying the vessel, naturally those undivine qualities will come to the fore. The best thing is to think before your meditation that you have to throw them out of your system. You don't have to do it here. You can do it on your way, or you can do it at home. Then, when you come to the meditation Centre you will come with purity. Think of it like this-every day you are drinking nectar, which is meditation. Also every day you are drinking poison, which comes in the form of doubt, fear, jealousy, insecurity and emotional vital life. When you drink poison, what is it that saves you, what is the antidote? This antidote is faith-faith in your spiritual life, faith in your spiritual parents, faith in the Supreme. If you have no faith, it is useless. God Himself will not be able to make you realise God. When He comes and stands in front of you, you will doubt Him. If God stands in front of you in a physical form and tells you "I am God," you won't believe it, because in your mind you have established an image of God according to your sweet fancy, and God is not going to come to you to fulfil your sweet fancy. He will come to you in His own way, whatever He feels is the right way for your soul.</p>
<p>When you show a little aspiration, all the forces which you have not conquered at night or on previous days will come and try to hold you back. As long as you are fast asleep these enemies will say, "All right, you sleep. Now we can also take rest." But the moment you become alert, they will say, "Where are you going? You can't go beyond our domain," and they will begin to fight with you. The easiest and most effective way to conquer these forces is to smile inwardly and outwardly, with a sincere smile. If you can smile at your enemy and say, "Oh, you have come! I am ready to conquer you." Then you cannot lose. The greatest strength we have is our inner joy, and this inner joy comes from aspiration and from faith that whatever is best for us will come from the Supreme. So it is not always the outer sleep that ruins the disciples' meditation, but the inner sleep.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> After you meditate you should not be tired. If it is real meditation, you get boundless energy. It will be peaceful and not restless energy; you should not feel tired. If you do, that means you are not meditating correctly.</p>
<p>Suppose you have worked very hard and have accumulated lots of money. You get tremendous joy and power from the money, but if you squander it, then again you will become as poor as you were before. Similarly, while you are meditating you have got Peace, Light and Bliss, the inner wealth. But perhaps you have unconsciously given it all away or thrown it all away. Then you will feel tired.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can we start sleeping very little and still function?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can we start sleeping very little and still function?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly! Spiritual Masters don't sleep more than two or three hours a day. When do they have the time? They don't have the time and they don't need it. Their disciples sleep on their behalf.</p>
<p>I am your spiritual Master, and since I sleep very little, I give you permission to sleep for me. But if it is more than eight hours, I take away the permission. No disciple, no sincere aspirant, should sleep more than eight hours. Seven, six, five-and-a-half hours is sufficient for almost everybody. But if that seems impossible, I say eight hours is the maximum. If you sleep more than eight hours, then you are taking those extra hours away from God and giving them to death.</p>
<p>If you sleep for eight hours, you are getting hardly more than half an hour or fifteen minutes of real sleep, soothing and fulfilling sleep. You don't get real rest; you are just in the world of inconscience. The other day at Columbia University a lady told me that just because she meditates more she has to sleep more. This is absurd. If you meditate more, you will receive boundless inner energy and you will develop the spiritual capacity to conquer sleep.</p>
<p>I had a cousin who used to meditate while lying down on her bed. She would look at the moon and try to meditate for about five minutes. Then she would fall asleep. The following day she would say she had meditated all night while gazing at the moon. She was fast asleep the whole time, but she was under the impression that she had been meditating. When you develop spiritual power you <em>will</em> be able to meditate while lying down. You will even be able to sleep and meditate at the same time. But this is not for beginners. True spiritual Masters allow the body to sleep and separate the soul from it. Their body is sleeping, but their consciousness is absolutely alert. While the body is resting they may be doing many things in the inner world.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for anyone to sleep for more than eight hours. I know this definitely. Why do something unnecessary? It is useless. In this world everybody should be wise enough not to do anything useless. If you are sick, then you can sleep ten or twelve hours a day if necessary, but otherwise no more than eight hours. If you sleep more than that, you are just wasting your precious time, which you could be spending in some spiritual pursuit or in doing something that is necessary. If you sleep more than you need to, you are just offering part of your life to death in advance.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> More than half an hour of meditation is not necessary early in the morning. That is enough. Then you can go and practise running. Everyone, good athletes and bad athletes, should practise in order to inspire others, to transcend their own capacity and to keep the body fit. By practising sports you strengthen your body and draw in more vital energy from the illumining vital world, the dynamic world. This energy will help you in your meditation. It will help you to conquer your lethargy. If you are practising for an hour or so every day, you will definitely need less sleep than you would normally need, and not more. Only if you are practising very strenuously for several hours a day will you need more sleep. You may not be able to beat the fastest runner, but your speed and capacity will increase. The progress you make in this way will help you considerably not only in your outer life, but in your inner life as well.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Early in the morning we should meditate on God the dynamic Power. When God's Power enters into us we will be surcharged with dynamic energy. God's Power will never destroy anybody, but it will give us this dynamic quality which we need. Right now the physical body is wanting in the dynamic aspect of reality. When dynamism enters us we will not need to rest for a minute. This dynamism is extremely necessary if we want to reach our goal as fast as possible. If we concentrate and meditate on God the Power, we will be able to give real life to the time that lies ahead of us.</p>
<p>The nature of the body is to encourage tiredness. Our physical body is so clever if every day you are supposed to go to the playground to take exercise, it will give you twenty reasons why you should not go. The physical mind and the body will give you twenty reasons to justify your lethargy. But if you go deep within, you will see not even one reason is sound. Then, when the hour for taking exercise or meditating is past, these forces go away. Divine wisdom comes to the fore and you feel miserable. At that time the word 'lethargy' is not in your mind. The same forces that inspired you not to exercise or not to meditate come and tell you, now it is too late. If you are sick, sleep according to the body's need. But if you have formed the habit of taking naps, you should break it. Do not surrender to lethargy.</p>

How can we wake up and be alert for meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please get up a little bit early for preparation. Before you start to run, you take all kinds of exercises. We call them limbering up exercises in athletics. For meditation it is also good to do preparation exercises. If six o'clock is your meditation time, feel that at six o'clock the Supreme will fire the starting gun. So before that, if you are not ready, you must take all kinds of spiritual exercises. You can do a little bit of japa, read some of my writings or sing some spiritual songs. If you try to start your meditation the moment you wake up, you will have difficulties. Like a runner who doesn't do preliminary exercises, you will be stiff and slow at the beginning. It is not possible to run the fastest if you have not first stretched your legs and done some limbering up.</p>
<p>Please feel that six o'clock is the time for the race to begin. So if you can get up at five-thirty and spend at least half an hour doing preliminary spiritual exercises before you start to meditate then you will raise your inspiration and aspiration to a satisfactory point and you will be ready to run at six o'clock. Otherwise you will feel inertia and for fifteen minutes or half an hour after you start you will still be half asleep. Then when the referee blows the whistle at the end of the race, you will still be staggering.</p>
<p>This is why it is good for the disciples to meditate at the Centre before I arrive. That is the time for you to warm up. Then when I come it is the time for you to run the fastest. Before that you can prepare yourself inwardly.</p>

Is it very important for me to come to early morning meditation, or should I just try to meditate at another time?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I feel that I don&#039;t meditate well in the morning and my body is both tired and restless. Is it very important for me to come to early morning meditation, or should I just try to meditate at another time?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Early morning meditation is of greatest importance in our spiritual life. When we have a group meditation in the morning, if anybody is extremely tired, exhausted, feeling sleepy, meditating with greatest difficulty, straining their eyes, please do not come. Please meditate at home or sleep if you want to. But if you meditate that way here, you will ruin the divine vibration and the sincere aspiration of your spiritual brothers and sisters. We shall not mind at all if you do not or cannot come in the morning. But if you come, kindly come fully prepared to stay awake and meditate well. In that way you will inspire others and others will inspire you.</p>
<p>If you feel that you are not fully awake and alert, you can try breathing deeply a few times and practise conscious awareness. If you feel that you are falling asleep and enjoying the pleasure of sleep, at that time say, "No, let me enjoy the bliss of meditation instead." When you are falling asleep, you are entering into other worlds, unconscious worlds. Instead, you have to remain in this world and in the world of divine consciousness. There is a very subtle, peaceful movement in meditation. There is life in it; the life that lifts us up toward the goal. But that life is not in the world of sleep.</p>
<p>But you must make it a point, whether you meditate or not, to keep the physical under control. If you can't tame the mind, let the mind roam. But the physical has to be disciplined. You must learn to sit quietly. The noise that you create with your restless body destroys the concentration of the disciples who are ready to receive the Peace, Light and Bliss that I am bringing down. Then you are like an unconscious enemy to them. You do not know the kind of spiritual crime you commit. You are hungry, but you do not realise it, so you are not trying to eat. But others have realised their hunger and are trying to eat. Their souls feel miserable when there are people who are preventing them from eating the divine food.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: It seems that during our group meditations, especially the early morning meditations, everyone is falling asleep instead of meditating. Why do we have so much trouble staying awake, even if we have had five, six or seven hours of sleep?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: It seems that during our group meditations, especially the early morning meditations, everyone is falling asleep instead of meditating. Why do we have so much trouble staying awake, even if we have had five, six or seven hours of sleep?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> More individual aspiration is necessary. As soon as you come to meditate you should feel that you have come to the starting point in your race. When you sit down to meditate, feel that the starter has just fired the gun and now is the time for you to run the fastest. Instead, what most of you do is feel that once you have gotten out of bed and taken a shower and come to the meditation room, you have played your role. You feel that the race is over and now you can relax. But this is absolutely the wrong approach. These things are not even the preparation. The runner does not feel that as soon as he arrives at the track he has run his race and now he can relax. No, he comes to the track with utmost eagerness, and once he arrives there, his eagerness increases. All his energy is focused on running the race, and he does not relax until the race is over.</p>
<p>So please do not feel that you have done your part just by coming to the meditation. You must also run the inner race with utmost eagerness and inspiration. If you feel that you have played your role just by getting up so early in the morning, or just by coming to the meditation, you will never be able to meditate well.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please take it as a golden opportunity. If you feel fresh and energised, just sit up and meditate for fifteen or twenty minutes. This will add to your inner wealth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, you should get up immediately. At that time you should feel that God has knocked at your door. He is paying you an unexpected visit. When God comes and knocks at your door, if you don't respond immediately, He will go to someone else's door and your opportunity will be lost.</p>
