<p>Yesterday, while I was running during the 33-mile race, a member of my road crew was talking to some spectators who were watching from the other side of the fence. One of them said, "The old man is not so bad." That means that although I was running with the young boys, I was not so bad.</p>

<p>After I stopped running last night, I was watching the rest of the 33-mile race. A little boy came up to me and. He was very nice to me and said, "How I wish I could be like you." Then he said, "Did you hear me calling you 'Guru'?" He was only ten years old.</p>

<p>In September or October of 1964, I was running in Woodstock, in a place called Cherry Hill. Believe it or not, my Beloved Supreme began running with me, right in front of me. He was holding a golden wand — like a magic wand. You can call Him my highest part or my separate part, but I was overwhelmed with Light and Delight. This was my first running experience in America. From this concert hall it is only half a mile to where I had that experience.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday, after running about five miles, I was tired and hungry. So I went into a cafeteria for a grilled cheese sandwich. The grilled cheese sandwich was cut into halves, and there was a toothpick in each side. I was reading the Olympic athletes' times in the newspaper, and I didn't see the toothpicks. One toothpick got stuck in the roof of my mouth. How I suffered! The owner of the store, a middle-aged lady, got frightened when she saw my face. I didn't know what had happened. If this experience had lasted a few minutes more, I would have thought about joining my Father in Heaven!</p>

<p>In 1944, when I ran 400 metres, I did it in 56 seconds. In 1946, it was 54 seconds. Then, for years, it was always 53.6 seconds or 53.8 or 53.9. Now, O God, it takes me so long.</p>
<p>I used to do 100 metres in 12.1 or 12.2 seconds. Then, when I was finished I used to laugh and smile and go away. Now, I'm taking 19 or 20 seconds, and I'm not laughing when I finish.</p>

<p>At four o'clock in the morning, I got inspiration to go run. There was another madcap out at the same time; he was roller-skating. Either he is crazy or I am crazy. He was going up and down the 150th Street hill with his dog. The dog followed and chased him up and down the hill. The skater was going this way and that way, zigzagging all over the road. It was very dangerous.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A deceptive ten miles</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A deceptive ten miles" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This morning, starting at about four o'clock, I ran ten miles. Sometimes when I am tired, I enter into Peter's car. But this morning I ran the whole ten miles. I thought I was going fast, but my timing was not good. So I was disgusted.</p>
<p>Around two o'clock this afternoon, Casey all of a sudden said to me, "The measurement of the ten-mile course you ran this morning is all wrong." Three years I have been running that course! Casey said that after the third mile, fifty metres was added. And it was after the third mile that I noticed my timing was becoming worse. Then, after that, there are more mistakes.</p>
<p>I asked, "How is it that you are only telling me now?"</p>
<p>Casey said, "I heard it at the Smile a long time ago, but I was in another world at the time. I am only now remembering it."</p>
<p>Peter said, "That is what I heard too."</p>
<p>Ashrita said, "Yes, we found the mistake a long time ago, but we didn't have time to correct it."</p>
<p>At two o'clock this afternoon they were telling me the news, and I had run early in the morning! When I first used to run the ten-mile route, I didn't care for timing. But now it is a different story. My road crew knew that the measurements were wrong, but they were too frightened to tell me or their sincerity didn't come forward.</p>

<p>It is so unsafe to run — no matter which hour of the day or night you go out! Right after midnight I was going down the 150th Street hill. Three Puerto Ricans were in a car enjoying their music, making unbearable noise. That was not enough! One of them had to throw a large piece of glass at me. I was going very fast down the hill and did not really see what was happening. The glass fell and broke only two or three metres ahead of me. I saw something coming, but luckily it didn't strike me.</p>
<p>Then I was brave enough to go near them and ask, "What are you doing?" I was very serious. They all became like the silent Brahma.</p>
<p>Members of my road crew were so useless. Eight or nine boys from the crew were there, and there were also two or three girls watching. Everyone was standing on the top of the hill. The girls are not to be blamed, but I started barking at the boys: "Idiots! You people all stand there, but no one is at the bottom of the hill." So some of them went to the bottom of the hill, and some stayed at the top.</p>
<p>I said to Peter, "How is it that you didn't go there before?" Peter had the ready-made answer: "We were watching the girls. I had to take care of the girls."</p>

<p>This morning, around five-thirty, the funniest thing happened. I crossed 150th Street and ran my straight one-mile course. When I got to Queens Boulevard and Main Street, an elderly woman began screaming at me. I was running on the street, not on the sidewalk or on her lawn. I wondered, "What have I done at this hour?"</p>
<p>When I finally approached her, I discovered that she was not actually screaming at me. But she wanted me to hear her complaints. Somebody had taken away the cover of her garbage can. She had put all her garbage in the can and now the wind was blowing it away because the cover was missing. I went there and sympathised with her. What could I do?</p>

<p>There is an old man who likes me very much. He lives on 150th Street, and he is partially lame. Whenever he sees me running, he has to say something. The other day, about two weeks ago, he stood up from his chair and said, "You are crazy! In this heat you have to run?"</p>

<p>During our Games Day, I went out for a run and got lost. I saw a girl ahead of me, but I said to myself, "What am I going to ask her? I don't even know the name of the school or the street. Maybe I should say, 'Have you seen hundreds of people playing tennis and other games?'"</p>
<p>I decided just to run by her. Then I noticed that she was wearing a name tag. So I went back and asked her what Centre she was from.</p>
<p>She said, "Connecticut."</p>
<p>Then I asked, "How long have you been a disciple?"</p>
<p>She answered, "One month."</p>
<p>The disciple directed me back to the school. I had to make a few turns, but it wasn't far. So you see, you should all wear name tags. Then, if any of you ever get lost or something happens to you, you will know whom to ask for help.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at four o'clock in the afternoon, I went running on 150th Street. As you know, construction is going on there. When the construction started, we know; but when it will end, we don't know. A middle-aged man said to me, "Boss, why do you have to run? You can't make your boys and girls run for you?" Then he ran with me.</p>

<p>As I was running, three young girls came and stood in front of me. They asked, "Can you please take our picture?" I was running, and they had to come and stand in front of me with an instamatic camera!</p>
<p>Since I have that kind of camera also, I didn't have any difficulty using it. They stood together and I took their picture. But that was not what they had in mind. They wanted something else. "We want you to be in the picture with us," they said.</p>
<p>So I stood with them, two at a time, while the other one took the picture. They know some of the disciples and they have been wanting to meet me for a long time. So they were all very happy and they thanked me.</p>
