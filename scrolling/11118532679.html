<p>This morning in Okinawa I went out running while it was still dark. At one point I saw a series of steps going up a mountain, and I decided to climb them. After I had walked up hundreds of steps, I found a shrine at the top of the mountain. It was not a good place to go in the dark. Even the trees seemed to talk to you, telling you not to visit their mountain. But it was a very nice shrine.</p>

<p>Today I saw at least ten disciples running early in the morning. First I barked at Shephali and Pranika. I was asking them why they were out at that hour, but they didn't understand what I was asking them.</p>
<p>I also saw more than five Japanese disciples running together.</p>

<p>In my morning run today I averaged under a nine-minute pace. Of course, when I walked the pace was slower, but I ran more than I walked. I would run 200 or 300 metres and then walk 40 or 50 metres.</p>
<p>I saw at least 20 disciples while I was running. I saw some girls — Nayana, Sunanda, Begabati and Khudita — running past the four-and-a-half-mile mark, and I did not see them come back. They must have run at least ten miles, and they were going quite fast — definitely under an eight-minute pace. Runners like Sunanda and Snigdha never run at an eight-minute pace — always under! An eight-minute pace is only for us mortals.</p>
<p>I saw Savita and Chetana and said, "All right, you can run 40 or so metres behind me."</p>

<p>Most people I saw running in Japan were very short, and their strides were also very short. They were very slow.</p>
<p>After I came back, the soul of Japan came to me and said she was so grateful that I had come to Japan. She said for that she would grant me a boon: "In this incarnation you will be able to run a marathon in under three hours."</p>
<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>Last night during my 20-mile training run, I tried some homeopathic medicine. As soon as I take that medicine, my mind gets clear. Then, in my nose, eyes, ears and down to my neck, I feel a flowing sensation. But below the neck — to my legs, chest, heart, stomach, thighs, knees — the medicine does not reach. Each time I take it, almost instantly I feel that my head has become light. But unfortunately my head is not carrying my whole body. My chest, legs, heart — absolutely nothing below my neck works better when I take that medicine. For me, nothing works.</p>
<p>Perhaps if I had taken this homeopathic remedy at around ten miles it would have helped me. When I took it at 16 miles, it was too late. It is a cream. At that point a cream will not take away my fatigue quickly.</p>

<p>It was so cold this morning while I was running that I saw almost nobody outside. Only two men greeted me. One said, "Good morning." The other said, "Hi!"</p>
<p>I was dying from the cold. Databir told me to take thick gloves, but I took thin ones. Then I had to put my hands in front of my chest to keep my fingers warm. I haven't run for a few days because I have been afraid of the cold. That means that today I was a brave man.</p>

<p>The registration place was the Holiday Inn in Miami. Savyasachi told me that Bill Rodgers was in the hall, so I got out of the car, thinking, "Let me say hello to him." He was just going out to run and was holding some running shoes.</p>
<p>I said, "Hello. Tomorrow you will be running?" He said, "Yes." I said, "I wish you the best of luck. Someday I wish you to go under two hours. Tomorrow I want you to be first and to go back to your highest glory."</p>
<p>He looked at me and said, "How I wish I could! "</p>
<p>I said, "Tomorrow you will try to do it. Do you recognise me?"</p>
<p>He said, "Yes." He was looking into my eyes very intensely and soulfully. He said, "Sri Chinmoy."</p>
<p>Again I smiled at him and he smiled at me. He thanked me and I thanked him.</p>

<p>After speaking with Bill Rodgers, I took two steps and who was waiting for me? Fred Lebow. I hadn't seen him, but he had seen me speaking to Bill Rodgers. He immediately grabbed my hand and introduced me to the race director. While he was introducing me, he was looking at me so lovingly and intensely. He told the race director, "This is Sri Chinmoy. He conducts races, especially marathons, and all his races are excellent. Whenever we need help, Sri Chinmoy's team always helps us."</p>
<p>The race director said, "Yes, I have heard about him."</p>
<p>Then Fred Lebow told me, "You must come to our club on the fifth of March. We are having a special banquet for excellent runners."</p>
<p>I said to Fred Lebow, "You have to finish tomorrow's marathon in under 3:30."</p>
<p>He said, "My best time is 3:40."</p>
<p>I said, "Isn't your best 3:30?"</p>
<p>He said, "No. Where did you get 3:30? My best is 3:40."</p>
<p>While he was talking to me, he was looking at me with such affection and loving concern. That kind of talk we were having!</p>

<p>After speaking to Fred, I went into the rest room and then I went into the stationery store in the hotel to buy The New York Times. Who came up to me? Fred Lebow again!</p>
<p>He said, "I was looking for you. Here, I am giving you this T-shirt." On the T-shirt was written, "Training for the New York Marathon 1983."</p>
<p>He said, "I want you to have it."</p>
<p>I thanked him. Then I asked, "This time, are you going to Russia to run a marathon?"</p>
<p>He said, "No, not to Russia, but I am going to China next month." In another two weeks he was going to Shanghai to run. He also told me that two weeks earlier he ran a marathon in New Orleans.</p>
<p>I asked him, "Will you run one of our races? Have you ever run in Germany?"</p>
<p>He said, "No."</p>
<p>I said, "We have a few marathons in Germany. I would be so happy and honoured if you could run in one. I also will go once this year."</p>
<p>He said, "If you are going to run, then you let me know and I will come to join you."</p>
<p>He gave me the New York Road Runners Club schedule for the whole year. Then both of us said that we would see each other the next day at the race.</p>

<p>When I went to pay for The New York Times, the funniest thing happened. Somebody had put a New Yorker magazine on top of my New York Times. So for the New York Times the cashier asked me for two dollars. I said, "Oh, in Miami it is so expensive!"</p>
<p>As I was leaving the cashier asked me, "Why are you not taking the New Yorker?"</p>
<p>I said, "I didn't buy it."</p>
<p>Then I saw Fred Lebow coming right behind me with a chocolate bar. He was trying to get his money out of his running shorts. I said, "I am paying for him." It was $1.58 or something. Everything is so expensive in those Holiday Inns. It is better not to buy anything there.</p>
<p>Fred Lebow grabbed my arm and thanked me. Then he said, "Oh, I forgot to tell you. You have to come tonight. I have got a videotape of the New York Marathon that I am showing here."</p>
<p>I said, "Three days ago I saw it in my house. First there were short, short races. Later you were waving your arms in circles. You were so happy and delighted when Salazar and the other big runners were finishing."</p>
<p>He asked me, "Where did you get it?" I said, "One of my students got it." He said, "Very few are released, and I have come here to show it." Then we departed.</p>

<p>The next morning before the race they were making announcements. Mr. Marathon was Bill Rodgers. Then they were saying that some great runners had come from Scotland and Ireland. They also said they were happy to have Fred Lebow running. I was happy that Fred Lebow's name was mentioned. While this was going on, five or six helpers were making such noise!</p>
<p>Three thousand people were running. This is the sixth year they have had this marathon. Five minutes before the race began, the wheelchair racers started. One fellow didn't have legs even. He was lying on his stomach, moving the wheels with his hands.</p>

<p>After two miles I felt as if I had run a whole marathon. The humidity was so bad, and also it was drizzling. I didn't mind the rain, but the humidity was so bad that after two miles I wanted to give up. With greatest difficulty I continued.</p>
<p>After four miles I started running and walking. After nine and a half miles, I was absolutely walking for four or five hundred metres at a time. Then whom did I see? Fred Lebow! He came from behind me. When I saw him, I said, "Oh, you were behind me?"</p>
<p>He started running with me. He asked me how many marathons I had run. I said, "This is my twentieth."</p>
<p>He said, "I am fifty years old and this is my fiftieth marathon."</p>
<p>I said, "I am congratulating you! For each year of your life you have run one marathon."</p>
<p>Then he said, "Look behind me. The man there has run a hundred and one marathons."</p>
<p>I was running with Fred Lebow for some time. I often complain about my stride. His stride is also short, but very quick. He was complaining about the humidity. Finally, he went ahead of me.</p>

<p>There were four or five middle-aged men and women running together. One of the middle-aged ladies, a crazy lady, came from behind me and pushed my elbow. She said, "Sweetheart, don't walk. You can make it. Run!" Then she and her friends went away.</p>
<p>I continued walking and jogging. When I ran, I ran fast, so at some point I must have passed that lady, although at the time I didn't know it. After eleven and a half miles, again she saw me walking. She came and stood in front of me. She was very mad at me and said, "Don't do that! I told you to run!" Her friends were all laughing at her while she was barking at me.</p>
<p>After thirteen and a half miles, I saw the same lady coming in my direction from the other side of the road. She had already made the turn at fourteen or fifteen miles, and she was coming back in the other direction. When she saw me she said, "Honey, I am so glad you are running. Keep running!" Again her friends were laughing, but I could see that she herself was also tired. Although she was telling me to run, she was absolutely dead. When I looked at her face, she looked like she would collapse. God knows how many miles she kept running.</p>

<p>After I saw the crazy lady for the last time, I went about four hundred metres farther, and whom did I see? Fred Lebow. He was practically a mile and a half ahead of me. He said, "Oh, Sri!" His face was so tired. I was not tired because I was walking.</p>
<p>After sixteen miles Saraswati saw him walking, but when I saw him, he was still running.</p>
<p>The humidity was unbearable, but Fred Lebow was encouraging me.</p>
