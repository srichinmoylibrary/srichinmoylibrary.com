  <h2 id="page-title">India: Her Consciousness and Light, part 1</h2><span property="dc:title" content="India: Her Consciousness and Light, part 1" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>What is India’s spiritual message to the world at large? Spirituality. What is spirituality? It is the natural way of truth that successfully communes with the Beyond here on earth.</p>
<p>What is India’s absolutely distinctive possession? Her soul. She lives in the soul, she lives from the soul and lives for the soul.</p>
<p>Where can the world find the real nature of India? In the ever-wakeful domain of the Spirit.</p>
<p>What has made the history of India unique? The most surprisingly unusual continuity of the line of her spiritual seekers and Masters.</p>
<p>What does Indian spirituality teach? It teaches the world to conquer the evil of the lower nature and also to go beyond the good of the higher nature.</p>
<p>Has Mother India any desire? If so, what is it? It is to transcend the human way once and for all, in the ever dynamic way of God, in the way of radical self-transmutation. Religion, however mighty it may be, is not and cannot be the message of India. Her message is self-realisation.</p>
<p>The perfect truth of India’s religion is in her outer and inner realisation of the One that is, of the One that is in the process of becoming.</p>
<p>O world, on your march towards the deepest recesses of your heart! To your amazement, you will find Mother India to be anything but God-fearing. What then is she? She is God-loving! The God-loving soul in God’s all-dreaming and all-manifesting Truth.</p>
<p>The soul of India feels that to be satisfied with intellectual speculation is to remain satisfied with half of the food that is actually needed for health. It is Realisation that gives one a full meal. And to have the Realisation, meditation and concentration are of paramount importance.</p>
<p>Indian philosophy, in its sublimest sense, is nothing short of the practical realisation of the Truth.</p>
<p>There is just a hyphen between the Vision of the Vedic seers and the soul of India. Also between India’s spirituality and the final spiritual liberation of the world.</p>

<p>They say that India long ago lost the Milky Way of greatness. But we know that she has now a colossal hope that the overcast sky will clear at last, revealing again the myriad points of light.</p>
<p>What were the chief causes of India’s downfall? She neglected the body-consciousness and eschewed the material life; she narrowed her outlook and sealed herself up in the outworn rituals of the past; she clung to the festering shell of her ancient culture and succeeded in killing its living, growing spirit. And India’s doom was sealed the day she started these practices.</p>
<p>India began to rise the day she turned away from these tendencies and accepted life in all its dynamic aspects.</p>
<p>India will rise fully the day she becomes self-reliant. She knows well that she cannot achieve her goal if she has to depend permanently on alien help. Self-help is the best help. Self-help is God’s own help in disguise.</p>
<p>India has within her a voice that is the self-same, all-fulfilling voice of God. That voice she simply must hear and act up to.</p>
<p>What is actually meant by the emancipation of the Indian woman? It means that she must no longer be alienated from education. She must have free access to the world-wide knowledge of the present day, in addition to the sacred lore of the past centuries. True education helps us to live in the integral perfection which is the very backbone of our existence on earth. The Indian woman must be given a full opportunity to develop and manifest this perfection.</p>
<p>True, consumed with desires and temptations, Europe rushed towards India to acquire her fabulous wealth. It is equally and absolutely true that Europe’s soul came to India with a spiritual seeking and an occult urge to discover what India was actually like.</p>
<p>India has three world-conquering weapons: Non-Violence, Peace and the Wisdom that tells that she is in All as All is in her.</p>
<p>India’s choice is character. But she must feel that she needs personality as well.</p>
<p>Mother India’s fear is not in atomic bombs but in her children’s Self-forgetful amnesia.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, India has perfectly reconciled in herself the two worst antagonists: Renunciation and Epicurianism.</p>
<p>Perfection was the choice of the Greeks. Proportion was the choice of the Romans. Universality is the choice of the Indians.</p>
<p>India is the voice that never falters. Hers is the truth that cannot be silenced by the threatening darkness of centuries. Hers is the heart that sings perpetually the unity of mankind.</p>
<p>India is the vault of an ancient eternal wisdom that has a universal appeal. She is also the universal reserve-bank of an ever-growing wisdom and is destined to be the hub and dynamo of world transformation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Truth and true Knowledge</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Truth and true Knowledge" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A theory must be tested. A fact must be honoured. A truth must be lived.</p>
<p>What is joy today may be sorrow tomorrow. But what is Truth today cannot be Falsehood tomorrow.</p>
<p>There are truths that cannot be expressed in words. Likewise there are truths that should not be expressed untimely in words.</p>
<p>There has been a very long-enduring tug-of-war between two parties. One party consists of Truth, Freedom and Immortality. The other party consists of Falsehood, Bondage and Death. Until now the world has seen God weeping through the eyes of the first party.</p>
<p>Our very life is an ambition to fight out obscurity and ignorance.</p>
<p>The more we inwardly obey, the better we outwardly rule.</p>
<p>Perfection is the conscious annihilation of one’s egocentric self.</p>
<p>To a dauntless soul, life is indeed an enjoyable serpentine winding of the road leading to Truth.</p>
<p>Sacrifice and Freedom-in-Will can and should peacefully move together to reach the palace of Truth.</p>
<p>Teach or preach the Ultimate Truth on its own level. If you reduce it to the footing of a particular listener to make it accessible to his understanding, the power and strength of that Truth will be lost.</p>
<p>Ignorance, however abysmal, always has within it some seeds of truth, however twisted and incomplete. Knowledge, however exalted, until it founds itself in the Gnostic Consciousness, always contains some element of ignorance.</p>
<p>Go deep within yourself and to your great surprise, you will find ignorance. It is a kind of knowledge, of course, but infinitely far from all-fulfilling. Go deep within yourself and to your utter astonishment, you will find knowledge. It is a kind of ignorance, of course, but holding within itself the seeds of True Wisdom.</p>
<p>Ignorance says, “You and I, I and you.” Knowledge says, “You within me, I within you.”</p>
<p>To be sure, the state of ignorance is a conscious, groping aspect of Knowledge in the Divine.</p>
<p>To be conscious means to be aware of the unrealities that go to make one’s nature limited and imperfect.</p>
<p>Unconsciousness, the mentor, allows us to be mere blind instruments. Consciousness, the mentor, teaches us how to be pure, knowing agents. From the birth of man, ignorance has been trying to throw Wisdom into the shade. But Wisdom never retaliates. On the contrary, Wisdom gives ignorance its due value.</p>
<p>Just as education has not made much headway among certain backward groups, even so the cultivation of Self-Knowledge has not made much headway among ill-lit humanity.</p>
<p>Self-revelation is the victorious smile of spontaneous progress.</p>
<p>The vanity of worldly wisdom cannot be removed by ripe old age. It can be removed only by our self-illumination.</p>
<p>In the intensity of love, we can extend our Knowledge and follow the footsteps of God.</p>
<p>If you want bliss, then seek Truth for Truth’s sake alone.</p>
<p>Truth is your Goal. If necessary, get to it even through Hell.</p>
<p>Truth expressed, beauty and love fulfilled.</p>
<p>Everything has death pre-destined for it, save the all-commanding dignity of Truth.</p>
<p>Every falsehood eventually dies in Truth, but Truth once revealed never dies.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Life</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Life" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Life is love. Love is life. Life fulfils God through love. Love fulfils God in life.</p>
<p>Life has an inner door. Aspiration opens it. Desire closes it. Aspiration opens the door from within. Desire closes it from without.</p>
<p>Life has an inner lamp. This inner lamp is called aspiration. And when we keep our aspiration burning, it will, without fail, transmit to God’s entire creation its effulgent glow.</p>
<p>Life has an inner Voice. This Voice is the Light of the Supreme. Life is protection, life is perfection, life is fulfilment when we open to this Light of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Each day is the renewal of life. Each day is the rebirth of our inner assurance that each individual is the chosen instrument of the Supreme to reveal and fulfil the infinite Divine here on earth.</p>
<p>The outgoing life finds nothing but trouble, torture, misery and frustration. The inflowing life discovers the Sea of peace and bliss.</p>
<p>How to start life’s inner journey? With the simple idea, the spontaneous thought that God-Realisation is your birthright. Where to start? Here. From within. When to start? Now. Before the birth of a second.</p>
<p>To illumine our life we need pure thoughts. Each pure thought is more precious than all the diamonds of the world, for God’s Breath abides only in man’s pure thoughts.</p>
<p>Life is always at work. It is ever active, dynamic. It tries to help the soul to complete its yet unaccomplished task, the divine Mission. The soul needs life’s help to unfold itself fully. Life needs the soul’s help to fulfil itself both physically and spiritually.</p>
<p>Birth and death play. They play together. Their game is the game of harmony. And it is always played on the infinite breast of Life.</p>
<p>Brooding and despondency are the worst foes to kill life in all its divine inspiration. No more brooding, no more despondency. Your life shall become the beauty of a rose, the song of the dawn, the dance of the twilight.</p>
<p>God is in life. But life must awaken to the light of His Presence, His Transcendent Feet.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Death</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Death" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Death is natural. Nothing natural can be detrimental. Death is rest. Rest is strength in disguise for a further adventure.</p>
<p>At the present state of human evolution, to conquer Death may be an impossibility. But to overcome the fear of death is not only practicability, but inevitability.</p>
<p>Death is normally the sign that the soul, under the particular circumstances, has exhausted the possibilities of its progress in a particular body.</p>
<p>When the strength of possibility loses to the strength of impossibility, it is called Death.</p>
<p>A useless life is a cordial invitation to Death.</p>
<p>Death is the hyphen between man’s growing fear and his shrinking life-energies.</p>
<p>He who prefers Death to Life has only to climb up the Tree. But he who prefers Life to Death has not only to climb up, but also to climb down again to do God’s work.</p>
<p>When Death approaches a man, his psychic being says to Death, “Death, just wait, let me see what I wish to work out in the next birth.” Death says, “You want life, evolutionary growth. Sorry, you are asking a favour from the wrong person. One second’s delay on my part may add something to your experience!”</p>
<p>Death says that it is immortal. Man’s achievements say, “Death, you are right. But the truth of the matter is that we shine perpetually upon your very breast. Not only that, we shine forever in you, through you and beyond you.”</p>

<p>What am I? I am a climbing cry. Who am I? God’s ever-expanding sky.</p>
<p>If you seek God in God’s own ways, you will meet God as fulfilment. If you seek God in other ways, you will meet God as frustration.</p>
<p>An ordinary man must think logically and act sensibly to prove himself worth living. A spiritual seeker must think intuitively and act divinely to prove himself worth living.</p>
<p>A bridge of steel spans a mighty river. And what is needed to build that bridge? A combination of a creative brain and a vast mathematical knowledge. A bridge of sacrifice spans Heaven and Earth. And what is needed to build that bridge? A combination of God’s Compassion and the seeker’s aspiration.</p>
<p>A sincere seeker of Truth has three inseparable friends: Peace, Faith and Receptivity. Peace says to him: “I shall show you that there is nothing but God.” Faith says: “I shall make you see God within you.” Receptivity says: “What else is God if not all your life?”</p>
<p>A spiritual seeker must know that austerity is an abnormality in as much as it is a disturbance of the natural balance of forces in the different parts of our consciousness. Austerity does not give self-mastery. In true detachment is the real self-mastery. Just as Earth has temptations for an ordinary man, so Heaven has temptations for an advanced seeker.</p>
<p>Experience is the open and conscious eye of a seeker. Realisation is the all-seeing eye of a Yogi. To have an experience of truth is to discover at long last an oasis in the desert of life.</p>
<p>“France has more need of me than I of France,” said Napoleon. Likewise the world has more need of a realised soul than he of the world.</p>

<p>Creation is proud of Man, its crown and peak. Man is proud of his eminence and fulfilment. But in God’s vision, even a self- realised man is only the child of the superman to come upon earth.</p>
<p>Man is the son of an ape! But he will be the father of a superman! But how? Both his fast-mounting yearning and the evolving wheel of Life will be responsible for this mighty transformation.</p>
<p>Man is synonymous with impotence. His goal is a far cry from his natural experience. His present is dead in ignorance. But his future will be dead to ignorance. Today brutality gambols within him; tomorrow Divinity.</p>
<p>Alas, man is not aware of the fact that his sweetness and humility go far, yet cost practically nothing.</p>
<p>Man, in essence, is not ugly. But hard is it for a man to appear beautiful, for he has lost the contact with his soul, the child of All-Beauty.</p>
<p>What is it, after all, that gives to a child his charm and beauty? Is it not the soul’s glow? When that touch gets fainter and is finally lost, he becomes a dull and cautious adult.</p>
<p>Man is by nature a lover. Only he has yet to discover the real thing to love. This quest awakens him to the fulfilment of his real Self.</p>
<p>Who is man after all? The one whose eye will make him Eternal, the one whose heart will throb with Immortality.</p>
<p>The man who is a sincere seeker of the infinite must needs always say: “So little done, so much to do.”</p>
<p>Man has two weapons: hope and despair. With hope he tries to kill the stagnation of incapacity. With despair he can kill the birth of the golden future.</p>
<p>If man’s life is given for living, then Truth can have its inevitable reason for existing.</p>
<p>Man’s joy in forgiving is a joy worth having. Man’s joy in being forgiven is a joy worth aspiring for.</p>
<p>Neither admiration nor critical penetration can make one see the secrets of another’s life. Self-sacrifice alone can do it.</p>
<p>Man’s unseen strength lies in his hopes. His hope’s strength lies in his sacrifice. His sacrifice’s strength lies in God’s Grace. His Grace’s strength is the All-Fulfilling Delight.</p>

<p>Equality is a shaky bridge between man and woman. Both man and woman desperately need love and love. It is love that is Bliss and never the sense of equality.</p>
<p>Man will be a beggar if he does not get sweetness and sacrifice from woman. Woman will suffer the same fate if she does not get strength and security from man.</p>
<p>If woman’s strength is in the beauty of her tears, then man’s strength is in the sacrifice of his heart.</p>
<p>If woman’s strength is in her silence and reserve, then man’s strength is in his vision and action.</p>
<p>If woman’s strength is in her quick rejection, then man’s strength is in his life’s new orientation.</p>
<p>Man thinks of what to say. Woman thinks of how to act.</p>
<p>Man and woman in ignorant love see only one subtle thief: Time. Man and woman in wise love feel only one faithful and inspiring servant: Time. Man and woman are at their best when they give to each other not only what they have but what they are.</p>
<p>Man brings the message of Heaven. Woman brings the message of Divine Earth. Woman, even in her highest aspect, creates her fulfilment on earth, as Prakriti. It is for her to bring the glorious perfection of heaven to the material base of earth.</p>
<p>Be it in art or literature,</p>
<p>Be it in scholarship or teaching,</p>
<p>Be it in administration and commerce,</p>
<p>Be it in service to society,</p>
<p>Be it in wifehood and motherhood,</p>
<p>Be it in philosophical quest or religious aspiration,</p>
<p>Be it even in spiritual realisation — woman is intended by the Supreme to bring the Divine Perfection to earth. Every sphere and aspect of earth, its grossest needs as well as its subtlest nuances, must feel the touch of woman’s radiant emanation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Problems and difficulties</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Problems and difficulties" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We agonise ourselves in trying to make a problem vanish. God laughs at us. But as soon as we accept a difficulty as inevitable, ordained by Him, it slowly melts away until the day comes when we wonder where it has disappeared.</p>
<p>As soon as you have conquered a difficulty, you will find that it repeats itself on a higher and subtler level. It is the same essential weakness in yourself which you are made to face in a more refined form.</p>
<p>A problem exists only in our own consciousness. The same external situation becomes a problem for me but not for you. Why? Because it disturbs some element of my inner harmony, while yours is left untouched.</p>
<p>There is no other way to spiritual success than to sit at the feet of Patience, trusting to her lords, Time and Progress.</p>
<p>Adversity makes you dynamic. Adversity forces your eyes wide open. Adversity teaches you the meaning of patience. Adversity endows you with faith in yourself. Adversity opens the secret door through which you can see the ultimate future fulfilment of God’s Will.</p>
<p>Is there any way left for man to be free? Certainly there is. The moment he feels his mind to be a thought of God, he can be at large like a bird in the sky; his life, however fleeting, is a breath of his Inner Pilot.</p>
<p>Aspiration can be raised to meet the Peace above; but Peace must be brought down to remove one’s difficulties.</p>
<p>Are you casting about for true happiness in life? If so, yield not to reason, yield not to fate, but yield only to the dictates of your inner Voice.</p>
<p>Difficulty is often fed by its master, Distrust. What is the function of Distrust? Its function is to interfere with the action of the Divine Grace.</p>
<p>An absolute surrender to the Divine is the only strength that can help an aspirant to wrestle with all the outer and inner problems of life.</p>
<p>As our very existence depends on God alone, we must be independent of the values of others, the opinions of others, the demands of others.</p>
<p>Today properly guarded can easily escape tomorrow’s snare. It can even nullify yesterday’s stumbles.</p>
<p>To think that pain is a well-deserved punishment is wrong. To think that pain is an unavoidable heritage of karma is worse. To think that pain can never be surmounted is worst of all. Pain is a momentary experience of one’s limited self before it enters into the sea of Bliss.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Art</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Art" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Creation itself is the Art of arts, although unrecognised.</p>
<p>One truth is clear, very clear. Whatever is, is art. How can any creation of the Supreme Artist be a denial of Him? Even beneath the ugliest and the most loathsome shines His all-loving Face of beauty.</p>
<p>Love is the most charming of all arts. Love is so because it is ‘life’ itself and not the translation of life.</p>
<p>Art is the outer vesture of love. Art, like love, is a force of oneness with the infinite. When we create a piece of art, we are really re-creating or reflecting some beauty of the Infinite.</p>
<p>Imagination is an essential attribute of the creative power of the mind. It is that son of the mind that sees a thing before it is brought into the material plane.</p>
<p>Imagination, too, has to surrender to its Master: Will. If it is incapable of that, it can never originate anything.</p>
<p>Art is an exacting goddess that demands one’s offering of heart, mind and body.</p>
<p>Nature is the mother of an artist. She serves the artist with a presentation of her beauties, visible and invisible.</p>
<p>Nature is the unmistakable evidence of evolutionary growth, and growth is the evidence of life; life, divinely organised and governed, is the evidence of art at its highest.</p>
<p>Keats’ address to art: “Thou foster-child of Silence and slow Time” is but half-truth. Art is the child of Silence, no doubt, but it transcends Time.</p>
<p>Beauty without grace is a flower without fragrance.</p>
<p>As man is, after all, an integral being, art has its claim, like knowledge and religion, to be one of his true occupations in life.</p>
<p>Art is creation solidified and concretised.</p>
<p>Art is the joint fulfilment of Truth and Beauty.</p>
<p>Art is the wonderful convincing bridge between the sweetest harmony and the most perfect rhythm.</p>
<p>Physical beauty in a human being is an external manifestation of some inner harmony and truth. This inner beauty is at its highest in the full opening of the soul towards God.</p>
<p>The supreme Art is to know the Supreme Artist intimately, within and without. This knowledge, well-established, cannot but guide all our movements on artistic lines. And this knowledge will be the basis of a perfectly beautiful life within and without.</p>
<p>Art in the most effective sense of the term is a sublime truth that draws our soul from within towards the infinite Vast.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Aspiration</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Aspiration" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Aspiration, in its simplest definition, is a lovely flame climbing Heavenward.</p>
<p>True aspiration can and does make us feel that if God is for us, who can eventually stand against us?</p>
<p>We feel a desire to have God on our side. But we need the aspiration to throw ourselves on God’s side.</p>
<p>Just as the sun is the only remedy for dark clouds in the sky, similarly, there is no other medicine for our troubled hearts than aspiration.</p>
<p>Aspiration is the first rung of the sky-kissing ladder; Realisation is the last.</p>
<p>True human aspiration has three intimate friends: Purification, Quietude and intensity. Aspiration has an enemy called impatience.</p>
<p>Aspiration is the mounting flame of our divine wish to raise ourselves to the crest and crowning of Divine Perfection.</p>
<p>The vital aspires through dynamism.</p>
<p>The mind aspires through self-search.</p>
<p>The heart aspires through the feeling of union.</p>
<p>The soul aspires through the perfection of God’s manifestation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Grace and compassion</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Grace and compassion" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We turn to the Lord for Grace; He looks to us for our sincerity.</p>
<p>A feeble prayer brings down God’s omnipotent Grace. Such is the magnanimity of God’s Compassion.</p>
<p>To a sincere heart, God’s Grace is swifter than a weaver’s shuttle. To an insincere heart, it is slower than laziness itself.</p>
<p>God may be unkindness to those who think, but He is All-Kindness to those who feel.</p>
<p>Although man frequently loses faith in God, He never loses His patience. For He knows well that His Grace is destined to save mankind from the tentacles of its own misery.</p>
<p>Our tears to God are our greatest strength to bring down His adamantine protection.</p>
<p>If one wants to be illumined by one word from the lips of God, then that word is Compassion.</p>
<p>Although we are accountable to God for all our conscious and Unconscious actions, God, being the Father, finds no better way of dealing with us than to accept, with His benign Compassion, our never-ending errors.</p>
<p>We may not see God personally. But if we can realise the relation between His Grace and His Power, it is as good as seeing Him.</p>
<p>We offer our surrendered helplessness to God from below. He showers blessings on us from above.</p>
<p>God’s Grace and God’s Justice have been rivals right from the birth of creation. But it goes without saying that His Justice can never keep pace with His Grace.</p>
<p>Aspirant! If evil has an access to the mid-ocean and to the sky, God’s all-pervading Compassion has a freer and more embracing access to these places.</p>
<p>Impelled by His strongest Compassion, God takes the feeblest man into His Omnipotence.</p>
<p>The world is partly conscious and partly unconscious of Nature’s blessing. Nature is the conscious and direct blessing of God.</p>
<p>Easy is it for a man to say that God has become ruthless toward him. Blessed would be he who would say that God has never been unwise.</p>
<p>In season and out of season we crack venomous jokes. And God simply smiles. But if ever God cracks a joke — and needless to say, He does so with a set purpose and with the most benevolent intention — we immediately shed bitter tears or become violently angry.</p>
<p>If we think of God’s Justice before we think of His Compassion, our hearts will be mistaken. His Justice wants man to be fully exposed, but His Compassion wants to drop a veil over man’s follies and misdeeds.</p>
<p>The universe is not vast enough for God’s Grace to be buried. Hence It will never disappear.</p>
<p>Our enemy is anger. Anger’s enemy is patience. Patience too has an enemy called ignorance. To be sure, eyeless ignorance also has an enemy, although Unbelievable. What is it? God’s Grace.</p>
<p>The purification of nature by personal effort is to cross over the Sea of Ignorance by a raft. The purification of nature by Grace is to cross over that Sea by an oceanliner.</p>
<p>God’s Compassion is that which comes to all, being fully beyond the touch of human wickedness.</p>
<p>God’s descending Grace and man’s ascending delight are part and parcel of Earth’s evolving consciousness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Delight</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Delight" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Delight is the source of existence. Delight is the meaning of existence. Delight is the language of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.</p>
<p>Delight was our inner past. Delight is our inner present. Delight shall be our inner future. No matter if our outer mind understands not or cares not to understand this self-revealing truth.</p>
<p>Delight is not satisfaction of the mind, the vital and the body. It is something deeper, higher and purer. Delight needs no outer help for its existence. It is self-existent, self-revealing and self-fulfilling.</p>
<p>Delight is the divine bridge between Peace and Power, between Light and Truth, between God’s unmanifested Dream and His manifested Reality.</p>
<p>The aggressive, dynamic and apparently conquering vital excitement is not Delight. Delight is surcharged with a creative consciousness which is at once energising, fulfilling and itself fulfilled. God and I are One when I reach Him through Delight in the plane of Delight. God is the whole, and I am a portion of Him when I reach Him through my soul’s Delight. God is the Boatman and I am the Boat when I reach God through Delight here on earth.</p>
<p>In Delight alone can an aspirant be true to his inmost self. In Delight alone can he feel and understand what God is like. Men speak of God twenty-four hours a day, but not even for a fleeting second do they feel Him, not to speak of understanding Him. If the outer life of an individual can swim in the sea of his soul’s Delight, then only will he feel God’s Presence, and understand Him in His cosmic Vision and absolute Reality.</p>
<p>High, higher and highest is the plane of Delight. With our illumined consciousness, we rise into that plane and become self-enraptured. Having crossed the corridors of sublime silence and trance, we are now one with the Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">An experience of Sri Chinmoy at the age of fourteen</h2><span property="dc:title" content="An experience of Sri Chinmoy at the age of fourteen" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Whenever I had the opportunity, I flew to the edge of the ever-blue sea and took my seat there in solitude. My bird of consciousness, dancing slowly, rose to the sky and lost itself up there.</p>
<p>On that occasion — it was a full-moon night — as I gazed and gazed upon the blue-white horizon, I found only a sea of sweet and serene light. All was engulfed, as it were, in an infinite Ocean of Light which played lovingly on the sweet ripples.</p>
<p>My finite consciousness was in quest of the infinite and immortal. I drank deeply of Ambrosia and was floating on an illumined ocean. It seemed that I no longer existed on this earth.</p>
<p>All of a sudden — I do not know why or how — something put an end to my sweet dream. No longer did the air emit its honey-like immortal Bliss, for my own depressed thoughts had come to the fore: “Useless, everything is useless. There is no hope of creating a divine world here on earth. It is only a childish dream.” I felt too, that I could not go on even with my own life. This seemed to be nothing but a thorny desert strewn with endless difficulties.</p>
<p>“Why should I suffer these unbearable pains and sorrows here? I am the son of the infinite. I must have freedom, I must have the ecstasy of Paradise. This ecstasy resides ever within me. Why then should I not leave this mortal world for my Eternal Abode in heaven?”</p>
<p>A sudden flash of lightning appeared over my head. Looking up with awe and bewilderment, I found above me my Beloved, the King of the Universe, looking at me. His radiant Face was overcast with sorrow.</p>
<p>“Father,” I asked, approaching Him, “what makes Thy Face so sad ?</p>
<p>“How can I be happy, My son, if you do not wish to be My companion and help Me in My Mission? I have, concealed in the world, millions of sweet plans which I shall unravel. If My children do not help Me in My play, how can I have My Divine Manifestation here on earth?”</p>
<p>Profoundly moved, I bowed and promised: “Father, I will be Thy faithful companion, loving and sincere, throughout Eternity. Shape me and make me worthy of my part in Thy cosmic Play and Thy Divine Mission.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The significance of a birthday</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The significance of a birthday" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The soul comes down. Mother-Earth smiles. Father-Heaven smiles. Father smiles in His divine offering. Mother smiles in Her divine acceptance.</p>
<p>A soul comes not alone. It arrives with God’s Promise and God’s Fulfilment. A new Thought, a new inspiration, a new Light, a new Power and a new Manifestation of God enter into a physical body, the fort of protection.</p>
<p>God once more inspires the soul and energises the body to enter dauntlessly into the battlefield of life with a stronger inspiration, a brighter freedom and a deeper peace.</p>
<p>Each birthday flowers into a special significance. The yet unfulfilled desires of a man knock at the Door of his soul. His soul opens the Door and comes to the fore on this special day.</p>
<p>The Supreme sends Eternity, Infinity and Immortality down into the world to feed His divine child, the soul. Eternity serves the breakfast, Infinity the lunch and Immortality the dinner. Eternity tells the soul where it is, Infinity tells the soul how far to go, Immortality tells the soul when and where to stop.</p>
<p>God dreams in the soul, for the soul. The soul dreams in the body, for the body. The body dreams in the senses, for the senses. The senses say to the body, the physical consciousness: “United we are playing our roles to fulfil you.” The body then says to the soul: “I am coming to fulfil you. Please stay for a while.”</p>
<p>The soul says to God: “I am come. Be pleased to fulfil Yourself in me.”</p>
