  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If I am compelled to adopt a sport which gives me less joy, can my inner progress be as great?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If I am compelled to adopt a sport which gives me less joy, can my inner progress be as great?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your inner progress will always remain the same if you have a good attitude and the right approach to the goal. Because of some injuries or owing to circumstances, let us say that you cannot do the particular thing you want and you have to do something else. At this time you have to know whether you are doing this new thing to please yourself or to please God. If you are doing it to please yourself, then you may feel miserable, for you may feel that the old world which you were compelled to give up has given you so much joy, whereas you will not be able to derive the same kind of joy from your present life.</p>
<p>In my case, for instance, I have been running all my life and have derived tremendous joy from my running life. This new life — bodybuilding — is something totally new to me. I have had to say good-bye to my old, long-established friend and to make somebody else my close and intimate friend. Now, if I approach weightlifting thinking that I have discarded an old friend and am now trying to make a new friend, then naturally I will feel miserable. But there is another approach. I can feel that my old friend has played his role in my outer life, and now I have a new friend who is encouraging me and whom I am encouraging. That does not mean I will have nothing to do with my old friend. No! Still he is deep inside my heart, and whatever joy I got from him or gave to him I still have with me. I am full of love for my old friend and I am full of gratitude to him. But in the outer life, my old friend is unable to help me in any way, and I am unable to help him at the present moment.</p>
<p>With my new friend, which is weightlifting, I now have to establish the same kind of friendship. If I can have the same good will towards my new friend, and if my new friend can have the same good will towards me, then I will make the same progress. Inside the new friend also, I have to feel my inner Guide. Twenty years ago my Inner Pilot asked me to run, and I did it. Now, some unhappy injury is preventing me from running, but these are only outer circumstances. Even while I was in the prime of my running career, if my Inner Pilot had asked me to give up running and do weightlifting, if I had done it cheerfully, then as a seeker I would have made the same progress by doing weightlifting as I made through running. If He wants me to change my career or to change my way of life and to enter into a new field, then I can make the best progress by doing so cheerfully. A seeker can get lasting joy and make the fastest progress no matter what he does if he is doing it because he wants to please God, his Inner Pilot.</p>
<p>If a seeker wants to make progress, he has to identify himself cheerfully with the thing that he is practising, and he has to remember all the time that it is not personal success or personal glory but oneness-joy and oneness-peace that he is aiming at. Since his goal is certain, his approach to the goal should be sincere and direct, and he should throw himself into each activity soulfully, enthusiastically and unconditionally.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Originally I didn’t have any outer teacher, but right now I do have a teacher. Bill Pearl, champion of champions, five times Mr. Universe, is kind enough to teach me. Mr. Pearl has given me a set of exercises. I am a bad student, but he forgives me. The other day I had a talk with him. I told him that I am unable to do all the exercises that he has given me; it is too much for me. But he is very kind. He said, do your own exercises first, and then try to adapt yourself to my schedule.” I am not totally fit for all the exercises that he has given me, but I will definitely start doing them very devotedly and faithfully. So Bill Pearl is now my Himalayan bodybuilding Guru, and my inner Guru is God the Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do you ever have doubts that you will achieve your goals?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do you ever have doubts that you will achieve your goals?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I had the doubtful consciousness, after several attempts I would give up. Doubt I gave up long, long ago. We doubt only when we are afraid of failure. But in my philosophy, defeat and victory we accept with equal cheerfulness. Whether my Inner Pilot wants to give me the experience of failure or the experience of success, I will be equally happy because mine is the way of surrender. If God gets joy by granting me defeat, and I have oneness with Him, then on the strength of my oneness I myself will have joy in my defeat.</p>
<p>It is the same with success. When I defeat my spiritual children in tennis, in no way do I get malicious pleasure. As an individual, if I have victory I am happy. But on the strength of my inseparable oneness with my students, if they are suffering, if they are sad that they have lost to me, I try to take their sadness into myself like a magnet, and then I get tremendous joy. So their defeat I take as my defeat, which is only an experience, and my victory I take also as just another experience.</p>
<p>If I take both defeat and victory as an experience, then doubt cannot enter. If I am unable to do something, it is an experience, and if I am able to do it, this is another experience. So how can doubt come? I see the experience that I get from victory and the experience that I get from defeat as equally good experiences; therefore, doubt cannot torture me. Doubt tortures me only when I say, “What will happen to me if I don’t do something, if I can’t do something?” If I don’t do something, the world is not going to dissolve. And if I do it, the world is not going to be saved. If I lose, the experience I am getting is coming from Above; and if I win, the experience is also coming from Above.</p>
<p>When we can see victory and defeat as equal, then there can be no doubt whatsoever. If I cannot do something, I am happy, and if I can do that thing, I am equally happy — because both are, after all, only experiences that I am getting, and these experiences my Inner Pilot is Himself having in and through me.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First one has to develop inspiration. Right now I am getting inspiration, and I am using it for weightlifting. I can also use it for tennis; I can use it for art; I can use it for composing songs.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You have used the term ’new era’ when talking about your achievements. Could you explain what this means?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: You have used the term ’new era’ when talking about your achievements. Could you explain what this means?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Anything that has been done in the past is recorded and is well appreciated. If a new idea or a new goal enters into a human being, then he becomes the pioneer in that particular field. When people normally speak about an era, they are talking about a period of time when an individual or a group of individuals has achieved certain things. An era depends entirely on the individual achievement or collective achievement that occurred during a number of years. But I see an era in terms of vision. I take an era as the vision of human beings for a certain period in life or in history. If somebody comes with new inspiration and new aspiration, he opens a new door for mankind to look forward and upward and offers a new vision. So ‘new era’ to me means the opening of a new door in our consciousness that allows us to go forward rather than stay with the past. Again, if there is something helpful in the past, we shall not discard it. The old way or traditional way or, let us say, the conventional way, we are not discarding. Because it is helpful and beneficial, we shall accept it. But if somebody discovers something new — a new method, a new approach to reality — then definitely he is embarking on a new discovery. And this new discovery itself brings in a new era.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What would you like our readers to get from the example of your weightlifting?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What would you like our readers to get from the example of your weightlifting?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is very simple. It is said that Indian teachers do not accept society as such. It is said that they do not care for the world but they care only for their spiritual life, that they like to be in the Himalayan caves and practise austerity and so forth. As long as they can get their own realisation, it is more than enough for them. But the philosophy that I have been taught from deep within is different. My philosophy says that we have to be in the world and we have to be for the world. We have to be like a boat. The boat is in the water, but the water does not enter into the boat. This is the boat that is taking us from ignorance to knowledge-shore.</p>
<p>Also I would like to tell the world not to neglect the body-consciousness. God has given us the body. The body is the temple, and the heart is the shrine where the deity within resides. If we do not pay the necessary attention to the body, then the temple will be weak or defective. Without a fit temple, how can you help the presiding deity inside? So I feel that the body must be kept fit. But I will never say that one must have larger-than-the-largest muscles. No, only I say that physical fitness is of paramount importance, and by taking exercise, one can keep the body fit. Again, through my weightlifting I wish to tell the outer world that the world of spirit does exist. People see that my physique is nothing in comparison to the physiques of the professional bodybuilders. Their biceps will be 22 inches whereas mine are not even 14, and their calves will be 18 to 20 inches while mine are 13 ½. Yet I can lift weights that many of them cannot lift So what does it prove? It proves that the inner spirit, or the mental and psychic power, can be of great assistance to the body when it is brought to the fore. Otherwise my physical body would never be able to lift this kind of weight. It is my prayer-life and meditation-life that, through God’s Grace, are enabling me to do this. I am also trying to show that the inner world has to be a source of inspiration to the outer world. They should not be like opposite poles — North Pole and South Pole. No, they have to be united. The body and the soul must go together.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Quite a few people in the past and even in the present have divided the physical and spiritual development.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Quite a few people in the past and even in the present have divided the physical and spiritual development." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People are clever. But cleverness and wisdom are two different things. Seekers in the hoary past wanted their own salvation, their own liberation, their own realisation. The spiritual seekers had problems of their own, but they were able to overcome these problems on the strength of their aspiration. But as soon as they dealt with the world, the problems they encountered were enormous, and they could not cope with them. As soon as they started mixing with human beings who had not reached the highest, they met tremendous problems. So they withdrew. They said, “I will remain at the top of the mango tree. I climbed up the mango tree and now I will eat mangoes to my heart’s content. I am not going to come down to share with you. Your ignorance is like a hungry wolf. If I come down to share with you, then you may devour me instead of taking the mango from me.” So they did not accept the world. Instead, they became clever.</p>
<p>But if a seeker is wise, then he will develop his oneness with the world. The same God who created me also created you. He who gave me the capacity to have illumination is infinitely higher than I am. But out of His infinite Bounty, He gave me the little capacity I have. If He could give me a little capacity out of His boundless Compassion, then will I not share it with you? If I have got something nice from somebody, if I am a good person, then definitely I will share it with others.</p>
<p>If one is a seeker, at every moment the world will ridicule him. But if the seeker feels the necessity, the command from within, to help the world, then he sees that the world is only one step behind him. If he has wisdom-light, on the strength of his oneness he will say to the world, “I know a little more than you; I am a little more aware than you because of my spiritual practice. But we are still brothers.” He takes the outer world as his younger brother and feels that he has a little more knowledge and wisdom. So he tells his brother, “I am not the Father, but I will take you to Him. I am not taking you to myself but to the One from whom I have received my own illumination. I know where our Father is. I will take you to Him, and He will give you Joy. Just come with me.” The spiritual figures must say, “I am not the Goal, but I know the Goal. I am the guide.”</p>
<p>When the mother feeds her child, sometimes the child does not want to eat. But the mother feels it is obligatory on her part to feed her child. Otherwise, the child will not be able to live on earth. Sometimes the child is very bad and will resist the mother in every possible way. But the mother keeps trying because she knows that the child has to eat. Similarly, people who are fully awakened feel it is their bounded duty to be of service to the world, which is their little brother Even though the little brother is not listening to them, they keep trying because they know that they have something really good, which will be of tremendous help to their little brother. This is the attitude of the modern-day spiritual Masters. It is like the mother and the child. You may not accept me, you may kick me countless times, but still I keep coming to you because of my oneness with you.</p>
<p>God gave me my oneness with Him; then He gave me His oneness with His creation. So God the Creator and God the creation are one in my life. God the Creator and God the creation I have to accept together. If society and the outer world are God the creation, then how can we separate them from God the Creator? They are inseparably one, like water and ice.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, I would like to make it very clear to you that I am not a bodybuilder; I am not a weightlifter. I am a truth-seeker and a God-lover. I pray to God and meditate on God daily, and I always wait for His inner Guidance. For the past 15 months, my Inner Pilot, God, has been telling me not to neglect the body but to be of inspiration to the world of strength. That is to say, we have to accept the body as something most important in our life. The spiritual figures of the hoary past neglected the body and the world. They remained in the Himalayan caves or in the forest — in isolated places. They felt that the body is useless and that a seeker cannot derive anything good from the body. But I do not see eye-to-eye with them.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can see that I do not have tremendous muscle-power. I do not have a superb physique. People who lift heavy weights can show large muscles, but I don’t have that kind of developed muscles. What I wish to show by these feats of strength is that prayer and meditation can definitely increase one’s outer capacities. I hope that by doing this I will be able to inspire many people to pray and meditate sincerely as part of their regular daily routine.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, if I can lift this elephant, I will give 100 per cent credit to the Grace of my Lord Supreme, for I know that my physical strength alone is not enough. When I stand in front of a world champion — Mr. Olympia or Mr. Universe — I see how small my muscles are.</p>

Why not lift weights at home?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do lift weights at home, but who is going to know about it or be inspired by it? If I don’t do it in public, then how am I going to inspire mankind? The other day I lifted 400 pounds in my room. Luckily it was recorded on video so we can prove it. We also have an automatic camera that takes still pictures. But if there were no videos and still pictures taken, do you think anyone would believe me?</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The message that prayer and meditation can help them in all aspects of their lives. If they want to become physically strong, then they can gain much by practising prayer and meditation. On the strength of my prayer and meditation, I have been able to build up my strength and to accomplish something in 15 months which otherwise would have taken me 30 or 40 years to do. Or perhaps I would never have been able to do these things. So my message is that if one needs strength, then uncovering one’s inner strength through prayer and meditation is the fastest and most effective way to get it.</p>
