  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can the need for affection and admiration be overcome?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can the need for affection and admiration be overcome?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The need for affection is not bad, but the need for admiration creates problems. We all need affection from God, affection from our dear ones. It is the mutual giving of affection that keeps us alive. Without the mother’s affection, it is impossible for us to live. But without admiration, easily we can live. The absence of affection from our dear ones is simply death. But if somebody does not admire us, no harm. Affection is in the same category as love. But admiration is totally different. When we are admired, the ego can come to the fore and destroy us. But when we are shown affection and loved, at that time our divine qualities increase. So when you get affection and love, you don’t have to worry. But when you get admiration, you have to be careful.</p>
<p>If you want to conquer your need for admiration, you have to feel that admiration is short-lived. Also you have to know that the people who are admiring you today may not be sincerely admiring you. For their own motives they are admiring you. Or you have to feel that this admiration is not leading you to anything; only it is increasing your ego. But if you get sincere love, sincere affection from someone, then your heart is expanding, your joy is increasing. So you don’t have to try to overcome it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is the path to God-realisation through Duality or Non-Duality?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is the path to God-realisation through Duality or Non-Duality?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two ways. The Creator started with one: God the Silence, Brahman. Then, from Silence it came to Sound. In Silence is our realisation. When we realise God, it is God the Silence that we realise. Then again, God the Sound we can also realise. When we realise God as Silence, at that time it is Non-Duality. But when we realise God as Sound, at that time it is Duality. God in his highest Height, God unrevealed is one. But when the One wants to reveal itself, this does not mean that it has come down, no. It can reveal itself on the same plane. God can remain at the top of the tree and then we will climb up to Him to get the fruits. Again, if He wants, God can climb down the tree and enter into the world of multiplicity. When He remains at the top of the tree, we call it Non-Duality. When He comes down to distribute the fruits, we call it Duality.</p>
<p>Silence and Sound go together. If we realise the Silence-aspect, then we see reality as Non-Duality. But if we realise the Sound-aspect, then there is Duality, because manifestation is multiplicity. As soon as the tree has one branch, it becomes dual. Then, when it gets many branches and leaves, it enters into multiplicity. The Self, before it is revealed, is expressed as Silence, as Non-Duality. But when it becomes visible to us, its reality as Silence does not go away. It is only to our vision that it is duality or multiplicity. But its inner Reality as Silence it maintains.</p>
<p>So when you want to realise God as Silence, He is at that time Non-Duality. But when you want to realise God as Sound, then He is Duality. In the field of creativity, in the field of manifestation, God is many. But in the field of realisation, He is One. In the Universal Consciousness, God is many. In the Transcendental Consciousness, God is One. If you want to realise Him as One, then He is ready. At that time you will see Him as one Height. If you see Him spreading His Arms, at that time He is becoming many. But He is the same God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I know God’s Will in my daily life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I know God’s Will in my daily life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can know God’s Will in your daily life if early in the morning you offer your utmost gratitude to God for what He has already done for you. When you offer your gratitude-heart, then it expands; and when it expands it becomes one with God’s Universal Reality. Gratitude-heart blossoms like a flower. When the flower is fully blossomed, then you appreciate and admire it. In your case also, when your heart of gratitude blossoms, immediately God is pleased. So if you offer gratitude to God for what He has already done for you, then naturally God’s sweet Will will operate in and through you. Early in the morning, before you meditate or do anything, offer as much gratitude as possible; offer your soulful tears just because you have become what you are now. If you do this, eventually you will become infinitely more than what you are now. So gratitude will be able to make you feel what God’s Will is. God’s Will will act in and through you and God will do everything in and through you, and for you, if you offer gratitude.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can one best overcome negative forces?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can one best overcome negative forces?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can best overcome negative forces just by becoming more aware of positive forces. If you want to conquer darkness, use your light-force. There are two rooms. One room is full of light and the other room is full of darkness. If you want to overcome anything that is negative or destructive, then you don’t go to that room. You go to the one that has the positive aspects of life, that has Light, Peace and Bliss. You go to the room that has the positive qualities. Then all these positive qualities you try to assimilate. Once you are inundated with the positive qualities, then you can enter into the room with the negative forces.</p>
<p>So pay no attention to the negative forces. Pay attention only to the positive forces, positive forces, positive forces. Let the positive forces become extremely powerful in your life; then you will be able to overcome the negative forces. But if in the beginning you start to pay attention to the negative forces, then you will be destroyed.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our relationship to the plant kingdom should be extremely sweet. The plant kingdom has real aspiration. We don’t see the seed; it is under the ground. But when we see the plant, we see how it aspires to become a tree and then how it aspires to have flowers. The Indian scientist J. C. Bose discovered how plants quarrel and fight for their own existence. But here we are dealing with their aspiration.</p>
<p>The relationship between the plant kingdom and your own existence is extremely important, extremely deep, extremely intimate. First you are a child. Because you are a child, you aspire to become physically strong, tall. You are a seed that germinates into a plant. Then you become an adolescent, and all the time you are dreaming of becoming a tree, a spiritual tree. So there is a child in you, a soul, that aspires to become a spiritual banyan tree. Plant life and human life are like two brothers. One human brother and one plant brother are here together. Your plant brother is reminding you of your aspiration. The plant brother is going upward to reach the sky and this helps to increase your own aspiration. It makes you feel that you also have to grow into your divinity to reach the highest.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If someone has brain damage or senility, can he make spiritual progress?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If someone has brain damage or senility, can he make spiritual progress?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spiritual progress does not depend on our physical ability or inability. One can make progress even when one is dying. It is his hour, his life is ending, but still he has inner aspiration, there is an inner cry. So this inner cry can give him progress. Again, spiritual progress one can make even after one has just left the body, provided one has maintained a connection with Mother Earth.</p>
<p>One thing is called conscious progress and another thing is called unconscious progress. If the brain is damaged, our physical mind will not be able to know if we are making progress. When the brain is damaged, we cannot make conscious progress; but unconscious progress is there because the inner heart does not depend on the brain. Only the physical mind will not be able to know how much progress the inner heart has made in and through the physical body. Progress is always noticeable with our inner eye. With our human eye we don’t see the progress, even if there is nothing wrong with our brain. But our inner eye constantly shows us the progress that we have made in each incarnation, no matter how much the physical is suffering.</p>
<p>So if there is inner cry, then there is bound to be some progress. Brain damage or senility cannot stand in the way of our inner progress. Outer progress may be limited with brain damage; how can you expect any progress in the outer life? But in the inner life, as long as one remains on earth, he can make progress if there is an intense inner cry, which does not depend on the brain at all.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You cannot see me clearly sometimes because your meditation is not high. It is like cooking something. If someone is an ordinary cook, then one day he cooks well and the next day he cannot cook well because he is not an expert. But when this same person becomes an expert, he cooks extremely well every day. In the beginning, one cannot dance well; his steps all go wrong. Then a few months later, sometimes he dances perfectly, sometimes he does not dance well. But there comes a time when he becomes a great dancer and he always dances well. So here also, when you continuously pray and meditate, you become an expert. Then you are bound to see me clearly all the time.</p>
<p>A little child can crawl, but his aim is to stand up and walk. Right now he can stand up for one fleeting second and then he falls down. But he knows that his aim is to stand up and walk. Your aim is to see me clearly all the time; that is your goal. Like the child who wants to stand up and walk, if the goal is clear, then you are bound to reach that goal.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can gain aspiration to grow high, higher, highest to reach the sky, and also we can gain patience. The plant wants to grow into a tree, but it cannot grow into a tree overnight. It needs patience. Our aim is to reach the highest goal. This aim for the highest we can learn from the plant kingdom. And, at the same time, what we need is patience. That also we can learn from the plant kingdom. So these two supreme qualities — aspiration to reach the highest and patience to wait for God’s Hour — we will learn from the plant kingdom.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything has a soul. If the time has come for the soul to evolve, then it will be replaced. Nothing remains without a soul. The soul is like the inhabitant of a house. Let us say this is your house. But you are outgrowing this place, or you have become very rich, so you want to live in a better house. You go to another house. Now, poor me, I need to have a house suitable for my own financial background. So I come here, because I cannot afford to go to a better place. Money here is like aspiration. If one soul is aspiring much more powerfully than another soul, then it will go higher. Then another soul, an absolutely raw, beginning soul, is coming to take its place. So all the houses have to be occupied by souls. Nothing remains unoccupied by a soul. When one soul progresses from the rock world, then that rock will not remain dead. Another soul will enter the rock. God every second is constantly creating millions of souls. So that particular rock will be inhabited by another soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I best feel that I am an instrument of the Supreme?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I best feel that I am an instrument of the Supreme?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can best feel that you are an instrument of the Supreme if you can feel that there is no other reality but the Supreme. This is the first step. Then you have to feel that you can live without God, you can live without yourself, but God cannot live without you. A child hides. He is pretending that he can live without the mother but while pretending, he looks around to see if the mother is coming to find him. On the one hand, he pretends that he does not need the mother; that is why he hides. On the other hand, he waits and looks to see if the mother is actually coming to get him. This same child, when he grows into an adolescent, makes the mother feel and makes himself feel that he actually does not need his mother. He can live all by himself. He goes to some school and he does not keep in touch with his mother. But the mother’s heart is always for the son. The son feels that the mother needs him whether or not he needs her.</p>
<p>So if you can make yourself feel that you are needed by God, whether you need God or not, then your problem is solved. It is not your human ego that is saying, “I am very great. I do not need God, but God needs me.” No. Just because God has so much more knowledge and wisdom, He needs you. Just because He is the Creator, He is conscious of His creation. I am not the Creator; therefore, I can forget. The inferior sometimes finds it demeaning to go to the superior because he feels he will lose his individuality. Sometimes the inferior will feel that if he remains aloof, then he will maintain his sense of individuality. But the superior knows that the inferior is not a different reality.</p>
<p>A tiny drop may feel that it will have nothing to do with the ocean. If it mixes with the ocean, it feels the ocean will devour it. Then it won’t exist anymore. But the ocean knows that it consists of all the countless drops; therefore, how can the ocean exclude the tiny drop? Only by virtue of the countless drops has it become the ocean. But the tiny drop wants to maintain its own individuality by staying separate. “If I mix with the ocean, then I will be totally lost. The best thing is to remain aloof.” But if you are sincere, you will feel that you are of God and also that He needs you more, because He is aware of how your existence is part of His, whether or not you are aware of it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I leave the body, I will go to the soul’s world and enjoy a rest. And from there also, as from here, I will not allow sincere disciples to make friends with ignorance, to mix with ignorance. Here, at the foot of the tree, I am begging you not to mix with ignorance. There I will sit on the topmost branch of the tree of Eternal Life and shout down. As I bark at you from the foot of the tree so that you will not do the wrong thing, from there I will do the same; only the place will be different.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we discover and develop our divine qualities?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we discover and develop our divine qualities?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can discover your divine qualities by digging deep within. As a miner digs and gets something, you also can dig. Digging here means your inner cry. When you cry, you dive deep within. And you can develop your divine qualities by constantly crying. In order to discover your divine qualities, you have to cry constantly. And then, when you have a constant inner cry, automatically you will develop all your divine inner qualities. Each time you cry you dig deep within; and when you dig deep within you develop your qualities. So, at every moment, please think of the instrument that digs inside you. It is your aspiration. Just as a miner uses an implement to dig in the ground, you also need a constant inner cry to dig in your heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I have heartfelt love for all humanity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I have heartfelt love for all humanity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can have heartfelt love for all humanity only when you love the Source. God created us. We did not create God. So in order to love all humanity, you have to go to humanity’s Source, God. If you love the root, then only can you love the tree. The root here is God. If you are conscious of the Source and the qualities the Source has, then only can you really love mankind. You cannot love any human being unless and until you love God. If you can make yourself feel that you love God and God alone, and nobody else, then you love everyone, for God is Someone who is inside everyone. If you say you love him or you love her, from that individual love you cannot go to love of God. But from love of God you can go to love of humanity. If you can please and love the Highest, God, then automatically you will be pleasing and loving humanity as well.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is real selfless service?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is real selfless service?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Real selfless service is that which does not expect a favourable result. Selfless service is only for the sake of self-giving; the result will come naturally. If there is an action, there will be a reaction. But the action will be performed not to please ourselves in our own way, but to please God in His own way. We shall act when we are inspired from within. We shall work soulfully and consciously. For seven hours, eight hours, ten hours we shall be inspired from within. If we work without inspiration, then we are working mechanically, like workers in a factory who do not want to be there. We have become another machine. Selfless service is not like that. It is cheerful, soulful, conscious and constant. First it is soulful service; then it is selfless; and finally, when it becomes unconditional and uncaring for the result, then it becomes perfect selfless service. So make it, please, unconditional.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is absolutely certain that everybody will be realised. Not only will every human being be realised, but also all those in the animal kingdom will eventually come into the human kingdom and then they too will be realised. No creation of God will remain unrealised and unillumined. Earth will definitely be illumined; only it is a matter of time. God’s entire creation has to realise God. This is God’s decree. Otherwise, God’s Game will not be complete.</p>
