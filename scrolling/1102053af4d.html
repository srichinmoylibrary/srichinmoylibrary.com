How can you surpass and go beyond Me alone, without Me, when we are eternally inseparable? My sweetest silly child, something more. I tell you, today if you leave Me, tomorrow if you surpass and go beyond Me, the day after tomorrow you will cry for your new Goal.

<p>"Yes, My child, they do have names. The left shoulder is called loving devotion, and the right shoulder is called devoted surrender."</p>

<p>"My child, take their side as many times as you want to. I enjoy both your wild ignorance and your wide wisdom."</p>
<p>"My Lord, here is my question. On behalf of my brothers and sisters, I am asking You this question. Why are You so inaccessible? Why don't You make it easy for my endless brothers and sisters to realise You? You know well how hard it is for them to come to You. Even to think of You is so difficult for them."</p>
<p>"My child, O humanity's advocate, since I don't have any advocate of My own, I have to play the role of My own advocate. My child, I agree with you that it is difficult for your countless brothers and sisters to come up to Me, to My transcendental Height. It is difficult for them even to think of Me.</p>
<p>"But now you have to agree with Me. Just because it is difficult for them to come up to Me, have I not come down to them? Have I not entered into their abysmal ignorance? Where am I now? I am now in their climbing aspiration. Where shall I be? I shall be in their glowing realisation. And where shall I ultimately be? I shall ultimately be in their fulfilling manifestation. And since it is difficult for them to think of Me, I think of them constantly. O humanity's advocate, do you agree with Me?"</p>
<p>"O humanity's Salvation, now I know why I say that Thou art great and Thou art good."</p>

<p>"My Lord, twice I get joy: once when I see You, and once when I think of You. Which one is more important?"</p>
<p>"My child, you have forgotten that you get joy four times. Two you have mentioned; the other two I am going to tell you about: when you work for Me, and when you feel that you are of Me.</p>
<p>"By devotedly seeing Me once a day if you get joy, then for that joy I shall give you seventy out of a hundred. By constantly thinking of Me if you get joy, then for that joy I shall give you eighty out of a hundred. By soulfully working for Me if you get joy, then for that joy I shall give you ninety out of a hundred. But by devotedly, constantly, soulfully and inseparably feeling that you are of Me and of Me alone, you get one hundred out of a hundred. Finally I want to tell you what I get, My child.

<p>"What was your answer, what was your reaction, My child?"</p>
<p>"My Lord, I simply kept quiet."</p>
<p>"My child, indeed you are a fool. Easily you could have told him that I can live without him, too. Further, you could have said to him, 'Look here, my wise friend, in case you ever need God, you will have to pull my God down alone, an impossible task. In case God wants to lift you up, I, your friend, God's son, shall push you from below, and God will pull you from above, a task sooner done than said.'</p>
