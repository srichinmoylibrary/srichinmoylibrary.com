  <h2 id="page-title">Disciple: When we imagine something, is that a mental process?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Disciple: When we imagine something, is that a mental process?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Imagination is not mental hallucination. Hallucinations come from the subconscious plane. This subconscious plane can be in the mind, it can be in the vital or it can be in the gross physical. But when you imagine, there already reality exists. There would have been no scientific discoveries if there had been no imagination. Imagination itself is a reality, but you have to be in the flow of imagination.</p>
<p>There is a world of imagination. Either you enter into that world or you let the world enter into you. Some people sit and try to imagine so many things. But all the time they are using the mind. That is not imagination. Only make yourself receptive and then just fly and fly. But don’t think of going north or south or east or west. Feel that you are in an airplane and that you have just left the ground. Then take the plane in any direction. Do not say, “If I go north, then the plane will crash.” Just throw yourself into the flow of some reality. Feel that there is a flow going on, like river, and just throw yourself into it. That is real imagination. In false imagination, all the time you are limiting yourself. “If I imagine this way, then the world will appreciate me, adore me.” That is false imagination. But if you just throw yourself into the flow, then that is sincere imagination.</p>
<p>Imagination and creation cannot be separated, but you have to know the difference between real imagination and false imagination. Real imagination is a continuous flow. It is flowing, flowing, and you can take as much as you want. But false imagination is when you are trying to grab something, trying to shape something in your own way.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In God’s case, imagination, realisation and manifestation go together. In our case, when we imagine something, it may take many years or even incarnations to give reality to that particular thing. In His case, it is not like that.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no difference. I am an Indian and you are an American, but where is the difference between your heart and my heart? There is no difference if you really use the heart. But if you don’t use the heart, if you use the mind, then you will say that these are two separate entities. Just because I use the heart and you people use the heart, that is why you are in my boat. But if you don’t use the heart, if you use the mind or the vital, I tell you, we won’t be together.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Demons do manifest on the physical plane. Sometimes these undivine forces attack our disciples, and sometimes the disciples leave the Centre. If I see that somebody has been attacked, I use power. Then it frightens the demons and they hide. But I try to trace them and fight against them and, by the Grace of the Supreme, I try to transform them. For demons, like other undivine creations of God, are meant for transformation, not destruction. The very purpose of God’s creation is transformation, not destruction. No creator wants his creation to be destroyed. But the Supreme definitely wants His creation to be transformed, illumined and perfected.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, the same. Some are afraid of water. Some are afraid of other things. We have some absolutely destructive forces even among the disciples. I don’t know how they stay with us. Ramakrishna used to say, “Examine their eyes. If they are a little bit defective, don’t accept them.” If the eyes are defective, they have done something absolutely terrible, the worst type of thing. They have deceived someone or killed someone. We have two or three disciples in one of our Centres like that.</p>
<p>But my name is Compassion. When I see them, I don’t curse them; I curse myself. On that day when I accepted them, they were in absolutely the highest consciousness. There is one person in particular. I felt that if I could transform this one, then good people could easily be transformed.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> These beings are fought with occult power — with occult power that you manifest. They don’t have physical form, but they can damage physical objects. We fight them with occult and vital power: subtle vital power, which is not on the physical plane. We fight entirely with energy, yet people can hear the sound several blocks away. No human being could produce that kind of sound; only vital beings can do it. These subtle beings don’t have physical form, but they can take any form they want. They don’t have a human appearance, but they do have some appearance.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the occult power goes, it is just like a bullet. But the spiritual power is like a large wave. I am telling you this only to give you a rough idea; it is not actually like that. Spiritual power is like a well-trained army. It will cover the enemy’s territory in all directions. But occult power won’t do that. Occult power will see where the person is and just go and strike. But if the person is not there, if by chance the person has moved away, then occult power won’t work; it is all gone. Occult power is like an arrow. If you can’t pierce the person, it is finished. But spiritual power goes this way, that way; it captures the enemy like a very well-trained army.</p>

Or can an ordinary occultist do something?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Occultists also can do it. But there is a difference between occult power and spiritual power. Occult power can do something immediately. But while doing it, you may be breaking something. Spiritual power may take a few hours more, but spiritual power is more powerful. It is like an elephant. Right now the elephant is sleeping. But when the time comes for the elephant to get up, it will show you its strength. Or you can say it is like those heavy wrestlers. They are very lazy by nature; they don’t move. But when they start wrestling, oh God, how powerful they are! Occult power works faster, but with occult power you have to be very, very careful. With spiritual power also you have to be careful. But if spiritual power is properly used, you can rest assured that you will have almost one hundred per cent success. With occult power, you cannot be sure. Occult power sometimes may even turn out to be your enemy. It is like playing with a knife; it is possible to cut yourself. But this will never happen with spiritual power.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Witches are tremendously hostile, destructive forces. They can easily destroy someone if they use a little bit of their witch-power. Then the person won’t be able to budge an inch. Or tongue-power they take away and the person won’t be able to talk. In India they destroy nostrils, ears. Each one has a certain destructive power, but it is not always of the same type. If they want, they can look at someone who is very young, four or five, and then that child is finished. If they want, they won’t give the child any more height. In the circus there are some who are midgets because of witches.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some chant incantations. As we have will power, they also have a kind of will power. They don’t have to use spells. In America I have seen many cases of this. Usually they will operate by creating fear. They are mesmerising people. I have one disciple who had five hostile forces attacking her. Her mother had practised black magic for years. The mother tried to attack her daughter, but she failed because I was protecting her. Then the mother confessed.</p>
<p>The story never ends. The mother had a lady friend who used to go to the same black magic teacher. The lady bought a book of mine and saw my picture. Now this lady has given up this practice and wants to become my disciple. A few days ago the mother came to the Centre out of curiosity because her daughter is with us. The mother saw her friend and asked, “What are you doing here?” The mother’s friend has become a real disciple. Perhaps this mother will change also.</p>
