  <h2 id="page-title">The bargainer</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The bargainer" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Yesterday we went to buy something. I remained in the car and X and Y went inside as my representatives. The man said, "Four hundred dollars." I told them to go back inside and offer him three hundred. The message came back, "Four hundred!" This time I told them to say, "Two hundred." He said, "Three seventy-five." I said, "Two thirty-five."</p>
<p>Finally he told them, "I am not going to sell it for less than three-fifty." So I said, "Then I am not going to buy it. We are going to another place." Then I felt sorry because I liked the thing so much. So I asked them to go back in and offer three hundred. He said, "No, three twenty-five."</p>
<p>So it started again. I was arguing for three hundred, but he wouldn't agree. Finally, he agreed and he sent his assistant, a black man, to talk to me. The man said, "It is very valuable."</p>
<p>I told Y and X, "Let them hate me for bargaining. I always ask for half price, because they always ask for two or three hundred dollars extra." In India everyone always bargains. In America some shopkeepers say nasty things when you try to bargain. But they ask such an inflated price! Why give them so much money unnecessarily?</p>

<p>The other day I went to buy some saris for two disciples. They were thirty-six dollars each. I told the shopkeeper, "No, thirty." The man agreed. Right after that a lady came in and wanted the same sari. He quoted her the same price - thirty-six dollars.</p>
<p>She came in after me, but she wanted to be served before me, so she bought it for thirty-six dollars, and left while I was still standing there.</p>
<p>Then the shopkeeper said that he gave me a better price because I always buy more than one. And he added, "Also, she is an ugly woman. I don't see any beauty in her." That is why he sold the sari to her for thirty-six dollars.</p>

<p>I wanted to buy a steam machine to lose weight. Sanatan took me to Brooklyn, and he got lost going there, so we went to Manhattan on the way from Queens to Brooklyn. Then, once we got there I couldn't believe what a horrible place it was! It was full of old hospital things - everything used and second-hand. Sanatan wanted me to buy a machine that was very large and very old. I was ready to buy it, but then my mother's soul appeared and said, "This is a hospital. You don't have to come to a place like this."</p>
<p>I didn't like the machine at all, but I would have surrendered to Sanatan. But when my mother interfered, I did not buy it. This machine was three times as large as the one I eventually did buy.</p>

<p>Five or six years ago I was in a restaurant in Paris. I was talking to them in English. Because I am an Indian, they also were talking to me in English. Everything was in English. But when an Englishman came in after me, although he was asking questions in English, he was getting the answers in French from them. So you see, they didn't like speaking English. The same thing sometimes happens in England. When a Frenchman comes and asks them questions, they pretend they don't know French even if they know it.</p>
<p>In India Hindi is the official language, but even now many people do not know Hindi. In so many places they can't speak Hindi, but they do speak English. So English saves us.</p>

<p>Yesterday we went to a shoe store in Brooklyn to buy running shoes. They know Tarak there, and they like him very much. The wife has a tremendous soul's connection with Pratibha, and the husband has a tremendous soul's connection with Kanan. While I was talking to them I was seeing their soul's connection with our disciples.</p>
<p>If you go there, you will see on the wall my picture in the New York Marathon. Thousands of people are ahead of me, but I am clearly visible.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The flute</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The flute" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I stopped in London on the way back from India. While I was there, I went to buy a Western flute. The man very politely said to me, "Do you play?" I said, "Yes, I play a little."</p>
<p>He said, "Do you want an expensive one or an inexpensive one?"</p>
<p>I said, "Inexpensive." The most inexpensive flutes were four hundred dollars; the others were twelve hundred and even two thousand or three thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Then he said to me, "If you know how to play, I advise you to go into our studio and play; then you can see if you like the flute. But if you don't know how to play, the best thing is for you to look at it in front of me here." He very nicely suspected me. After I had played for two seconds, he said, "You don't have to play here." Then he took me to the studio.</p>
<p>Whether it was his sincerity or flattery, God knows, but after I played for two or three minutes he said, "You are a concert flautist. You should not play this flute. You should use an open-hole flute."</p>
<p>Inwardly I said, "What is his intention? Those flutes are four thousand dollars. He may just be flattering me to get the money. Flattery sometimes makes you lose your sense of proportion." So I said, "I can't play that kind of flute."</p>
<p>The flute that I was going to buy was three hundred dollars. But he flattered me to such an extent that I decided to get one that cost about a thousand dollars. When I was about to pay the bill, A. came into the store. She said, "A thousand dollars!" But I said to myself, "I sell so many flute tapes. In two weeks I will be able to make this money back. I won't be wasting money. Now I will be able to make more tapes and sell them."</p>
<p>So I bought the expensive flute. Now I am practising on it, and I am already planning to make several more tapes.</p>

<p>When I was in London at a smaller-than-the-smallest shop, I saw a small harmonium. Just for the sake of fun and curiosity, I said, "Can I see the harmonium?"</p>
<p>The man said, "Certainly you can see it, but first you have to tell me if you have ever played one. If you have never played one, I can't allow you to play it. You have to listen to me play it. I will play, and you will hear what a wonderful sound it has."</p>
<p>I said, "Definitely I can play it. Please let me try." It was very small. After playing it I said, "I have four or five harmoniums and this one is infinitely worse than my worst!"</p>
<p>He kept quiet because he saw that I did know how to play.</p>

<p>While I was shopping in London, an Indian really proved to have a good heart. I was buying some saris, and I wanted to pay the owner in American dollars. I was telling him that to simplify things, I would say that two dollars equals a pound. The owner said, "Do you want to make me very rich?"</p>
<p>I said, "Why?"</p>
<p>He said, "It is a dollar eighty-five, and you want to give me two dollars. I don't want you to make me rich!"</p>
<p>Since I was offering, he could have easily agreed. Then he was begging me to drink some juice because it was very hot. I said no, because I had to leave.</p>
<p>He said, "At least take some handkerchiefs from me. Do you have any handkerchiefs?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, I don't have any handkerchiefs."</p>
<p>So he forced me to take three handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>In London I spent half an hour in Barkers looking for a pair of shorts. All the shorts were sizes 32 and 34. A salesman went to look for my size, but after fifteen minutes he came back and said they did not even have one pair in size 30. I was disappointed not to be able to get a pair of shorts, but secretly I was very happy to find that it is so rare for a man to have a size 30 waist!</p>

<p>There were over six hundred people at the concert I gave in Edinburgh the last time I was there. They were very receptive.</p>
<p>Afterwards I was very hungry, but I didn't want to eat much. Sabuj is the manager of a baked potato store, so we went there to eat. After I ate one baked potato, my hunger increased like anything, so I asked them to give me three or four items more. Even that was not enough, and again I asked for more. So this is how I diet when I am travelling.</p>

<p>After the seven-mile race in Scotland, we went to a store where I bought a football for Tejiyan's team. In India I hadn't seen that kind of ball, so I bought it. Janaka and Janani were with me, browsing.</p>
<p>One of the workers came up to me and said, "I am embarrassed, but I would like to ask you something. You have no hair, yet you look so smart and strong. May I know your age?"</p>
<p>I said, "Fifty-one."</p>
<p>He said, "Fifty-one?"</p>
<p>The worker was much younger than me, but he was very fat. He couldn't believe I was over fifty. And he was not just flattering me because I bought the football. He said this to me long before I bought it.</p>

<p>Before leaving for San Francisco, I went with X to buy a new bow for my esraj. There were seven flutes in the store and I decided to buy the cheapest one, which was for beginners. The man said, "Do you want the one in the showcase or would you like to have a new one?" I took the old one, which cost $206. This was the cheapest beginner's flute. It is so useless that I can't play it.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to a coffee shop after I had gone shopping. A lady came in after me and ordered some food. Then she said that she was going to make a phone call. When she came back to the counter the waitress said to her, "Here is your food."</p>
<p>The lady started screaming at the waitress and then went out of the coffee shop. The waitress followed her, also screaming, because the lady had ordered food and had gone away without paying for it. God knows what happened during her phone conversation, but she did not want to eat.</p>

<p>When I was in Maryland, I went to a candle shop and got four or five different items made of wax. At the cash register the shopkeeper asked, as usual, "What else, what else?"</p>
<p>Whenever I stand by the cash register, before they tell me how much I owe them, they always ask, "What else, what else?"</p>
