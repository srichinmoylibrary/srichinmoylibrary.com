<p>Last night I told Pratyaya I would go out running at six-thirty this morning. But then I got inspired to go out at five o'clock, and it was not yet six-thirty when I came back.</p>
<p>I said, "Oh my God, if I do not inform Pratyaya, then she will go out looking for me on the street because she likes to see me run. She will be going on a wild goose chase."</p>
<p>So I phoned her and told her I was already back. She was all ready to go out looking for me, but I stopped her in time.</p>

<p>When he saw me, he said, "Hey, young man! Inside the park a car has been totally smashed. Can you go and see what is wrong?"</p>
<p>I smiled at him. Then he said, "Young man, you cannot go? Then take care, and have a nice day!"</p>

<p>Today, while I was out running I saw a very nice car parked near Flushing Meadow Park. I said to myself, "These people keep their car so clean! I shall have to bless the car."</p>
<p>I put my left hand on the car to bless it. But then, O God, all my fingers became dirty!</p>
<p>From a distance, the car looked so nice.</p>

<p>While I was out walking this morning, I came to an intersection. There was a car coming, so I was going to wait for it to go by. But the driver waved for me to pass first.</p>
<p>As I crossed in front of him, the driver called out, "I know you! You are Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>I smiled and went by. Then he said, "Wait a moment! I want to shake hands with you," and he started coming out of the car.</p>
<p>I said, "Oh no, you do not have to come out of the car." Then I went over to him and put out my hand. He was so surprised that I went to him.</p>
<p>Poor me, I do not know how to shake hands, so I held my hand in a peculiar way. Anyway, he took my hand and shook it. He was of Spanish origin. I think he was a construction worker.</p>

<p>A few days ago I was at Victory Field walking very slowly by the discus area. A man was there talking to his friend. As I passed by, I heard him say, "I believe in God. God speaks to me. And I believe in Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>First he tells his friend that God speaks to him, and then he says he believes in me. I do not know him or his friend, but still he believes in me. Can you imagine!</p>

<p>The Delta Air Lines terminal used to be my favourite place to walk in cold weather. All the workers there liked me. One time the main guard even came up and told me that I would get better exercise if I walked at a difference place in the terminal.</p>
<p>But the assistant manager did not want me to walk there, and he threw me out. He said that I was running, but it was not true.</p>
<p>When I used to go there, I would always see two old ladies who worked in the terminal. Every time they saw me, they would talk to me.</p>
<p>Just the other day one of the ladies saw me. She asked, "Why do you not come anymore?"</p>
<p>I told her, "I am not allowed to come. But now I am going to the USAir terminal. They are very nice to me there."</p>
<p>She was so happy that I had found somewhere to walk.</p>

<p>I said, "I wish to give you a piece of good news. Recently some students of mine from various parts of the world came to New York on your airline."</p>

<p>Then I talked to him about other things, including my meetings with President Gorbachev.</p>

<p>Most of the people who work at the USAir ticket counters near the place where I run are black. An elderly black lady is the supervisor, and there are two other black ladies and one white lady.</p>
<p>The other day I showed them some recent pictures of Sudhahota running with me.</p>
<p>I said, "May I show you something? This is Carl Lewis." They were so happy to see the picture.</p>
<p>Then I was telling them about some of the prominent black figures whom I have met over the years. I mentioned Muhammad Ali and 'Big Man" Clarence Clemons, Mokshagun. I also mentioned Eddie Murphy, Narada, Reverend Jackson and my hero, Jesse Owens.</p>
<p>Then I said, "I know Roberta Flack; she is a very close friend of mine." As soon as I said "Roberta Flack," how thrilled the ladies were. You have no idea how much people love Addwitiya!</p>

<p>After showing the ladies the picture of Sudhahota and me running together, I went back to my chair about twenty metres away and started drawing birds. After a few minutes, the elderly black lady, the supervisor, came up to me and asked to see the picture again. She had brought with her a young white lady who worked under her.</p>
<p>The young lady said to me, "I want to tell you something, but I am afraid and embarrassed." Then she looked at me and said, "You and Gorbachev look alike." Immediately she put her hands over her face and turned away in embarrassment.</p>
<p>I said, "You are right. He is my friend. I have received many letters from him and just the other day I met him in Washington." She said, "But you two look alike!" Look at this! I was only telling them about my black friends. I had not mentioned Gorbachev at all. But this was her intuition.</p>

<p>The other day I went to the USAir terminal to run around 6:15 in the morning. After running, I started drawing.</p>
<p>When I finished drawing, I went to a gift shop fifty metres away to buy a T-shirt for one of my disciples that said 'Titan' or something like that, since that particular disciple likes this kind of thing.</p>
<p>When I came back to my seat, I saw that my notebooks were missing! One contained 5,000 bird drawings and the other had 3,000 drawings.</p>
<p>I went to the nearest ticket counter and asked the lady there, "Did you see anybody take my notebooks?"</p>
<p>She said, "Perhaps the trash collector took them and threw them away."</p>
<p>I said, "They are so important."</p>
<p>She said, "Ask the trash collector." Then I went to another counter. The man there was so nice. He said he would page the trash collector. Finally the trash collector came. He was Puerto Rican. Unfortunately, he did not speak much English and the man who was helping me did not speak Spanish. He was calling the Puerto Rican an idiot, while the poor fellow looked so innocent. He definitely was not the one who had taken the notebooks.</p>
<p>Then I went back to my original seat. By then, the elderly black lady who likes me so much had come to her counter, which is near where I sit. I said to her, "You have to help me."</p>
<p>She said, "Of course!"</p>
<p>I told her, "I have lost two notebooks."</p>
<p>Then she started searching for my notebooks here, there and everywhere. Finally, she found my notebooks on somebody else's counter. I was so moved and grateful.</p>

<p>Later that day I went back to the USAir terminal to give the elderly black lady a big scarf. She knows I am a big shot because she has seen my picture with Sudhahota. But this time I also took the blue book, which mentions all our different activities. I took Govinda as my assistant, along with Sagar and Databir.</p>
<p>When we arrived, the lady who had been so nice to me was busy. From her counter she kept running into the plane and back again. I was wondering when she would be free. When she finally was free, I gave her the scarf.</p>
<p>She said, "Oh, you shouldn't have done it!"</p>
<p>I said, "You were so kind to me. You found something very valuable to me."</p>
<p>Again she said, "But you should not have done it." She was very happy.</p>
<p>I had also brought gifts for the others who had helped me, but I felt miserable because I had not brought anything for the innocent Puerto Rican who got such a scolding. When I was leaving USAir, he happened to walk by, and he raised his broomstick. He did not know that we had found the notebooks. So I said to him, "Gracias, gracias!" Next time I go, I will give him something very nice.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A new kind of candy</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A new kind of candy" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A few days ago, as usual, I went to USAir to run. After I had done my running, I went to my favourite gift store, where I go every day. The man who works there comes from Pakistan. He welcomed me.</p>
<p>I bought a copy of Time magazine and a British newspaper, The Sun. It had an article about somebody who had heard the voice of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Every day I buy a piece of candy for whoever drives me. I usually do not eat any myself, but today I wanted to have some. So I said to myself, "Today I must buy something really new."</p>
<p>I saw something new that looked like chocolate with birds on it. It looked very nice. I said, "One for me and one for Maral!"</p>
<p>Then I said to myself, "Yesterday I promised Saroja that the first thing I would eat today would be one of her brownies." She had baked them for her birthday and left one for me in the refrigerator at my house.</p>
<p>I said, "I have to be a sincere person at least one time." So I decided not to eat the candy until after I ate her brownie.</p>
<p>When I got home, I ate Saroja's brownie and then I said, "Now let me have this candy." But when I opened it up, I saw it was not candy at all. It was a bunch of cards with the pictures of basketball players, saying how great the players were.</p>
<p>O God, this was the candy I got for Maral and myself!</p>

<p>When I was ready to go out walking the day before yesterday, it was quite dark. But I did not turn on the porch light when I put on my shoes. As a result, on my left foot I put a Nike shoe and on my right foot I put something else. Believe it or not, a shoe not only has a sole but also a soul. The soul of one shoe was telling me, "I will hurt you if you wear me." It was addressing me very devotedly.</p>
<p>I asked, "Why?"</p>
<p>The soul said, "Look at your shoes."</p>
<p>When I looked, I saw that I had two different kinds of shoes on. One was already starting to hurt because it was new. The right one was perfect, but the left one was the wrong shoe. So I went back and put on another shoe.</p>
<p>On that day I walked four miles, so definitely the shoe would have hurt me.</p>

<p>I buy such simple things at the gift shop, but they are so expensive. On that day, the magazine, newspaper and two pieces of candy came to $10.59. When the man said, "$10.59," I said, "Stop, stop! I do not have that much. I have only $10."</p>
<p>The Pakistani man said, "Do not worry. Every day you come."</p>
<p>On another day I was going to buy three ties for Gorbachev. The three ties, plus candy and newspapers had come to a little over $40. I only had $40 with me, so I decided to buy only one tie and the other things. Then it came to only $20.</p>
<p>I said to the Pakistani man, "The other day when I did not have enough money, you did not give me a discount. So I had to return something."</p>
<p>He said, "What could I do? That fat lady Louise, was here." He himself is very fat. I said, "That lady is so thin!"</p>
<p>He told me, "She calls me fat, so I also call her fat."</p>
<p>Then he said, "You come from India and I come from Pakistan, and we are friends. But if you had been living in India and I had been living in Pakistan, no good!"</p>
<p>I said, "So many times we have had wonderful conversations. Here there is no India or Pakistan. Here in America we are one."</p>
<p>Then I told him, "Tomorrow I am not going to come. I will be in Canada."</p>
<p>He said, "Do not worry about the 59 cents!"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The useless water bottle</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The useless water bottle" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Yesterday I walked four miles. After I had covered two miles, I felt thirsty. I am supposed to drink every two miles; otherwise, I get cramps. In my pocket I was carrying a small water container. It says, "Press and then turn to open." So I pressed and turned once, then twice. Two or three times I tried to open it, but I could not do so. I was in a very high consciousness. After trying to open it three times, I threw it away.</p>
<p>Then I said, "O God, what am I going to do?"</p>
<p>When I go out walking, I usually take a small amount of money with me. Before I left the house, I had said, "Since I am carrying water, what is the use of bringing any money?" But I took a twenty dollar bill anyway.</p>
<p>I found a small store selling donuts and pretzels. I said, "This place should have something for me." I asked for a Snapple and gave the man my twenty dollar bill. He asked me, "Do you have anything smaller'"</p>
<p>I looked at him pitifully. Then he put his hand inside his pocket and brought out a bundle of one, five and ten dollar bills. So we exchanged smiles.</p>
