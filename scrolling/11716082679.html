  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You have been singing Jiban debata at every concert. Has the soul of the song made progress because you have sung it so many times?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: You have been singing &lt;em&gt;Jiban debata&lt;/em&gt; at every concert. Has the soul of the song made progress because you have sung it so many times?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the case of <em>Jiban debata</em>, it is not like that. I sing that song for a very special reason. I try to become inseparably one with the audience, with all the human beings that are there. And I cry to God on behalf of all of them for His Forgiveness. The individual souls of the audience I take as collective — one unit, one individual. Then I pray, most soulfully I cry on their behalf for Forgiveness.</p>
<p>If you can ask God for Forgiveness every day, you purify yourself. The word 'forgiveness' carries purification. Whether God has forgiven us or not is up to Him, but if we can pray to God for Forgiveness, immediately it purifies our heart. We can pray to God for Forgiveness for the things we did today or yesterday or even for the things that we will do in the future. It is not a joke. It is absolutely necessary. Good seekers do not know what will happen in the future. The next moment they may commit an Himalayan blunder. Right now they are in a very good consciousness, so they pray to God, "Please forgive me now for the things that I am going to do tomorrow."</p>
<p>You may laugh. You do not believe that you are going to make a great mistake tomorrow. But this prayer is absolutely essential. If you ask God to forgive you for the mistakes that you will commit tomorrow, it is like saving money and putting it in the bank. Then, when you really do something wrong, God will see the balance and you can take the money back. Many, many seekers do this. They pray to God for His future Forgiveness. You know yourselves how your consciousness can change. Early in the morning you may be divine. Then, in two hours' time, you become undivine, your consciousness descends.</p>
<p>If you ask God to forgive you for your future mistakes, then when you do make a mistake you will see that your forgiveness-prayer is negating the mistake. But you do not do that. We always stay in the past. We pray to God, "Oh, yesterday I told a lie. Save me, save me!"</p>
<p>But yesterday is gone, now something else is coming. So let us also pray for tomorrow. Prayer is not only for the things that we have done wrong in the past. Prayer also means to look forward. When we pray, we are trying to remove the obstacles that are ahead of us. Already the ones that are behind us we have fought with. Whether we have won or lost, God alone knows, but we do know that our prayer-life and meditation-life are carrying us forward. There if we can have God's Forgiveness, then immediately the way forward will become easier for us.</p>
<p>The past, present and future are all at God's Command. He knows whether or not we are going to make a deplorable mistake in an hour or not. So the best thing is to ask for His Forgiveness. And also, if we can ask God for Forgiveness for future things, then God sees and feels whether we really mean it. He sees whether we have taken His Forgiveness seriously. Otherwise, we go on thinking that we are perfect. Then, all of a sudden, when we do something wrong, we cry, "God, save me! Save me!"</p>
<p>We must come to the point where we can say, "I am not perfect. I can at any moment make mistakes. So the best thing is to ask for God's Forgiveness. If God forgives me today for tomorrow's mistakes then already I have nullified tomorrow's problem by using my wisdom today." This is absolutely true. Tomorrow's mistakes can be nullified if you cry to God today for His Forgiveness.</p>

 <p>
SCA 1135-1138. Questions asked on 31 December 1983 after Sri Chinmoy's talk on the New Year.</p>
<h2>Question: If somebody wants to choose one time of the year to make a new start -— such as your birthday, or the anniversary of our joining the Centre, or our own birthday, or the beginning of the New Year -— are each of these times equally good?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My birthday, your own birthday, the anniversary of your becoming a disciple, the day I came to America — all these are most significant days. Every hour cannot be the same. The way you can meditate early in the morning at six o'clock, you will not be able to meditate at twelve noon, unless you are an expert. Early in the morning, it is quite easy. Later in the day, it is not so easy. It is not impossible, but it is not easy.</p>
<p>When we remain here, in the earth-bound life, we cannot say that every day is equally important. No, every day is not equally important. Some days are bound to be more important than other days. That is why we observe anniversaries and birthdays. When a birthday comes, at that time we say to ourselves, "Why did I come here? Have I made any progress since I accepted the spiritual life? In some fields I have made progress; in other fields I have not made progress, or I have gone backwards."</p>
<p>In your case, you have made so much progress in music. But again, you are losing your spontaneity and childlike consciousness. I am telling you about your progress and backward march for your good. You have made progress in one thing and gone backwards in another. If you had maintained your childlike consciousness, it would have given tremendous joy to your soul. Like this, everybody is a culprit. People have made considerable progress in one thing and in another field they have lost their previous standard and climbed down instead of up.</p>
<p>So you can choose any date you want to make a new start, but once you start, then you have to continue. Otherwise, on your birthday you will try to meditate very soulfully and the day after your birthday you will say, "Yesterday I meditated so soulfully. So today I do not have to meditate." Our human life is like that. We eat voraciously one day and the following day we do not want to eat. But in the spiritual life, we have to eat every day because our capacity to eat is unlimited. God's Affection, Love, Blessings, Concern and Compassion are unlimited, so God gives us unlimited receptivity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I used to meditate for half an hour every morning, but recently I have only been meditating for fifteen minutes. Is it better to meditate longer?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I used to meditate for half an hour every morning, but recently I have only been meditating for fifteen minutes. Is it better to meditate longer?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you can continue, certainly. Do you think if you meditate more than fifteen minutes and still maintain your height that it will not be better? If you can meditate for half an hour instead of for fifteen minutes, certainly it will be better for you.</p>
<p>Some people just wait to see when fifteen minutes are over. They meditate on the hands of the clock rather than on their hearts. Instead, if you want to try to hear the sound of your heartbeat, that will be very good. Then, after you develop the power of concentration, you can meditate on your heartbeat in any part of your body. If your mind is bothering you, you can bring the hammer — the heartbeat — there and strike the mind so that it will be good.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Every time you give a special talk, I become so inspired. Then, after a few days or a week, it goes away. Is there any way I can remain inspired?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Every time you give a special talk, I become so inspired. Then, after a few days or a week, it goes away. Is there any way I can remain inspired?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The question is whether you really want to maintain that inspiration. Edmund Hillary climbed up Mt. Everest, but he did not do it in one stroke. For a week he halted and then he started again.</p>
<p>You say that you are not maintaining the same inspiration and aspiration after a week. What you have to do is see how far you have come during that week and then look up to see if there is any space for you to go higher. You will see that the distance which you have covered is next to nothing, whereas the distance you have yet to cover is very great.</p>
<p>What actually happens is this: the disciples, after climbing up five feet, think that is enough. They get a complacent feeling, and this complacent feeling is their worst enemy. They are so happy that they have climbed up five feet, but they have to feel that they have to climb up five million metres! They have to feel, "Oh, if only I had climbed up seven inches more, I would have been still higher. So let me continue."</p>
<p>The very fact that you climbed up five feet should give you enthusiasm and inspiration to go higher. In the spiritual life, we cannot remain at one place. In the ordinary life, you can reach a certain point and stay there for ten or twenty years, or for the rest of your life. But in the spiritual life, every day you have to make a new attempt. Otherwise, you will come back to your same old, stupid self.</p>
<p>If you want to maintain your enthusiasm and determination, you have to feel that no matter how far you have come, it is practically nothing compared to the distance you have to go. And also you have to feel that if in one week you had the capacity to climb up five feet, then you have the capacity to climb up another five feet the following week. In this way, you will be able to climb up to the highest height. But human beings usually do not do that. Either they become tired or they look around and see how far they have come. Then they feel that this distance is enough for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>So maintain your hunger and thirst. Otherwise, you will go back to your ordinary life and your mind will again become totally unspiritual. When you take part in a tug-of-war, so many times you come back five inches and then go five feet forwards. Such a struggle goes on — forwards and backwards. Like that, you have to continue to struggle in order to make progress in the spiritual life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes the outer conditions make it difficult to meditate.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes the outer conditions make it difficult to meditate." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everybody has the same problem: it is too hot or too cold, or something else. Unfortunately, the world is like that. If you are inside the meditation room, it is too hot. Again, outside the sun is very bright. Either way there is a problem. The place is not good; the sun is bothering you; there is too much noise — in addition to the inner difficulties that you face! But instead of thinking of the difficulties, try to think of it the other way: think of the opportunities. One approach is to think of the hurdles that you face in life. Another approach is to think of the joy that you will get after crossing over the hurdles. You have to say, "If I cross over the hurdles, which I can and I must, then I will be so happy." This way of seeing things increases your inner and outer capacity.</p>
<p>Sometimes the outer conditions make you feel absolutely miserable when you are meditating. You can easily surrender and say, "It is not my fault. It is nature's fault." In this way, you can justify your surrender very nicely. But the other way is to say, "If I can meditate in spite of this opposition, then I will become a better, stronger disciple." Instead of surrendering to those obstacles, regard them as opportunities to make progress.</p>
<p>Spiritual people are supposed to be warriors. When we face obstacles, we have to conquer them. This has to be our attitude all the time. Otherwise, if we surrender to circumstances, we will never be able to do anything. So if you think of the happiness you will get when you conquer the obstacles that you are presently facing and if you can bring that happiness forward, it will give you added strength. And that strength will give you the capacity to meditate more peacefully.</p>

SCA 1139-1145. Questions asked by children and parents on 21 October 1988 at The Oneness-Family School in Washington, D.C.</p>
<h2>Question: Are you a famous painter?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Good boy, I am not famous, but I paint. I have painted my inner life and now I will paint my outer life.</p>
<p>It took me hundreds and thousands of years, thousands and thousands of years to paint the inner life. And now I have started painting the outer life. God alone knows when I will complete painting my outer life.</p>
<p>With my inner painting I cried and cried for God the Creator. With my outer painting I am smiling and smiling at God the creation. We are all God's creation, you and I and all of us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because human beings are not doing the right thing. The right thing is to love God. If you love God and pray to God every day, then you will not do anything wrong. So first things first. Pray to God. If you do not pray to God, then you cannot do the right thing. Every day, in the morning, you have to pray to God for a few minutes, you have to meditate on God for a few minutes. That is the right thing. Once you start doing the right thing, then everything goes right.</p>

While I am offering the joy that I receive from playing, I feel that the listeners are also offering me their inner joy. I am giving you something from my heart, the joy that I feel, and you are giving me what you are feeling deep within your heart. So this is how we become a oneness-soul, a oneness-family.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You want perfection from your children and the other children whom you teach. Let us say that early in the morning you sowed some seeds in the garden. You do not expect the seeds to germinate in the afternoon! No, you have the patience to wait for quite a few months for a little plant or sapling to appear. Then again you wait for the plant to grow and grow. And again you have to wait for the plant to become a tree and produce flowers and fruits. Then you are quite happy. In the beginning, you planted the seeds and you wanted to pick the fruits immediately. But you knew that it was not possible. At the same time, you knew that there would come a time when the tree would produce most beautiful flowers and delicious fruits, so you waited.</p>
<p>This patience is what we call the wisdom of the heart. Outwardly you may say, "Oh, how long do I have to wait?" But if you have the wisdom of the heart, you will see that it is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>In your case, you are asking the children to do the right thing, but they are not listening. Here you have to apply the same wisdom that you did for the tree. Outwardly we call it patience; inwardly we call it wisdom-light. If you use your wisdom-light, perfection will dawn one day.</p>
<p>Every day you can try to watch the children to see whether they have improved or not. Suppose one child is not listening to you at all. No matter what you say, no matter how sad and mad you become, this child does not listen. You can try to discipline the child outwardly, by scolding and so forth. This is one method.</p>
<p>Another method is this: look at the eyes of the child and show your utmost compassion. Do not bring forward any anger or frustration whatsoever, only utmost compassion. Try to make the child feel that you are at his mercy. Definitely you are stronger than the child. You can give him a smart slap, you can do many things. But you are not going to do that. You have to make the child feel that he is superior to you, you are at his mercy, and he can do anything if he wants to. You are absolutely helpless, so you are begging him to show you compassion. In this way, you will touch his heart and he will not be able to go on doing the wrong thing.</p>
<p>It is like this: a child is holding a ball. You can easily snatch the ball away from him, but you are pretending that you are helpless, that you are weaker than him. And you are begging him to give you the ball. If you snatch it, then he will cry, he will do many things, he may even try to strike you. But if you offer tears, crocodile tears, if you say you are at his mercy, then if he gives you the ball you will be the happiest person.</p>
<p>When you are trying to discipline a child, you can do the same thing. You used one way, but it did not work. So the other way is to touch the heart of the child. Not to discipline with the hand, but with the heart. If you can touch the heart of a child with your wisdom-light, that same child will become perfect. Always you have to be wise. If one method does not work, then let us adopt a new method.</p>
<p>When I was very, very young, I was quite naughty, to say the least. Now I have developed some peace of mind, I am not restless, But in those days it was a different story. My sisters and brothers were all older than me. Unnecessarily, I used to pinch them, box them, everything. But they were so kind to me. They never, never punished me. Then, when my mother caught me red-handed, just a few little tears in her eyes were enough for me. I immediately became calm and quiet. Her tears had infinitely more power than her scolding. My mother's tears had infinite power inside them.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Outwardly you can do a few things. You could invite some boys of his age in whom you have confidence to come and inspire him. These good boys are trying in every way to become decent citizens of the world. They will always try to lead a life of inspiration and even unconscious aspiration. So their company will help your son.</p>
<p>The next thing is that you have to act like a thief. At night, when your child is fast asleep, for five or ten minutes just go and stand near him and try to feel your own heart, not your mind. Your heart will have a conversation with his heart. Your heart is all affection, all love, all compassion for your son. Like this, your heart's affection, fondness, love and so many other good qualities will enter into your son. In the same way, your son has affection, love and fondness for you. Your heart will offer its good qualities and your son's heart will offer its own good qualities. Sooner or later, you are bound to see that these good qualities are being manifested in his outer life. And he will never know that secretly, when he was fast asleep, you came and injected so many divine qualities into his heart. Let him think that he is making the change by himself. It can come as a surprise to you. It does not matter who has inspired him to change his nature. The important thing is that your son is getting better.</p>
<p>So this change will take place from your meditation with his heart at night. When he is sleeping, he is not arrogant, he is not undivine. At that time, his mind is asleep. When one is asleep, one listens to others.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why do bad people kill the good ones?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why do bad people kill the good ones?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Bad people get malicious pleasure by hurting the good ones. They do not want the good qualities or capacities of the good ones to flourish. They want to kill their enemies so that their good qualities cannot spread all over the world. But what happens is this: when one good person is killed, the good qualities of that person are not killed.</p>
<p>A little bird is inside the cage. When you smash the cage, the bird flies everywhere. So when a good person is killed, like Martin Luther King, Jr. or President Kennedy, the body-cage may be smashed, but their soul-bird flies all over the world. The loss of the cage we cannot deny. It is a most tragic loss for the whole world. But the soul is flying and flying like a beautiful bird, spreading its good qualities here, there and everywhere. Mahatma Gandhi is another example. His body is gone, but his soul is all over the world. Everywhere people are appreciating, admiring and adoring him.</p>
<p>Today I am at Oneness-Family School. This little school has the highest visions, the loftiest visions. There are millions of schools and colleges in the world. They cannot all change their names, but if they could all have a sub-title then it would be 'Oneness-Family'. Whenever you go to a school or university, immediately you get inspiration from the person the school is named after or who founded the school. When you go to a school in Washington, you immediately think of George Washington, the Father of the Nation. When you go to Thomas Jefferson's University in Virginia, immediately you think of Jefferson's inner illumination. All the good qualities that he embodied come to your mind. Those great luminaries, great pioneers in so many fields, have left the world, but their good qualities we still adore.</p>
<p>In the same way, not only the name 'Oneness-Family School', but the vision of this school will one day cover the length and breadth of the world. Right now it is a tiny seed, smaller than the smallest. But eventually it will be like a huge banyan tree. This vision will one day become large, larger, largest. The oneness-family-vision will be everywhere.</p>
<p>If you feel oneness, who is going to kill whom? Are you going to kill your mother or father or brother or sister? So when you pray and meditate, you improve your heart's oneness. Then the whole world becomes yours. Once you feel your oneness with the entire world, you are not going to kill anybody and, if others do the same thing, then there will be no assassination, no murder. People will not hurt each other.</p>
<p>All the schools and universities should have the same vision: oneness, oneness, oneness. Then there will be no more fighting, no more quarrelling. Ignorance will be illumined. Now oneness is lacking. We see only the confusion of the mind. We need the heart's dedication and the heart's illumination to realise the vision of Oneness-Family.</p>

Do you agree with that approach?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am so happy to hear that the parents come and help you. The parents have such big hearts, good hearts, that they join you. Here parents are teachers and you are teachers. It is a joint effort. You are helping their children and they are also helping their children to make progress. Parents here like the teachers, they feel they can talk to the teachers, so they come and assist you. In other schools this does not happen.</p>
<p>Transcendence is the supreme blessing that the divine children at the Oneness-Family School are going to learn from their dear teachers. Each teacher at this school is a giver of the self, sleeplessly and unconditionally, to the Will of the Supreme. My heart of love and my life of gratitude I am offering to all the soulful teachers at the Oneness-Family School.</p>

SCA 1146-1147.These questions were asked on 4 December 1989 in New York.</p>
<h2>Question: Are there some very advanced seekers in Germany who are inwardly looking for a spiritual path?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only this much I can say: many, many souls in Germany are awakened for the spiritual life. And a new push, a tremendous push they have got from the inner world since November 9th.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> An additional push the German soul has offered to all the Germans. Whether they were previously awakened or unawakened, this push was applied to everybody. It is like the sun. The sun shines for everybody. Some people take advantage of it and some people do not. So this new awakening, new push, the soul of Germany has blessingfully offered to each and every German. Some will definitely make use of it, while others will not. Those who are making use of it, who are soulfully using the blessing, will definitely make very special progress. Under the guidance of their own inner beings or a spiritual Master, these souls will make a tremendous contribution to the body, heart and soul of their country, Germany.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The other two souls are integrated inside the new one. They have now disappeared inside the new one, which is vaster than the vastest. The two old ones, the souls in the separated worlds, East and West, are not of the same standard as the new soul. Which is better, which is worse, which is more developed, God alone knows. Then a day will come when these two souls will be taken to rest in the soul's world, according to their soul's development. But still they are staying inside the new one, the one that is guiding the destiny of Germany.</p>

SCA 1148-1166. An interview conducted by Robert Swan, the editor of <em>Simply Living Magazine</em>, on 14 September 1984 in Canberra, Australia.</p>
<h2>Question: You have said that your philosophy is a merging of the inner and the outer. Most people would interpret meditation as being an inner process and I wonder if you could explain for us how you feel marathon running has a place in spiritual development.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The inner running and the outer running complement each other. For outer running, we need discipline. Without a life of discipline, we cannot succeed in any walk of life. So when we do outer running, it reminds us of the inner running. The inner running, we know, is the longest distance, eternal distance. We do not know when it started and we have no idea when we are going to end it. Whereas, if it is a marathon, we know that after covering 26 miles and 385 yards, we come to an end.</p>
<p>For outer running, we need a life of discipline, endurance and patience — so many things which are good! In the spiritual life also we need many things — we have to conquer our fear, doubt, jealousy, insecurity and so on. So we feel that one is helping the other.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, if I have freshness in my mind and if I have sound health, then I will be inspired to pray and meditate. If I do not have good health, then I am not going to get up and pray and meditate. So it is my good health that is helping me to become a good seeker.</p>
<p>Again, if I am a true seeker, then I will try to do something for mankind on the physical plane. If I love God the Creator, I must also love God the Creation, otherwise what kind of love is it? If I love God, who has created this world, I must also love the Creation itself. So while we run outwardly, it is the Creation that we see and when we pray and meditate, we are trying to have a conscious awareness of the Creator.</p>
