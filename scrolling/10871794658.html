<p>After I left the spiritual bookstore, I went downstairs to a musical instrument store. I was playing on a violin when an elderly lady came up to me with folded hands. I asked her if she wanted anything.</p>
<p>She said, "I did not see you when you were upstairs. I am the owner of the bookstore. I came here from down the street to see you."</p>
<p>It was raining so heavily outside, but she had come into the music store just to see me. For her to go out in such weather was really something! She was standing in front of me so devotedly with folded hands.</p>

<p>In Singapore I went into a camera shop to buy a camera case. A little girl about nine or ten was taking care of me. I asked her the price of one bag. She said it was 28 Singapore dollars, so I said, "Fine."</p>
<p>Then she said to me, "No, it is $25." I did not pay any attention to her because I was looking at other bags. Suddenly she said to me, "Why are you not buying the first bag? It is only $27."</p>
<p>I looked at her and thought I had made a mistake. Perhaps she had not told me that it was $25. Otherwise, how could it be $27 now? I continued browsing, looking at other bags.</p>
<p>She said, "No, these other bags are very expensive. You take this one. It is $28."</p>
<p>Finally I said, "Am I deaf? How could the price go up?"</p>
<p>The little girl said, "Did I tell you $25?"</p>
<p>I said, "You told me $25, S27 and $28."</p>
<p>She said, "All right, if I said S25, then you can have it for $25."</p>
<p>Then, when I gave her $25, she gave me back a dollar in change. She was great!</p>

<p>In another store in Singapore, I was looking at some shirts imported from Hawaii. After I had selected three shirts, a little boy came up to me and said, "You will be sorry."</p>
<p>I said, "Why?"</p>
<p>He said, "You need extra-large, not large."</p>
<p>I said, "No, I am a large."</p>
<p>But he took the trouble of getting the same shirts that I had selected — only in extra-large.</p>
<p>I asked, "Is there no place for me to try on these shirts to see which size fits me?"</p>
<p>He replied, "Yes, you can go there. But take both sizes."</p>
<p>So I took one large and one extra-large to try on. The large size fit me perfectly. It was even a little long. I came back and told him, "The large fits me."</p>
<p>The boy said, "Now that you have won, will you not buy one more shirt?"</p>
<p>I said, "Definitely I will buy one more." Originally I had selected three shirts; but because I won, it became four.</p>

<p>While I was shopping in Padang, Indonesia, Niriha was following me and recording everything on her video camera. In five or six stores she took video. In the last store she took video of me bargaining. In the beginning the price was 200, but in the end it came down to 100.</p>
<p>Then, when I went into an Indian music store to buy two flutes, Niriha disappeared. I suspected that the owners were Tamil. Then all of a sudden the wife spoke to her husband in Tamil, asking him to give Agraha and me a chair.Immediately I started speaking my Tamil. If Niriha had stayed to video, she could have got my Tamil voice. We were looking for Niriha, but that was the time she was missing!</p>

<p>Today I was bargaining in one store in Bukittinggi. The saleslady held up her hand twice, and I thought she wanted two times 500 or 1,000 rupiah. I said, "No, 200."</p>
<p>I said to myself, "I will fight!"</p>
<p>Finally I said, "I will pay 500 rupiah," and I gave the lady 500. Then she returned 200 to me.</p>
<p>At first I thought I may have given her 5,000 rupiah by mistake, but it was 500. So I was fighting for more than she was asking for!</p>

<p>In Bukittinggi, I was bargaining to buy a synthesizer. The man in the store was coming down only 2,500 rupiah, so I did not want to get it.</p>
<p>I told Savyasachi to take Vijali there to bargain with them some more. She has immediate luck.</p>
<p>The synthesizer has one setting that sounds like a violin and another that sounds like a harpsichord. With my Yamaha, I have to push several buttons in order to make these sounds.</p>

<p>In some stores the people are nice; they are ready to bargain. In other stores, whatever price they say is all they will take-finished!</p>
<p>In one store I was bargaining and bargaining. The man in the store would write down one price, but I did not understand his writing, so I would write down another price. It never ended. Finally I bought two items and left.</p>
<p>Then I decided to go back and buy a third item-a T-shirt for Raghu. I said to myself, "I am not going to bargain this time. Whatever price the man asks for, I will give."</p>
<p>The man said, "5,000 rupiah."</p>
<p>I became the silent Brahma and said, "All right."</p>
<p>The man couldn't believe his ears. When I gave him 5,000, he returned 2,000 to me. That was a nice experience.</p>

<p>When I went into a flute store in Bukittinggi, Dhanu and a few other disciples also came in the store, and they were listening while I was trying out different flutes. Dhanu was supplying me with flutes, and I was trying to see which ones were good.</p>
<p>The owner was also selecting flutes for me. He wanted to show me how they sounded, so he was playing as loudly as possible. Meanwhile, I was trying to play in my civilised way. So the owner and I were giving a great performance!Finally I selected two flutes. The man used two Hindi words, so I started talking to him in Hindi. But he could not speak Hindi; he knew only two words and used them because I was an Indian.</p>
<p>The man asked for 10,000 rupiah for the two flutes, and I offered 5,000. The man said 7,000 and I was a little bit disappointed. Then Dhanu took out 5,000 from his wallet. I could see that the man was ready to accept 5,000, but he was not taking it. Finally, he agreed and took the money. I thought the transaction was over, so I took out 10,000 rupiah to pay Dhanu back. When the man saw my 10,000 rupiah, he thought it was for him. Then he didn't want to sell the flutes for 5,000 and started asking for 10,000 again. What kind of problems I created!</p>
<p>Finally, I said that I wouldn't pay more than 5,000, and Dhanu asked for his money back. Then the man accepted our price.</p>
