<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on each angel's closeness to the Supreme. Even the cosmic gods do not meet with the Supreme every day or every hour. Angels do have a free access to the Supreme. A secretary may have a free access to the boss, but there will be many days when the boss is so busy that the secretary does not dare to disturb him. Again, some days the secretary can spend hours with the boss. Sometimes the boss may say that unless it is life or death, the secretary should not call, whereas if the boss wants to chat, he can call the secretary any time. Similarly, angels do have free access to the Supreme, but they cannot exploit it. Unless there is an emergency, they will not disturb Him.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are archangels. They have more brilliance, compassion, love, light and divine power than the other angels. In India, some priests take responsibility for only one house, while very significant priests may take care of twenty houses. Similarly, archangels can take care of more human beings.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Angels live indefinitely, not eternally. There is a great difference between indefinitely and eternally. Indefinite means that after twenty years, two hundred years or four hundred years, either they will take human incarnation or they will be dissolved. Some angels do not want to come down in a manifested form, with a gross human body. After a few centuries they want to be freed from their form.</p>
<p>Some angels want to go to another place. It is not like humans who, after eighty or ninety years, become old and die. No, only they are tired of playing their roles. They do not want to play the same role eternally. Either they will take human incarnation or they will go to some other planet to live. They have worked hard, so they want to enjoy vacation or, you can say, retirement.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Anything that is created has a soul. An ant has a soul; material objects and gross physical objects have a soul. In God's creation everything has a soul. As an insect has a soul, as a drop has a soul, as an ocean has a soul, even so, angels have souls. The soul is a portion of divinity. Inside anything that exists, a spark of divinity has to be there. Existence itself embodies part of divinity, because existence did not come from a hostile force. Existence came from God.</p>
<p>Even inside a bad person — a thief, a drug addict — the soul is there. It is a question of how much the soul can manifest its divinity.</p>

 <p>
SCA 879-881. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions from some of his Puerto Rican disciples on 27 November 1999 in New York.</p>
<h2>Question: How can we erase the past?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we use the word 'erase', we think of a blackboard. It is as if you have drawn something very poorly and nobody is appreciating your artwork, so you want to erase it. But we do not have to erase the past. We have only to forget about the past and go forward.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a particular quality that your Puerto Rican disciples need to develop?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a particular quality that your Puerto Rican disciples need to develop?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not only my Puerto Rican disciples, but all my disciples need to develop mutual appreciation. When you have private meetings, please appreciate one another. If somebody has done something wrong, ignore it totally. Think that you yourself have done that stupid thing. The time that you spend finding fault with someone or that someone spends finding fault with you is a sheer waste. See only the good qualities of others. If someone has done something good, appreciate it. If you have done something good, others should appreciate you. In that way, you are going forward. Otherwise, you can never make any progress. To make progress means to see only good things in everybody. God sees only good things in us. Bad people see only bad things in everybody.</p>
<p>Spiritual Masters try to see the good qualities of their disciples. Unfortunately, some disciples try to see only bad qualities in their Master. They say, "Master did not smile at me, but he smiled at this fellow and that fellow." They should say, "Who cares whether Master smiles at me or not, as long as I can serve him?"</p>
<p>Always look for the good things in others. Bad things forget, or say, "If I had been in his position, perhaps I would have done the same thing or even worse." If somebody has done something wrong, either ignore it or simply say, "You have done this, but perhaps you could have done something better."</p>
<p>Always remain in the world of encouragement. Whenever I have accomplished anything, Blessings, Grace, Compassion and everything I received from the Supreme. But I have also received encouragement from humanity, including a few big shots. When Pablo Casals saw me, he was shedding tears. Leonard Bernstein and other great musicians have appreciated me. If they had said, "You are a third-class musician. Give up your aspiration to become a musician," would I have become a musician?</p>
<p>In weightlifting so many people have encouraged me. In my artwork, if one girl in particular had not encouraged me, would I have become an artist? So much discouragement I got. But since I started in Ottawa, one person has encouraged me like anything, and today I have become a great artist. Encouragement is necessary. If you will not encourage me because you are jealous of me, or I will not encourage you because I am jealous of you, then we will never make progress. With your jealousy and my jealousy we can never go forward.</p>
<p>When you were a baby and you stood up for the first time, your mother felt that she had got the whole world! When you started walking, she entered into the seventh Heaven of delight. Then when you started running, she was so happy. You made progress because of her encouragement. When you were struggling so hard to stand up, your mother did not continue cooking food or reading the newspaper, as if she did not care. She was looking to see what you were doing. That was her encouragement. As soon as you stood up, she became so excited and delighted. She encouraged you with her smile, or she came and embraced you. Because of her encouragement, you tried again and again to get up and then walk and run. Our Centres will flourish only if there is encouragement.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can the Puerto Rican disciples please you?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can the Puerto Rican disciples please you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For some disciples, my fulfilment is the only thing they are aspiring for. Ask yourself if my fulfilment is everything to you. Write down whatever answer comes to you. Yes, definitely you want your Guru to be fulfilled, but side by side, you want your own fulfilment. For a few disciples — very, very few — there is no side by side. For them, it is one-pointed: "Guru's fulfilment. I do not need my own fulfilment."</p>
<p>In your case, you do want my fulfilment but, along with that, you will look this side and that side and say, "Can I also be fulfilled? Can I also become the world's greatest percussionist or can I also become the world's greatest cellist?"</p>
<p>If you had love for your Master, would Puerto Rico have so few Centres? Your love for the Supreme in me is the expansion of the Puerto Rican consciousness. The more you love the Supreme in me, the more your own reality and divinity will be able to expand, not only in your own life, but also in the entire consciousness of Puerto Rico. The more you increase your love for the Supreme in me, for the Supreme in yourselves, the sooner Puerto Rico will become as strong as hundreds of elephants. You will say, "I love my Guru." But then see the extent of your love. In Germany, Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and other places, it is their love-power that has expanded. Puerto Rico is the place that I chose first. You become tired before you start your journey, and they do not become tired even when their journey is completed. They are carrying my message of the ever-transcending Beyond.</p>
<p>My Puerto Rican children will say, "Oh, it is because of the Puerto Rican heat that our Centres are not growing." But inner heat is infinitely more powerful than the outer Puerto Rican heat. When the inner heat, the burning cry for God, comes forward, the outer Puerto Rican heat is nothing in comparison. India has produced so many sages, saints, spiritual Masters and Avatars. Is India the coldest country on earth? These spiritual figures became great because their inner heat was much stronger than the outer heat. India produced Sri Krishna, Lord Buddha, Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Aurobindo and many other great spiritual figures because of the inner heat. Like that, your inner heat also has to become most powerful.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Sometimes I reach a state in meditation where I would like to go beyond. How can I conquer the fear of reaching something higher, something unknown?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Once you enter into the spiritual life, you have to feel that there is a force that is high, higher, highest, or at least try to remember that this higher force exists. Spirituality means union with a higher force which is infinitely higher than our present physical strength, vital strength or mental strength. If you have fear, then you cannot achieve anything. Again, if you do not have fear, you can achieve everything.</p>
<p>If your own brother, instead of being thin, becomes very stout and strong like a boxer, you will not be afraid of him because he is your brother. If somebody else who is very powerful and in a very aggressive consciousness comes and stands right in front of you, you are going to get frightened because that fellow is unknown to you. But if you have faith in your inner life, that faith can accomplish everything. In the Ramayana, Hanuman wrote down Rama's name for somebody else so that that person could walk across the river. That fellow started with faith, but then out of curiosity he opened up the paper and saw that only the word "Rama" was written there. He said, "What is this?" Then he drowned. If he had had faith in Rama's name, the way for a few minutes he had faith in what Hanuman had written, he could have continued across safely.</p>
<p>We fear the unknown only when we do not believe that a higher force is protecting us. With occult power you can go outside your body with your soul. It is very easy to imagine — "Ah, if I can go outside the body, it will be great fun! I will be able to see all the higher worlds." But when you actually see your own soul coming out of the body, like a bird flying out of its cage, you may say, "Oh my God! The bird has gone out! Perhaps it will not be able to come back any more." Sometimes if the soul-bird goes out of the body-cage, the owner gets panicky. In the occult world you have to go beyond the body. If you want to practise occultism, the very first thing is to go out, out into the unknown. So occult power and fear never go together.</p>
<p>While the soul is going out of the body, if you have faith that a higher force is guiding you, protecting you and taking care of you, then there is no such thing as fear. Always have faith, faith, faith. If you have faith, you are bound to be protected. Your faith is infinitely, infinitely stronger than the fear that you are either creating for yourself or encountering in your imagination. So always have more faith in yourself, more faith in your spirituality, more faith in God and more faith in your Master. Then the unknown cannot remain unknown. It is unknown for the time being, but the unknown does not remain forever unknown. A child gets frightened when he sees that his elder brother is reading a huge book, while he is only studying the alphabet. He says, "My God! How will I ever read such a huge book?" Then he studies for a few years and there comes a time when he is able to read the book that frightened him.</p>
<p>There is also another way you can use your faith to overcome your fear of the unknown. If you see that somebody is very undivine, try to bring forward your faith and see immediately your own divinity or his divinity. There is not a single person who does not have inherent divinity. If somebody is very bad, simply try to see the divine inside him. When you see the divine inside him, immediately his divinity comes to the fore and his outer animal propensity disappears. Always have faith in the divine. Your faith is infinitely stronger than imaginary fear or any other kind of fear that you are encountering in the spiritual life.</p>
