  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, I sometimes say the Gayatri Mantra even though I am your disciple. Am I doing the right thing?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, I sometimes say the Gayatri Mantra even though I am your disciple. Am I doing the right thing?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are doing the Gayatri Mantra, it will be most effective. But if you use another mantra, which another spiritual Master gave you, and if you are following my path, then it will be a problem. The Gayatri Mantra is above all gurus. The Gayatri Mantra will not be able to create any problem, because just by repeating this mantra people have realised God. In India there are people who have realised God only by repeating the Gayatri Mantra most soulfully by the Ganges. If you repeat the Gayatri Mantra most soulfully in front of my picture, it will add to your aspiration. But if it is some other mantra, you have no idea what it will do. It may be a spiritual word, true, but your nature may not correspond to that particular aspect of God.</p>
<p>Each mantra represents an aspect of God. If right now you need God's Love-power more than any other power, and if you are not paying any attention to Love-power, then your progress will be very slow. But once you realise God, all the aspects of God enter into you. Very often I tell disciples who have accepted our path not to practise their old mantras, which they have gotten from other Masters or from books. It becomes a hindrance on the path. They want to be totally devoted to our path; but the forces and the energy they create by repeating those particular divine words may interfere with their spiritual progress. It is like walking along two roads at the same time; it is very dangerous. But the Gayatri Mantra is above all this. The Gayatri is the mother of all mantras. So if you practise the Gayatri, it will really add to your progress on our path; and when you follow our path, it will intensify for you the meditative power of the Gayatri Mantra.</p>
<p>I would be very happy if you could learn the tune that I have set to the Gayatri Mantra. If you can sing it most soulfully, it will be as good as repeating the mantra one hundred times. This is the difference between reciting and singing. While we are singing, our entire being is elevated and transported into the highest plane of consciousness. When we recite something soulfully, sometimes we may get dynamic power; sometimes we may get vital power, uncontrolled vital power. But if we sing a song soulfully, immediately psychic power comes. Psychic power comes to the fore and makes us swim in the sea of Light and Delight. If we are singing soulfully, this is more important than to be technically correct. When I sing, many times I make mistakes. But God does not care about my technique. He cares for my soulful qualities. So when you learn the Gayatri Mantra, please do not worry that you cannot sing it like a professional singer. As long as it comes from your heart, God will be really pleased.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you feel insincere, the best thing is to continue, not to give up. It is like hunger. Every day you don't feel hungry, but you do eat. If you are not properly hungry, the food may not taste good. You may not feel great joy in eating, but you do eat because it is the necessity of the body. Similarly, even if you are not feeling sincere gratitude, it is better to continue because in this way you maintain the habit. If you stop eating today and you don't feel like eating tomorrow, then you become weak. Here also, if you don't continue your offering you become weak. If you don't try to offer the little gratitude you feel today, tomorrow it will be worse, and the day after it will all go away. So the best thing is to continue. It need not be your best meditation, but continue; do not stop.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: To attain joy, should we always meditate the same way as we do in the Centre?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: To attain joy, should we always meditate the same way as we do in the Centre?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The highest type of meditation is done in silence, with one objective in mind: to please God in His own Way. When you meditate, if you can feel that you are pleasing God in God's own Way, then that is the best type of meditation. Otherwise, if you start meditating in order to get joy, you will get joy; you are <em>bound</em> to get joy if that is your intention. But you may not get boundless joy, precisely because you have not pleased your Eternal Beloved, your Father and Friend, God, in His own Way. During your meditation, if God finds it is necessary to give you an experience of suffering, world-suffering, if He wants to enlarge your heart for a few seconds and offer you the world of suffering, if that is His intention but you want to have only joy from your meditation, He will grant you joy. But just because you have separated your existence from the experience He wanted to give you, you will not get the highest joy. "Let Thy Will be done." What the Saviour Christ said is absolutely the highest truth. This is the supreme message humanity can receive from the absolute Highest. Before you meditate, if you can offer the result of your meditation to the Source and say, "I wish to become Your perfect instrument so You can fulfil Yourself in and through me in Your own Way," this is the highest, absolutely the highest, type of meditation.</p>

<h2>Question: How can I become your disciple?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please come to this Centre regularly. Please feel this is your spiritual home. You have an earthly home and this is your spiritual home. Here you will get love, concern and the feeling of divine oneness. Only my request to you is to come here regularly and throw your heart and soul into our path. The Supreme in me will do the needful. I accept you wholeheartedly. You kindly come and pay your fee, which is aspiration and regularity. If you come regularly and devotedly and offer your aspiration to the Supreme, you are giving me my salary and fee.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If someone wants to become your disciple, is it necessary for you to see the person&#039;s picture or actually see the person in the physical?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If someone wants to become your disciple, is it necessary for you to see the person&#039;s picture or actually see the person in the physical?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it is not at all necessary. When a person wants to become my disciple, it means a portion of his soul is hovering around me. When it is time for me to decide on the physical plane about this particular person, immediately his soul will appear before me. That is why when I go through the seekers' pictures, sometimes I flip through very quickly without even pausing. It is because the soul appears before me and it is not necessary for me to concentrate on the picture. Sometimes, though, it is not the soul but the mind or the vital or the heart that wants to become my disciple. Then I have to concentrate for a second or two to bring the soul forward so I can see if the person is meant to follow my path or not.</p>
<p>The reason I ask seekers to send in a picture is for the human aspect. If they think that I want to see their picture, then they feel that I care about them. It helps to convince their mind and makes them feel more familiar with me. But to be frank, it is not at all necessary.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If somebody were to be awakened in the middle of the night and hear a clear voice say, &quot;Come to me. I am your Teacher,&quot; how would he interpret it? Is this a kind of initiation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If somebody were to be awakened in the middle of the night and hear a clear voice say, &amp;quot;Come to me. &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am your Teacher,&amp;quot; how would he interpret it? Is this a kind of initiation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know that initiation can be accomplished in various ways. Sometimes you get a Teacher on the physical plane. Sometimes after you study books written by a spiritual figure, the inspiration you get leads you to a kind of inner initiation by a particular spiritual Teacher.</p>
<p>Again, God may come to you Himself to initiate you. At that time, this inner voice is the Voice of God telling you something. God may show you Light. This Light can take the form of a particular Teacher. Or through this Light God will take you to a particular Teacher.</p>
<p>But when someone says, "Come to me; I am your Teacher," the word 'I' is very complicated at that point. If you have a spiritual Teacher who has left the body and if the Teacher feels that you need more spiritual help and guidance, he may appear to you in a vision and say, "I have come back." This 'I' doesn't mean that he has physically returned to earth. It means that he sees that somebody else is capable of helping you; and he will say that he, in some other form, is ready to guide you more.</p>
<p>I have three or four disciples whose Guru passed away three or four years ago. Their Guru came to them during a dream or meditation and said, "I have come in another form." By 'I' he meant myself. He used the term 'I', but it did not mean that he had entered into me. No! The other Master realised his oneness with me and used the term 'I'. So we have to know what that particular 'I' is and what it stands for.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The essential quality that a seeker needs, not only to enter into my path, but to enter into any path, is sincerity. The seeker has to ask himself whether he really needs someone to fill his life. Right now he does need someone, because he has not yet established a free access to his inner life, where he is absolutely and inseparably one with God. A day will come when the seeker will realise that his own highest, transcendental height is God Himself. But he cannot claim the Highest as his very own right now because most of the time he is swimming and drowning in a sea of ignorance. Therefore, he has to feel that there is someone who is trying to illumine him. How can he search for that someone? First of all, he has to look inside his own heart, and he has to look with sincerity. If he can feel that his whole life — body, mind, vital, heart and soul — is composed of sincerity, then he is not only meant for this path, but for all paths, and he will make the fastest progress.</p>
<p>There are many paths and many Masters, but each path has a special quality of its own. All paths and all Masters lead the seeker to the destined Goal, but each path has something different and original to offer. In our path, we have divine love, devotion and surrender. To acquire these divine qualities of love, devotion and surrender, we must give of ourselves; and while giving, we shall feel our oneness with the Supreme. So, if someone wants to try our path, he has to feel the necessity of realising the highest truth through divine love, devotion and surrender. If he has divine love, devotion and surrender along with the true sincerity, then he is more than qualified to follow our path.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Kindly feel that you are only studying to please the Supreme in you. Whatever the result, don't take it as success or failure; take it as progress. Otherwise there will always be a competitive spirit and you will be tense. But if you feel that you are studying to please God, then you won't separate your outer life from your inner life and there will be no tension. Keep in mind that you are not doing these things for name and fame. If you are doing something just to please God, then you are not responsible for the result. At that time you live in the soul; and when you are in the soul, there is no tension.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: My friend is not a disciple. She has begun to meditate on your picture and she feels great fear.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: My friend is not a disciple. She has begun to meditate on your picture and she feels great fear." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no fear. It is only a matter of whether she is ready to give up certain things. Fear is not of the Real, but of giving up something. Very often people say they are frightened to death of my picture. But it is not my picture; only inwardly they are unwilling to give up their old habits, their old life. They look at my picture and see an ocean of uncertainty. But it is not actually an ocean of uncertainty. They are only holding onto old habits that they are unwilling to give up. "What will happen if we give them up? Right now we know what we are and what we are doing." Her experience has to be interpreted in this way.</p>
<p>If one can obliterate the past and be ready to enter into the new, the ever-new, consciously and soulfully, one will see that the new also has its reality, a more fulfilling reality than the past. Then there can be no fear, never. Fear comes only when either we are unwilling to give up our old life or we are not certain of the new life. But mostly people are unconscious of the fact that they don't want to give up their old life. Because they want to become spiritual, they feel embarrassed that they are still cherishing mundane things and they don't want to admit it. Some are sincere; they say they are not going to give up drinking or drugs. They want the spiritual life, but they don't want to give up their old life. Let us only encourage them and say that the new life will definitely give them a sense of satisfaction. It may be my path or somebody else's path, but so long as spirituality is practised, they will get some satisfaction. And if it is followed sincerely and devotedly, the satisfaction will be abiding.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You use the word &#039;seeker&#039;. When does the seeker cease seeking and become a disciple?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: You use the word &#039;seeker&#039;. When does the seeker cease seeking and become a disciple?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are all seekers. Even though I have reached the height, my highest height, I am also a seeker. There is no end to our inner discovery, there is no end to our realisation. Even if you have realised the Truth, I wish to say that today's realisation is just the starting point for tomorrow's discovery.</p>
<p>When we want to make a distinction between seeker and disciple, we feel that a disciple is under an inner obligation to follow a specific Master, to walk along a specific path, whereas a seeker is at liberty to go to all the Masters and get a little knowledge from each. Sometimes a seeker becomes unnecessarily greedy. He feels that if he goes to ten Masters, then he will be immediately satisfied. But it is not like that. The one Master that is meant for him has the most nourishing food. A seeker becomes a disciple when he comes to realise that Yoga is only one subject and that only one teacher is necessary.</p>
<p>Each teacher has a specific way of bringing the disciple's soul to the fore. Each teacher has a specific way of offering meditation to the disciple's outer being. If one keeps switching from one teacher to the next, he wastes a lot of time. Also, he finds that his aspiration may decrease. When a seeker becomes a disciple, at that time he claims to have a house of his own. "This is my father, this is my mother, this is my brother, this is my sister." A disciple who follows a specific path, will say, "These are my spiritual brothers and sisters; this is our spiritual family."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely she will get some benefit in the inner world if she is aware of us, of what we are doing on earth. And you can help her more by helping her remember sweet experiences that you had with her during her lifetime. If you can recollect some sweet experiences that she shared with you or that you shared with her, and while you are experiencing them again, if you can remember us and bring us into the experience itself, then her soul will receive additional joy, love and oneness that will help the soul fly into the higher worlds. It can be done in that way, by remembering a few experiences.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I believe very much in the emancipation of religion, but I&#039;m Roman Catholic and I just wonder about serving two Masters. Can I also become your disciple?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I believe very much in the emancipation of religion, but I&#039;m Roman Catholic and I just wonder about serving two Masters. Can I also become your disciple?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. There is nothing wrong in your realisation, but you have to know that Christianity is a religion, whereas what we are following is not a religion. We are following a path.</p>
<p>There is only one Master and that Master is God, the Absolute Supreme. A spiritual Master is only an elder brother in your family. The younger brothers do not know where the Father is or they do not know all about the Father's capacities. The elder brother teaches them about the Father's capacities or he takes them to the Father. Then his role is over. So there will be no conflict if you follow my path because I am not the destination. I am just a messenger; I take you or your message to the Supreme.</p>
<p>If I say my Hinduism is by far the best religion and if you say your Christianity is by far the best, then we shall only quarrel and fight. But we say, "No, you stay in your religion and let me stay in mine, and let us meet together to do something great for God and for humanity." We will meet together and do the needful. Then we will go back to our respective homes, our religions, to take rest.</p>
<p>When we follow a path, we do not encourage any seeker to look down on religion. On the contrary, we feel that our love for religion is strengthened because we follow Yoga. Yoga means oneness with God. If we can establish our oneness with God, or if we can have a free access to God's Heart, then we can add our strength, our light, to our own religion. Right now, like a divine beggar, we are trying to grab everything from our religion. But a day will come when we get light from within, when our being is surcharged with light. At that time we will be able to offer light to religion.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best thing is not to do these things. You are in a different boat, one that will only encourage you to love God and devote your existence to serving God. The best thing is to try our path wholeheartedly. I don't want to say the others are wrong, but you will have more success on this path if you try it wholeheartedly.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You will try to read my books and concentrate on my photograph and keep in close touch with someone in the Centre. If you can read my writings, they are like friends, like your brothers and sisters. Also, try to get some of our records and listen to our music. It is not always possible to meditate, but you can read and listen to music. In this way you will make progress. Distance cannot take away our inner connection.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Since entering the spiritual life, I feel I don&#039;t want to spend time with my old friends. But I feel sad about not seeing them so often.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Since entering the spiritual life, I feel I don&#039;t want to spend time with my old friends. But I feel sad about not seeing them so often." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have undivine friends, then right now do not mix with them. According to your standard they are undivine, but according to others' standards they are not undivine. You have entered into the spiritual life, so you know that these people are undivine. Once upon a time you were also, let us say, undivine. That is why they were your friends; that is why you mixed together. Now you have become spiritual, but they are still in that other world.</p>
<p>Those people have many friends of their own standard, so do not feel sorry; do not feel that just because you are giving them up, they are totally lost. No, they are perfectly happy. Perhaps they are also equally sad because they think that you are totally lost. They feel some crazy ideas have entered into your mind and they have lost you. In this world it is like that. You will unnecessarily feel sorry for them. They will unnecessarily feel sorry for you. But the world is very vast. They have their own friends. You are not indispensable in their life and they are not indispensable in your life. Only God is indispensable. So when we know where we stand and where others stand, then we do not feel at all sorry. Sometimes you have false attachment, let us say. Attachment is very bad, but sometimes it is false. You say, "What about me? I have so much to offer them." But you have nothing to offer to them. Only you have to offer whatever you have to God. During your prayer and meditation, if you can give your aspiration, love and devotion to God, then everything will be done for you. Every moment, every day, there will be many to give them joy. Do not feel you are the one person who can be of any use to them. With your own modesty and humility you will see that you will make the fastest progress; and they will also make the fastest progress if each of you follows his own path.</p>
