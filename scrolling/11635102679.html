 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What is the spiritual significance of a smile?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When a human mother smiles, it is from her heart. When the Divine Mother smiles, it is her promise to her spiritual child that the Goal of the Beyond is destined, that the Reality Transcendental is bound to dawn for the seeker. When the human father smiles at his son, he offers his earthly knowledge, wisdom and concern. When the spiritual Father smiles at his spiritual child, he offers him the assurance that at every second he is eternally of him and for him. In the seeker's aspiration and the Master's realisation, seeker and Master are one. When the Master brings the golden boat which will carry the seeker to the Golden Shore, he invites the seeker with the broadest smile, with his heart's smile. Then, when he carries the seeker from earth to the Golden Shore, he again offers the seeker his heart's most revealing and fulfilling smile.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day, every hour, every minute, every second the seeker must know how to open the heart-door of the Supreme. He needs the key, and the name of this key is joy. When the seeker is happy, he not only has the key, but he is the key. The happier the seeker is, the easier it is for him to open up the heart-door of the Supreme. The key is most perfect when the seeker is the happiest of human beings.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I get more satisfaction from detachment?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I get more satisfaction from detachment?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How do you acquire the power of detachment or the light of detachment? It is easy for the sincere seeker, and at the same time, very difficult for the insincere seekers. Even for sincere seekers, as long as they exist in the finite, with the finite and for the finite, there will always be attachment. But when they feel that they have come from the Infinite, they are in the Infinite and they are for the Infinite, then they don't have to cry for detachment. Detachment itself runs toward them, and they feel that they are nothing other than detachment itself.</p>
<p>You are attached to the body. What is the body? It is the limited consciousness, the finite consciousness. In the spiritual life, we use the term 'devoted.' We are attached to the finite, but we are devoted to the Infinite. Now I wish to say that if we are devoted to the Infinite, rather than attached to the finite, then we automatically get the power of detachment. When we live in the finite and want to satisfy the finite, then it is all attachment. But when we want to remain in the Infinite and serve the Infinite, then it becomes all detachment.</p>
<p>It is not that the finite becomes separate from the Infinite. No. The finite makes a conscious surrender to the Infinite. The obscure part of us has to surrender to the illumined part in us. Then the finite and the Infinite become one. It is like my feet and my head. They are on one body. If my feet are now dirty and filthy, and my brain tells me that my feet are dirty and filthy, then what do I do? I go and wash them. This is the brain's power. In the spiritual life also, the higher part can illumine the lower part. The Infinite has the capacity to illumine the finite. Now the finite has the message of attachment. But again, this finite can easily be transformed into the Infinite. The finite is a tiny drop. But when it enters into the vast ocean, it loses its own tiny individuality. The tiniest one gains its largest, most sublime individuality. So when we consciously and soulfully devote ourselves to something vast and infinite, then attachment is bound to be replaced by detachment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a great difference between joy and delight?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a great difference between joy and delight?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a great difference between joy and Delight. Let us say that joy is the opposite of pleasure. Indulgence in the physical and the vital is called pleasure. Pleasure is immediately followed by frustration, and frustration is followed by destruction. But joy is something that grows in us. Slowly and steadily it can grow. Again, joy also can fade away, but it will never come down to the level of frustration. To have joy is like drinking a glass of water. If you are thirsty, then you may finish all the water; then it will be gone. But if you put the cup right near the sink, you can fill it up again and again. In the same way, if necessity demands, joy will diminish. But it can also be replenished. But whether it diminishes or grows, if it is real joy, then it is not going to frustrate or destroy you.</p>
<p>Joy you can get in your mind, in your heart and even in your arms. After you have thrown the shotput a great distance, immediately your arm will make you feel that it has achieved everything and you will feel joy inside your arm. Sometimes, while walking very fast, if you get a kind of relaxed feeling in your knee, inside your knee you will feel joy. If you get a little strength inside your ankle, you will feel joy in your ankle. So any part of your being can have joy. Joy can be divided among the parts of your being. You can have joy in the mind, in the vital or in the body. You can have joy anywhere.</p>
<p>Joy does not usually descend to the lowest, because it is afraid of fighting with pleasure. Joy and pleasure have practically the same strength, so joy is afraid to fight because it is not always certain to win. One is a good boy, the other is a bad boy. But the bad boy sometimes defeats the good boy and makes him feel helpless, hopeless. But when the good boy gets strength, he tries to transform the bad boy and give him good advice as to what he is doing right and wrong. In this way joy tries to transform pleasure.</p>
<p>But delight is something else. When you have delight, you will feel tremendous ecstasy in your whole being, from the soles of your feet to the crown of your head. From above, Delight-Nectar descends through the crown centre and drips into the Third Eye. You drink this Delight-Nectar and feel a sense of Immortality. As soon as one little drop of this Delight comes into the sahasrara chakra, the whole body gets a divine thrill. Not even one cell, one molecule, will be denied this intense ecstasy.</p>
<p>Joy cannot go beyond the boundaries of its own existence. But Delight comes from the soul's region, from the transcendental Silence-Height. As it descends, it gradually illumines everything, even the gross physical. From the highest it comes to the lowest. Delight has tremendous power, but it descends very slowly. When it enters from the highest plane, it goes first to the soul's arena, then to the psychic plane, the mental plane, the vital plane, and then finally to the physical plane. Delight always descends very, very cautiously, and very steadily and unerringly.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Prayer can give you everything. If you don't have poise, your prayer is bound to give you poise. But I wish to say that everybody comes into the world with some inner poise. The soul has all the divine qualities in seed form. The soul is a portion of divinity, so naturally everything will be there. But poise can be in the physical in an absolutely negligible quantity. If you try, you can develop an ocean of poise from one drop. Even if you think that you don't have a drop of poise, no harm. The Supreme will give you abundant poise just because you are praying. Then, a time will come when your whole being will be flooded with inner poise. You are praying and praying and your inner being is storing up your poise, keeping it secret. Then one day you will see that you are all poise, boundless poise.</p>

If you ask me, "How is God?" my answer will be Delight. There can be no question on earth that cannot be answered by using the one supreme word, "Delight." For any question you ask, only one answer is correct, and that answer is Delight.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you as an individual human being want always to do the right thing at the right moment, it will be impossible. No human being is always able to do the right thing at the right moment. But if you ask the Supreme to act in and through you twenty-four hours a day, and if you can feel that anything that you do in those twenty-four hours belongs to the Supreme and not to you, then God will take the responsibility. Feel that you don't belong to yourself but only to the Supreme. If you can make yourself feel that you don't belong to yourself, you belong only to God, then it becomes His headache, not yours. If you feel that it is your responsibility to do the right thing at the right moment, then it will be your worry and your responsibility. But if you give your responsibility to the Highest Absolute Supreme, it becomes His responsibility; and as soon as it becomes His responsibility, then you become His instrument. Whoever has the responsibility is the doer. So when you have given the responsibility to the Supreme in you, then He becomes the Doer and it is up to Him to do the right thing and to say the right thing in and through you.</p>
<p>As long as you maintain your own individuality and responsibility, the Supreme will say, "All right, let her try. Let her try in her own way." So the best thing is to feel that you don't belong to yourself; you belong to somebody else and that is the Supreme. If you belong to the Supreme, then He is the Doer and naturally He will do the right thing in and through you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part III — Gratitude and the Will of the Supreme</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part III — Gratitude and the Will of the Supreme" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Could you speak on humility and gratitude?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life two qualities are absolutely of utmost importance. These two qualities are humility and gratitude. Humility and gratitude. If we can add appropriate adjectives to these two words, then they will convey more height and more depth to the seeker in you, the seeker in all human beings. For humility I wish to add "sincere": sincere humility. For gratitude, I wish to add "soulful": soulful gratitude. Gratitude has to be full of the soul-consciousness; otherwise it is not gratitude. Then it becomes a tricky way of gaining something more from the person to whom we show our gratitude. But soulful gratitude is offered to someone for what we have received. Even if that person does not give us anything more in life, not even an iota of joy or love, we shall eternally remain grateful to him for what he has done. We shall always be grateful for the way his gift has added to our life of aspiration, or considerably transformed our life and carried us consciously to the highest Source. When we offer soulful gratitude, it is our eternal recognition of what we have received from someone on our eternal journey across Eternity to Infinity's shore of Beauty, Light and Delight.</p>
<p>The Christ and all spiritual Masters without exception have told us that humility is of constant necessity in order to make the fastest and surest progress in the spiritual life. It is necessary in order to see the Face of our Supreme Beloved, the Inner Pilot. Inner humility and gratitude are our highest achievements. When you feel humble, you feel that your body, vital and mind are responding to your soul's dictates. If you feel grateful, sincerely grateful, soulfully grateful, then you have achieved the highest achievement that the earth-consciousness can offer to the Heaven-consciousness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Do only one thing: you have to compare where you as an individual are now with where you were eight years ago. Many good and bad things have happened to you in eight years, but on the whole you will see that eight years ago you were not even at the foot of the realisation-tree. You were millions of miles away from your realisation. Right now, you have not only stood at the foot of the tree, but you have climbed up to a considerable height. While climbing you may have had all kinds of misgivings, but still you are there. Some people who had fear while climbing have fallen down; again, others have now become afraid and cannot climb any higher. Fear, doubt and anxiety have also come to you. But you have to ask your inner being, "Am I at the same place where I was eight years ago?" The answer will be, "No. At that time I was not even anywhere near the tree." At this point, gratitude comes.</p>
<p>We have to see the positive aspect of what we have achieved and what we have grown into. I always say that the past is dust. The past has given us frustration, not illumination. But at the same time we have to know the difference between the past, which is dust, and the present, which is not dust. We have taken quite a few steps forward in the past few years. So if we have become something which we were not before, then there is every possibility that we will become something infinitely better in the future. That is why we offer our gratitude to the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can feel the necessity for gratitude if you feel that gratitude is your living breath. Feel that if your gratitude-breath is extinguished, then you are dead. Each time you offer gratitude for a fleeting second, feel it is a living breath.</p>
<p>On earth there is nothing so important or significant as gratitude. In God's case, the most significant thing He has is Compassion. God is Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent, but His Compassion-Power makes us close to Him. If He did not have Compassion-Power, we would not care for Him. If we can show God an iota of gratitude, God feels that within us He can exist. Our gratitude is God's Existence, God's House, God's Abode. God has to live in the street unless He can live inside our gratitude-heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Gratitude is the most precious thing that a human being can have. If someone has a million dollars and if someone else has only an iota of gratitude, in the Eyes of the Supreme he who has an iota of gratitude to God is far superior. Gratitude is the purest thing that we can have. It is immortal in us. If we can offer to God whatever is immortal, soulful and significant, then that is most meaningful.</p>
<p>Someone can have outer wealth, but if he has spiritual wealth — simplicity, purity, humility — that is far better. Again, somebody can be pure, devoted and sincere, but if he does not have any gratitude to God, then his purity is not perfect. On the other hand, if somebody is of bad character but is grateful to God for not yet having been caught or punished, and if he offers gratitude to God and wants to change his life, then God is pleased.</p>
<p>Every morning you should offer gratitude to God for your existence. You should offer gratitude because God has kept you on earth to manifest Him. So gratitude is the most important thing in our life. Nothing is more important in God's Eyes than gratitude.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If you realise the Supreme and have become one with the Supreme, is there gratitude at that time?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If you realise the Supreme and have become one with the Supreme, is there gratitude at that time?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Even if you realise the Highest Consciousness, still gratitude will always remain. Gratitude is sweetness and delight. Delight we experience no matter on which plane of consciousness we are. Gratitude is earth's greatest delight and Heaven's greatest delight. When the cosmic gods get something from the Supreme, they offer delight and gratitude.</p>
<p>When you have delight and gratitude, at that time you reach the Highest. Just because you have reached the Highest you are happy. If you remain on the highest plane, then you become one with the Vision and one with the Reality. Vision gives capacity to Reality. If this moment Vision is giving something to Reality, although they are one, Reality will naturally feel grateful. When you are on the highest level, Vision and Reality are one. But if you want to play the cosmic Game and you separate the Vision from Reality, then when you have given, naturally the one to whom you give will express gratitude. But on the highest plane, he who gives and he who receives are one.</p>
<p>Gratitude is in both realisation and manifestation. If you remain in the highest realisation you will be grateful, and if you remain in manifestation you will be grateful. Gratitude has to be constant. Even on the highest plane you have to be grateful.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the Will of God and also on your own dedication to the spiritual life. They go together. In the beginning you have to participate in the game. You have to get up early in the morning, at six o'clock or seven o'clock, and you have to meditate. But then there comes a time when you see that it is only His Will that is acting in and through you. In the beginning, you may feel that it is fifty percent your will and fifty percent God's Will working in and through you. But when you go deep within, you see that it is ninety-nine percent God's Will. And later, you will realise that it is one hundred percent God's Will. But in the beginning you have to act like a good student. You have to get up early and do your inner study. At that time you feel that aspiration depends on your will.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I look at you as an individual, from your heart I hear one message and from your tongue I hear another message. In the inner world somebody will touch my feet and say, "You are my only Reality. I have seen your transcendental Form. I was going to end my life, but you have saved me." But in the outer world if I speak to that same individual, he will be rude to me to such an extent that you cannot imagine.</p>
<p>One day I am the Saviour. Then three days later I am the worst person on earth, because I have prevented him from taking his life or I failed to fulfil his desires. But why does he feel that it is my capacity that has saved him or that has failed to satisfy his vital demands? It is the Supreme Himself who is giving the command. But the individual cannot believe that it is the Will of the Supreme, so he has to curse me and be rude to me.</p>
<p>When you are identified with the Will of the Supreme, at that time the most unbelievable things you can do if necessity demands. When the Master is identified with the supreme Will and is not fulfilling the human desires in a human way, at that time people say that he is the worst culprit. Spiritual Masters are always at the mercy of the disciples. The disciples want the Master to do something; but that very thing he is not authorised to do. If the disciples are in a high consciousness, then they will not ask for the fulfilment of their desires. If an iota of demand passes through their mind, they will feel miserable. But if they don't remain in that high consciousness, then they blame the Master for everything.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme will not keep in His Mind success or failure. He will keep only the experience in His Mind. When you do something and there is no success, then you will be very sad and disturbed. But you should feel from within that no matter which result you get, you will be equally happy. You have to feel that it is not the success or failure that you want; it is only the experience that you need in order to grow. Then the result will be in accordance with the divine Will. Otherwise you will only cry for success and if you get failure you will feel miserable. So when you do something, if you are inspired from within, then you will be satisfied with either success or failure. Whatever experience the divine force wants to give you, you will take it as an experience.</p>
