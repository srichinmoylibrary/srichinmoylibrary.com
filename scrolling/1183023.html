<p>He and his wife were not vegetarians. The Master knew it but did not pay any attention to it. One day they saw that two very close disciples of the Master were enjoying meat and they were terribly shocked. How could such close disciples eat meat? Either the Master had given them permission or they were deceiving the Master. The husband and wife felt that either the Master was bad or the disciples were bad. They didn’t want to stay with a bad family, so they left. They didn’t know that the Master himself had asked these two disciples to eat meat because they were not well and their doctor had requested that they eat meat.</p>

<p>She was a middle-aged woman. One day she came to the Centre to do selfless service. There were quite a few young boys and girls who were working that day at the Centre. God alone knows why, but she tried to steal a five-dollar bill out of a young boy’s pocket. She was caught by one of the disciples, who told the young boy. The young boy very politely asked her to return the money. She did not deny that she had stolen it and she gave the money back to the owner. Then she came up to the Master crying. When the Master heard the story, he felt extremely sorry for her and told her that God had forgiven her. Do you want to hear what she said to the Master? “Master, God has forgiven me, true; but I have not forgiven <em>you</em>. I have been with you for three years. How is it that you have not changed my character? I have made no improvement since I came to you and joined your path. I am a hopeless case and you are a useless Master. I shall be looking for a new Master. ”</p>

<p>One day a woman disciple said to the Master, “Master, why do you criticise the astrologers so mercilessly?”</p>
<p>The Master said, “I just make fun of astrologers from time to time. I never intend to hurt them.”</p>
<p>“Master, I am an astrologer. People on this island believe in astrology. They have tremendous faith in it. Therefore, they have all admiration for me. I told them that this whole land would sink into the ocean by such and such a day. You told the radio station and television station that nothing was going to happen and, unfortunately, nothing <em>did</em> happen. I and my astrologer-friends were absolutely sure that this island of ours was going to be washed away. Now that our prophecy has not come true, everybody is laughing at us. We all know that you are the culprit. It was you who used your occult power to negate our prophecy. Otherwise, our prophecy would have undoubtedly come true.”</p>
<p>The Master said to her smilingly, “I have nothing else to do with myself but use occult power to prove that you or your colleagues are wrong.”</p>
<p>She said to the Master, “You are not only an occultist of the first order, but also a liar of the first order. You have deceived the whole of our island. Therefore, I hate you and I am leaving your path immediately.”</p>

<p>He thought that since he was an Indian he would receive special affection and love from his Master. Alas, the Master did not fulfil his expectation. In vain he stayed with the Master for eight long months and then one day he said to the Master, “You don’t care for the Indian heart. You care only for the American purse.”</p>
<p>The Master said to him, “Had I really cared for the American dollar, by this time I would have become a very, very rich man. It was not American money-power, but American heart-power that conquered me; and it was certainly not your deception-power.”</p>
<p>The Indian became angry and left the Master.</p>

<p>She asked her Master one day to open up her third eye. The Master said to her that he could not do it since it was not God’s Will. She did not believe the Master. She told the Master that it was his own insecurity that made him refuse to open her third eye. If her third eye were opened up, naturally she would be as great as her Master; and how could the Master have somebody at his own level? Therefore, she left the Master and tried to open her third eye without anybody’s help. What she did was to make a big hole in her forehead by striking her head against one of the kitchen utensils. The Master felt miserable but he was helpless because she was no longer in his Centre.</p>

<p>The Master said, “Krishna’s compassion-power and his money-power do not go together at the same time in your life.”</p>
<p>She said to the Master, “But you are the Krishna of the present era. You could help me financially.”</p>
<p>The Master said to her, “Occasionally I will be able to help you, but not regularly, since my own financial situation is very deplorable.” She was not satisfied with the Master’s sincerity and she left his path.</p>

<p>She was a middle-aged woman. She had a brother who was very unkind to her or, to use her own word, belligerent. He used to strike her mercilessly, in season and out of season. As a last resort she came to the Master for help. The Master went to her house and had a long talk with her brother, and her brother solemnly promised the Master that he would not strike her anymore. Lo and behold, he kept his promise. The woman found that it was no longer necessary for her to come to the Master, for she had no other need which she wanted the Master to fulfil. She did not need God. What she needed was her sympathetic brother.</p>

<p>He asked the Master whether he should study or work. The Master asked him to study. He wanted to know what to study. The Master asked him to study medicine. So he listened to the Master and began to study medicine. Alas, soon he fell in love with one of the beautiful girls in his class. He told the Master’s other disciples that the Master was to blame for his downfall since it was the Master who had asked him to study medicine. Had he worked instead of studying medicine, he would not have entered into the emotional life. The Master smiled and said, “That means people who work have no emotional problems.”</p>
<p>The Master said to his doctor-friend, “Your Master came into the world to be misunderstood.”</p>
<p>He said to the Master, “You are not my Master; you don’t deserve to be my Master. My temptation-life is the Master. You take care of yourself, sir, and let me take care of myself.”</p>

<p>She and her husband and their two little daughters became the Master’s disciples. The wife felt sad and miserable that her children were not getting as much attention as the children of some of the other parents.</p>
<p>One day she came and threatened the Master. “Master, be impartial. My children are also God’s children. How is it that you don’t care so much for my children?”</p>
<p>The Master said, “I have equal love for each child, but some receive my love and concern in abundant measure while others do not receive it at all. In your children’s case, unfortunately, they do not receive my affection and love. I am not the culprit.”</p>
<p>She said, “Then who else is the culprit? Don’t fool me anymore. You can fool only my husband. Let him stay with you. I and my children are leaving you. I am not as stupid as my husband. Stupidity is not spirituality. Sincerity is spirituality. I am that sincerity.”</p>

<p>The Master had a German disciple. She always asked the Master the same question: “Can you tell me, Master, the condition of my soul?” Six or seven times the Master with utmost compassion told her about the condition of her soul.</p>
<p>Once the Master had to answer quite a few serious questions in a Centre meeting, and he was completely exhausted. Then, the last question was asked by the German lady: “Can you please tell me, Master, about the condition of my soul?”</p>
<p>The Master was not kind enough on that day, which he should have been. He simply said, “What will you do with the condition of your soul? Take care of your vital life and mental life.”</p>
<p>The woman became furious and told one of the Master’s disciples, who was a boxer, that she would have nothing further to do with an unsympathetic, cruel Master.</p>

<p>This particular lady wanted to have a special interview with the Master. In those days the Master had very few disciples, and he was more than willing to grant interviews. Now, however, the story is totally different. But the day this lady wanted to have an interview with the Master, God knows why the Master did not want to see her. During that evening’s meditation, a sister of the Master who was in Heaven came down to the Master and pleaded with him to grant an interview to this particular seeker. But the Master did not want to grant the interview because he knew that he had quite a few important things to do in the next few days.</p>
<p>The Master’s sister scolded the Master and said, “You have to do it. This is my request and command. You have to give the interview.” She said that this particular woman had a special connection with her and when the time came for this seeker to become the Master’s disciple, she should be given the same name as hers. Sister’s demand and sister’s command the Master had to follow.</p>
<p>The Master gave quite a few significant interviews, plus inner experiences of a very high order, to this particular lady, but her photographer-husband was totally against her spiritual life. Eventually the photographer-husband won and the Master lost the disciple.</p>
<p>After the lady left the Master’s path, the Master said to his sister, who was in Heaven, “Look why I didn’t feel like giving interviews to that particular disciple.” But the sister only gave her brother a broad smile and said that there was nothing wrong in trying to illumine someone’s agelong darkness.</p>

<p>He was a businessman who sold vegetable cutters. He thought that since the Master had quite a few disciples, he would be able to sell his vegetable cutters to them. He gave a free demonstration of his machine. The Master felt sorry for him and bought four or five sets which he presented to his favourite disciples. But the man was not satisfied.

They used their credulous hearts and this pained him tremendously. He felt from within that he could be his own saviour; there was no need of an outer agent to save his life. But strangely enough, there had been many occasions when he, the victim, could not help himself. His sister and brother’s Master, whose path he followed for a short while, helped him considerably to get out of his mind-desire and vital-jungle. His sister and brother’s Master had always kept his heart’s door wide open to him, both in the inner world and in the outer world, for the Master had a special preference for this boy with the young, brilliant mind. But the boy left because he had something else to do, other than what his sister and brother were doing.</p>
