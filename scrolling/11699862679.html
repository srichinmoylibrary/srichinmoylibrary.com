<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Training the physical mind does not destroy the intuition of a child. Only it puts aside the intuitive faculty. The intuitive capacity does not and cannot function when the physical mind is too active. But when the physical mind is alert or active, you can't say that intuition will totally be destroyed. No, only the intuition power cannot function properly. When the seeker begins to aspire and consciously prays and meditates, the physical mind is transformed into the illumined mind. At that time, the dormant intuitive faculty bears fruit.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How necessary is a formal education?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How necessary is a formal education?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on the individual. It is true that most human beings must have a formal education. Otherwise, they will not be of much use to society. If you don't get a formal education, you will act not only like a fool but also like an animal.</p>
<p>But again, one does not have to go to school in order to get formal education. India's Rabindranath Tagore and George Bernard Shaw of the West — to name just two — are among those who did not go to so-called high schools and colleges to get a formal education. But they did get education, a broad formal education. For formal education does not mean schooling. Formal education means learning the knowledge that is necessary in order to conquer the world. In order to have a strong footing in the world, it is quite necessary for a human being to have formal education.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What is really important in life is self-giving. To whom do we give ourselves? We give ourselves to God inside all human beings. How do we do that? We do that by feeling that there is no other way to become happy and fulfilled in life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can keep our outer education from being an obstacle to our inner education by allowing the inner education to come to the fore and illumine the outer education.</p>
<p>The outer education is world-information; the inner education is self-realisation. It is only self-realisation that can illumine and transform world-information and take world-information into another world, which is known as the experience-world.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A child can be educated without losing his spontaneity and freedom only when the teacher consciously feels that God Himself is an eternal Child who does everything spontaneously by exercising His divine Freedom. And what is His divine Freedom? His divine Freedom is constant, conscious and unconditional Self-giving.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The teacher can always offer her heart to her students provided she feels that she is not just teaching ignorant students. She has to feel that what she is actually doing is pleasing her beloved Supreme and serving her beloved Supreme in His own way by serving the students.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can help a person to remember a thing or an incident by doing two things. First, you can tell him that he is not the forgetful mind but the all-remembering soul that knows the Beginning's beginning and the ever-transcending End. You can consciously pray to the Supreme to grant your dear one the capacity to have a new mind, a new mental receptivity, a new mental awakening.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two roads that lead to the same destination. One road is known as the Compassion-road and the other road is known as the Discipline-road. Although both roads lead to the same destination, God prefers the Compassion-road over the Discipline-road; for He feels that if a child walks along His Compassion-road, then the child will be able to walk much faster.</p>
<p>Only when everything else fails does God resort to disciplining the lives of His students. But again, God tells us that even His disciplinary action is nothing short of Compassion, for it is His compassionate Heart which makes Him want to illumine and perfect His children.</p>
<p>Compassion is the first and foremost approach in dealing with unruly children. Discipline is the last resort. Again, on the practical level, the teacher must observe secretly whether a particular student responds more to life's compassionate aspect or life's disciplinary aspect. By knowing that, he can easily do the needful.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, every individual should be educated to his fullest capacity because education is self-cultivation. The more one cultivates oneself, the more one comes to realise what his ultimate realisation is. His ultimate realisation is self-transcendence, and for that an ever-transcending education is necessary.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When will the Supreme introduce a new educational system? The Supreme will introduce a new educational system only when our consciousness becomes more receptive, more aspiring, more self-giving.</p>
<p>How will the Supreme introduce a new educational system? The Supreme will introduce a new educational system by making us feel that the new educational system is nothing but self-illumination and life-perfection.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. Anything that is progressive, anything that is illumining, anything that is fulfilling is the result of conscious or unconscious meditation. If the meditation is conscious, then the progress is noticeable sooner than at once. If the meditation is unconscious, then the progress cannot be quick and it may not be noted outwardly.</p>

Then, try to feel that you are not writing papers as such, you are writing soulful letters to God Himself. If you do that, then you are bound to be surcharged with inspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A student who is trying to be spiritual must have a good feeling toward her earthly teachers, for it is God Himself who is teaching her through her earthly teachers — for a special purpose.</p>
<p>God is both earth-teacher and Heaven-teacher. When He plays the role of earth-teacher, He tells His students that no matter how ignorant they are, still He is ready and eager to teach them And when He plays the role of Heaven-teacher, He tells His students that He and they are one and inseparable. He is the tree and they are His leaves, flowers and fruits.</p>
