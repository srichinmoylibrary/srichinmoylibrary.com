<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the heart and the vital. Sometimes the lower vital movements come forward and enter into the heart. Sometimes the heart's sweetest joy and light enter into the vital in order to transform it. Before it is transformed, the vital is all impurity. But once abundant purity enters into it, it is all divinely dynamic energy.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Usually a vital demand comes from a very low plane of consciousness. This plane is unlit, impure, frightening and threatening. It tempts us to lead a very undivine and corrupted life. Those who lead this kind of life should feel that their hour has not yet struck. Further, a vital demand is always destructive. It does not embody any light and at the same time it does not care for light.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The conflict is within, but we can control the senses. By suppressing the senses we will never be able to control them permanently. Suppression can allow us to control the senses temporarily, but ultimately we have to transcend the senses.</p>
<p>Transcend is a very big word. How can we transcend desire or the life of the senses? We can do it through aspiration. We have to know the meaning of these two words. If we live in aspiration, which goes up, up, up, it will take us up with it. Then automatically the senses will be purified and will be under control; the senses or emotions will be transcended. But if we live in constant desires, then what happens? The senses come to the fore, hungry to be fed. We have millions of ordinary silly desires, which we try to fulfil. If the senses get nourishment they become more powerful and we are caught by them. Then we can never transcend them. If we feed them all the time, how can we control them?</p>
<p>But by suppression alone what are we doing? We are taking the negative path. We are trying to conquer the senses by force. But we can never get joy either in our own life or in the lives of others by using force. By beating or striking our vital desires we can never get joy. Only by pouring illumination into them can we get real joy. The senses can be brought under control only by being transformed and there is only one way to transform them. It is through constant sincere aspiration. This is the only way.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Whenever I see a beautiful woman, sex thoughts enter my mind. I try to destroy them, but they persist.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Whenever I see a beautiful woman, sex thoughts enter my mind. I try to destroy them, but they persist." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two ways to solve this problem. As soon as you see a beautiful woman just try to lift her entire body up into the sky with your will. Look at her and concentrate and lift her up so that like a kite she is flying. The other way, the easiest way, is when you see a woman to look only at her feet. Indian <em>sadhus</em> say to look only at the feet, not at the eyes, not at the face. Look at the feet if you want immediate release from temptation. Look at the feet and then try with your whole consciousness to go deep within. This takes only a second. Either lift this woman up or look at her feet. Then immediately lower vital thoughts have to be controlled. Many have done it and have been very successful. There was a great Indian <em>avatar</em> named Sri Chaitanya. He used to tell all his disciples, "Even if it is your mother, don't look at her eyes; just look at her feet."</p>
<p>But these methods are only for beginners. A day will come when you will have to look at women with your eyes open and, with your inner experiences, with your own inner realisation, go beyond the feeling of man and woman. There is it only one universal Consciousness; there is no masculine, no feminine. There is only one consciousness flowing in two different forms. This feeling can be developed only with our own inner development. It is a very advanced state. Right now perhaps we don't even feel oneness with our limbs. If I can throw a shotput farther with my right hand than with my left hand, I give more importance to my right hand and I ignore my left hand. I have seen many athletes who curse their left hand because they need the help of the left hand even though it is not as powerful as the right. If we cannot feel oneness even with our own two hands, how can we be one with another person? With aspiration and with our inner spiritual development the whole creation becomes ours. At that time there is no difficulty.</p>

Americans are all animals. Why have you come to America to help these people with your spiritual light?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Is India above sex? I don't think the population would be so large if there were no sexuality in India. You have condemned American life, but who has compelled you to stay here? You can go back to India if the vital life of Americans is disturbing you.</p>
<p>Sex life right now is almost a universal necessity. It is not only an American problem or Indian problem or a European problem. If one wants to transcend it, there is a way: it is aspiration. But one has no right to hate or condemn America exclusively. If this is a disease, it is a universal disease. If it is a necessity, it is a universal necessity for these who have not consciously begun to to transcend their imperfections and limitations. India's great Swami Vivekananda also had the idea that Americans were not at all pure, that they were all animals. But Vivekananda came to America to the Parliament of Religions in Chicago, and it was America who accepted his light first, while India did not recognise him.</p>
<p>Purification and aspiration must go together side by side. If you want to wait for purification before you start your aspiration, then you will have to wait for eternity. Nobody is pure until he has made himself pure through his soulful aspiration. If an individual believes that he has to be pure before he can dare to utter the name of God, he is wrong. Only when he utters the name of God does he get a little purity. Once he has purity, if he repeats the name of God, at that time his aspiration will become deeper and more intense. Aspiration and purification go together. Aspiration increases purity and purity increases aspiration. It is a mutual service.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you talk about sexual abstention in terms of getting to a higher consciousness?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you talk about sexual abstention in terms of getting to a higher consciousness?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> 'Higher consciousness' is a vague term. If somebody says, "This is my higher consciousness," a second person will say, "My higher consciousness is infinitely higher than that." A third person will say, "Oh, that is all low consciousness in my view. When I see your highest consciousness, I see that it is equal to my lowest consciousness." Let us use the word 'aspiration' instead.</p>
<p>In our aspiration we have to know what our goal is. We have to know how high we want to go. For a child, a few feet is very high, but for a grown-up it is quite low, and for a pilot in an airplane it is no height at all. When our aspiration mounts, it goes infinitely higher than any airplane can go. If we want to lead an ordinary life and have just a little aspiration, we can do so. Those who have a little aspiration are better than those who have none at all, because at least they are trying to get a little light. For some time they remain in light and for some time they remain in darkness. They are just like babies. Their capacity is very limited. But again, there are people who want to remain in light twenty-four hours a day. For those who want to touch the Highest, physical abstinence is necessary. For everything we have to pay some price. The higher we go with our aspiration, the greater is our delight. The aspirant has to know what he wants. If his ultimate goal is the Highest, then gradually he has to give up the sex life. But if he stops the sex life all at once, he will be doomed. Inner purification has to be accomplished gradually.</p>
<p>If we have done something for many years and we stop it all at once, this sudden change may tell upon our health. But if we do it gradually, then it will not affect us. For centuries in many previous incarnations we have indulged in sex. Then we start aspiring and want to go to the Highest.</p>
<p>When we get inner experiences our entire being will be flooded with delight and ecstasy. Then we will see the difference between the physical life and the spiritual life, between real food and clay. When we were children we used to eat mud, dirt, rocks and all kinds of undivine things. At that time we thought it was most delicious food. But when we grow up we eat only proper food. Similarly when we are children in the spiritual life we also enjoy undivine things. But when we grow up we see that these enjoyments are all impure and undivine. At that time we are ready to give them up.</p>

If everybody did that, there would be no more incarnations!</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If everyone followed the spiritual path they would reach a time when they would give up their sexual lives. If everybody did that, there would be no more incarnations!" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How do you know there would be no more incarnations? You are wrong because unfortunately you have not entered into the soul's region.</p>
<p>Human procreation is one way to bring human life to earth. You are under the impression that if everyone stopped his sex life, no souls would be able to enter into the world. Unfortunately, you do not know that there are many souls in the vital world, in the intuitive world, and in other worlds which could come without that process. The spiritual Masters are seeing this in the inner worlds. These souls will take human form without going through the ordinary process. In a few hundred years you yourself will see this happening.</p>
<p>You know that once upon a time we were all in the animal kingdom. We were every kind of animal. But now that we have all become human beings, are all the animals gone? No! We have become human beings, but still we see animals all around us. Our evolution has progressed very far, and we are now in the process of realising God. But there are people who realised God thousands of years ago and who are now divinised supermen, transformed beings. When they come into the world you can see the same sort of difference between them and ordinary people who are not aspiring, as we can see between ourselves and the animals we once were. If a realised person showed his inner world to you, his inner Peace, inner Light and inner Power, then you would see an immeasurable difference between yourself and him.</p>
<p>In the future, souls will descend into the world without going through the process of human procreation. God's ever-transcending creation will never come to an end. If you had been able to enter into the highest kind of meditation, you would have been able to envision the future and see how souls will come down to earth in the future. Now you have made progress; you are a human being. But once upon a time you were an animal. The unimaginable difference between an animal and a human being is something like the difference you will see between the human beings who are on earth today and the divine men who will live on earth in the future.</p>

But spiritual teachers say that sex desire stands in the way of inner growth. Who is right?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Freud claimed that sex was in practically all relationships, beginning with the infant-mother relationship. I do not agree with this. Freud failed to notice the sweet purity and self-giving quality of genuine mother love. Although Freud was a pioneer in his field, others have gone much further both during his time and since then. One of his colleagues, Carl Jung, disagreed with Freud's limited view. Jung placed more emphasis on the blossoming of the soul, the flower within. He said that in the soul lies intuition, the psyche and the promptings of the unconscious with its accumulated knowledge and experience of many lifetimes. The soul is the source of healing and inner growth and is in direct touch with the wisdom of the Beyond.</p>
<p>It is foolish to try to reduce all human and divine impulses to the so-called sex drive. When we enter into the spiritual life, our aspiration alone can feed and sustain us, bringing the light of consciousness into our life. Then we react differently to all experiences. Life's occurrences are seen consciously in the light of the soul, instead of looming up as problems constantly to be solved.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You must ask your Guru to help you solve this problem. Perhaps you do not understand what he meant by enjoyment. You should write to him or ask some spiritual brother of yours in whom you have faith, what his philosophy actually says concerning vital enjoyment. Since you are his disciple you should follow his path and his philosophy. If you find that your Master's philosophy does in fact allow this kind of vital enjoyment, and you still feel that you cannot reach fulfillment by following it, then you should leave the Master's path and find one which can lead you farther in your spiritual life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each individual has two beings: the demanding vital and the surrendering heart. A conflict between the two is happening daily in you. At the end of the day, if you are conscious, you will know how many times you consciously took the side of the heart and how many times you took the side of the vital.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Is there any difference between emotion and the vital?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Emotion and the vital are two different things. You can say that the vital is the house and in that house emotion is the tenant. The most predominant emotion is the vital emotion. But emotion can also be in the body, in the mind and in the heart. Emotion in the body usually degrades our consciousness. Emotion in the impure heart blinds and binds us, while emotion in the pure heart illumines us and liberates us. In the mind there is some emotion, but the mind is by nature dry and it does not have the kind of exuberant or uncontrolled, childlike or childish emotion of the vital. When we say, "He is an emotional fellow," we are referring to his undisciplined and unillumined vital emotion. This emotion usually originates in the two centres below the navel centre.</p>
<p>Some of you disappoint me very badly with your emotional vital problems. Please try to purify your vital world. I will be most proud of each of you the moment I see the purification of your vital. I shall be bloated with divine pride that my spiritual children are really pure.</p>
<p>If there is no effort to transform the vital emotional life into the purest spiritual life, then all your spiritual activities will be a kind of self-deception, and in self-deception there is no God-realisation. Many so-called aspirants feel that they can deceive their spiritual Master. They pretend to be the purest virgins and the most complete celibates. But God has given the true spiritual Masters a third eye which is fully open. They are always aware of the aspirants' imperfections and shortcomings.</p>
<p>If you can transform your vital emotions into divine joy, this divine emotion is not bad. When you use your emotions for enjoyment or self-indulgence, then you are ruining your inner life. But if you use it for inner determination, for self-liberation, then emotion is the strongest power in you. Please use it in this way, as your inner assistant.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it wrong for spiritual aspirants to demonstrate their affection for each other physically in public?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it wrong for spiritual aspirants to demonstrate their affection for each other physically in public?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The display of emotions in public can lead to serious problems for spiritual aspirants. You may feel that your consciousness is very high at all times, but the consciousness of your brother and sister aspirants may not be as high as yours. You have no right to create undivine thoughts in their minds by your conduct. You have every right to do anything you wish in private, but when in public you should also keep the rights of others in mind. Whether your consciousness is on the highest plane or not is for God to judge. But your behaviour may make it difficult for others who are observing you to keep their consciousness high. If they have an iota of aspiration, your demonstrative behaviour may make their aspiration descend. We have come into the world to inspire others. If their aspiration descends because of us then we are committing a real crime against their souls. If you feel that your emotions are pure enough, then do whatever you wish to do in private.</p>
<p>Sometimes others may complain about your conduct because you are doing something which they themselves want to do, but which they don't dare to do. In this case, they are complaining out of jealousy. But in some people's cases no jealousy is involved. They are simply weak; they are not yet strong or solid in their aspiration, so their consciousness and their aspiration descend when they see their friends kissing or embracing, or even just touching each other. A young boy may be struggling to control his vital life, and although you may be superior to him, you can lower his consciousness and re-awaken his lower vital. This is very bad on your part. If something you do decreases the inspiration and aspiration of some of your spiritual brothers and sisters, then you should stop doing it out of the kindness, love and consideration which you feel for them.</p>
<p>The physical exchange of love between girls is most unhealthy, and the same is true for boys; also, when husbands display affection for other women, or when wives display affection for other men.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Should we try to help other people with their emotional problems?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Should we try to help other people with their emotional problems?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A disciple of mine who was a psychologist once tried to help two women with their emotional problems. One wanted to commit suicide and the other wanted to leave her husband. What happened? While he was attempting to cure their vital weaknesses, he was attacked and caught by their lower vital forces.</p>
<p>Who had asked him to help them? Only his own ego. The women did not come to him for his solution to their lower vital, sex problems but for help with their worries and anxieties. Some persons are sincere in their attempts to help others, but they do not know that the moment they try to help and cure someone, the entire imperfection of the patient comes and attacks them. Then they are lost, totally lost. Fortunately, this disciple was sincere enough. He came to me with both the patients and now all the problems are solved.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The expansion of the heart is very good, very necessary. But we have to know that sometimes what we are expanding is our lower vital instead of our heart. When you have this experience that you are describing, please be very conscious. Expansion of the heart, the psychic heart, the pure heart, is very good. But very often the impure vital comes to the fore instead.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one way to deal with these. We must feel that the world is not around us or in front of us, but deep within us; therefore, we have to try to achieve our own purification and the transformation of our nature. The more we are inwardly purified and transformed, the sooner the world's transformation will take place.</p>
