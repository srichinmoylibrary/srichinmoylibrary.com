<p>This morning, while walking around London, I went into an Indian store that sold magazines and candy. Magazines I didn't get, but I did buy a chocolate bar — I think it is called "Tiger" — for 19 pence.</p>
<p>As soon as I came out of the store, a tall man said to me, "Good morning! Last night I was at your concert and I heard your music. I also am a musician. I play music, but you <em>are</em> music itself!"</p>
<p>Since he was flattering me, I gave him a piece of the chocolate bar. He took it with such joy and appreciation.</p>

<p>After the London Peace Concert, a certain spiritual teacher came up to me backstage. He was bowing down and saying, "Please bless me, please bless me!"</p>
<p>Was I going to place my hand on his head? No! I only bless my own disciples. But I gave him a flower. This particular teacher used to be a doctor before he became a spiritual Master. Now he has quite a few disciples. He has asked his disciples always to participate in our activities because he has such love and admiration for me. His disciples keep my picture on their shrine, along with the pictures of other spiritual Masters.</p>
<p>Last week his disciples in San Francisco invited our disciples to come and play my music for them in their Centre.</p>

<p>After the Toronto Concert, I met with one of the officials from the Consulate of India. Many years ago I worked with him in the Consulate in New York.</p>
<p>He said to me, "Your very name is a phenomenon. You carry two worlds inside you — Eastern and Western. It is such a rare thing. Your music has transported my wife and me almost into a trance. Please let us know when you are coming again so we can be with you and be blessed by you."</p>
<p>I thanked him and said, "I am so grateful to you. Your very presence is a blessing to me and to us all."</p>

<p>The morning after the San Francisco Peace Concert, I went to visit to Narada's studio.</p>
<p>While I was waiting for the elevator to come, a very fat man came up and shook hands with me for no reason. Then he said, "You are the most handsome musician I've ever seen. Now tell me something. One moment you walk across the stage like an invalid. But the next moment you play the cello so powerfully and dramatically. Your playing is full of life. And then, when you walk back to play another instrument, you are an invalid again. How do you switch back and forth like that?"</p>
<p>At that time the elevator came and we went inside. Both of us were smiling at each other in the elevator as it went up.</p>

<p>When I went to the Spanish Consulate to get my visa, the clerk was very unkind. For a long time she was avoiding and ignoring everyone. Then a little girl came to our rescue; she came as our saviour.</p>
<p>She was only two or three years old, and she was smiling and laughing and making lots of noise. She was very cute, and she made everybody smile. Even the undivine clerk started smiling, and then everything changed for the better; she started to do her job properly. Soon we got everything we needed. Otherwise how many hours we would have stayed there!</p>
<p>So that little girl changed our fate. God sent her to help us and save us.</p>

<p>The first time I went to France, Air France told me I didn't need a visa. But when I arrived at the airport in France, the authorities wouldn't allow me to enter the country. For at least 45 minutes they delayed me!</p>
<p>I had to call the Indian Embassy in Washington. The Ambassador happened to be Bengali. We spoke in Bengali over the phone, and then he spoke to the authorities at the airport.</p>
<p>The people at the airport were so impressed that I was speaking to the Ambassador himself in Bengali. All of a sudden they became very affectionate. They began finding fault with my tie, saying I didn't know how to put it on properly. Then they fixed it for me.</p>
<p>So first they were harassing me, and then they were fixing my tie!</p>

<p>When the Mayor was escorting me to the reception after the meeting, he was saying that although the building was old, he has new, modern thoughts there. The building was built in the 16th century.</p>

<p>Last night he phoned our Madrid hotel from America. The switchboard connected him with my room. When I said, "Hello," Ketan said, "Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! I wanted to speak to Bipin."</p>
<p>I said, "Give me some news."</p>
<p>He said, "Oh no, they have made the wrong connection!"</p>
<p>I said again, "Give me some news. What is happening in New York?"</p>

<p>He could not figure out how it was possible for me not to know the name of the place and the hour of the concert, since I was the one performing.</p>

<p>When Agraha and I were shopping in Madrid, we saw a Chinese instrument with two strings. The sound was good, but the price was not good.</p>
<p>They said, "12,030," or something like that. So I wanted to say, "10,000."</p>
<p>But Agraha, the great Spanish scholar, told them 9,000.</p>
<p>"Agraha!" I said.</p>
<p>They said, "Impossible!"</p>
<p>I asked Agraha why he didn't say 10,000. He said, "Since you like bargaining, I said 9,000 so you can go up." Then he offered 10,000, but the man still said, "Impossible."</p>
<p>Agraha said, "11,000," but the man would not come down. They were greedy and they thought that we might again go up.</p>
<p>They were greedy and we were cheap, so we didn't buy it.</p>

<p>Then he started chanting "pranam." As soon as he started chanting, the two nurses who were there jumped up from their chairs to see. Before this, the nurses had been calling him, but he hadn't responded.</p>
<p>Andre went on chanting so loudly that the nurses were pushing each other's shoulders out of excitement. He was so happy, and four or five times he smiled.</p>
