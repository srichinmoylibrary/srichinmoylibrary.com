  <h2 id="page-title">Receptivity</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Receptivity" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Receptivity is emptiness. What we call emptiness today, that very thing we can aptly call fulness tomorrow. Let us try to lead once more a life of simplicity, humility, sincerity, purity, gratitude and surrender. Some of you may think and feel that you are already blessed with these divine qualities. To you, my simple request is this: you should try to discover the capacities of these divine qualities. Simplicity increases receptivity in our physical body. Humility increases receptivity in our vital. Sincerity increases receptivity in our mind. Purity increases receptivity in our heart. Gratitude increases receptivity in our aspiration-life. Surrender increases receptivity in our dedication-life.</p>
<p>The way we live either increases or decreases our power of receptivity. There are two ways of living: wrong living and right living. There are two kinds of human beings on earth: the ignorance-lover and the God-lover. The ignorance-lover wrongly depends on wrong living. The God-lover rightly depends on right living.</p>
<p>Receptivity is available in two worlds: the desire-world and the aspiration-world. In the desire-world, receptivity is found in the thick jungle of attachment. In the aspiration-world, receptivity is found in the beautiful garden of devotedness.</p>
<p>Receptivity succeeds and receptivity proceeds. When we invoke God the divine Light, our receptivity succeeds in the battlefield of life. When we invoke God the supreme Delight, our receptivity proceeds along Eternity’s all-fulfilling and all-satisfying Road.</p>
<p>Measureless and fathomless receptivity we can have if we are not afraid of the unknown and if we are ready to love the Unknowable.</p>
<p>Here we are at Harvard. Harvard embodies unparalleled capacities, and one unparalleled, sky-vast capacity is its sea-deep receptivity. Again, receptivity comes from God’s Compassion-Eye, and God’s Compassion-Eye comes from God’s Oneness-Heart. This Oneness-Heart each seeker can have, provided he claims God’s Oneness-Heart as his own, very own. Once a seeker can claim God’s Oneness-Heart as his very own, his will be the measureless and fathomless receptivity. And inside his fathomless receptivity, at every moment what will loom large is God’s own Transcendental Vision. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Surrender</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Surrender" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Why do I surrender? I surrender because I want to prove to myself, and to nobody else, that I am a great Truth-seeker, a mighty light-discoverer and a perfect God-lover.</p>
<p>What do I surrender? I surrender my unconscious body, my ferocious vital, my doubting mind and my fearful heart.</p>
<p>To whom do I surrender all this? I surrender all this to my Beloved Supreme, to Him alone whom I claim to be my only sweet Dream and my only pure Reality.</p>
<p>No pretence, no pretence! I do not want to pretend that I have made my surrender complete and perfect. No, my entire being I still have not surrendered to the dictates of my Beloved Supreme. My complete surrender, my unconditional surrender, is still a far cry. Yet I do feel that there shall come a time when my entire being will be His, only His. Then only will my surrender be complete, and I will be His Vision-Reality. For complete surrender what I need is intense aspiration, the constantly mounting flame that climbs up to reach not only the unknown but also the Unknowable.</p>
<p>Lo, I have made my surrender to my Lord Supreme complete. Now, what have I learnt from my complete surrender? Previously I thought that God is all Power, but now I clearly see that His Power is nothing other than His Love. I see that I have surrendered not to God the Power but to God the Love, to God who is all Love. This is not my mind’s hallucination but my heart’s illumination.</p>
<p>Before, I thought that I had many enemies. I did not want to surrender to anybody for I thought that the entire world was my enemy. But now I clearly see that all along I had only one enemy, and that enemy was myself. Now that I have surrendered my very existence to my Lord Supreme, I have no enemies — not even myself. I have only oneness-friends inside the Heart of my universal Oneness-Friend: my Source, my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Before my life of surrender, I wanted world-attention in order to please myself. Now I wish only for my Lord’s constant examination so that I can perfect myself in every way. My new life of surrender will make the world feel that unconditional surrender to the Lord Supreme is not an impossible task. No, it is a task that every human being will eventually have to perform so that perfection will become his outer name and satisfaction will become his inner name.</p>
<p>Now that I have surrendered, I am enjoying vastness in infinite measure. Surrender is my oneness with Eternity’s Peace, Infinity’s Bliss and Immortality’s Love. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A seeker’s heart-songs</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="A seeker’s heart-songs" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We are all seekers—seekers of Truth. For us there can be nothing more valuable or significant than realisation.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of realisation: I can, I have and I am. I can see the face of Truth, the Transcendental Truth. I have deep within me Eternity, Infinity and Immortality. I am God. These are the main realisations that each individual will eventually achieve.</p>
<p>In order to achieve realisation, aspiration is of supreme importance. Eternity’s two immortal friends are aspiration and realisation. The goal of aspiration is to ascend. The goal of realisation is to transcend.</p>
<p>Inspiration is also of paramount importance. Our inspiration carries us from the foot of the life-tree to the topmost branch of the life-tree. Our aspiration takes us from the world of suffering to the world of light and delight. Our realisation transforms our Eternity’s cry into our Infinity’s smile. Our Eternity’s cry is what we now have. Our Infinity’s smile is what we shall one day become.</p>
<p>Each individual seeker has an inner cry, which we call aspiration. Again, each individual seeker has an inner message: dedication. Our dedication makes us feel that God the Creator and God the Creation are inseparably one. Therefore, while serving God the Creation, we are becoming one with God the Creator.</p>
<p>Aspiration teaches us the necessity of realisation, and realisation teaches us the necessity of self-transcendence. Why? Because our Source, our Beloved Supreme Himself, at every moment is transcending His own Vision-Reality and His own Reality-Vision.</p>
<p>Dedication is part and parcel of God-manifestation. Since God is ever-transcending, there is no end to our God-manifestation. Therefore, manifestation also makes us feel the necessity of self-transcendence. Our self-transcendence takes place in and through our God-manifestation here on earth. Each time we transcend ourselves we see that God is being manifested in and through us in a most special and significant way.</p>
<p>Our dedication and realisation tell us that we always have to go beyond, beyond, beyond. Today’s goal is only the starting point for tomorrow’s journey. Today’s perfection marks the very beginning of tomorrow’s new creation. Today’s satisfaction is the harbinger of an even greater hunger for more purity, more beauty and more closeness and oneness with God.</p>
<p>Realisation is beauty’s flower and duty’s fruit. Beauty’s flower is our heart, and duty’s fruit is our life. Beauty is our self-giving; duty is our God-becoming. Beauty reveals the Infinite in the finite; duty manifests the Immortal in the mortal. Beauty tells the God-seeker that his Source is in God. Duty tells the God-seeker that his life is for God and God alone.</p>
<p>Indian philosophy, Indian religion and Indian spirituality from time immemorial have had only one message—the message of realisation, or “Know thyself.” When a seeker knows himself, he declares, “/Aham Brahmasmi/ — I am Brahman, the One without a second.” This same message was offered here in the West when the Saviour declared, “I and my Father are one.” This is the loftiest realisation of the soul.</p>
<p>In order to have the experience of God-realisation, each individual has to develop some inner discipline. Again, inside this inner discipline, the easiest way to approach the highest Reality is through love, devotion and surrender.</p>
<p>I am speaking here of divine love, which is altogether different from human love. Human love tries to possess and be possessed. Therefore, human love always fails to satisfy us. But divine love at each moment wants to expand and, while expanding, it liberates.</p>
<p>Human devotion is nothing short of attachment. In human devotion, the devotee and the object of his devotion are like two blind beggars with no goal or destination. But divine devotion only intensifies our inner cry for higher light and delight. Divine devotion intensifies our heart’s purity at every moment, and this is of paramount importance in realising the Absolute Reality.</p>
<p>Last comes surrender. In human life we surrender to our superiors. Like slaves we surrender to those who have power over us. But this kind of surrender is a far cry from spiritual surrender. When a human being surrenders to a superior, there is no guarantee that this so-called superior possesses more light.</p>
<p>In divine surrender we surrender to our Source, so that we can consciously become part and parcel of that Source. In the spiritual life we surrender cheerfully, soulfully and unconditionally to our higher Self in order to become one with our Highest. The tiny drop knows that its reality is the ocean. When it consciously merges with the ocean, it loses its individual identity and becomes the ocean itself.</p>
<p>We want to achieve quite a few things in life. In order to accomplish our outer goals, we try to influence others by every possible means. Sometimes we adopt foul means or try to deceive others; others also try to deceive us. But if our goal is God-realisation, we cannot hope to deceive God or influence God through foul means. In fact, this is not at all necessary. God’s dearest wish is for us to realise Him.</p>
<p>God says to us, “My children, I have countless ways for you to realise Me. If one particular way does not suit your nature, then there are many, many other ways. I shall present Myself before you in countless ways in order that you may realise Me. At every moment I shall knock at your heart’s door and, if you sincerely want to receive Me, you will open the door.” </p>

<p>Peace is love universal. Peace is power transcendental.</p>
<p>Destruction is peace: this is the realisation of the animal in man. Supremacy is peace: this is the realisation of the human in man. Oneness is peace: this is the realisation of the divine in man.</p>
<p>Ignorance-night bravely tells me that it can destroy the whole world in a twinkling. Wisdom-light secretly tells me that it is praying soulfully, devotedly and unconditionally to bring down the Kingdom of Heaven here on earth at God’s choice Hour.</p>
<p>A God-seeker sees peace everywhere. A God-server feels peace within. A God-lover owns peace within and without.</p>
<p>A man of peace is the oneness-beauty in God’s Vision-Eye. A man of peace is the fulness-divinity in God’s Satisfaction-Heart. A man of peace is the dreamer, lover and partner of God’s Existence, Consciousness and Delight.</p>
<p>Peace will be tomorrow’s blossoming smile to replace today’s streaming tears. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">I can have peace</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="I can have peace" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I must simplify my complicated life so that I can have soulful peace. I must purify my doubting mind so that I can have powerful peace. I must intensify my aspiring heart so that I can have fruitful peace.</p>
<p>In the small hours of the morning, I meditate on peace. During the day, I try to transform my peace-dream-light into my peace-reality-delight.</p>
<p>I can have immediate peace the moment I sincerely feel that I am not indispensable either in the inner world of aspiration or in the outer world of dedication. I can have immediate peace when I can put an end to my self-aggrandisement. I can have immediate peace when I can devotedly feel that each human being, either consciously or unconsciously, is heading towards perfection and that, at God’s choice Hour, each human being will reach the acme of perfection.</p>
<p>I can have divine peace only when I can feel in the inmost recesses of my heart that I am of God’s Compassion-Heart and that I am consciously, constantly, devotedly and unconditionally for God’s Satisfaction-Life. I can have supreme peace when I can feel unmistakably that my existence-light is only for God’s Satisfaction-Life.</p>
<p>May the seeker in each human heart pray to the hidden Lord Transcendental to appear, so that when He appears, He will appear with His revealed universal Peace. </p>

<p>I am offering tonight’s peace-music-song-experience to Princeton’s illustrious son, President Woodrow Wilson, the founder of the League of Nations, whose heart was the pioneer-dream and whose life was the pioneer-dreamer of the oneness-home of world peace.</p>
<p>Each peace-seeker has a special way of receiving peace from his Inner Pilot. His Inner Pilot is at once his heart’s Saviour and his life’s Liberator. His heart’s Saviour saves him from blighting sins. His life’s Liberator liberates him from teeming imperfections.</p>
<p>Being a peace-seeker, I, too, have my own way of receiving peace. I receive peace only when I am exchanging something with my Beloved Supreme. I offer Him my doubting mind. In exchange, He grants me His compassionate Eye. I offer Him my fearful heart. In exchange, He grants me His powerful Feet. In our mutual exchange of gifts, I receive peace from my Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>In my day-to-day life, when I receive something from others, I get peace. When I give others something of my own, I also get peace. Again, when I go beyond receiving and giving, and just become a oneness-heart, I receive peace.</p>
<p>After receiving something from someone, the peace that I get is beautiful. After offering something to someone, the peace that I get is soulful. And when I go beyond receiving and giving and just become a oneness-heart in my oneness-family, the peace that I get is fruitful, supremely fruitful.</p>
<p>When we use power to bring about peace, we bring to the fore the animal life of our past incarnations. When we use love to bring about peace, we bring to the fore the life divine of our future incarnations.</p>
<p>You are mistaken if you think that by perfecting the world you will get peace. You are equally mistaken if you think that by letting the world perfect you, you will get peace. No, you cannot perfect the world, and the world cannot perfect you. Perfection comes from within, and the message of peace also comes from within — from within the peace-seeker’s heart. If the seeker wants to get perfection, if he wants to get peace, then he has to be consciously aware of his inner divinity and his own reality. It is by virtue of his prayer-life and his meditation-life that he can be conscious of what he eternally is. What he is, is the embodiment of God’s Vision-Dream. Who he is, is the embodiment and continuation of God’s Manifestation on earth. What he is, is the embodiment of God’s Satisfaction in God’s ever-transcending Creation. Only by becoming fully conscious of this can the true peace-seeker have peace—Eternity’s Peace, Infinity’s Peace and Immortality’s Peace. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The message of peace</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The message of peace" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Peace is my mind’s newness. Peace is my heart’s soulfulness. Peace is my life’s fulness.</p>
<p>My newness-mind will not have an iota of doubt. It will have implicit faith — faith in itself and faith in God. My soulfulness-heart will have no insecurity. It will have only confidence-light. My fulness-life will have no sense of separativity. It will have only unity and oneness—a oneness-home.</p>
<p>Peace is not an attainment. Peace is an enlightenment. Peace will not come from possession of this world. Peace will come from perfection of this world through perfection of oneself.</p>
<p>Peace is the beauty of the outer discipline. Peace is the purity of the inner obedience. The outer discipline perfects the human in us. The inner obedience fulfils the divine in us.</p>
<p>Life is a self-transcendence-flight. Peace is a God-discovery-crown. Life is Eternity’s hunger-cry. Peace is Infinity’s satisfaction-smile.</p>
<p>In the ordinary world, ignorance-night reigns supreme and the ignorant mind cherishes war. War wants to show the world what it can do: in the twinkling of an eye it can destroy everything.</p>
<p>In soundless silence, peace tells the world who its owner is. Its only real Owner is God the transcendental Delight and God the universal Light. A true seeker of peace, a genuine lover and server of Truth, who is a true God-lover in the inmost recesses of his heart, receives this soundless, undeniable message of peace.</p>
<p>The message of peace is that God the Creator and God the Creation, God the Possessor and God the possession, are inseparably one. This is why no mind-power can ever destroy the world, and this is why heart-power will one day unify the length and breadth of the world and establish a oneness-home in the seeker’s heart-garden—his heart-garden of peace. </p>

<p>Peace is today’s universal heart-hunger-cry. Peace will be tomorrow’s immortal life-satisfaction-smile.</p>
<p>We do not have an iota of peace precisely because our human mind wants to dominate the world. We do not have an iota of peace precisely because our divine heart has not yet established its inseparable oneness with the world. As long as we sing the song of supremacy, as long as we want to prove to the world that we are superior to others, then there can be no peace.</p>
<p>Who can have peace? Not a sovereign dictator, not a world-conqueror, but a self-giver and a world-lover.</p>
<p>Where is peace? Not in the world of competition, but in the world of self-perfection. Where else is peace? Not in our ruthless rejection of the outer life, but in our soulful acceptance of the outer life.</p>
<p>Our outer life needs greatness. Our inner life needs goodness. In our outer life we must be great—not individually, but collectively and universally. Then our inner goodness has to come to the fore and transform our greatness into goodness. If goodness and greatness remain apart, then there can be no peace. Greatness has to become inseparably one with goodness if we are to have peace. The mind’s loftiest achievements can never grant us peace. Only when our mind’s greatness becomes inseparably one with our heart’s all-giving goodness can we have abiding peace.</p>
<p>When the mind receives, it is peaceful and happy. When the heart offers, it is peaceful and happy. But there comes a time when we feel that there is something more than giving and taking, and this is becoming. When a Truth-seeker and God-lover not only receives peace from without and offers peace from within, but also wants to become peace itself, then he sees and feels that the Boatman, God the Creator, and the Boat, God the Creation, are immediately happy—and God’s Happiness is his own happiness.</p>
<p>A Truth-seeker and God-lover can never have peace unless and until he pleases his Inner Pilot—who is at once God the Creator and God the Creation—in His own Way. And by pleasing God in God’s own Way, the seeker becomes peace itself.</p>

<p>O peace-givers,<br /> First become peace-makers.</p>
<p>O peace-makers,<br /> First become peace-discoverers.</p>
<p>O peace-discoverers,<br /> First become peace-lovers.</p>
<p>O peace-lovers,<br /> First become divine peace-dreamers.</p>

<p>I cannot think of God the Creation without thinking of God the Creator. I cannot imagine God’s Compassion-Eye without imagining His Forgiveness-Heart. Likewise, I cannot feel God’s transcendental Blessings without feeling His universal Peace.</p>
<p>What is Peace? Peace is the satisfaction-fruit. Where is the satisfaction-fruit? It is in the perfection-flower. Where is the perfection-flower? It is in the aspiration-seed. The aspiration-seed offers us the message of self-transcendence; thus self-transcendence is peace within and peace without.</p>
<p>In order to have peace, the human mind has to be aware of truth and has to accept truth as such. The mind’s awareness of truth and the mind’s acceptance of truth is peace. Again, the heart’s embodiment of truth and the heart’s revelation of truth is peace. Finally, the life’s fulfilment of truth and the life’s manifestation of truth is peace.</p>
<p>The earth-bound human hunger has to be transformed into the Heaven-free divine hunger in order to have peace. World-possession is our outer hunger. World-illumination is our inner hunger. To please ourselves in our own way is our human hunger. To please God in God’s own Way is our divine hunger. No matter how many times our desires are fulfilled, we can never have abiding peace. But if we please our Inner Pilot even for a fleeting second on the strength of our heart’s aspiration-cry, at that time we get abiding peace.</p>
<p>Peace and truth are inseparable. While we pray and meditate, we must see truth in the heart of peace and peace in the heart of truth. Man belongs to God’s unconditional Compassion. God belongs to man’s sleepless aspiration. This is at once Truth supreme and Peace supreme.</p>
<p>A seeker of Truth and lover of Peace will eventually please God in His own Way. God will eventually make the Truth-seeker and God-lover another God—the God of tomorrow. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A seeker’s peace</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="A seeker’s peace" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A seeker gets peace from his concentration, meditation and contemplation. His concentration-peace is powerful. It is like lightning. His meditation-peace is soulful. It is like the morning or the evening sky. His contemplation-peace is fruitful. It is like the oneness of the leaves, flowers and fruits with their source, the tree. It is like the inseparable oneness of the divine lover and the Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>A seeker knows that peace and truth are inseparable. An ordinary human being finds it difficult to get peace from truth, for many times in his day-to-day life he feels that it will be more difficult if he tries to abide by truth. Therefore, rather than accept truth as his teacher and friend, he tries to take truth as his student and slave. But a seeker accepts truth as his teacher and his friend. Unlike an ordinary human being, a seeker also knows that truth frightens only the undivine, unaspiring reality in him. The aspiring reality is always illumined by truth. Therefore, a Truth-seeker and a God-lover always welcomes truth and, in his acceptance of truth, he derives peace within and without.</p>
<p>The seeker also has discovered the simple but supreme secret that without God’s Compassion-Light, he is nothing, but with God’s unconditional Love, he not only has everything but he also is everything. When he realises this, his heart is all peace.</p>
<p>The seeker gets peace when his aspiration-heart feels that it gets everything that it needs from God, and when his dedication-life feels that it needs nothing from the world in return. For the unaspiring human being, this truth is concealed. That is why peace is nowhere to be found in his life. But for the seeker, it is not concealed; it is fully revealed.</p>
<p>Peace is nothing other than satisfaction. Every human being is longing for peace, which is satisfaction. And every human being will definitely have peace in the near or distant future. At God’s choice Hour, each individual human being will become a seeker and begin to follow the inner life. This is the life that keeps its heart-door wide open to the supreme Truth, which is being manifested here on earth in the form of divine Peace. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Where is peace?</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Where is peace?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Where is peace? Peace is not in the old and dead world of the mind—the world that abounds in doubt, insecurity, jealousy and meanness. Peace is in the ever-new world of the heart, which is flooded with love, joy and oneness.</p>
<p>Peace is a unique power. This power is a stranger to money-power, possession-power and supremacy-power. Peace-power has established its inseparable oneness only with heart-power.</p>
<p>Peace-power and the heart’s oneness-power will forever and forever remain inseparable, supremely enjoying their unparalleled divine friendship.</p>
<p>A purity-mind has peace. A oneness-heart is peace. A satisfaction-life distributes peace here, there and all-where.</p>
<p>I can have peace only when I feel that my heart has everything and that my life needs nothing. Let us all dive deep into our heart-sea. Then we are bound to see and hear our Inner Pilot singing His own Victory-Song in and through us— His divinely chosen children and supreme hero-warriors.</p>
<p>At every moment I must be practical and wise. I shall not desire to own the world or disown the world. I shall only desire to love the world-heart and to serve the world-body. I must accept the world as it is, and try to improve the world with my inner and outer capacities without any expectation-hopes. This is the only way I can have peace of mind as a constant, sleepless companion in my world of aspiration and in my world of dedication.</p>
<p>On a practical level, if I want peace and need peace, then I must also pray soulfully and meditate silently. I must recite the name of my Beloved Supreme day and night. At every moment in my dedication-life I must remember His unconditional Compassion-Power while loving and serving His world-family, my brothers and sisters in humanity.</p>
<p>Peace brilliantly shines on a Truth-seeker’s and God-lover’s silence-life-path. I must, as a seeker, walk along the path of silence. My Lord Supreme every day will both follow me and lead me. His Forgiveness-Heart will follow me and His Compassion-Eye will lead me along Eternity’s Road. Thus, my Lord Supreme and my own aspiration-heart, with its eternal God-hunger, will be two pilgrims walking together forever along Eternity’s Road towards ever-fulfilling peace and ever-increasing satisfaction. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">God’s most treasured gift</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="God’s most treasured gift" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>It is said that there is nothing new under the sun. The same sunrise and the same sunset human souls have been observing from time immemorial. This is the message that human beings receive from their outer eyes. But from our inner vision, we see the reality a little bit differently. Each sunrise and sunset, according to our inner vision, is not the same; there is a noticeable difference.</p>
<p>As history repeats itself, even so, everything in our outer life to a great extent also repeats itself. But in the process of human evolution, Eternity itself is changing. Eternity is always in the process of transcending its own existence-reality. It is flowing along the river of the Beyond, the river that is carrying the message of the Eternal Beyond. This life-river is well-known by the seekers of the infinite Truth, for they have been asked by the Absolute Himself to discover the new in the Eternal.</p>
<p>Peace is something new. Right from the dawn of civilisation, humanity has been offering many things to the world at large, but it has not been able to offer peace. The seekers of the Absolute Truth are trying to discover peace within themselves, and then reveal it and offer it to mankind.</p>
<p>This peace is not to be found in the mind. The mind’s doubt cannot offer us peace. It is the heart’s faith that can offer us peace. The mind of separativity, which separates one reality from another, cannot give us the message of peace. It is the heart of unity, which unites everything, that can give us peace.</p>
<p>The mind that tells us, “God is elsewhere; Truth is elsewhere,” cannot grant us peace. The heart that knows and, at the same time, makes us feel that God is here and also everywhere else is the only thing that can give us peace. Peace is an inner reality that can be found only inside the aspiring heart.</p>
<p>This inner reality the heart does not want to keep for itself. It wants to share it with the other members of its family: the mind, the vital and the physical existence-reality. Therefore, whoever has the sincere need for peace of mind first has to dive deep within and discover the peace which is in the inmost recesses of his heart. Then he has to gather this peace and offer it to his doubting and unreceptive mind.</p>
<p>God-lovers and Truth-seekers have discovered this supreme secret. They know that they have to dive deep within to feel God’s most treasured Gift to mankind. The Inner Pilot offers this Gift to His choice children who establish their loving oneness with Him. Then soulfully, devotedly and unconditionally, they have to bring this Peace-Gift into the mind, vital and body so that peace becomes an integral part of their human existence.</p>
<p>Since we are all God-lovers and Truth-seekers, let us try to discover peace in the depths of our oneness-heart—not in our mind of separativity, doubt and confusion. This inner peace has the capacity to transform the doubting and unreceptive mind of humanity. Once we discover inner peace in the depths of our satisfaction-heart and bring it to the fore, our unlit mind will also become fully illumined. Let us pray and meditate that the hour of our peace-discovery will soon dawn. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The way to abiding peace</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The way to abiding peace" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A man of desire has no peace. Even when a powerful desire of his is fulfilled, he still has no peace, since teeming new desires are constantly attacking his earthly existence.</p>
<p>A man of aspiration longs for peace at every moment. If he listens to the dictates of his Inner Pilot and surrenders his actions and the fruits thereof to the Will of God, then a man of aspiration will definitely receive peace.</p>
<p>Expectation reigns supreme in both the life of a desire-man and the life of an aspiration-man. As long as an individual remains in the world of desire, his expectations will never meet with satisfaction. That is because desire lives in the finite. Although an individual may have countless desires, the desire-life itself is in the finite, of the finite and for the finite. Anything that is finite cannot bring peace. But for the man of aspiration, because he is longing for something vast, something infinite, something immortal, there shall come a time when his expectations will be fulfilled. When he gets what he is longing for, he will find that he has peace as well, for anything that is vast, anything that is infinite, eventually will give us peace. The man who has peace has everything.</p>
<p>A desire-man does not care so much for God the Creator, but he wants to possess God the Creation. An aspiration-man wants to be loved by the loving heart of humanity. A man of surrender wants to love God in humanity, for he sees God the Creator and God the Creation as one. Even inside the desire-man, the man of surrender sees the Presence of God. He knows that God’s Creation cannot exist without the Creator, and that God the Creator is trying to illumine His Creation. Therefore, a man of surrender tries to see God even in the dark cave of human bondage. He knows that there shall come a time when even the worst possible human being will long for freedom, and it is God’s supreme Vision that everyone who is longing for freedom will one day be liberated.</p>
<p>Here on earth everybody desires freedom. But there is a great difference between the inner freedom and the outer freedom. With our outer freedom we try to exercise our supremacy and lord it over others; we try to conquer the length and breadth of the world. With our inner freedom we try to become inseparably one with God’s Will. Quite often we use outer freedom to destroy the world around us according to our sweet will. But inner freedom, which is our oneness-will with God’s living Reality, is always used to fulfil a divine purpose and manifest the divine Truth here on earth. It is inner freedom that brings peace.</p>
<p>There is nobody who does not need happiness. But there can be no true happiness without peace of mind. Although we may not have peace right now, we can discover peace by exercising our imagination-power, the way a child exercises his imagination-power. A child imagines everything in God’s Creation in his own way. He imagines his existence in the heart of the infinite Vast. He imagines the entire universe as his own. If we start with a child’s imagination, before long this imagination will blossom into aspiration.</p>
<p>First we imagine peace, and then we begin to aspire for peace. When we become spiritually advanced, we adopt the way of surrender. We offer our aspiration unconditionally for the fulfilment of God’s Will, not to receive peace or any other blessing. At that time we surrender our desire-life, our aspiration-life, our dedication-life — our whole existence — to God’s Will. When our only happiness lies in our fulfilment of God, our Beloved Supreme, and in our Lord’s Fulfilment in and through us, then only can we have abiding peace.</p>
<p>In this world God the Creator expresses and reveals Himself through the seeker, who is none other than God the Lover. Each man, in essence, is God, but here in the world arena God the seeker longs for God the Liberator. And God the Liberator becomes God the Fulfiller while revealing and manifesting Himself through God the seeker. In seeking, in revealing and in manifesting, man achieves what he needs, which is God the Peace. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Willingness</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Willingness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My sleepless willingness is my heart’s soulful conversation with God’s Compassion-Eye. My heart’s unwillingness is the very beginning of my mind’s frustration-destruction-dance. My heart’s hallowed willingness-strength can easily cover my mind’s farthest unwillingness-length.</p>
<p>My despotic unwillingness is a self-styled server always unemployed. My inner life and my outer life simply do not need it or even want it. Nevertheless, alas, at times my unwillingness-mind-baggage is shockingly heavy and far overweight. To please my Lord at every moment in His own Way, what I need is a soulful willingness empty of expectation and full of sterling faith. Therefore, every morning I pray to my Lord Supreme to bless my aspiration-heart with willingness-gratitude-tears and to bless my dedication-life with willingness-plenitude-smiles.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, the world desperately needs peace-contributions in infinite measure. Do grant me soulful willingness so that I, along with all the other self-giving hearts of the world, can offer my own heart’s peace-contribution spontaneously and generously to fulfil humanity’s age-old cry for world peace, world harmony and a oneness-world-home.</p>
<p>To my extreme joy, my Beloved Supreme has listened to my heartfelt prayer. The indomitable eagerness of my God-nourished and God-cherished heart’s willingness has once and for all smashed the pride of my mind’s self-doubting and God-doubting unwillingness. Now my unreserved and unconditional willingness to love God the Creator and serve God the Creation unconditionally has placed me on the highest rung of my consciousness-ladder, and God is offering me His own transcendental Crown and universal Throne. </p>
