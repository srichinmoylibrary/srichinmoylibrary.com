<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The easiest and most effective way to conquer depression and all negative forces is to smile inwardly and outwardly with a sincere smile. Smile inwardly and outwardly at your enemy and say, “Oh, you have come. I am ready to conquer you.” If this smile is sincere and soulful, you cannot lose. The greatest strength you have is your inner joy, and this inner joy comes only from faith — faith that whatever is best for you will come from the Supreme. Now, what is best for you can be absolutely the worst thing for somebody else, and what is best for that person can be the worst thing for you. What you really need — not what you want but what you need — the Supreme is bound to give you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one does not have a Master, what should he do? He has to go deep within and try to see the Inner Pilot. He may not actually see the Inner Pilot, for this is something very rare. But the Inner Pilot is more than ready to act and speak through his conscience. If one listens to the dictates of his conscience, then automatically his aspiration is bound to increase.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this case we have to know how far we have already walked along the path of spirituality — that is to say, our own development. One becomes an expert gradually. When one wants to be a dancer, he cannot learn all the steps overnight. But the day comes when the dancer can do many things at a time while dancing. For an ordinary person this would be simply impossible. When someone is just learning to drive, he is lost. But when he becomes an expert driver, everything is under perfect control. Similarly, when a seeker becomes advanced and can meditate well every day, naturally he is growing in inner purity and inner strength. Then, when he enters into the hustle and bustle of daily life, inside himself he feels the living presence of his own inner being which helped him meditate well early in the morning. Even while he is answering all the professor’s questions or talking to his boss, inside he will feel the presence of a divine child who is surcharged with light, peace and bliss.</p>
<p>But this cannot happen overnight. In the spiritual life if one practises daily, regularly and soulfully, one is bound to develop this inner capacity. Then one will feel this inner presence guiding him and even if he is speaking about earthly, mundane things, he will not lose it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it necessary to discard the mind in the spiritual life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it necessary to discard the mind in the spiritual life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to grab the mind and offer it to the heart. Then the mind will be illumined; it will be obedient. Now the mind is ruling you, but when the mind has been brought under control and offered to the heart, you will rule the mind. When the mind is illumined, it will be able to work most powerfully, in a most fulfilling manner. You are not discarding the mind; you are only trying to take the mind to a proper place, and that is the heart, the heart’s illumination. When the illumination of the heart enters into the mind, the mind becomes a most powerful instrument. The vital also can be used most dynamically when illumined by the light from the heart.</p>
<p>God is constantly transcending, going beyond Himself. He is the Consciousness of the infinite Beyond, which is all the time transcending its own Infinity. With our mind we can never understand this. That is why we do not use the mind to enter into the deepest level of Consciousness. We try with our intuition-light, our intuitive light, or with our aspiration’s light to realise the Highest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is hard for an ordinary seeker to know. This is why a spiritual Master is very important. You may be doing absolutely the right thing, but feel that you are doing the wrong thing because you don’t have the assurance from one who knows the real truth. However, there is one way you can tell. When your meditation is correct, you will feel a kind of joy all over your body. When you get a kind of spontaneous inner joy, then the meditation you have adopted is correct. But if you do not feel that joy, if, on the contrary, you feel a mental tension or disturbance, then you will know that that particular kind of meditation is not meant for you.</p>

I would like to find out the technique of these eye movements.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: You said once that when your eyes move back and forth during meditation you are entering into different worlds. I would like to find out the technique of these eye movements." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not a technique, actually. First one has to realise the Truth; then automatically one can enter into these worlds. I can enter into these seven planes of consciousness on the strength of my inner realisation.</p>
<p>It is like this. When one is very rich, one can have seven houses at his disposal. But when one is very poor, he can have only one house. In the spiritual life also, when one is just beginning, one can have a free access to only one plane of consciousness. Then, as he becomes more advanced, it is always advisable to go to the higher worlds one by one. But when he becomes an expert in the inner life, he can be like a bird flying from one branch to another branch. As there are seven higher worlds, there are also seven lower worlds. These lower worlds one should not go into unless and until one has realised the Highest. We enter into the lower worlds for the purification of our own nature and the earth-consciousness.</p>
<p>But first things first. First we have to realise the Highest with our own sincere aspiration and dedication. Then God will give us the capacity to enter into these higher planes of consciousness. Once we have achieved Peace, Light and Bliss in abundant measure, we can easily enter into these planes. Either we enter into these worlds or they come to us and enter into us. When we enter into these worlds, we bring down their Light, Peace and Bliss according to our capacity, receptivity and necessity. But when they enter into us, they give us only what they would like to give us. Each world has Peace, Light and Bliss and each one also has some special divine quality of its own. When these worlds come into us, they give us their speciality in their own way. When we enter into them, we select. It is like when we enter into a store and select the food that we like best.</p>
<p>So there is no technique; there is only aspiration. But again, we don’t pray to God to enter into these worlds. We should only think of our conscious self-dedication to the Will of God. What we should do during our prayer and meditation is make a conscious attempt to enter into His Will. If He wants us to enter into these worlds, let Him carry us. We should pray and meditate only to realise Him. Once we can please Him, He will give us all that He has and all that He is.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is true that each and every individual on earth will realise God someday, but that will take hundreds and thousands of incarnations. However, if one consciously aspires, one can expedite one’s journey. There is nobody on earth who will remain unrealised because we are all God’s children and God Himself will never allow us to remain unfulfilled. If we are not realised, we cannot fulfil God. If we do not fulfil God, we cannot fulfil ourselves. So God, out of His infinite Bounty, will come down. But that may take hundreds and thousands of years. If somebody consciously, soulfully and devotedly meditates every day, then naturally he will reach God sooner than those who are still slumbering. Whenever we do something consciously, we get the result sooner. We all have our oneness with God; nobody can deny it. But spiritual people who are meditating and concentrating are crying to have a conscious oneness with God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have aspiration, realisation is bound to take place eventually. If you have no aspiration, then you can go to a Guru, you can do anything, but realisation will not come to you. Aspiration is the money-power of the higher realms. If you have money, you can go to the supermarket and buy whatever you want. If you do not have money, you can wait there for hours and still you will not get even a biscuit to take home. If your aspiration is really intense, if you are a multimillionaire in the spiritual world, then you can stay right where you are and order everything brought to you. If you have aspiration, God is bound to come wherever you meditate. But if you have no aspiration, you can enter into every church, synagogue, temple and mosque in the world, but still you will, not see the Face of God or feel His Presence.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Aspiration is in each part of the person. The central aspiration comes from the soul, but the body, the mind, the vital and the heart also have aspiration. When the aspiration of all the members of the being go together, then only do you run the fastest. Otherwise, when the heart wants to pray in the morning, the body wants to remain fast asleep. And when the body is ready to meditate, the heart may not be aspiring. Instead, the heart is cherishing jealousy, the vital is cherishing insecurity, the mind is thinking of school or the office. Then what are you going to do? But when the heart says, “I am pure,” when the body says, “I am ready, alert,” when the mind closes its door to doubt, at that time you will be able to run the fastest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No matter where the Supreme is, His Compassion-magnet is pulling us, but we are afraid of being caught by this Compassion. We are very clever. When His Compassion touches us, the mind says, “It is all feminine and passive; it has no power. It is not His Compassion, it is His weakness. He needs us badly.” That is what the physical mind says. Then the tricky vital will say, “Oh no, no, no. There is some motive behind it. I am beautiful, or I have a lot of money, or I am a great artist, so He wants me for something.” This is what the tricky vital will say. And the impure heart will say, “He will take away all my good qualities and give them to undeserving people.” Only the pure heart, which has the capacity to identify itself with the Vast, will say, “No, He has given me the opportunity, the golden opportunity, to fulfil myself and to fulfil Him.” That is what the pure heart says, but how many people have that kind of pure heart? Very few people have that kind of pure heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes it happens that you are under the impression that someone is making real inner progress, but it may not be so at all. Some people try to show off about their inner progress or they deceive themselves. Sometimes you see someone who is all the time praying and meditating. You get the impression that he is making wonderful progress. But God alone knows what he is doing, whether he is thinking of God or just deceiving himself.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes there is a time lapse, sometimes there is not. You may have an inner experience today, and by tomorrow your life may be changed. It depends on the strength of the inner experience, or on the amount of aspiration you have.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it possible for someone who has no teacher or method of inner discipline to be thinking about something and enter into meditation without even realising it?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it possible for someone who has no teacher or method of inner discipline to be thinking about something and enter into meditation without even realising it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are various ways of achieving realisation. If the aspirant is an extraordinary soul with intense aspiration, and if he does not have a Master or any possibility of getting one, at that time God Himself comes forward and gives him the necessary inner instruction. But thinking will not lead to meditation. Thinking and meditation are altogether two different things. In meditation there should be no thinking. The first thing in meditation is to keep the mind calm and quiet. No thought should enter into the mind at all.</p>
