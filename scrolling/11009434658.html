<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Suppose you see that your father is spending lots of time chatting with others here and there, and he is not paying any attention to you. If you get angry, that is attachment. But if you love your father, no matter how many hours or how many days he is spending with his friends, you will not get angry. That is love. Where there is attachment, you feel that everything has to be done in your way. But where there is love, you feel that the other person can do things in his own way, if what he is doing is right. Love does not get hurt. Love says, "He is doing the right thing."</p>

Your prayer will be, "O God, give me the capacity so that I can get up tomorrow at five-thirty." Pray to God for all the things that you are supposed to do the following day. Then, if you can fulfil them, discipline will enter your life. But your prayer has to be offered the previous evening, before you go to bed.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To sing soulfully is the right thing. To sing powerfully is necessary only on rare occasions, but soulfully you have to sing, always soulfully. When you want to sing soulfully, you have to think that you are not the body, you are not the vital, you are not the mind, you are not the heart, even; you are the soul. If you think of the soul, if you feel that you are the soul and nothing else, then you will be able to sing soulfully.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As many times as possible say, "Guru, I love you <em>only</em>. I need you <em>only</em>." The word '<em>only</em>' has the power. Otherwise, just to say "I love you" or "I need you" is not enough. By using the word '<em>only</em>', you become one-pointed. '<em>Only</em>' is just one word, but it has all the power, everything that you need. When you say, "I love you <em>only</em>, I need you <em>only, only, only</em>" — that '<em>only</em>' becomes so powerful! Then you can feel close, closer, closest to my heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Daily, at least five times for three or four minutes, each time you breathe in, consciously try to have intensity. Try to feel you are breathing in intensity, intensity, intensity when you pray to the Supreme. Breathe in and breathe out as slowly as possible, and then feel that that intensity is coming into you. It has entered into your heart and into all your nerves and muscles.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Look at a bird; look at the vast, blue sky; look at a green field or look at the beautiful moon. You can have more inspiration by looking at these things. You can look at the rising sun or anything else that gives you immediate joy. Always find something that inspires you. With your eyes you will look at it, and then you can increase your inspiration. Anything that is beautiful, look at that very thing for inspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are stressed and exhausted, it is usually because you have worked very hard. Lie down for four or five minutes and breathe in as slowly as possible. While breathing, you have to feel that peace has descended and entered into your mind. From head to foot it is circulating. Feel that all your nerves are getting nourishment. Breathe as slowly and as quietly as possible, so that even if you put a thread right in front of your nose, the thread would not move to and fro. If the thread moves to this side and that side, it means you are not breathing slowly and quietly. You can use the thread to examine your breathing. If it does not move, that means your breathing is correct. Then, after three or four minutes, you can bring in peace from Above. It will percolate inside your entire body. But correct breathing is absolutely necessary.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we be fully forgiven?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we be fully forgiven?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us say you have done something wrong, so you pray to God to forgive you. Then, after two months or even two days, you may be tempted to do the same thing again. But, even if you are tempted, if you do not repeat the wrong thing that you have done, then you know that you are forgiven. If you can assure God that you will not do it again, then His Forgiveness comes. Otherwise, your misdeed and God's Forgiveness do not automatically go together. God examines you. If He sees that you have not done the same thing a second time, then He forgives you. Otherwise, if God forgives you at once, you will be inclined to do the same thing again after three months.</p>
<p>Let us say you have told a lie. The first time, God gives you a chance. Then you tell another lie. God does not trust you at that time. When you make a promise that you will not do the thing anymore, and you keep your promise, then you are forgiven. But if you continue to break your promise, then you are not forgiven. At that time it becomes worse. God becomes His Justice-Light.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only think of all the good qualities that your country has. All the good qualities that you can think of that your country has, you will try to keep right in front of your eyes. Then, just feed these qualities with your goodwill, with your love, with your concern. Think of a very young or beautiful child. You are feeding that child. Take the whole country as an individual, one individual, and feel that you are feeding that individual with your concern. That is the best way to serve: to think of the country not as countless millions of people, but as only one person, one person. For you, that one person will embody the whole of Russia. In that way, you will be able to do the best for your country.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Try to count how many times your Master has smiled at you and how many good things you have done for your Master unconditionally. If you think of the good things that you have done in the inner world and in the outer world, unconditionally, then you can increase your inner oneness with your Master. By remembering the good things that the Master has done for you and you have done for the Master, you can increase your inner oneness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditate for five or ten minutes most sincerely, most sincerely. Do not bring forward your desire. Do not ask, "How will I know God's Will, how will I know?" Forget about your question; do not think of it. Only for ten minutes meditate as deeply as possible, without allowing any thought, good or bad. You will have no good thought, no bad thought for ten minutes. Then something from within will tell you what God's Will is. For ten minutes remain silent. Absolutely do not allow any thought to enter. Then your inner voice will tell you, "This is the right thing, that is the wrong thing."</p>
