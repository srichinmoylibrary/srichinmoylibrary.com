<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Purity or impurity is not a direct result of the consciousness from which you are operating. On the contrary, it is purity or impurity that enters into the consciousness. When purity enters, consciousness is elevated; when impurity enters, consciousness descends. Consciousness sees impurity as a culprit and purity as a friend. Consciousness is affected by the presence of purity or impurity, but consciousness does not affect purity or impurity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> With our destructive consciousness we try to destroy others and destroy ourselves. Unfortunately, in the animal we see the destructive quality looming large. But it is better to have this animal consciousness, to fight and struggle, than to remain in the stone consciousness where there is no movement, no progress.</p>
<p>Now the animal has played its role, and we have come to the human consciousness. We know that movement is necessary; but it has to be dynamic movement, not aggressive movement. In the human consciousness we try to go a little farther with our dynamic movement, but unfortunately, the animal consciousness still lies dormant in us. We try to purify the destructive animal quality through our human dynamism. Then, from the human dynamic movement, we try to go to the Divine. When the human enters into the Divine, we get perfect Perfection and the animal consciousness leaves us totally.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The extension of consciousness means the extension of the dream-reality of the parents. Parents are constantly dreaming in and through their child, so the soul of the child is consciously assimilating the dream-reality of the parents.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here we have to be very, very careful. Most of the time it is not at all necessary for us to enter into the consciousness of another person or object in order to more fully understand him or it. Why? Very often when we try to understand someone we unconsciously or consciously bring upon ourselves the unlit and ignorant parts of that human being. There is no assurance, no guarantee, that by understanding someone we are throwing more light on him or that our own conscious being is receiving more light.</p>
<p>But if it is the Will of God, then we should try to invoke more light into our own system and try to see more divinity in the person whom we are trying to understand. The more we can consciously see light in another person, the sooner we are bound to understand him. But first it is most important to know whether or not it is the Will of God for us to understand someone more fully. Very often when we try to understand someone, we only fathom, we only explore unlit and undivine qualities in him. Today we observe these qualities and tomorrow, in spite of our best intentions, they enter into us and create unnecessary problems for us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: We know that your name, ‘Chinmoy’, means ‘full of divine consciousness’. What does it mean to be ‘full of divine consciousness&#039;?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: We know that your name, ‘Chinmoy’, means ‘full of divine consciousness’. What does it mean to be ‘full of divine consciousness&#039;?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> ‘Full of divine consciousness’ signifies a most powerful, muscular man in the inner world. In the spiritual life everybody has consciousness. When one is aware of having divine consciousness, he is on the verge of realisation. But if one is '<em>full</em> of divine consciousness' and <em>fully</em> aware of it, that means that his oneness with God is inseparable and also permanent.</p>
<p>When one becomes the possessor of divine consciousness in his inner life to the fullest degree, then he not only feels that God’s Promise to mankind is <em>his</em> promise, God’s Dream is <em>his</em> dream, and God’s Reality is <em>his</em> reality, but in his inner life he becomes God-Reality itself. In the beginning when he deals with consciousness, he feels that God is the Master, God is the Creator, God is everything. But when he becomes fully divine or when he is full of divine consciousness, at that time it is not his ego, but his inseparable oneness that makes him feel that God and he are partners. He gets this realisation directly from God; if he tries to deny it out of humility or false modesty, then God becomes really displeased with him.</p>
<p>God is constantly trying to make all seekers feel that He is not their Master but their partner. When we live in the world of desire, God is helpless. At that time we make Him feel that we are the servants and He is the Master, and He has to accept this fact. But when we become fully aware of our oneness with Him, then God begs us to realise the true Truth, the supreme Truth, that He and each individual are partners working for the same cause.</p>
<p>It is very easy to have relatives and to have all kinds of relationships with human beings, but to have a friend, a true friend, is the most difficult thing. God always tells spiritual Masters and spiritual seekers of the highest height that what He needs is friendship. If the seeker can sincerely feel that God is not his Father, Mother, Brother or Sister but his Friend, then God gets the greatest joy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Relative to you, Guru, what percentage of your total consciousness does your average disciple possess?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Relative to you, Guru, what percentage of your total consciousness does your average disciple possess?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At this point I will be misunderstood but let me brag a little. I have two consciousness’, two types. One is human, one is divine. The human consciousness you know very well: I shout, I bark. I do many things undivine according to your understanding. But my divine Consciousness, which has realised the Highest, the Absolute, is a different story.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to know what percentage of my divine Consciousness you have, then I wish to be very frank with you and say that you do not have even one percent. This is because here I am dealing with Infinity. Unfortunately, to be very frank with you, you have not realised God — which you will do tomorrow or some time in the future. So until you have realised the infinite as I have done, there cannot be any question of percentage. We cannot enter into percentage. Again, I am a human being like you, so naturally you can possess a percentage of my consciousness.</p>
<p>Now here also let me be very, very frank with you. I am a human being that aspired, and still aspires, or a divine being that constantly sings the song of self-transcendence. There is no end to my aspiration. There is no end to my transcendence. I always say, “self-transcendence.” The Supreme Himself is transcending Himself. So naturally my divine Consciousness is also transcending. A few years ago I declared my highest transcendental Consciousness and three years later that Consciousness, that picture, fell down at my feet because I went much higher than my previous transcendental Consciousness. So there is and there can be no limit.</p>
<p>I wish to say that if one can realise twenty-five percent of my human consciousness, I will tell you that that person is really something. I had a disciple who is still a disciple in the inner world. In the inner world she is extremely close, closer, closest to my heart and soul. When that individual used to get twenty-five percent of my human consciousness, people used to see in that person my face. Although I am a man and she is a woman, her whole face used to radiate my face. And when she used to meditate people used to see in her my face, absolutely my face. And that experience happened three or four times. You know my face is totally different from hers. I am a man first of all, and God has done a very good job of taking away all my hair. But that person had plenty of hair. In every way our faces were totally different — mine a man’s and hers a woman’s face. But when she used to enter twenty-five percent into my consciousness, my human consciousness, which is aspiring, which is in its own way extremely mature, then my physical plane also entered into her heart; with aspiration, of course.</p>
<p>When she was successful in entering into my human consciousness with her own heart’s most intense aspiration she did that kind of miracle. And it has been experienced, not by me, but by the disciples of that Centre, three times at least. And I used to receive letters saying that I, my physical presence, was physically there.</p>
<p>Why I am bragging, is that it was my physical consciousness, human consciousness. Only on very rare occasions when one has the kind of human consciousness that she had, is one ready to receive twenty-five percent of my human consciousness. Then again, seventy-five more that person has to get of mine, and that seventy-five percent more one has to get not for a fleeting second, but for a few seconds. To be very frank with you, it was only for a fleeting second, five or ten seconds or one minute that she had my consciousness. So if you possess one hundred percent of my human consciousness constantly, then I assure you, you are becoming ready for the divine Consciousness. And then, when you are ready for the divine Consciousness, naturally you will realise God.</p>
<p>I am telling you this. Perhaps I am bragging. But if you are very sincere, then you will see that I am still underestimating. God-realised people are like that. No matter to what extent they brag in their intimate circles, they underestimate themselves. Not deliberately, of course, but because that is what God wants them to do.</p>
<p>Well dear ones, as the Supreme in me forgives you when you do something wrong, even so the Supreme in me will expect you to forgive me if I have said something wrong. Needless to say, He does it out of His unconditional and infinite Bounty.</p>

We are all fools, so we have to know it more convincingly. ‘Yes’ or ‘no’ we can say, but <em>why</em> it is ‘yes’, or <em>why</em> it is ‘no' — that we have to know from you. You have said that nobody can surpass God’s Consciousness; now you justify this.</p>
<p><em>Chandra: No one can surpass God because who created us? God. He is our Creator. So who can surpass the Creator’s Consciousness? He is the Highest.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely true. You get a hundred out of a hundred. One hundred out of a hundred you get. You have told us the supreme philosophy in a few words.</p>
<p>Now, I wish to tell you from my monkey consciousness another supreme philosophy. Vivekananda used to say, as well as all other spiritual Masters, something that you will one day say: “Who is God if not you yourself?” Tomorrow when you realise God, you will see that you are God, your mother is God, your father is God, I am God, everybody is God. Before we realise God we can doubt Him. We can be atheists and say, “There is no God, there is no God.” But when we realise God, we then believe that there is no one or no thing which is not God.</p>
<p>Before realisation we may have the audacity to deny God. Then when we make a little progress we say, “Oh, Guru has realised God, he is divine. And I have not realised God, I am undivine.” Then gradually, gradually when aspiration grows, we will say, “Oh, if he has the capacity to realise God, what is wrong with me? If he can do it, why can’t I do it? If he has done it, then I can do it.” So this is how aspiration grows and how our capacity grows.</p>
<p>Now, a few minutes ago I said that when we realise God we see that everybody is God. You are God, I am God, everybody is God. The philosophy of God is self-transcendence. He cherishes an eternal hunger for self-transcendence.</p>
<p>Who can transcend himself? Vilupti has asked the question, so Vilupti, who embodies God, who <em>is</em> God in terms of the supreme philosophy, naturally will transcend herself. What Chandra said is one hundred percent true; we can’t deny it. But if we examine the question from another angle — what God has and what God is — then we will know that all is sufficient for Him. But at the same time He says that this sufficiency is not pleasing Him. He wants always to transcend Himself.</p>
<p>It is like somebody who has many millions of dollars and somebody who has one dollar. The person with one dollar says, “Oh, if I could only have two dollars.” Although he knows that his capacity is to have only one dollar, he is trying to have one more. And again, the multimillionaire tries to have a little more as well. So God is infinite, but still He wants to grow. With the mind, we can’t fathom Him, but with the heart we feel Him, we become one. He is static, and He is dynamic. God is the highest Height. He does not grow. And at the same time He grows. It is said correctly in our Indian philosophy that God moves and He moves not; that He is far and He is also near. Now, how will the mind be able to recognise two things at the same time? If something is moving, the mind will say, “Yes, it is moving.” But the mind will not be able to say at the same time, “No, it is standing still.”</p>
<p>But in God’s case, He is standing still and moving everywhere. This is His Goal. If you use the third eye you see that He is at once nowhere and everywhere. God means self-transcendence. Constant self-transcendence is God.</p>
<p>Now let us take Chandra. You as God are constantly transcending yourself. This is from the highest spiritual point of view. But what you have said, from one point of view, is also absolutely true. God, our Creator, is Absolute; how can we transcend Him? It is impossible! How can we transcend Him when we are two separate individuals? When God is one and you are somebody else, how can you transcend Him? Because He has created you, you are the creation and He is the Creator. Now how can the creation surpass the Creator? It is only the Creator who will constantly create. If you are an artist, you constantly create. If you are an artist, constantly you will go on creating something. It is you who have the capacity, not the creation, not the piece of paper or pencil with which you create. This is the truth.</p>
<p>But if the creation becomes devotedly and soulfully one with the Creator, if the consciousness of the creation becomes one with the Creator, then it can transcend Him.</p>
<p>Now, your parents are here. You are their creation. Now, in terms of their knowledge and wisdom, you are nowhere. Your father and mother know much more than you. But if you become inseparably one with them, with your boundless love, then whatever they have is yours. You become one with them.</p>
<p>Your father is sincere, so naturally he will see tremendous progress in comparison to what he was ten years ago. That progress is his transcendence, self-transcendence. So you see, God, who is our eternal Father and our eternal Mother, also makes progress, which means He is constantly going high, higher, highest. There is no end to His Progress. Since He is progressing, we too are progressing, because we are one with Him. We are all the time with Him, inside Him; we are part and parcel of His existence. As He is climbing we are climbing automatically. In His case, there is constant satisfaction and this satisfaction is in transcending. In our case, the vision of transcendence comes into being in our self-giving. And today’s self-giving is nothing short of tomorrow’s God-becoming.</p>
