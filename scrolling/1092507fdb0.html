<p>Nationalism is not a highly political or mental aspiration. What is nationalism? In the words of Sri Aurobindo, "Nationalism is not a mere political programme; Nationalism is a religion that comes from God..."</p>
<p>Now let us observe what Jawaharlal Nehru writes about the contribution of Rabindranath to Nationalism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nationalism, especially when it urges us to fight for freedom, is noble and life-giving. But often it becomes a narrow creed, and limits and encompasses its votaries and makes them forget the many-sidedness of life. But Rabindranath Tagore has given to our nationalism the outlook of internationalism and has enriched it with art and music and the magic of his words, so that it has become the full-blooded emblem of India's awakened spirit."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Nature has always had more force than education." — Voltaire <em>Life of Moliere</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nature is a flow of harmony that infallibly unites the within and the without, the what-is and the what-is-to-come. No insincerity or blunder is to be found between Nature's action and Nature's law. Tagore will now show us what God actually does through Nature and the human soul: "It is said that Nature is the field through which God manifests his Power, while through the human soul He manifests his Love. In Nature He asserts Himself through Power, while in the human souls He gives himself away through love."</p>

<p>It is really surprising that a man at times doubts the authenticity of a thing even after being an eye witness. But the moment he runs his eyes over that very event in a newspaper, he finds considerable truth in it. So often it is found that newspapers are not only news-suppliers, but also news producers with the help of an unfathomable sea of imagination. In the words of Napoleon, "Four newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets." Tagore's view on newspapers is also worth remembering, especially for the writers: "No one has achieved Immortality by writing for newspapers."</p>

<p>One day in his childhood Rabindranath wanted to accompany his elders to school. The private tutor gave him a slap and remarked, "Now you are weeping for not being able to go to school, but a time will come when you will weep more bitterly for having to go to school." In later years Rabindranath said that no other prophecy proved to be as accurate as this in his life.</p>

<p>In 1930, almost in the evening of his life, Rabindranath started devoting himself to painting. In this new field of Art some people found much in him, some found practically nothing. Some admired and encouraged him unstintingly, while some simply threw cold water on him. Tagore observes: "People often ask me about the meaning of my pictures. I remain silent even as my pictures are. It is for them to <em>express</em> and not to <em>explain."</em></p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Plays</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Plays" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Tagore's plays have a vast and sublime range of poignant emotion, and in some of them how wonderfully he reveals the teeming storms of life with a new orientation.</p>
<p><em>Prakritir Pratishodh (Nature's Revenge):</em> In this play we find an ascetic of the first water coming back to ordinary human life through his commiseration with poor humanity. The play teaches us that Nature is bound to take revenge on us if we despise her.</p>
<p><em>Chitrangada (Chitra)</em> was the daughter of the king of Manipur. Her physical beauty compelled Arjuna, the third Pandava, to accept her as the partner of his life. But as satisfaction was not to be found in physical beauty, he sought for the Beauty that lies beyond the body.</p>
<p><em>Raja (The King of the Dark Chamber)</em> is, according to some critics, nothing more than an allegory. But Tagore writes: "Critics and detectives are naturally suspicious. They scent allegories and bombs where there are no such abominations. It is difficult to convince them of our innocence. With regard to the criticism of my play "The King of the Dark Chamber"...the human soul has its inner drama, which is just the same as anything else that concerns man. Sudarshana is not more allegory than Lady Macbeth, who might be described as an allegory representing the criminal ambition in man's nature. However, it does not matter what things are according to the rules of the critics. They are what they are and therefore difficult of classification."</p>
<p>The moment Sudarshana realised that in enjoying the outer beauty alone the true fulfilment of life can never be attained, she utterly surrendered herself to the king and in no time she discovered the secret that in the offering of oneself there lies the key of true fulfilment.</p>
<p>An interesting event. One day while Tagore was residing at Maitreyi Devi's place at Mangpu, which is near Kalimpong, a French lady, Mademoiselle Boshenec, came before the Poet and said, "Gurudeva, to-day <em>Post Office</em> will be staged in France." After observing silence for a few minutes, Tagore said that in Russia <em>The King of the Dark Chamber</em> was staged repeatedly. Again after a long silence: "This is called reward, " said he.</p>
<p><em>Dakghar (The Post Office)</em> is another play that brought him much fame. A young life full of expectation was Amal's. All that he wanted was to go 'somewhere' and see 'something'. Poor Amal's expectation of a letter from the king clearly indicates that human life is nothing but an expectation right from the womb to the tomb.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Poetry</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Poetry" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>It is no hyperbole to say that very few poets in the world had or have as free an access to the inner realms of Poetry as Tagore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The poetry of Tagore owes its sudden and universal success to this advantage — that he gives us more of this discovery and fusion for which the mind of our age is in quest than any other creative writer of the time. His work is a constant music of the overpassing of the borders, a chant-filled realm in which the subtle sounds and lights of the truth of the spirit give new meanings to the finer subtleties of life."</p>
<p>— Sri Aurobindo</p>
<p>(From <em>The Golden Book of Tagore</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this connection let me cite Amal Kiran, the beautiful name given by Sri Aurobindo to his poet-disciple who has had the rare good fortune to discuss with his Master matters of high poetry through series of correspondence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the East two names have stood high in our own day, one in Urdu and Persian by a dynamic colourful passion of religious thought, the other in Bengali by a deeply and exquisitely imaged devotionalism, and both by an intonation inspired and measured: Iqbal and Tagore."</p>
<p><em> — Mother India</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are critics who say that Tagore cannot be classed with the poets of the highest magnitude, for he did not try an epic. O wiseacre! his lyrics have sufficient power to lift you up into the realm of poetic delight where his pen reigns supreme over almost all branches of Art.</p>
<p>To many of us it is but an insoluble mystery whether Tagore moulded his life according to the growth of his poetical works or whether it was his gradual poetical flow that brought about successive vicissitudes in his outer life. However, his poetical genius and his life marched side by side in a perfect harmony.</p>
<p>It was his wonderful <em>Nirjharer Swapnabhanga, (The Awakening of the Fountain)</em> that took him for the first time into the realm of Intuition. A new life dawned within him, and he looked at the creation with a new vision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I shall rush from peak to peak, I shall sweep from mount to mount, With peals of laughter and songs of murmur I shall clap to tune and rhythm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sonar Tari (The Golden Boat):</em> this unique poem was mercilessly criticised by many uncomprehending critics. Some called it sheer mysticism, others claimed that the poem was nothing but barren mist. To me at least, it is nothing inferior to a lucid touch of Revelation, however small in quantity it might be. Here the finite wants to taste the infinite; further, the finite wants to be one with the all-pervading infinite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who comes singing to the shore as he rows? It seems to be an old familiar face. He moves with full sail on; Looks neither right nor left. The helpless waves break on either side. It seems to be an old familiar face.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The birth of the philosopher we notice in Rabindranath the day he brought to light one of his earliest works, <em>Sandhya Sangit (Evening Songs).</em> And this philosopher expressed himself through Tagore's innumerable writings, until the latter breathed his last.</p>
<p>In <em>Naivedya (Offering)</em> we find the poet Rabindranath declaring that he does not belong to the school of Renunciation. The world is not illusionary. Its joy and sorrow, its beauty and ugliness have a veritable value. He wanted to view and acquire Truth and Beauty in and from all the objects of the world. He sings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mine is not the seat of Yoga Behind the doors of senses shut."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In height and depth, in grandeur and sublimity, no other poem of Tagore's can equal <em>Balaka.</em> Here the doors of the world beyond are, as it were, thrown wide open to him. Not only did he bring down the truths of that world, but also he bestowed these achievements on all Bengali literature. Ceaselessly and dauntlessly the world shall march towards its final goal. The surge of beauty that pervades the earth is never a chimera's mist. This beauty is a self-fulfilling truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hear the wild restless flutterings of wings In the depth of silence, in the air, on land and sea. Herbs and shrubs flap their wings over the earthy sky. Who can say, what is there in the tenebrous womb of the earth? Millions of seeds open out their wings Even like flights of cranes. I see ranges of those hillocks, those forests Moving with outspread wings from isle to isle, From the unknown to the unknown. With the flutter of starry wings Darkness glimmers in the weeping night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be sure, <em>Urvasie (The Celestial Nymph)</em> is the wonder of wonders produced in the field of Tagore's poetry. It is here that he reaches the acme of beauty filled with delight. Verily, according to Tagore, <em>Urvasie</em> is at once an eternally self-revealing and self-fulfilling goddess.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O Urvasie swaying soft and sweet, When thou dancest before the assembly of the gods, Thrills of delight course through thy limbs, Waves upon waves swirl rhythmically in the bosom of the ocean, The undulating tips of the shivering corn Appear like the fluttering skirt of mother earth. From the necklace hung upon thy breast Drop down the stars on the floor of the sky. And all at once man loses his masculine heart in sheer rapture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Silence, silence, in a pin-drop silence <em>Puravi</em> sings so sweetly in the core of the poet's heart his songs of Farewell. No more does the poet care for the hustle-bustle of broad daylight. Self-sufficient in peace, he no longer permits the reminiscences of the past, however sweet, to jog his mind.</p>
<p>From his exquisite poem, <em>Swarga Hate Viday (To Bid Adieu to Heaven),</em> we can easily grasp the idea that earthly love and beauty are more intense and delightful than those of Heaven precisely because they are transient. For love and beauty exist in Heaven for good.</p>
<p>It is said that the poet's poem and the prophet's word fly higher than a high-pinioned bird. No wonder, then, that Tagore became at once a poet and a prophet of the highest magnitude when his pen produced <em>Namaskar (Salutation).</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rabindranath, O Aurobindo, bows to thee! O Friend, my country's friend, O voice incarnate, free, Of India's soul!..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally we are not to forget what relation Tagore actually had with his poetry. In one of his letters he writes: "Consciously or unconsciously, I may have done many things that were untrue, but I have never uttered anything false in my poetry: that is the sanctuary where the deepest truth of my life finds refuge."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Prose</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Prose" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Tagore was essentially a Master-poet by temperament, immediately and exquisitely conscious of every claim of mellifluous beauty in all its multifarious forms. His was a personality of singular charm, and a character of singular sweetness. The more we sing Tagore's songs, the better the transparent sincerity breathing through them impresses us.</p>
<p>Needless to say, in the field of prose, too, he is undoubtedly a treasure-house of penetrating wisdom, sublime and beautiful thoughts. His sparkling prose-works are both great and delightfully helpful to the present-day need of humanity. Many of his prose books guide us rightly and purposely through the thick and thin of life. And it is, as it were, an imperative need for an adorer of Bengali literature to quote Tagore's prose to justify the author's own genius.</p>
<p>Let me reproduce here a pleasantly readable remark made by Tagore on prose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wonder why the writing of pages of prose does not give one anything like the joy of completing a single poem. One's emotions take such perfection of form in a poem, they can be taken up by the fingers, so to speak. While prose is like a sackful of loose material, incapable of being lifted as you please." — (From his letters)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truth had a peculiar dream. In the dream he saw Tagore's prose and Tagore's poetry exchanging hot words.</p>
<p>Prose: "Poetry, you must admit that I gave Rabindranath perfection long before you. And when? When he was but in his teens."</p>
<p>Poetry: "True, you gave him perfection before me. But the real sense of it came only after I had been recognised. It is the Nobel Prize given to me that illumined your own depths to the world."</p>
<p>Prose: "Sufficient. Tagore is not all he is on the strength of your gift alone."</p>
<p>Poetry: "But without me, he will never be the real Rabindranath."</p>

<p>Many great individuals who have luminous qualities have yet a rough and arid exterior. Tagore is among the very few exceptions: his outer and inner being glowed alike.</p>

<p>The sole business of the fools is to speak sixteen to the dozen and ask tireless questions, and that of the wise is to answer them. But it is an undeniable truth that the eyes of the wise are often suffused with tears in answering the dunces. Of course, truly innocent and truth-seeking queries do not disturb the men of wisdom; rather such queries give them an overdose of emotional delight. Here is a striking example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I take up father's pen or pencil and write upon his book just as he does, — a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, — why do you get cross with me, then, mother?</p>
<p>"You never say a word when father writes."</p>
<p>"When my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don't seem to mind at all."</p>
<p>"But if I take one sheet to make a boat with, you say, 'Child, how troublesome you are!'</p>
<p>"What do you think of father's spoiling sheets and sheets of paper with black marks all over on both sides?"</p>
<p>— Rabindranath <em>The Crescent Moon</em></p>

<p>My readers may quite reasonably ask why I have so often quoted Tagore. It is precisely because, according to my firm conviction, there is no better way to understand or express Tagore than to bring him always on the scene.</p>

<p>Rabindranath: A towering personality of multifarious achievements.</p>
<p>In Rabindranath's works Bengali literature rightly deserves to shake hands with world literature.</p>
<p>A day shall dawn when Rabindranath's soul-stirring songs will go a long way to the formation of character of the Indians.</p>
<p>His was a Spirit that was ever open to the new Light.</p>
<p>His was the politics that could never be separated from the core of spirituality.</p>
<p>Rabindranath's Viswabharati is a glorious idea seeking a perfect Form.</p>
<p>A marvel indeed, Rabindranath had the rare capacity to mingle the strains of human sorrow and joy, human sweetness and bitterness into one song.</p>
<p>Dancing was looked down upon in Bengal until Rabindranath's tireless toil and mighty personality rehabilitated this art. Dancing was then taken up even by the girls and women of aristocratic families. Rabindranath's faultless view is that dancing is undoubtedly a means of self-expression.</p>
