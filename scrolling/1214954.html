 <p>
UN 1-3. On 15 June 1977, Sri Chinmoy was interviewed at the United Nations by a reporter from the worldwide news service, United Press International. Following are excerpts from that interview.</p>
<h2><em>UPI:</em> You said once that honesty and frankness are the birthright of the West, humility and devotion are the birthright of the East, and the combination of these four powers should be the ideal of a human being. What do you mean by this?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When these qualities, the good qualities of the East and the good qualities of the West, are all combined, a human being can be perfect. Right now the good qualities that the East has are not enough. Similarly, the good qualities that the West has are not enough. But when we can amalgamate them, when we can have the qualities of both worlds, then an individual can become perfect. Right now, the West wants to proceed with only honesty and frankness, but this is insufficient. Humility is also required. The East has humility, but honesty is also required if it wants to become perfect.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We pray and meditate, plus I give short talks and answer questions. The inner world embodies peace, light and bliss. The outer world, unfortunately, does not embody these qualities right now, whereas the inner world has them in boundless measure. So we try to establish a free access to the inner world by virtue of our inner cry and our soulful meditation. We call this our aspiration.</p>
<p><em>UPI:</em> So you don't sit down and talk about the boundaries in the Middle East; you talk about other things?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. I am quite ignorant of politics as such. My forté is spirituality. There are two approaches to every problem. One is the inner approach; the other is the outer approach. Those who come to meditate want to try to walk along the inner road. But ultimately both the roads can lead to the same destination.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">UPI: What is the inner road?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;UPI:&lt;/em&gt; What is the inner road?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The inner road is the road of sincere dedication to the highest cause. In the outer world one can aim at a particular goal without having sincere dedication to the goal. But the inner road represents the attitude of the seeker. The seeker tries in every way to lead a more illumining and more fulfilling life, to find and follow the way that is right from the highest point of view.</p>
<p><em>UPI:</em> Do you envision the day when your goals will be achieved?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the outer world it is a very, very slow process. In the course of time, definitely we will reach the Destined Goal. No sincere cry will meet with frustration, disappointment or failure. If we have a sincere cry, the day is bound to dawn when our sincere cry will meet with satisfaction, supreme satisfaction, which is illumination within and without.</p>
<p><em>UPI:</em> But you don't ever see the day when your work will be done, do you?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, my work is not like that. It is a slow and steady process. We have to sow the seed, which has to germinate, then become a sapling and gradually become a huge banyan tree. We are now in the process of consciously becoming that which we always were in the inner world. But this process of growth is an ever-transcending process. We can grow eternally. We need never stop.</p>
<p><em>UPI:</em> Where are you now? Have you dropped the seed? Do we have a seedling?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is a most inspiring, encouraging question. I have been asked thousands and thousands of questions all over the world, but this last question of yours so far nobody has asked me, not even my disciples. We have sown the seed. Now we have a tiny plant. This tiny plant will grow and become a strong tree. If storms of doubt and hurricanes of jealousy and other undivine forces enter, then naturally the progress can be very slow. But if there is implicit faith and devoted oneness, then the plant will very soon grow into a tree. Now we are in the plant stage; we have sown the seed, and it is no longer a seedling. It has germinated properly. Previously it was only a seedling, but now it has become a tiny but healthy plant. So there is every hope that it will weather all the buffets and blows of human doubts and weaknesses and grow into a huge tree.</p>
<p><em>UPI:</em> Thank you very much.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part II — Norman Rockwell: Artist of Americana</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part II — Norman Rockwell: Artist of Americana" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p>
UN 4. On 10 November 1978 Sri Chinmoy paid the following memorial tribute to the American artist Norman Rockwell during a meeting of the Meditation Group.</p>
<h2>Norman Rockwell: Artist of Americana</h2>

<p>Let us for a minute offer our prayerful meditation so that the artist of Americana, Norman Rockwell, may receive the universal Peace and transcendental Bliss which his soul so rightly and richly deserves.</p>
<p>He not only saw America's simplicity-life and America's happiness-heart, but he also became simplicity and happiness in the purest sense of the term.</p>
<p>No matter what ultra-modern science has made of America, no matter what the modern intellectual giants have made of America, in the depths of America's heart and life there shall always dwell three virtues: simplicity — a childlike simplicity; happiness — a child's happiness; and satisfaction — a child's constantly blossoming satisfaction that comes when America becomes and offers to the world what the child in it has. No virtue that America has can ever diminish or vanish, for virtue is an immortal gift which God Himself grants to aspiring souls and aspiring nations.</p>
<p>America's vastness the world knows. America's oneness only a soul like Norman Rockwell could feel. We, the seekers, shall always feel in him America's oneness-loving life and America's satisfactiondisributing heart. Norman Rockwell embodies the Reality's revealed dream.</p>

<h2>Food and God</h2>


<p>Food has God.<br /> God is Food.<br /> Food has life.<br /> God is Life.<br /> Food has reality.<br /> God is Reality.<br /> Food has sound-success.<br /> God is Sound-Success.<br /> Food has silence-progress.<br /> God is Silence-Progress.</p>

<p>I eat. I eat to survive. From my very birth I have been seeking nourishment. Food saves my life from starvation. Food saves my life from extinction.</p>

<p>Mine is the hunger that does not permit me<br />     To think soulfully.<br /> Mine is the hunger that does not permit me<br />     To act selflessly.<br /> Mine is the hunger that does not permit me<br />     To pray to God constantly.<br /> Mine is the hunger that does not permit me<br />     To meditate spontaneously.<br /> Mine is the hunger that does not permit me<br />     To love God unconditionally.</p>

<p>I know my food-hunger is reasonable and inevitable. But my power-hunger is unreasonable and unpardonable. Finally, my God-hunger is incomparable and insurmountable.</p>
<p>To my great sorrow, poverty attacks plenty. To my widest astonishment, plenty invades poverty. One of the lofty principles of the United Nations is: "Poverty anywhere in the world is a threat to prosperity everywhere." Indeed, this is a heart-unifying and lifefulfilling message. The United Nations was founded upon the vision-hunger for world peace. I am sure there shall come a time when that vision will be transformed into reality — in spite of today's teeming, threatening and frightening clouds over the firmament of the United Nations.</p>

<p>O body, I tell you a supreme secret:<br />     "Shortage is poverty."<br /> O vital, I tell you a supreme secret:<br />     "Rivalry is poverty."<br /> O mind, I tell you a supreme secret:<br />     "Doubt is poverty."<br /> O heart, I tell you a supreme secret:<br />     "Insecurity is poverty."<br /> O life, I tell you a supreme secret:<br />     "Impurity is poverty."<br /> O truth-seeker, I tell you a supreme secret:<br />     "Disobedience is poverty."<br /> O God-lover, I tell you a supreme secret:<br />     "Ingratitude is poverty."     I eat to live.<br /> Indeed, this is my wisdom-light.<br />     I live to eat.<br /> Indeed, this is my ignorance-night.<br /> God says to my desire-life:<br />     "Love to live."<br /> God says to my aspiration-life:<br />     "Live to love."<br /> God says to my realisation-life:<br />     "Love to become a oneness-heart.<br />     Live to be a perfection-life."</p>

<p>Indeed, the power of helplessness in human beings is remarkable. Do we dare to believe this?</p>
<p>Indeed, the power of hopelessness in human beings is staggering. Do we dare to believe this?</p>
<p>Indeed, the power of uselessness in human beings is frightening. Do we dare to believe this?</p>
<p>What is this power? This power is self-oblivion. Self-oblivion has blighted man's aspiration and blinded man's vision.</p>
<p>Here at the United Nations, each person is a representative soul of his nation. It is in and through him that his nation gives and receives. It is in and through him that his nation thirsts for world-acceptance, world-recognition, world-appreciation and worldadmiration.</p>
<p>A person's willingness to hoist the banner of truth in order to bring about national and international victory determines his life's success-march and his heart's progress-flight. Indeed, his life's successmarch and his heart's progress-flight are the successmarch and the progress-flight of his nation as well. This success-march and progress-flight can be founded only on his and his nation's self-giving to the United Nations, which is the world's peaceenvisioning home, the world's oneness-home and a fulness-vision-manifestation.</p>

<p>Prayer is man's soulful cry for God.<br /> Meditation is man's fruitful smile in God.</p>
<p>Prayer is personal; also, universal.<br /> Meditation is impersonal; also, transcendental.</p>
<p>Prayer is petition; also, adoration.<br /> Meditation is absorption; also, perfection.</p>
<p>Prayer needs God's Compassion-Shower.<br /> Meditation needs God's Illumination-Tower.</p>
<p>I pray for Immortality.<br /> I meditate on Infinity and Eternity.</p>
<p>Prayer is night crying for light.<br /> Meditation is light searching for delight.</p>
<p>Prayer reminds us of our hidden sins.<br /> Meditation reminds us of our forgotten sun.</p>
<p>To prayer God says:<br />     "My child, I am waiting for you.<br />     Come and see Me."</p>
<p>To meditation God says:<br />     "My child, wait for Me.<br />     I am coming to see you."</p>
<p>Prayer is the purity that counts.<br /> Meditation is the luminosity that mounts.</p>
<p>My prayer-teacher shows me<br />     The beauty of soulfulness.<br /> My meditation-teacher blesses me<br />     With the duty of oneness.</p>
<p>Prayer soulfully reveals man's faith in God.<br /> Meditation smilingly reveals God's faith in man.<br />     God — who, you? No!<br />     God — who, me? No!     Who then is God?<br /> God is my prayer-purity's Guest.<br /> God is my meditation-divinity's Nest.</p>
<p>My God is mad because nowadays<br />     I do not pray<br /> Either in the morning or in the evening.</p>
<p>My God is sad because nowadays<br />     I do not meditate<br /> Sleeplessly and unconditionally.</p>

<p>My Lord Supreme, this is a special day, Gratitude Day. Alas, I do not have even an iota of gratitude to offer You. Since I have no gratitude, please tell me what I can offer You instead.</p>
<p>"My child, then give Me a soulful promise."</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, I do not know what a soulful promise is. I always break my promise. I promise in season and out of season. But never do I fulfil my promises. Such being the case, my Lord Supreme, please tell me what I can offer You instead of a soulful promise.</p>
<p>"My child, then tell Me that you love Me divinely."</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, I do not know what divine Love is. How can I offer You divine Love when I do not know what divine Love feels like?</p>
<p>"My child, then give Me a fruitful cry. Cry for Me once, only once in your life."</p>
<p>Alas, my Lord Supreme, I do not cry even for myself. How do You expect me to cry for You?</p>
<p>"My child, let Me tell you one thing. Both of us deserve two special names. Each of us will have a new name. Your new name will be a secret and clever unwillingness, and My new Name will be an unreservedly open and compassionately stupid Forgiveness."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Oneness-satisfaction</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Oneness-satisfaction" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Women have one common name: sacrifice. They can sacrifice everything that they have and that they are, either for their dear ones or for an unknown, if not an unknowable, supreme Reality. From time immemorial, Indian women have been revealing the supernal beauty of sacrifice. An Indian wife is synonymous with an Indian sacrifice-heart.</p>
<p>In the hoary past, Maitreyi, wife of the great sage Yagnavalka, received a Call from the Absolute Reality. Therefore, she found it impossible to be satisfied with earthly riches and fleeting happiness. Easily she could have wallowed in the pleasures of earthly prosperity, but she chose the path of renunciation. Her immortal utterance will forever and ever reverberate in the Indian firmament: "What shall I do with the things that will not and cannot make me immortal?"</p>
<p>In the Ramayana, Sita became an incarnation of sacrifice. She cheerfully and unconditionally accepted the life of exile for fourteen years in order to be with her beloved Rama. Urmila, the wife of Rama's younger brother, Lakshmana, made a similar and ever-memorable sacrifice. She allowed her beloved husband Lakshmana to follow his eldest brother into exile, although she could not go with him. She sacrificed the company of her dearest husband by cheerfully letting him fulfil his desire to be with his brother Rama.</p>
<p>Savitri's love for Prince Satyavan touched the very depth of Immortality. When Death snatched him away, Savitri continued following the spirit of her husband until she proved to Death that nothing in God's entire Creation could stand between her and her husband. Finally, Death had to return Satyavan to the world of the living, for the power of Savitri's oneness-love for her husband far surpassed the division-power of Death.</p>
<p>Many ordinary Indian women have also become emblems of sacrifice. A certain Rajput king was killed in battle by another king, and the enemy's soldiers entered into the palace to kill the family of the defeated king. The maid, Panna, seeing the grave situation, carried away the infant prince and put her own child in the prince's place. She said to herself, "I am an ordinary human being, and my son will always remain an ordinary human being. But this infant will one day be a king. The king and the queen were always kind to me. Can I not do them a favour now that they are dead? If God takes care of this infant prince through me, he will grow up and some day he may be able to regain his kingdom. My sacrifice is no sacrifice when I am doing something for a noble cause." The soldiers came and killed Panna's child but, in the course of time, the real prince did regain his father's kingdom.</p>
<p>Satisfaction can be achieved in various ways. These women, through their matchless sacrifice, which was nothing other than their oneness-love, attained satisfaction.</p>
<p>Some present-day women, specially in the West, try to achieve satisfaction in another way. They try to achieve satisfaction by equalling or transcending men. But the satisfaction that comes from equalling or surpassing others will not last. Only oneness-satisfaction will forever last. In the heart of oneness, there is no superiority or inferiority; there is not even equality. There is only oneness-joy. It is not a competition-game, but a oneness-game.</p>
<p>Today we hear a lot about women's liberation. Many women are trying to equal or surpass men. I wish to say that real liberation does not lie in equalling or surpassing others, but in becoming one with them. Liberation is satisfaction, and satisfaction is found only in oneness.</p>
<p>Man's inner strength is his poise. Woman's inner strength is her love. When poise and love blend together in oneness-game, at that time true satisfaction, constant satisfaction, perfect satisfaction, infinite and immortal Satisfaction will dawn on earth.</p>

<p>Each nation has five members in its family: inspiration, aspiration, realisation, revelation and manifestation.</p>

<p>The body needs inspiration.<br /> The vital needs aspiration.<br /> The mind needs realisation.<br /> The heart needs revelation.<br /> The soul needs manifestation.</p>
<p>The body wants to walk.<br /> The vital wants to run.<br /> The mind wants to fly.<br /> The heart wants to dive.<br /> The soul wants to be.</p>
