  <h2 id="page-title">The lost rupees</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The lost rupees" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a very good worker. He used to work very, very hard during the entire day. At the end of the day he would go to his boss and receive five rupees. For his whole day's work his salary was only five rupees. One day his boss gave him a ten-rupee note and said, "Give me five rupees change."</p>
<p>The worker said, "I have no money to give you change."</p>
<p>The boss said, "Then I cannot pay you."</p>
<p>The worker pleaded, "Can you not give me the ten rupees? You know that tomorrow I will definitely come. You can pay me for tomorrow in advance."</p>
<p>The boss said, "No, no, no, I do not trust you."</p>
<p>The worker said, "I have worked the whole day from early morning until now. On a daily basis you give me five rupees. Today you have a ten-rupee note. You know that tomorrow I will come and work. Can you not give it to me?"</p>
<p>The boss said again, "No, no, I do not trust you. You may not come."</p>
<p>The worker was very, very sad that this had happened. The boss said, "Tomorrow you come and at the end of the day I will give you five rupees for today and five for tomorrow."</p>
<p>The worker said, "But today I have to buy food for tomorrow. I entirely depend on your five rupees to eat."</p>
<p>The boss said, "Are you arguing with me?" Then the boss gave him a very smart slap.</p>
<p>The man was so miserable. He was not getting any money, and then he received this kind of treatment. At that moment, a friend of the boss, a jeweller, passed by. He asked, "What is happening? Why is that worker crying?"</p>
<p>The boss said, "He is a rogue. He has finished working. I have only a ten-rupee note. He is unable to give me five rupees back, so I did not give him his salary for today and, what is worse, now he is arguing with me."</p>
<p>The friend asked, "He is not arguing. He is simply stating his case. He is such a humble man. But I can easily solve this problem. Give me the ten-rupee note."</p>
<p>The friend took ten rupees from the boss and gave him a five-rupee note in return. The boss gave the five-rupee note to the worker. Then the friend said, "I owe you five rupees."</p>
<p>The boss asked, "When will you give me the five rupees that you still owe me?"</p>
<p>The friend said, "When the time comes, I may give you back your five rupees. You are such a bad fellow. This man is a very sincere worker and you were refusing to pay him. The more I think about it, the more I am determined not to give you back your five rupees."</p>
<p>Then the boss said, "All right. I am not going to force you to return my five rupees. It is better to keep our friendship than to get my five rupees back."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Singing the king&#039;s glory</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Singing the king&#039;s glory" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The king needed a very, very good worker to do some special tasks in the palace. The minister found the perfect worker. This worker was very sincere, very nice looking, very honest and so forth. But he had one bad habit: he used to come to work late. So the king scolded the minister: "What kind of man is he? He is coming late to work every day. Does he not value his job in the palace?"</p>
<p>The minister was very embarrassed. He went to see the worker and said, "I got you the job and told the king that you were such a nice man and a good worker. Why are you behaving in this way? Why do you come late to work every day? How can you justify it?"</p>
<p>The man replied, "Early in the morning, I go to the temple, and there I praise God. I sing God's Glory for hours and hours. That is why I arrive late."</p>
<p>The minister said, "This is what you do? Then when you come to the king's palace, why do you not sing the king's glory?"</p>
<p>The fellow came the following day to work and started singing the king's glory. He was extolling the king and praising him to the skies. The king observed the worker for some time. At first he was amused. Then after half an hour or forty-five minutes the worker was still going on with endless singing. He was not working at all. He was only singing the king's praises. Then the king became exasperated. He gave the man a slap and demanded, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>The man said, "What can I do? The minister asked me to sing your glory."</p>
<p>Then the minister was summoned. The king asked him, "Why did you tell this worker to sing my glory?"</p>
<p>The minister said, "He told me he comes late each day because he sings God's Glory in the temple. I told him that if he came and sang your glory for a little while, you would be pleased. But I did not think that he would be only singing your glory and not working at all."</p>
<p>The worker said in his own defense, "God created me. That is why I go to the temple every day and sing God's Praises and Glory."</p>
<p>The minister said, "God created you, and God also wants you to live on earth, to work honestly. By praising God constantly, how will you be able to support yourself? If you wanted to praise God all day long, why did you accept this job? There is a time for everything. If you go to the temple early in the morning, you can praise God before you come to work. Then you will come to the palace punctually and work here. At the end of the day, you will take your salary and buy what you need. In this way, everything will have its proper time. Come to work on time. Before you come to work, go to the temple and sing God's Glory. Then after finishing your work here, you can again go to the temple. But, in the meantime, you must work."</p>
<p>When the king heard such sound advice and saw that this worker was going to listen, he gave a large amount of money to the minister. He was such a wise minister! The king also gave a bonus to the worker.</p>
<p>The minister was right. The following day the worker arrived at the palace on time. He had already gone to the temple and offered his praises to God. Then he came to work because he was getting money from the king. Before starting work, he sang the king's praises for a short time, and then he started working.</p>
<p>So the king was pleased with this worker and the minister was pleased with him. Definitely God was also pleased with him because he was doing the right thing.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The spiritual Master&#039;s burden</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The spiritual Master&#039;s burden" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A spiritual Master had many, many disciples. When old age descended upon him, he became extremely frail. His disciples were worrying and worrying! "O God," they cried, "We have such a great and good spiritual Master. Do not allow him to die. We do not want to lose our beloved Master."</p>
<p>They were all begging the spiritual Master, "Please take some medicine to improve your health."</p>
<p>The spiritual Master would not take any medicine. He said, "My time has come. I do not want to take any more medicine. If it is God's Will for me to leave this body, then I am fully prepared. If I continue to live on earth, then I will have to take the burden of so many people. But when I die, only four men will have to take <em>my</em> burden. I am very, very sorry for those four men who will have to bear my burden."</p>
<p>The disciples asked, "Why are you saying that only four people will have to take care of you? There are so many people here who are extremely devoted to you. We will all take care of you if anything happens to you." Then they all started crying.</p>
<p>The spiritual Master said, "I do not need all of you. I need only four people."</p>
<p>The disciples could not fathom why their Master was making a special point of saying four people. Finally, the Master said, "You fools, when I die, my coffin will be carried by only four men. I am feeling sorry for them because they will have to carry my lifeless body to the burial ground. Here on earth I took the burden of so many people. But when I die, only four men will have to bear <em>my</em> burden."</p>
