TRNS 1-2. The first two stories in this volume were initially printed, along with other stories, in a pamphlet entitled <em>Silence Liberates</em> published circa 1971.</p>
<h2>Transfiguration</h2>

<p>A beggar man and a beggar woman. The woman was ugliness incarnate; the man stoneblind from his very birth. One day they chanced to meet on the outskirts of the town.</p>
<p>"Oh," she cried, "you are a blind beggar, and I have no one to call my own. I shall clasp your hand and lead you from door to door. And thus both of us shall be benefitted." She could not express her actual feeling.</p>
<p>"I shall derive much benefit from your kindness, no doubt," said the beggar man, "but what about your good self? I shall be nothing but a burden to you."</p>
<p>"A human being cannot live without having such a burden," she replied.</p>
<p>So from that day on, they went out begging together. She held him by the hand and led him from door to door as he asked for alms. The blind man felt indebted to her and prayed to God to shower blessings on her.</p>
<p>{{{fleuron}}}</p>
<p>One day they went out far beyond the town and returned home very late. The sun had been unbearably hot and their feet were scorched. As they made their way home, the blind beggar said to his comrade, "Am I not a trouble to you?"</p>
<p>"My life became unbearable," she said, "simply because I had no such trouble."</p>
<p>The blind beggar could only remain silent.</p>
<p>One day it began to rain heavily while they were on their way to beg. The violent downpour was accompanied by tremendous thunderbolts. The two beggars ran and took shelter under a huge banyan tree nearby. Even there, the relentless shower made its way through the space between the leaves, soaking them to the skin. The fury of the wind and the lashing rain set them shivering in their scanty rags. Suddenly, in a voice choked with emotion, the blind beggar said, "Ah! What suffering you are put to! But for me, you could have been free!"</p>
<p>"Suffering? No doubt it is suffering. But suffering of this kind alone has made my life worth living."</p>
<p>Silence reigned upon the lips of the blind beggar.</p>
<p>{{{fleuron}}}</p>
<p>In this wise, days ran into weeks and weeks into months.</p>
<p>The intimacy of the blind man and the ugly woman grew deeper through touch than through words. She held him by the hand and led him from village to village. Her touch was to him no less than a garland of fragrant flowers laid upon him. That touch, day by day, penetrated his nerves and blood and assuaged a deep-rooted pang of his heart. An utmost, inseparable intimacy grew between them.</p>
<p>One day the blind man burst out, "I am consumed with the desire to see you. How I wish to be blessed with sight even for a day!" At this the woman was simply stunned. For she was convinced that she had got him precisely because he had no sight.</p>
<p>Presently the beggar asked her, "What has come over you? What makes you so upset?"</p>
<p>The beggar woman caught hold of his hand and gave it a gentle shake. "Who? Why? Nothing is the matter." But the eyes of the beggar woman were now brimming with tears.</p>
<p>The beggar man himself became deeply moved. He asked her why she had begun to weep.</p>
<p>"Are you a magician? You have no sight. How do you know that my eyes are swimming in tears?"</p>
<p>After some moments of silence, he answered,</p>
<p>"Well, I myself do not know how I have known it."</p>
<p>Silence fell upon the two souls.</p>
<p>{{{fleuron}}}</p>
<p>One day the woman confided, "You know, I shall lose you the moment your eyes start functioning."</p>
<p>"Why? How do you mean?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"Well, you know, I… I… I am the most uglylooking woman upon the earth."</p>
<p>A subtle smile played upon his lips. "You are ugly? Do not lie to me. To your eyes you are ugly because you have not been able to see your true self. But my blind eyes have seen it. You are the embodiment of beauty. Full of compassion are your eyes. A divine affection courses across your lips. A full-bloomed lotus is in your hand. The blush of a red lotus shines upon your cheeks."</p>
<p>At this, a silent smile hung upon her quivering mouth. That smile was, as it were, laden with the sorrow of the whole world.</p>
<p>"Yet, I pine to see you with my eyes open," said the blind beggar man.</p>
<p>For two days a storm had been raging in all its fury within the heart of the beggar woman. She had a dream that the beggar would gain the power of sight. If this did happen, what then? The Goddess of Beauty had been hostile to her all along. There was no shadow of a doubt in her heart that the beggar would desert her as soon as he saw her. Again she would have to go her way. And who, but the blind beggar, could have fallen deeply in love with <em>her</em>, ugliness itself?</p>
<p>After a long battle, the selflessness of the woman came successfully to the fore and she decided to tell him of her dream.</p>
<p>"Do you know something?" she said.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Soon your eyes will obey your command. You will be able to see at your will."</p>
<p>An overwhelming delight stilled the power of his speech.</p>
<p>"You will be blessed with the power of sight," she continued, "when you stand chestdeep in Devi Lake and when the blessing-flower of the Mahalakshmi Temple is put to your eyes at the very moment of sunrise."</p>
<p>"Is it so?" His heart gave a jump and a thump in ecstasy.</p>
<p>"Mahalakshmi herself has promised me so in my dream."</p>
<p>Light, hope and delight shone on the beggar's face.</p>
<p>There was a minute's silence. A few drops of tears stole into her eyes.</p>
<p>Impatience tortured him. "But when, my dear, when?"</p>
<p>"In two days, the day of the sun's entrance into Capricorn."</p>
<p>{{{fleuron}}}</p>
<p>On the appointed day, both beggar man and beggar woman stood chest-deep in Devi Lake. A fragrant blessing-flower from the Mahalakshmi Temple was in the hand of the beggar man. The beggar woman was trembling with expectation to see the sunrise.</p>
<p>The golden disk was now appearing on the horizon. The beggar woman touched the blind eyes of her beloved with the flower. Lo, the miracle!</p>
<p>The man was blind no more. His bright eyes were now flooded with sight and delight. They reflected the devotion welling up from the depths of his heart. He seized her by the hand and looked eagerly into her face. With a voice full of gratitude, he cried out, "Oh! You... you... you beautiful beggar woman!"</p>
<p>She blushed and her heart gave a throb of ecstasy. She cast a glance at her own reflection in the water. There, in the silvery freshness of the dawn, mirrored in the calm lake, her face, transfigured into the Goddess of Beauty, incarnate.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Union (A Fable)</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Union (A Fable)" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>An incalculable number of years ago there was a time when man was extremely addlebrained. He treated his consort, the most intimate companion upon earth, as a bond-woman. She was kept, as it were, in iron fetters. She was granted the freedom of moving about inside the house performing all household duties. But she was denied the right of going out of doors.</p>
<p>She accepted her lot without a murmur. No, none was there to read her mind. She would take every care of his room as of the whole household. She would tidy up all her husband's things and keep them trim and safe for his use, and even the floor she would scrub with her own hands. When the day was done and the Sun dozed into a sweet sleep on the Western brim of the world, she would light a lamp fed with clarified butter and, placing it under the tulsi plant in the courtyard, offer prayers to ward off all unforeseen evils. She would arrange flowers for his daily worship and timely serve food and drink to all concerned. The man was certain that she did all these simply because she had no existence without him.</p>
<p>God could not help smiling at the secret thoughts of the man. He wanted to play a trick on the man. However, God's fun-making was of the merry type. One day He removed the man's better half from his house. On entering his house, the man found no food to eat, no water to drink, no flowers to offer to God.</p>
<p>In no time, he flew into a rage. He shouted himself hoarse. He was, as it were, preparing himself to wage a war against somebody. Suddenly God donned the earthly cloak and came into his presence. With utmost innocence, He said to the man: "What has come over you? What is all this commotion?"</p>
<p>"How do you mean?" He was more than angry. "Where is she gone, the one who has been marked for me? Now there is none to serve me with food and drink. Who will collect flowers for me for my daily worship? She used to do all these."</p>
<p>"So it was only to have all these that you needed her?"</p>
<p>"Then for what else?"</p>
<p>"Can I seize upon your word?"</p>
<p>"I give you my word of honour. There, there alone, her importance ends."</p>
<p>"I promise, every day you will get food, drink and flowers, all on time."</p>
<p>By the Omnipotence of God, all the necessities of the man were supplied to him. No, there was not even the slightest flaw in God's management. The man was timely supplied with everything as before. But only his consort's presence was denied to him.</p>
<p>All went well — timely food for the appeasement of his hunger, water for the quenching of his thirst, flowers for his daily worship — all were there. But there was something lacking in his life. The tune that would fill the gap between his food and drink and bring in a wave of satisfaction between his drink and worship was sadly missing. Now his food was simply food, his water was mere water, his flowers were mere flowers. Life appeared to him as cruelty personified. Everything went on mechanically, like the hands of a clock.</p>
<p>One day the man returned home dead tired. He found everything in perfect order — his food, his drink, his flowers, in a word, whatever he actually might have wanted. Yet his anger knew no bounds. He cried out, "Who wants all these? Who can put up with Your cruel mockery? Who can abide by Your mechanical dealings?" Then, with a tremendous kick, he sent all the utensils and the flowers flying pell-mell.</p>
<p>God appeared. "What is wrong with you again?"</p>
<p>In lieu of a meet reply, the man blurted out: "You are clever enough to guess the reason. How long will You keep up this farce? Who wants all these services from You? Take them all back. Who wants Your insipid gifts? Give her back who was absolutely my own. My heart is in hot haste to see her. I have had no heart for anything else. I cannot lure my heart away from her."</p>
<p>A subtle smile played upon the eyes of God. He made the man feel for himself that his wild anger was the malady of his own heart. So now God returned his wife.</p>
<p>The sight of her sent the man mad with joy. He was overwhelmed with a tremendous emotion. In the twinkling of an eye, he released her from her fetters. He decked her wrists with two gold bracelets and placed round her neck a pendant of snow-white pearls. His heart was ravished with love. He hugged her impetuously. "It does not behoove me to treat you as a bondwoman anymore. You are my peer in every respect. You are perfection's model. You are the <em>Purna</em> (the deity of Fulfilment). By your magic touch, the empty hearts become filled with the richness of delight. You eclipse Lakshmi's matchless pride of beauty. It is you who complete the incomplete."</p>
<p>That was the day when the gods were awakened by the redolent smell of the flowers offered by man.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part II — Stories</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part II — Stories" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p>
TRNS 3-5. Sri Chinmoy recounted these three stories at his home in New York on 8 March 2004.</p>
<h2>God is your only own</h2>

<p>One day, while a spiritual Master was meditating, one of his female disciples came up to him and said, "Master, Master, please do me a favour."</p>
<p>He asked, "What kind of favour?"</p>
<p>She explained, "My husband is unmanageable. I want him to be under my control. I am infinitely wiser than he is, so I want him to listen to me."</p>
<p>The Master said, "I cannot make him do that. It is an impossible task."</p>
<p>The woman became annoyed with the Master. She said to him, "Master, why do you say that you can bring God to us? If you cannot do something as simple as make my husband listen to me, then how can you bring God to us? That is infinitely more difficult! If you cannot do even this small favour for me, if you cannot help me in this small way, then how will you ever be able to show us God? I want my husband to be under my full control. You cannot do that, yet you say you can bring God down to us from Heaven. How can this be? I am sure that if you can bring God down from Heaven, then easily you can make my husband come under my control."</p>
<p>Finally, the woman's tirade came to an end. In a calm and quiet voice, the spiritual Master replied, "I can bring God to you because God is your own, whereas your husband is not your own."</p>
<p>Now the woman became really upset. "What do you mean?" she cried. "We are married legally. And we have been together for so many years! Now you are saying that my husband is not my own. If my husband is not my own, then who else can be mine?"</p>
<p>The woman stood before the Master, moving her arms as she spoke. Her attitude was almost threatening. Nevertheless, the Master continued in the same patient and calm voice, "Look, you want to bring your husband under your control. Your husband also wants to do the same with you. He wants you to be under his control. What am I going to do? I am lost in between two bosses. Here is the proof that you and he are not one. You and he are not thinking the same. You want to be his boss; he wants to be your boss. Neither of you is coming forward to surrender to the other. You are not saying, 'All right, let me surrender to him. If he wants to be my boss, then let me surrender.' And he also is not agreeing to surrender to you. So already you two have differences of opinion. Your desire is to bring your husband under your control. You want to lord it over him. He wants to do the same with you. Your wish he is not fulfilling, and his wish you are not fulfilling. So how can you be one?"</p>
<p>The Master gestured for the woman to sit down. Then he went on, "On the other hand, if you pray to God, 'God, do give me Peace, Love and Bliss,' God immediately listens to your request. So is He not truly your own? As soon as you pray to God to give you inner wealth, God immediately listens. So God is absolutely your own."</p>
<p>The woman jumped up and said, "Master, you stay with your philosophy. Your philosophy is too complicated." Then she left the Master's house quite abruptly.</p>
<p>A few hours later, the husband came to the Master with the same request: he wanted his wife to listen to him. The Master told the husband the same thing that he had told the wife. He said, "God is the only one who is your own because only God listens to your prayers, whereas your wife does not listen to your prayers."</p>
<p>In a voice laden with despair, the husband said, "I have had enough of her. Since we got married, she has destroyed all my peace, all my joy."</p>
<p>"Then go forward on your own," advised the spiritual Master.</p>
<p>The husband cast aside all his complaints against his wife and started praying and meditating with the Master most soulfully. Several hours passed. Meanwhile, the wife did not know where her husband had gone. She arrived at the Master's house to inform him that her husband was missing. She came rushing into the room and said to the Master, "It is late into the night, but my husband has not come home."</p>
<p>All of a sudden she noticed that her husband was sitting on the ground in front of the Master. He was in deep meditation and she saw that her husband's face was full of light. His entire being shone with light.</p>
<p>An inner transformation was taking place inside the wife. She said to herself, "If he can be happy like this, then what is wrong with me? Let me also pray and meditate with the Master and not think about controlling my husband."</p>
<p>So each of them began to follow the spiritual life most sincerely and, in the course of time, each one stopped trying to control the other. They only prayed and prayed. Whenever they had to arrive at an important decision, the husband would say to the wife, "Your way is the only way," and the wife would say to the husband, "Your way is the only way."</p>
<p>This is how they became really happy, peaceful and blissful.</p>

<p>One day God appeared before a certain seeker with folded hands and began bowing to the seeker again and again.</p>
<p>The seeker was simply shocked. He cried out, "God, what are You doing? What are You doing?"</p>
<p>God made no reply. He only bowed down and touched the feet of the seeker.</p>
<p>"God, You have gone crazy, crazy!" shouted the seeker in disbelief.</p>
<p>This time God spoke. He said, "No, I am not crazy."</p>
<p>"Then please explain Your behaviour to me, God," begged the seeker. "How can You touch my feet? How can You stand in front of me with folded hands? What does it mean?"</p>
<p>Finally, God answered him: "Every day you demand something from me. You tell me, 'God, give me this, give me that; give me this, give me that!' Your demands and commands have no beginning and no end. Every day you command Me to do so many things. Who can issue commands? Only he who is superior. One can only command someone who is subordinate, like a slave. So I have become your slave.</p>
<p>"Since you have made Me your slave, I have to stand in front of you with folded hands and touch your feet. At every moment you are commanding Me to give you this and give you that. Therefore, you must be superior to Me. That is why I have come with folded hands and why I am touching your feet again and again. It is you who have made Me your slave."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The oath of silence</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The oath of silence" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There were three monks who were very close friends. One was a Russian, one was a German and one was an Italian. They all wanted to realise God, so they entered into an Himalayan cave and took an oath of silence. They decided to pray and meditate most intensely, and not to utter a single word until they had realised God.</p>
<p>For one year, everything went well. They remained silent and they enjoyed very deep meditations. Alas, the day came when the weather became unbearably cold. The three monks were shivering. Each one was finding it extremely difficult to meditate.</p>
<p>Finally, the Italian monk opened his eyes and said, "It is very cold here."</p>
<p>The German monk opened his eyes and said, "You are right, my friend."</p>
<p>Hearing their conversation, the Russian monk flew into a rage. "You two are so bad!" he thundered. "You cannot keep your promise. You have to discuss the weather! What is more, you have interrupted my meditation. I was drinking in peace and delight, but now it is all ruined. What happened to your sacred oath? It is simply worthless!"</p>
<p>Like this, he went on insulting the German monk and the Italian monk mercilessly.</p>
<p>Still his anger did not abate. At last, the Russian monk said, "You two are worse than useless! I am leaving you." Saying this, he left the cave.</p>
<p>The German monk and the Italian monk were so furious and upset at the behaviour of the Russian monk. "What right does he have to scold us?" they shouted. They became so disgusted that they, too, decided to leave the cave.</p>
<p>This is how the three monks ended their silence and abandoned the Himalayan cave. Needless to say, God-realisation was nowhere to be found!</p>

 <p>
TRNS 6-10. On 19 November 1995, Sri Chinmoy recounted these five stories about Sarada Devi, the consort of Sri Ramakrishna. Sarada Devi was known as the Holy Mother to the disciples of Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<h2>The Master's earthly and heavenly behaviour</h2>

<p>One day, a new seeker lodged a serious complaint with Sarada Devi against a senior disciple. He said, "The senior disciple told me that one should not stay very close to one's Master for a long period of time. From the Master's earthly behaviour, the disciple may lose faith in the Master. Therefore, it is advisable for the disciple to leave after a short time if he wishes to maintain faith in the Master."</p>
<p>The Mother said, "Do not listen to him. If you take someone as your Master, you can never separate your Master's earthly behaviour from his Heavenly behaviour. Everything is always the same in his inner life and in his outer life."</p>

<p>One day, towards the end of his earthly sojourn, Sri Ramakrishna asked Sarada Devi, "Do you have dreams?"</p>
<p>She replied, "Yes, I do. Just last night I had a dream. In the dream, I saw Mother Kali standing in front of me. She was keeping her neck bent to one side. I asked Mother Kali why she had her neck bent. She said, 'My son is suffering so much in his throat, so I am suffering the same way.' "</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna said to Sarada Devi, "It is absolutely true. Mother Kali and I are suffering together. But I tell you, since I am going through all this suffering which you were all supposed to suffer, you do not have to suffer. My Mother has sent me into the world to take upon myself the suffering of the world."</p>

<p>One day, in a particular disciple's house, Sarada Devi entered into trance. She remained in that state for several hours. Upon returning to her normal consciousness, she told the disciples around her that she had envisioned red and blue lights. She said that she had been swimming in a sea of light.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she said that if this experience had lasted for four or five days, her soul would not have remained on earth.</p>

<p>This experience occurred after Sri Ramakrishna had left his physical body. One night Sarada Devi was seated by the Ganges. The scene was flooded with moonlight. All of a sudden, she saw Sri Ramakrishna entering into the Ganges. His whole body melted into the water. Then Vivekananda appeared. He was chanting <em>"Jai Ramakrishna, jai Ramakrishna!"</em> [Victory to Ramakrishna, victory to Ramakrishna!]</p>
<p>Sarada Devi saw that with his two hands, Vivekananda was scattering the water of the Ganges on the heads of countless people and they were all being liberated. It was an unimaginable gathering.</p>
<p>Then Sarada Devi said to herself, "How can I enter into the water with my legs and feet now that it has become Thakur?" So for many days she did not enter into the Ganges.</p>

<p>On the day of Sri Ramakrishna's passing, after Sri Ramakrishna had left his earthly body, all his disciples and dear ones were swimming in the sea of tears. Sarada Devi's grief knew no bounds. She became her heart's heart-rending cries.</p>
<p>In the evening, in accordance with the custom of Hindu widows in India, she was removing all the ornaments from her body one by one. She had discarded everything except one gold bracelet. As she was removing this last ornament, Sri Ramakrishna appeared in front of her and said, "What are you doing? I am not dead, I am immortal. I am now in my Heavenly body, my golden body. Therefore, I want you to keep wearing your gold bracelet."</p>
<p>Sarada Devi continued wearing that bracelet as long as she lived.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part IV - Stories about Swami Vivekananda</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part IV - Stories about Swami Vivekananda" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p>
TRNS 11-25. Over the years, Sri Chinmoy told many stories about Swami Vivekananda with whom he has a very close inner connection. These are some of those stories.</p>
<h2>Raising the fare for the passage</h2>

<p>During his itinerant wanderings in the west and south of India, Swami Vivekananda had come to hear of the Parliament of Religions which was to be held in America in 1893. He expressed his wish to go and his devotees in Madras went forth to collect the necessary funds. They raised about three hundred rupees. Then, to their great surprise and shock, Vivekananda asked them to give the money to the poor and needy. He was convinced that if it was really the Will of the Supreme for him to go to the West, the money would come again.</p>
<p>A few months later, the devotees in Madras once more began collecting funds. Alasinga Perumal, Swami Vivekananda's foremost devotee in Madras, went from door to door begging people to help. Money also came from other quarters, including the Maharajas of several states. Finally, Swami Vivekananda was presented with a first class ticket on a steamer to Vancouver.</p>
<p>On May 31st, 1893, the steamer bearing Swami Vivekananda set sail from Bombay.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Adopting the name &#039;Vivekananda&#039;</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Adopting the name &#039;Vivekananda&#039;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My name, Chinmoy, was given to me by my brother Chitta when he applied for me to go to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Before that, I was known by my nickname, 'Madal'.</p>
<p>In Swami Vivekananda's case, his childhood name was Naren and his nickname was Bilé. A few years after Sri Ramakrishna left the body, Naren became a wandering sannyasin. His wanderings took him across the length and breadth of India.</p>
<p>At that time, he used many different names. When he journeyed to Delhi in 1891, for example, he assumed the name of Swami Vividishananda. Before that, he had also travelled under the names Bishikeshananda and Sachchidananda. Then, on the eve of his departure for America, he took the name Vivekananda. This is how it happened.</p>
<p>Naren's dearest friend, admirer and devotee came from Kerala in South India. As I mentioned in the previous story, his name was Alasinga Perumal. He was extremely, extremely devoted to Naren. He was supposed to take care of Naren's passport. So he went to the passport office in Madras and wrote down the name that the Swami had been using: Bishikeshananda. It means, 'the dancing waves of the ocean'. The meaning is so significant, but the word itself is not at all sweet.</p>
<p>"What a horrible name!" exclaimed Alasinga Perumal. Then he consulted with the other devotees in Madras and they were all of the same opinion. A few days later, he brought the passport to Naren. When Naren looked at it, he said, "What is this? This is not my name!"</p>
<p>Then all the devotees replied, "Yes, this is your name. We did not like that old name you gave yourself. Vivekananda has to be your name. It is far, far better. It has much more meaning around it."</p>
<p>Naren could not argue with his disciples, so he took the name Vivekananda. It means, 'the most powerful delight of all-pervading conscience'. If you develop your conscience, you cannot tell lies or do anything wrong or undivine. Your conscience will all the time poke you. Some people say that this name means 'discrimination'. But the actual meaning is 'conscience'. Where does discrimination come from? From conscience. If you have conscience, then only can you discriminate. It is from the results of conscience that we get discrimination.</p>
<p>In most cases, disciples receive spiritual names from their Masters. But in Vivekananda's case, it was just the opposite. He received his name from the disciples, and he surrendered to them.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Permission to cross the seas</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Permission to cross the seas" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Just before he was due to leave for America, Vivekananda decided that he would cross the seas only after having some concrete indications from his Master, Sri Ramakrishna. It had been seven years since Sri Ramakrishna had left the body. Vivekananda waited and waited for a sign from his Master, but in vain. At last he argued that his spiritual Mother and the Master were one and the same and so he decided to seek Sarada Devi's permission to go abroad.</p>
<p>Accordingly, from Madras he wrote a letter to Sarada Devi. By the time he received a reply from her, he had had a most significant dream in which he saw Sri Ramakrishna proceed to the West over the waves and waters. In the dream, Sri Ramakrishna was beckoning Vivekananda to follow him. This Vivekananda took for approval of his plan.</p>
<p>Presently he received wholehearted permission and blessings from his spiritual Mother. Now all Vivekananda's doubts vanished. With redoubled faith, he was able to undertake his historic voyage.</p>

<p>Other delegates to the Parliament of Religions in 1893 represented certain groups, but Swami Vivekananda came as an individual. He did not receive a formal invitation as such. He just came on his own. Then he was given a letter of introduction by Professor J.H. Wright, the Professor of Greek at Harvard University. Unfortunately, Swami Vivekananda lost the letter.</p>
<p>Vivekananda was very upset when he lost the letter, but the great Professor said to him, "To ask you, Swami, for your credentials is like asking the sun to state its right to shine." So this is the wonderful compliment that he gave Vivekananda.</p>
