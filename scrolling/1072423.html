  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What causes suffering?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What causes suffering?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because of our wrong deeds, the negative, unaspiring, undivine forces have come into existence. When these forces enter into us, we suffer. This is one point of view. But again, whatever we call suffering, and whatever we call sinful, evil, undivine or unaspiring is also part of God. We experience God in and through everything. When we see suffering, immediately we feel that God is really cruel. This is our human way of judging God. But if we go deep within, we see that what we call suffering is nothing but an experience. And who is having that experience? God Himself. God is the Doer, God is the Action and God is the Fruit. This is what we realise from our inner spiritual life.</p>
<p>The human in us will see suffering as something horrible and undivine, but the divine in us will see it as God’s experience in the process of cosmic evolution. The higher we go, the clearer it becomes to our human mind that all the incidents that have taken place on earth are the experiences of God in and through each human being. Now, in God’s cosmic <em>Lila</em> (Game), we see multitudinous activities, countless forces operating all at once. But a day will dawn when the sincere seekers will realise the highest Truth and outnumber the unaspiring people, and then the undivine forces will have to give way. When a seeker consciously enters into the sea of Peace and Light on the strength of his aspiration, he becomes part and parcel of God’s Will. Then he does not commit the mistakes that unaspiring human beings commit. Unfortunately, right now, out of perhaps a million people, only one or two aspire; and again, out of those aspirants, a very limited few are extremely sincere in their spiritual life.</p>
<p>The world is progressing towards the Light, although this progress is very slow. Human suffering <em>will</em> come to an end, because God is all Delight. We came from Delight. On earth we are growing in Delight. At the end of our soul’s journey we shall return to Delight.</p>
<p>Our Vedic seers sang: <em>Anandadd hy eva khalv imani bhutani jayante . . .:</em> “From Delight we came into existence. In Delight we grow. At the end of our journey, into Delight we shall retire.”</p>
<p>This experience of Delight we develop when we meditate and pray. Most of us do not pray or meditate sincerely or soulfully; therefore, the existence of Delight is a far cry for us. But if we soulfully meditate and unconditionally surrender our day-to-day existence to the Almighty, to our Divine Father, then Delight will be our everyday reality. At every second we shall feel the presence of Delight. Our outer experience may be otherwise; it may seem painful or destructive. But in our inner experience we shall become inseparably one with the cosmic Will. In that Will there is no suffering. Suffering is in the human mind and in the earth-consciousness. But when we go beyond the earth-consciousness, when we offer our very existence to the Supreme and become part and parcel of His cosmic Will on earth, we see that there is no such thing as suffering. We see only an experience, a divine cosmic experience which God Himself is having in and through us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why did God need this suffering? Why did God make it so that He would suffer in man’s suffering?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why did God need this suffering? Why did God make it so that He would suffer in man’s suffering?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As I said, the worst suffering is that in our human mind. You know if you pinch me, I shall suffer. If you give me a deliberate blow, I shall suffer. Yet suffering is painful because we take it as painful. Something may be painful to us, but in God’s Eye it is not like that; it is an experience. And that experience is like a stepping-stone.</p>
<p>There is day and there is night. We can say that night is darkness and it is full of undivine forces, whereas day is bright and divine. But again, we could think of night as rest and peace. If we enter into the very depth of night, we get peace, sublime peace. There we take rest and energise ourselves for the day, when we will enter into the battlefield of life.</p>
<p>We have to know that we are making progress; we are proceeding towards the Light. Right now let us say that there is a tunnel of suffering before us. But at the end of the tunnel there is light. Suffering is not the beginning and suffering is not the end. Light and Delight were the beginning and they will be the end. In the process of evolution, the forces of suffering are making us stronger. Sooner or later we shall say “No” to suffering. We shall refuse to see the face of suffering; we shall see only the face of Light and Delight. This will be our determination. But if you ask, “Why should suffering exist at all?” then I wish to say that you call it suffering, but God does not call it suffering. He takes it as an experience, and when we become one with His Will, we also will take it as an experience. Right now we are not one with His Will, so suffering is suffering and joy is joy. We are separated from God by our limited mind. But if we remain in the wave of the cosmic Will, then we shall see that everything is an experience helping us to realise the Absolute.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What should be the course and what is the merit of sex in human development?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What should be the course and what is the merit of sex in human development?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The medical world will have its view, and the religious leaders will have their views, and each individual will have his own view. But from the spiritual point of view, I can say that when one is on the verge of realisation, or when one has realised God and one remains always in transcendental Delight, sex-life does not exist. Sex and immortal Delight can never go together. Sex is physical pleasure, and there is a great difference between earthly pleasure and divine Delight. Of course, from the seeker who is learning the ABCs of spirituality or who has just completed his primary course, we cannot expect total celibacy. But for one who is about to be inundated with infinite Bliss and Light, sex is just like eating clay. Children often eat clay, but when they get older, they have no desire for it.</p>
<p>The question arises, how can a seeker solve this problem? The answer is to solve it gradually. If you drink five cups of tea daily, then try to drink only four for a few weeks. Then make it three, and after a few weeks make it two, then gradually one. If you try to stop drinking tea overnight, it will tell on your health. The best thing is to go slowly and steadily in the process of spiritual growth. One knows how often he indulges in vital life. Gradually, he should try to curb his vital movements, because his ultimate goal is to drink Nectar, immortal Bliss. Slowly and steadily he has to march towards the Goal.</p>
<p>So a seeker must know where he stands. If he aims at the highest Goal, then a day will dawn when he will have to give up sex-life altogether. If he wants to be satisfied with an iota of Peace, Light and Bliss, he can enjoy the romantic life; he can smoke and he can drink. But if he wants the Highest, and he is determined never to stop in his upward journey unless and until he has reached the Highest, then in the process of his spiritual evolution there will come a time when he can determine the value of the pleasure-life and the blissful life. Then he will give up the pleasure-life altogether, because he knows that pleasure is followed by frustration, and frustration is followed by destruction. A child may eat mud and sand, but when he grows up he eats only nourishing food. In the spiritual life also, for the beginner it is permissible within limits to have a lower vital life. But there comes a time when it is not only objectionable but also unnecessary. The wiser we become, the easier it is for us to know what is necessary and what is unnecessary. A wise man will do only those things that are necessary, whereas a fool will go on and on doing all kinds of unnecessary things all his life.</p>
<p>Whether or not one conquers the lower vital life depends entirely on whether the individual wants the Highest. If he wants the Highest, then a day will come when he will have to go far beyond the meshes of ignorance into the realm of Light and Delight. If he wants to be satisfied with his lower vital life, and at the same time meditate for five or ten minutes a day, then I wish to say that for him the lower vital life is permissible. His goal is not the ultimate Goal. But a sincerely aspiring seeker will one day give up the life of desire. He knows that desire is binding him all the time. That is why he has launched onto the path of aspiration, where he will get the sense of constant freedom. The higher he goes, the clearer becomes his vision that the life of pleasure and the life of Bliss can never go together. Each individual will deal with his own vital life according to his aspiration. Each individual will see how far he wants to go, and how much he has developed in his inner life. On the strength of his own inner development he can and will solve this problem.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What words of advice do you have for a person who is trying to keep ego and pride in their proper places? In other words, how can one develop humility and wipe out the ego?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What words of advice do you have for a person who is trying to keep ego and pride in their proper places? In other words, how can one develop humility and wipe out the ego?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two types of ego. One ego says, “My and mine: there the reality ends.” The other ego says, “God is mine. The Almighty, the Infinite, is mine. How can I bind myself to an individual or to a family or to anything limited and limiting?” That ego does not bind; it frees. That is divine ego, or you can say that it is not ego, but it is the feeling of inseparable oneness with the Infinite Vast. An ordinary human being is satisfied with an individual or with the members of his family, but a spiritual seeker will be satisfied only with Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. When the divine ego comes forward, each aspirant can say, “I am God’s chosen child. How can I do this? How can I be so mean, how can I be so selfish, so undivine?” This feeling will always save us.</p>
<p>The Christ said, “I and my Father are one.” An ordinary human being might say, “How could he say such an egotistical thing?” But a seeker will say, “He is absolutely right. He has realised the Highest, and it is on the strength of his realisation that he says this.” An ordinary, unaspiring human being who is in the world of desire may feel that God does not exist, or he will say, “God is God. He is in Heaven and I am here on earth. I have no connection with Him.” But a seeker knows, “If God exists, then no matter where He is, there I, too, exist, There is no separation Who brought me into the world? God. Who is the Source? God.”</p>
<p>Each time the undivine ego comes forward, we shall have to spread our wings and fly in the firmament of divine Reality. Then the undivine ego will die. The ego that binds us will disappear, and in its place will be the ego that gives us the feeling of universal Oneness. Then we will feel our reality; we will feel our life-breath in each individual. We will not be bound at all.</p>
<p>Now we come to humility and other divine qualities. In the spiritual life we have to know that three things are of paramount importance. First is simplicity. If we do not have a simple life, we cannot knock at God’s Door, and God will not be able to knock at our door. Then comes sincerity. If we have no sincerity, then it is useless for us to enter into the spiritual life. In the ordinary human life, we may be insincere and still become successful. But this success is only partial and temporary. In our spiritual life we do not get even an iota of success if we are not sincere. Only a really sincere seeker can make true spiritual progress. But he knows that simplicity is not enough and sincerity is not enough. Something else is needed, and that is humility.</p>
<p>This humility is not humiliation. We will not allow someone to lord it over us, to kick us all the time. No, this humility is our soul’s light spreading everywhere. God is the Highest, the Omniscient, the Omnipotent. But He descended; He condescended to enter into each human being. This is what our soul’s light tells us. When an ordinary human being gets thousands of dollars, he is bloated with pride. He will not talk to poorer people; it is beneath his dignity to mix with them. He feels that he has become very great. But look at the divinity of a tree. When a tree is not bearing fruit, it stands upright. But when it is loaded with fruits and flowers, when it has the real treasure, the real wealth, the tree bends down to offer us the fruits. When the tree is in full possession of its divinely given wealth, it bends down to offer it to humanity.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, the higher we go, the greater is our self-offering. This self-offering is not an act of self-aggrandisement. We offer ourselves because we feel that only by offering what we have and what we are can we become totally one with the rest of the world. There is no feeling of superiority; there is only a feeling of oneness. And this feeling of oneness comes from the soul. When the soul’s light is offered to the world at large, it takes the form of humility. If a child wants something from his mother, she has to bend down to give it to him because she is so tall and he is so small. The seekers of the infinite Truth have to bend down to offer something to unaspiring, sleeping humanity. This humility of ours comes only from sincere aspiration. In sincere aspiration we see Light and grow into Light. And this Light has to be spread. It can be spread only when we have a genuine concern for the manifestation of God on earth. If the fruits remain on the topmost bough of the tree, they will be inaccessible and no one will be able to eat them. But when we see that the tree itself is bending down and eagerly offering its wealth, then we appreciate the tree’s kindness and generosity. So when we have peace, light and bliss, we have to offer them. The act of self-offering is a manifestation of God; and self-offering is achieved through humility, which is the light of the soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you comment on the different methods of attaining liberation corresponding to the different ages?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you comment on the different methods of attaining liberation corresponding to the different ages?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us deal only with the present. You did not realise God in the past, so the past cannot help you. It is in the present or the future that you will achieve liberation. In your present state of evolution, what you need most is love and devotion. There are three principal paths to God-realisation: <em>Karma</em> yoga, the path of selfless action; <em>Jnana</em> yoga, the path of knowledge and wisdom; and <em>Bhakti</em> yoga, the path of love, devotion and surrender. In the present day, divine love is the quickest way to realise the Highest. The mind has played its role, especially in the West. The West has offered many mental giants to the world, but right now this country needs more of the wealth of the heart, which is love. And deep inside the heart is the soul.</p>
<p>The soul is everywhere within us, true. The light and consciousness of the soul permeates our whole body, from the soles of our feet to the crown of our head. But we know that there is a particular place where the soul actually abides: in the inmost recesses of the heart. In a person’s house there are many rooms, but the owner stays in one of these rooms most of the time. Although the entire house belongs to him, and is permeated with his consciousness, there is one room where he spends most of his time. If you want to be in closest contact with the owner, you have to stay in that particular room. The owner of our being is the soul. If we want a free access to the soul, we have to focus our attention, our concentration, on the heart. When we can receive the soul’s light, we can make the fastest progress.</p>
<p>All paths are equally important; no path is inferior. But we know the value of time. In the Western world we are always concerned with time and speed. There was a time when we had to be satisfied with the speed of a horse. Now we see how fast the jet plane goes! From here we can go to India by various means of transportation. But if we go by plane, we will reach India the fastest. Since in the outer life we are giving so much value to speed, it is also absolutely necessary for us to give the same value to speed in the inner life. If one is in a position to run the fastest, why should he crawl or just walk? If he has the capacity, let him run the fastest and reach the Goal as soon as possible.</p>
<p>God is already seated on His Throne inside the very depths of our hearts. If we I want to make the fastest progress, if we want to reach the Highest as soon as possible, then the path of the heart, which is all love, devotion and surrender, must be followed. So here in the West, let us not think of the past, of what the Vedic Seers did, or of what other spiritual giants did. Let us think of ourselves and what we can do for our own perfection and for the perfection of the world. We have to know that unless and until humanity is perfected inwardly, we can never perfect the world-atmosphere. In order to be perfect, we have to enter into the very depths of our heart so that the light of our soul can come to the fore. We have to bask in the sunshine of our soul and then radiate that light, offering it for the illumination of the world-consciousness. So at the present stage, I wish to recommend to each seeker to follow the path of the heart — that is, love — sincere love, divine love, unconditional love.</p>
<p>Ordinary human love is always full of expectation. With our human love we feel, “I have done so much for that person; certainly he will also do something for me.” But in divine love there is no expectation, because we know that God has already given us all the good qualities that we need. If we are meditating, where has this capacity come from? It has come directly from God. So many people here on earth are not meditating, but we are meditating. Our meditation is a gift of God’s Grace. Long before we expected to meditate, long before we were aware of spirituality or of the Reality, He gave us aspiration, He gave us light, He gave us sincerity. He has given us everything; He has done everything unconditionally for us. Now let us do the same for Him. Let us pray, let us meditate, let us do everything to increase our aspiration. And, at the same time, let us wait for God to give us realisation at His choice Hour. This we can do only if we follow the path of the heart.</p>
<p>In the spiritual heart there is no demand. A mother gives and gives and gives to her child, simply because she loves him. If she is lucky enough, when the child grows up he will give to her in return. But very often he does not return her offering. He has his own life. But as the mother gives, she is blessed by God. The light, affection and other divine qualities which she gives to her child are blessings in themselves. In the spiritual life we must love God in this way, without expectation. We shall pray and meditate, and He who has given us the power to pray and meditate will undoubtedly give us His most delicious fruit, realisation, in His own time.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, in the present-day world the path of the heart is the fastest, and not the path of the mind or of the intellect. Those days are gone, they have played their role. Now, if we want to run the fastest in this world, then the path of the heart is the path to follow.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is very true. These are past incarnations. You are seeing his past incarnation, and he is seeing yours. But it is not at all advisable for you to do this right now. If you are seeing your past incarnations, there may be tremendous difficulties. When you enter into the past incarnation, you may see some undivine forces. Even in this incarnation, as long as you have not realised God, there are many undivine forces inside you. When you meditate on each other this way, the undivine forces of one can enter into the other. It is very risky.</p>
<p>We have to keep progressing and progressing. If we dig into our past, until three or four incarnations ago, we will see that we were all animals, although in the human body. Even in our first human incarnation here on earth, we were animals in human form. There are many, many people on earth who are absolutely animals, although they have human bodies. In Jamaica, in Canada, in Puerto Rico, in New York, when I walk along the street, I see people who have just entered the human kingdom. What can you expect from them? Their consciousness is more animal than human. If you look into your own past incarnations, you may consciously be bringing forward your animal consciousness. If you were a saint in a previous incarnation, then naturally the saint consciousness will come forward. But if you were a saint before, then in this incarnation you will be a greater saint. In this incarnation, if you become a saint, next incarnation you will be greater, and in the next, you will be still greater. The past, I always say, is dust. Has the past given you realisation? No. It did not give you realisation. If it had given you realisation then you would not be here struggling. From the past you did not get what you actually want now.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does it help to know what kind of animal you were, if you were a good animal like a bird or a reindeer?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does it help to know what kind of animal you were, if you were a good animal like a bird or a reindeer?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Suppose you were a deer. Now, there are some advantages and some disadvantages. The advantage is that if you were a deer in your last animal incarnation, then you will think of your speed. You will see that you ran very fast. You will think, “Even in the animal incarnation I ran so fast, and at that time I did not have the advanced soul which I now have.” The soul is the same, but it is progressing and advancing. There is a soul in this sofa, a soul in this carpet, and a soul in me. But the soul is much more manifest inside me. If you know that in your past incarnation you ran really fast, you will say, “Let me now continue to run with utmost speed.”</p>
<p>Once you know something, it becomes very easy to learn again. If you ran fast in your past incarnation, then in this incarnation also you can run very fast. This is the advantage. I achieved God-realisation in a previous incarnation, so in this incarnation it took me only a year or so to realise God after I consciously began praying and meditating. If you know something that you can utilise positively, you will get inspiration. But again, if you know that in a past incarnation you were something very great, while in this incarnation you are nothing, then you will curse God. You will curse yourself. You will say; “I was so great. If I was so great, how is it that in this incarnation I am so useless?” Then you will feel miserable. You will think, “I have done something wrong and I do not even know it,” or “God is harsh. God does not care for me.” It is very easy to blame God.</p>
<p>On very rare occasions do people properly utilise the knowledge of their past incarnations. Unfortunately, what happens is this. If a past incarnation is not encouraging, if in my past incarnation I did not run fast at all in the spiritual life, if I was an ordinary person, or let us say, even a thief or something bad, then I will become frustrated. If we do something wrong in this incarnation, it takes us a few months to come out of despair and frustration. We say, “I was so bad. I did this, I did that. Now how am I going to become pure? How am I going to be God’s instrument? How am I going to realise God?” If you did something seriously wrong four years ago, it may still bother you.</p>
<p>The best thing is to forget about it if you have done something wrong. Just say, “I put my finger into fire and burned it. Now I do not want to do it again.” My advice is always to forget about the past. My feeling is — the past is dust. Only on rare occasions can you think of the past as an encouragement. If you know that you have to run 100 metres, and you ran 10 metres in your past incarnations, then you only have to cover 90 metres more. Now you have help; you are under the guidance of a spiritual Master who can inspire you and guide you. You know that you have the capacity to run. Now if somebody is guiding you, you will be able to cover the other 90 metres much faster.</p>
<p>If you do not get inspiration from your past, it is always a disadvantage to know that you were very great or very bad. If you were great in one field, and now God wants to make you great in some other line, you might misunderstand Him. And if He does not want to make you great, if you are ordinary, you will feel that He is really useless and cruel. It is better just to start from the beginning like a child. You may not remember where your starting point was, but you do know where the goal is.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is up to me. I can be fully aware if I want to be. But I do not always want to be aware. With my human eyes I can look at something and see it, but I do not have to absorb it. I am looking at my picture now, but I do not want to see whether I have a garland on. My inner beings can do that job. I have faith in them. They are very good instruments. My physical body may enjoy relaxation by spending time talking to you, but the spiritual inside me has no rest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are learning something, it is so difficult to do it properly. But when you become an expert, it is impossible to do it the wrong way. In the spiritual life also, before you become an expert you make many, many mistakes during meditation. But when you really become an expert, even if you try to make a mistake, it is not possible. The correct method will be something normal and natural for you. Right now God-realisation is an abnormality, an unnatural thing for you people. But, the moment you realise God, you will see that there is nothing so normal, so natural, so close as that.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can you tell us something about the predominant qualities of America?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can you tell us something about the predominant qualities of America?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In America, the dynamic vital, but not the aggressive vital, is of paramount importance. There are various places in the world where the aggressive vital is more to the fore, but here in America I see the dynamic vital most of the time. Again, you have to know that we are still imperfect. The vital is like a knife. With a knife we can cut a fruit and share it with others. Let us say that that sharing is done by the dynamic vital. With the same knife, if I stab you, then that is the aggressive vital. The same instrument can be dynamic or aggressive.</p>
<p>I appreciate America for its dynamism. If you are dynamic, you run towards your goal. If you do not know where the goal is, then you may run from this side to that side, but it is better to move than to remain static. There are many people in India and other parts of the world who are wallowing in the pleasures of idleness. They live in eternal time. They think that one day God will come and stand before them and say, “All right, since you could not think of Me, it is My duty to think of you.” But that is absurd.</p>
<p>Americans are running. They are not sure of the goal, but they are constantly on the move. They go to one side and run into a wall and get hurt. Then they go to another side, and the goal is not there, so they get another blow. But at least they go. If they sit still, worrying that perhaps on this side there is a wall or on that side there is a hole, then they will not make any progress at all. This dynamism is the thing that I deeply appreciate and admire in America.</p>
<p>I have hope for the places where I notice dynamism. But there are places where there is no dynamism, and I have very little hope for their progress. In Europe presently, people still live in the mind. The mind is not a bad thing. The mind can be a very good instrument, later on, but not now. The mind that we are now using is the physical mind, which constantly doubts and suspects. It is limited and full of darkness. But there are other higher minds — the illumined mind, the intuitive mind, the overmind. We are not using these higher minds right now. First we have to live in the heart and bring the soul’s light into the mind. Europeans are mental people. They find it difficult to appreciate the heart’s qualities. Some, however, are trying hard to open their hearts.</p>
<p>Another good quality of Americans is that they appreciate everything, like children. A child appreciates everything without discrimination. God is a divine Child. He appreciates everything. When His son or daughter gives Him anything, He is so highly pleased, even if it is just a grain of sand. He says, “If you had wanted to keep that grain of sand for yourself, you could have, but you gave it to Me.” Americans are like that, too. America has a big heart. When it is a question of the heart’s magnanimity, America is very advanced. America makes mistakes, but who does not mistakes? Mistakes we all make, but America does not know how to hesitate. The best quality in the spiritual life is not to hesitate once you know your goal. Even if you do not know your goal, run! Then God’s Compassion will dawn because you are running, because you are on the move. Once you feel that your goal is not where you are, your goal is somewhere ahead of you, then you have to run.</p>
<p>America has the willingness to see, and to accept or reject, rather than to first hesitate. There are many parts of the world that hesitate and hesitate and hesitate, until it becomes too late. In any race if you hesitate and hesitate before you start to move, in the meantime, your opponents just win the race!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can you speak about the connection between the great spiritual Masters?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can you speak about the connection between the great spiritual Masters?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sri Krishna, the Buddha, and Jesus Christ are the same, only in different forms and different names. You cannot separate Krishna from the Christ or the Buddha from the Christ. They are all one. Sri Ramakrishna, a great spiritual Master, the Master of Swami Vivekananda, said, “He who is Rama, He who is Krishna, in one form is Sri Ramakrishna.” Here in the West we have the tendency to say that Christ is the only saviour. But the only saviour is God, the Supreme, Christ’s Father, let us say. When Christ said, “I and my Father are one,” he was absolutely right. He claimed this on the strength of his highest realisation. Others can also claim this on the strength of their own realisation. It is up to you to believe them or not. You can discredit their realisation but they will not be the loser. They have eaten the mango and they know how delicious it is. If you say, “No, you have not eaten it,” that is fine. But since they have eaten it, they are satisfied. Jesus is the Son, the Liberator, the Saviour. But we have to know that he, Krishna, Buddha and other great Masters are all one.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Most of the spiritual Masters have been recognised, accepted and worshipped only after they have left the physical body. But now, the world has progressed. In the modern world, aspiration has increased. On the one hand, you see the Vietnam war, but on the other hand, the divine Light is being received by many. There are now quite a few spiritual Masters on earth. These Masters are not all God-realised, but they are trying in their own way to help mankind. If a so-called spiritual Master is not God-realised, he is like a teacher who has not received his university degree. He is in a position to teach a kindergarten student. From these Masters, you can learn Hatha yoga and a little philosophy. By doing Hatha yoga you will not realise God, but if you practise a few Hatha yoga postures it does help to keep better health and to have a little relaxation.</p>
<p>You cannot expect to get your Master’s degree in kindergarten, but you can learn something there. But to say that kindergarten or primary school lessons are enough, is foolishness. You can take Hatha yoga all your life without making an iota of spiritual progress. If you go to India, many Indian village people will be able to do all the most difficult exercises in a twinkling of an eye. But the life they lead is an animal life. Hatha yoga can help you physically if you want to do it for ten or fifteen minutes. But a spiritual aspirant need not spend an hour or two. You will be wasting your precious time.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, I wish to say that the world, especially the Western world, is crying for light. Very often people ask me on the radio and on television, “How is it that the Christians in the Western world are moving away from the Church and coming to Indian spiritual Masters? What is wrong with Western religion?” I say that nothing is wrong. But the seekers who come to spiritual Masters have looked for something in the Church which they did not find. That is why they are now looking to the Indian Masters to see if they can get it there. What is that thing? It is inspiration, and inside inspiration is aspiration. True Indian spiritual Masters embody inspiration and aspiration. The Western aspirants can see the difference between the sermon of the priest and the life he leads. There is often a yawning gulf between what he says and what he is.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I was speaking at Yale University. A professor of philosophy was sitting beside a student of his. During the question and answer period, the professor asked me, “How is it that when I invite questions and answer them, my students don’t pay any attention? They smoke and put their feet on the benches and all kinds of things. How is it that they are showing you such respect? You have given a talk on philosophy and now they are full of appreciation and admiration. I also teach philosophy. But they are looking at you with rapt attention.” So the student immediately stood up and answered the question for me. “Sir, there is a slight difference between you and this spiritual man,” he said. “That’s why we are behaving in a different way.” The professor says the same thing as the spiritual man. Perhaps he says it in a more mental and convincing way, in an academic way, but people can see the difference. When a sincere aspirant speaks about spirituality people will run to listen to him. But if you do not follow a spiritual life, nobody is going to be inspired by your spiritual philosophy. Everybody has a heart to feel whether there is any sincerity behind your words.</p>
