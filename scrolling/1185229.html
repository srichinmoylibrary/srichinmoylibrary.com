<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has a living Breath and the name of that Breath is man. Man has a living Goal and the name of the Goal is God. In God is man’s satisfaction, achievement and fulfilment. Through man is God’s Satisfaction, Achievement and Fulfilment. God needs man just as man needs God. God needs man to manifest Himself totally on earth. Man needs God to realise the Highest. We are His limbs: He is our body.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two kinds of time. One is earthbound time and the other is eternal Time. The earthbound time is what we have created, but eternal Time cannot be created. It is within us and without us. When we live in eternal Time, we cannot separate one second from another second. When we live in earthbound time, we know that it is one o’clock and then it is one minute past one. They are two separate minutes. But in eternal Time, we cannot separate the minutes or hours. In eternal Time one o’clock, two o’clock, three and four o’clock are all together. This is the difference between eternal Time and earthbound time. We can see the present, past and future perfectly housed in eternal Time, and this eternal Time we can easily possess when we are Self-realised.</p>
<p>Time for us right now means earthbound time, limited time. Time and life came into existence together and were very close to one another. But unfortunately, when life started playing its role on earth, it became short-lived; and time, being a friend of life, also became short-lived. They are both short-lived, but they know that their Source is eternal Life and eternal Time.</p>
<p>Let us take an ordinary second. This second you can use either for meditation or for gossip. This second you can use either for prayer or to cherish impure and undivine thoughts. When you consciously use time to do something divine, you are entering into divine Time which means timeless Time. When you are consciously thinking of something divine, immediately eternal Life comes and shakes hands with you. Each moment you want to go upward through aspiration, the eternal Time also becomes your friend.</p>
<p>If you pray and meditate, if you play your part in the spiritual life, then even if realisation still remains a far cry, you should not be impatient or worried. At that time, you have to know that God’s Hour has not yet struck. You have played your part, or rather, God has played His Part in and through you, but the hour of realisation has not yet struck.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The world is in the process of evolution, so the present state is the most evolved. Then, after a few centuries, the world will be more evolved. Four thousand or five thousand years ago our ancestors might have done a few extraordinary things. But when it is a matter of general achievement or evolution, we are much more developed. Five thousand years ago, our forefathers made the sacrifices we read about in the <em>Mahabharata</em>, but the vision of the general masses was not as broad as it is now. What is worse, in those days they did not involve themselves with morality. Now we have the power to destroy; we have the atom bomb, the hydrogen bomb. At the same time, we have the United Nations for peace. We are making progress on both sides of the coin with both constructive and destructive inventions and developments, but we are trying.</p>
<p>You have to know that we don’t go backwards. In spiritual evolution, I am evolving, you are evolving, everybody is evolving. In the process of evolution we are all proceeding towards the Divine, towards the Ultimate. But this evolution is not like a straight line. Its movement goes in a spiral. So we may think that we are not making any progress, but we are.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to please someone in his own way, he will give you much more for your efforts than if you want to please him in your own way. If you please someone according to your capacity, then he will reward you according to your receptivity. But when you please God in His own way, He will actually give you the receptivity to receive His Light, Peace, Bliss — everything. At that time He will say, “Take Me, I am yours.” However, if you please Him in your own way, then He will please you according to your aspiration, according to the capacity or willingness that you have offered to Him. So there is a great difference between pleasing God in His own way and pleasing Him in your own way.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is better to repeat Aum aloud, not silently. I tell my disciples that the sound should not come from the throat; it should come directly from the heart. The ‘m’ sound should last three times as long as the ‘au’ sound, and you should feel it vibrating inside your heart. Again, let the mantra vibrate all over your body; let the sound permeate your body.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that moment fear entered into your physical and then into your stomach. Now, you have to know that Aum is the name of God. When you chant Aum, please try to feel that you are actually breathing in the Breath of the Supreme, the Infinite. But when you breathe in and chant Aum, it should not be done mechanically; at that time you should not feel that you are doing two different things. While you are breathing in and chanting Aum, the name and form should be coming inside you together. Then there will be no fear; it will be all joy and oneness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In your case, you have impurity in your entire being, in your entire life. But if you can overcome fear, doubt and jealousy, then you won’t have to go to purity; purity will come and touch your feet. You may see that others are pulling the light and that the light is pulling others, so you may become jealous of their achievements. But if you want the light to fulfil you, then you must overcome your jealousy, doubt and fear. My constant blessing is there. However, if you cherish these undivine forces unconsciously, not to speak of consciously, then realisation will remain a far cry. If you really want to realise the highest Absolute, you have to know that you and everybody else are part and parcel of the same Truth. So how can you be jealous of anybody? God is omnipotent and He is in you, with you and for you. So how can you be afraid of anybody? And God is omnipresent; He is all-pervading, within you and around you. So how can you cherish doubt, even unconsciously?</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Real Immortality is consciousness. Consciousness does not die. When we speak of Immortality, we have to feel that it is the Immortality of consciousness that we are speaking of. This consciousness, which we think of as already immortal, will be enlarged and brought forward only with the transformation of our human nature. Now we are living in an unconscious world, but a day will come when we will all be conscious, divinised and transformed. Immortality means that which will last forever, and what lasts is our consciousness, our aspiring consciousness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> After achieving realisation, many people stay on earth. Many spiritual Masters — Sri Krishna, Lord Buddha, Sri Ramakrishna and others — worked for humanity. The Game does not stop after realisation.</p>
<p>Those who attain the highest Truth, Peace, Light and Bliss act from deep within. They act far better than ordinary human beings. A spiritual Master works from deep within and his consciousness is spread all over the world; whereas the ordinary human consciousness is bound to just the members of the family and dear ones.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We use the term ‘transcendental Consciousness'; again, we speak of the ever-transcending transcendental Consciousness. The transcendental Consciousness, <em>Turiya</em>, is the highest, but this transcendental Consciousness is not static. It is also constantly transcending itself. God is infinite, eternal and immortal; but all spiritual Masters know that God is also ever-progressing. God Himself is in the process of evolution. He is making progress, constant progress, in and through everyone in order to establish perfect Perfection on earth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You use the term ‘intelligence’. But in the spiritual world we call it ‘consciousness’ or ‘intuition’. Intelligence can never be infinite. Intelligence comes from the brain; it is in the mind. Whatever is inside the brain, inside the mind, can never be infinite; whereas intuition can be infinite, consciousness can be infinite, and here we find different levels. Although intuition is infinite, there are layers upon layers or degrees of intuition. So when somebody says that he did something through intuition, it doesn’t necessarily mean that he was acting from the same level of intuition as somebody else.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life sex has to be gradually given up. If you want to realise God in this body, sex has no place. Now, you have to know that impure mental associations are as harmful as physical relationships. If the mind enjoys lower vital thoughts, then it is practically the same as having gross physical relations.</p>
<p>At the time of meditation, it is especially important not to indulge in any lower vital thoughts, sex thoughts. It will be infinitely more fatal than when the normal consciousness enjoys lower thoughts because, at the time of meditation, your whole power of concentration is extremely intense. If you think of Divinity, Peace, Light and Bliss, then like an arrow you are entering into God’s divine Kingdom. Similarly, if you think of lower vital things, you enter immediately, with the same intensity, into the lower vital. Then there you are caught.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here on earth you have to know that ignorance is playing its role. If you fight with someone, you do not feel that you are fighting with yourself. You feel that you are fighting with someone else. Why? Because you have lost your feeling of oneness. The moment you feel that he and you are one, only in two different bodies, or that he is part and parcel of your life, you will stop fighting.</p>
<p>The basic problem is our ignorance. Now, what can put an end to our ignorance? It is our conscious aspiration. The more we go up with our aspiration and become one with a higher light, the more we become conscious of our unity. Aspiration will make us feel that we and the rest of the world are one. Then we see that the field of manifestation is like one sea with millions of waves.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you can offer all your actions, good and bad, to God, then the problems that you are seeing all around you will no longer be problems. You will see that they are only experiences that the Inner Pilot is having in and through you. He is the Doer, He is the experiences and, at the same time, He is the Observer. The moment you can surrender the action and the fruit of your action, your part is over. Then you will see that the way you see the truth is not the way that God sees the truth. He sees the truth from a different angle, from a very high plane of Consciousness. When you become one with Him, you will see that each action has a purpose. Now, nothing seems to have a purpose; everything, everyone seems like a mad elephant trampling here and there. But a day will come when if you budge even an inch, you will understand the reason for it. Outwardly, we see that the Game is very painful; but when we are able to enter into the soul, we find that there is a purpose which only the soul can tell us. The heart is convinced that there is a purpose, but what the actual purpose is, only the soul can say.</p>
