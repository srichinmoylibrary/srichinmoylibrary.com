<p>Japan is the land of beauty. This beauty is not something that man has created. It is something that God Himself is, and that God Himself has. What God Himself is, and what God Himself has, in one form is beauty. This beauty is revealing itself through the body, vital, mind, heart and soul of Japan.</p>
<p>When we think of Japan, when we pray for Japan, when we meditate on Japan, we see a very, very special quality of our Lord Supreme. This unique quality is His self-expression and revelation of His own Infinity in and through His finite, little self. God is infinite. He is vaster than the vastest. Far beyond our imagination is His vastness. But again, He can reveal Himself through the finite, smaller than the smallest. This unique quality and capacity of His can be found only in Japan. It is not nature's beauty in Japan — though that has its own value — but it is the inner beauty, inner softness, sweetness, tenderness, purity and humility of Japan that have pleased God the Creator most powerfully.Inner beauty is your birthright. This inner beauty God, our Beloved Supreme, cherishes. He is fond of your inner beauty and proud of your outer beauty. Your inner beauty is your heart's sleepless cry for God. Your outer beauty is your willingness and eagerness to serve God the creation.</p>
<p>In the East, the sun rises in Japan. The inner sun will also rise here sooner than the soonest to illumine the East, to illumine the West and to illumine the whole world.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Meeting With Kazuki Furui: Deputy Mayor of Nagasaki</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Meeting With Kazuki Furui: Deputy Mayor of Nagasaki" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Deputy Mayor Furui</em>: Welcome to Nagasaki. I hear you are giving a concert for peace this evening.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am very happy and deeply honoured to be here. Nagasaki is a most significant place, not only in Japan, but also in the whole world. The message of peace and oneness the world has come to know from Nagasaki's most sorrowful experience.Destruction is an old experience; illumination is a new experience. Now humanity is being illumined. This illumination that we are having, and that the whole world is going to have, is called oneness and peace.</p>
<p><em>Deputy Mayor Furui:</em> During your visit, are you travelling to other cities?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, tomorrow we are visiting Hiroshima, and then the next day, Kyoto.</p>
<p><em>Deputy Mayor Furui:</em> In your Peace Concert, will you be performing by yourself?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I play by myself. I do not speak Japanese, and you do not speak Bengali, my mother tongue. If we use our mother tongues to communicate, we shall not be able to understand each other. But music is a universal language through which we can establish our oneness-feeling. That is why I play music-to have an inner communion with everybody. Outer language is not necessary at that time.</p>
<p><em>Deputy Mayor Furui:</em> I understand that our staff helped with public relations for the Peace Concert.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy: Yes.</em> I am so grateful, so grateful to them for their kind help and participation.</p>
<p><em>Deputy Mayor Furui:</em> I hear you are going to see the Governor as well. You have come to Japan many times.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, many times. I have been to Nagasaki three times.</p>
<p><em>Deputy Mayor Furui:</em> Is that so! When you conduct Peace Meditations at the United Nations, do you give instructions?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not give any instructions. I pray and meditate, and those who come do the same. We pray and meditate together, each in our own way. Our sincere and soulful prayers we share, but no outer instructions are given. I feel that the silent, inner communication is far better than using words. When we talk, we use the mind. When we use words, our mind gets the opportunity to create confusion. But when we use the heart to pray together, then we feel our oneness, and oneness is what we need. The mind divides. We do not want division; we want oneness. Oneness we get only from the silence of our hearts.</p>
<p><em>Deputy Mayor Furui:</em> I am praying from the depths of my heart for the success of the concert you are giving tonight.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to thank you from the very depths of my heart for your kind words and for your prayers.</p>

 <p>
JSBH 4-8. On 25 September 1987 Sri Chinmoy met with Isamu Takada, Governor of Nagasaki Prefecture. These are excerpts from their discussion.</p>
<h2><em>Governor Takada:</em> I have heard so much about you. You are the proposer of the Peace Run.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God, out of His Kindness and Compassion, gave me the inspiration. And my students around the world manifested this inspiration, along with thousands of others, as they carried the peace torch around the world in the Peace Run.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Whenever I get the opportunity I travel to offer my prayers for peace.</p>
<p><em>Governor Takada:</em> It is my great pleasure and honour to welcome you to Nagasaki, one of only two cities that suffered from the atomic bomb.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, the places that have suffered the most also have the capacity to offer the most good to the world. Here in Japan are the two places that have suffered the most destruction from the atomic bomb. Now from Hiroshima and Nagasaki oneness is being offered to the world. When something is destroyed, there is a surge of inspiration to rebuild it. Right after the destruction a new hope, a new dawn comes. The new dawn is now blossoming in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes when you suffer, you learn to value the highest goal. It is not that suffering is necessary, but sometimes when you suffer, you learn to appreciate and value the highest goal more than otherwise. If you have to climb the Himalayas, then you will truly appreciate their height and value attaining the summit. But if you just take a plane and fly above the Himalayas, you do not get the same intensity. When Hillary and Tenzing climbed, what suffering they had! But from their achievement the world got new determination, new inspiration to do something especially great.</p>
<p>The whole world needs peace. But if one goes through the suffering of war, only then does one truly value the supreme necessity for peace.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Matsumoto:</em> Thank you, thank you! The Emperor of Japan just had an operation and is scheduled to remain hospitalised for one or two weeks. You have come to Japan at the right time. Your visit here will cure the Emperor. Your visit to Japan has brightened up the entire world. Kyoto is the old capital of Japan, a place of tradition. Your visit here in this town means that we are purified by your presence.</p>
<p>I feel that you have come with a heart which is as illumining as the sun. We are welcoming you with utmost gratitude to Kyoto. Today we are having a special reception for the 15th Anniversary of the China/Japan Friendship Treaty. On the occasion of this anniversary, representatives from China, including the leader of the China/Japan Friendship Associat-ion, are arriving. Kyoto is rejoicing because a representative of China has arrived, as well as yourself, a representative of India.</p>

<p>With gratitude, joy and pride I also dedicate the following poem to my dear brother and friend Akishige Matsumoto, who is officiating as the Japanese Chairman of the China/Japan Friendship Association. Quite a few delegates are here tonight. For the last fifteen years friendship-oneness has reigned between these two countries, and today they are observing this oneness.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more precious than when the unfortunate enemies of the past become dearer than the dearest oneness-friends. This is the supreme victory over ignorance-night. Now the Supreme's Light is illumining these two countries with His blessingful Peace on earth.</p>
