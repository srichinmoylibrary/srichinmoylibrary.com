  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why is it that when everything is going well, instead of being happy and really aspiring, I feel restless and uneasy? I almost don&#039;t trust the good things.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why is it that when everything is going well, instead of being happy and really aspiring, I feel restless and uneasy? I almost don&#039;t trust the good things." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My dearest son, you have to believe in the Supreme's Grace and Compassion. Suppose I am the goal, which I am not. If you come to me from your place without any effort because I have offered you my care and you can go at top speed, then you will feel that you have done nothing. You have exerted no personal effort, so you will not be happy. But if you first cut off your legs and your arms, and then you come to me, you will say, "In spite of this handicap I have reached the goal." Then you will be happy in your own way.</p>
<p>But ours is the sunlit path. I have made a shortcut for you people. The difficulty is that when the Grace operates in and through you, you don't realise it. Sometimes Grace does not care for your personal effort. If someone is pleased with you, he may give you something that you want immediately, without your having to ask for it at all. Let us say that you are thirsty and I have water. The natural thing is for you to come to me for the water, but I can also come to you with the water and give it to you. Sri Ramakrishna used to say, "If you are thirsty, then you have to go to the pond; the pond won't come to you." This is one theory. But mine is the theory of the mother and the child. If a child is hungry, then the mother will come running from wherever she is to feed the child. You are unhappy because you feel that you have done nothing to deserve what you are getting. But you <em>have</em> done something in the inner world; otherwise my compassion and the Supreme's Compassion would not have come towards you.</p>
<p>When you are happy, the hostile forces come and say, "What have you done to de serve it?" But I assure you, in the inner world you have done something. You have aspired, let us say unconsciously, but the hostile forces do not want to allow you to maintain your happiness. By hook or by crook they will try to destroy it. The mind will supply you with all kinds of wrong ideas. When Grace operates, it operates unconditionally, true. But in the inner world you have also done something to please the Supreme, and that is why the Supreme has granted you this happiness. At that time try to be grateful; do not take it as an illusion. When Grace flows, you do not have to think about your personal effort; you do not have to prove how hard you have worked. If there is a shortcut, why have you to go in a roundabout way to the goal? It is unnecessary. So when you are happy, be grateful to the Supreme and feel also that this happiness is not something undeserved.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are in the country, when you look at a tree, when you look at the flowers and blossoms and foliage, you get joy, tremendous joy. But when you come back to the city, you do not get any joy. First of all, you have to know that the country is all nature. There, everything tries to be pure, outwardly purer than in the city. In the city there are all kinds of pollution. Air pollution, water pollution and all kinds of unfortunate things you hear about in the city, whereas the country is not like that. There nature is welcoming your aspiration. The city does not welcome your aspiration. The city consciousness right now is trying to possess you, to possess others, to possess everything. The country consciousness is different. The country wants only to offer what it has. It does not want to possess you. That is why you get more joy from the country than from the city.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there any way to prevent bad thoughts from attacking us when we want to send happiness to someone else?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there any way to prevent bad thoughts from attacking us when we want to send happiness to someone else?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, you have to know to whom you are offering good thoughts. It is true that you should offer good thoughts to everyone in a general way. Early in the morning or in the evening you can offer your divine love to the world at large in your silent meditation. When you enter into the spiritual life, you should offer divine love to everyone, not just to a particular individual. It should not be directed towards one person in order to conquer him.</p>
<p>Sometimes you may offer love to an individual with the idea that it is divine love, but you have no idea whether you are offering divine love or just vital and emotional love. If it is undivine love, then the situation becomes worse. Your undivine love will fight with his undivine love. And even if it is divine love that you are offering, perhaps that particular individual does not want or need or care for your love. So he is the wrong person for you to concentrate on. It will be a serious mistake for you to offer your love to him, because he may not want your divine love at this moment. It is like asking someone who is fast asleep to get up. He will say, "Leave me alone. It is time for me to sleep, and I will sleep as long as I want to. I do not want you."</p>
<p>If you feel that somebody is offering you undivine love and that you have to offer divine love in order to conquer him, then that is also a mistake. Offer your divine love to the Supreme in everybody. When you offer it to an individual, you will have problems, because it is like asking someone to do something untimely. You will give something and you will expect something in return. But if you expect something in return, you will be frustrated. So the best thing right now is to offer divine love to everybody.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it true that for everything positive there is something negative?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it true that for everything positive there is something negative?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why do we have to take everything as positive and negative? We can take them as counterparts. Everything has different forms, shapes or consciousness on different planes, but we do not have to call them positive and negative. Only we see that fulfilment is coming through them in different ways. The One is becoming many; it is enjoying itself in infinite forms. In anything that has come from the One and is trying to complete the One in a very high, spiritual, illumined way, there will be two aspects of the Reality: the unmanifested aspect and the revealed and manifested aspect. The one that we can see is the reality being manifested, and the one that we cannot see is the unmanifested reality.</p>
<p>We can say that in some cases the one that comes out for manifestation is a negative, hostile aspect, and the one that does not come out is divine. But both things are really only one reality that is fulfilling itself in different ways. The reality that is coming forward we can call night, and the reality that is remaining behind we can call day, but they are both part and parcel of the selfsame reality. We call them positive and negative when we deal with separativity, but actually the so-called night and the so-called day both exist inside each other.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part VI</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part VI" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Doubt and identification</h2>

<p>We are all wise people. Now let us properly exercise our wisdom. We have to know what we are getting from doubt. From doubt we are getting nothing; we are only kicking ourselves. If somebody has done something great, then with our doubt we try to destroy him. Just because we are wanting in oneness, we doubt him. In the outer world we have not reached the goal that he has reached, but in the inner world we have the capacity to identify ourselves with him. The moment we identify ourselves, we feel that it is we who have reached that goal. The same is also true in the inner world. There also we can identify with others' achievements.</p>
<p>If we have achieved something in the outer world, others can see what we have done, but they doubt it. Why? They doubt it because they are also lacking in oneness. In the inner world they also have the strength and capacity to identify themselves with others, but right now, outwardly they are doubting and inwardly they are doubting. Everyone is doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Now let us look from the point of view of God. Let us try to enter into God, who is all Love, all Joy, all Peace, all Bliss. He is all divine qualities. By doubting Him, who is the possessor of all divine qualities, do we gain anything? You will say, "Unless and until I have seen God, felt God, why should I not doubt Him? I have not seen Him, I have not felt Him, and I can say that you have not seen Him or felt Him, since you have not been able to show Him to me." But whether you doubt it or not, there are people on earth who have seen God's Light or felt God's Light because of their receptivity, and you also can do the same.</p>
<p>If a child who is in kindergarten doubts the student who is completing his Master's degree, then who is the loser? The one who is getting his Master's degree will still get it. He will complete his course. But the little one who is doubting will not gain anything. If we are wise enough, then we will become totally one with the person who is getting his Master's degree. We can identify with him to such an extent that we can say, "I got my Master's degree."</p>
<p>When one enters into the spiritual life, doubt often comes. But if that person, with his iota of aspiration, identifies with someone who is advanced in the spiritual life, then immediately, on the strength of his oneness with the aspiration of the person who is much more developed, he gets tremendous confidence in his life. He feels that he has an elder brother who can help him and inspire him. A spiritual Master is like an elder brother. He shows the way. He has crossed the ignorance-sea and reached the goal, but he comes back to save his younger brothers.</p>
<p>When we doubt God, we don't gain anything and God does not lose anything. But when we doubt ourselves, when we think that we do not have any divine qualities, we really lose. So I tell you, if you want to doubt, then doubt God; do not doubt yourself. If you have to doubt, then doubt God. God, with His infinite Compassion, will forgive you. But when you start doubting yourself, you become the real loser. All your good qualities you can lose just by doubting yourself. I can doubt God at every second, and He will not lose an iota of His Divinity. But the moment I start doubting myself, if I have even a little love or a little joy, I lose all my capacities and all my possibilities.</p>
<p>So first of all, it is best not to doubt anybody, including God and yourself. But if you are helpless and you have to make a choice, then it is better to doubt God. He will show you Compassion, whereas you will not be able to forgive yourself. If you doubt yourself today, tomorrow you will curse yourself and say, "Why did I doubt?" But poor God will not be angry with you; He will not curse you. Forgiveness is granted by God. So it is always better to doubt God than to doubt oneself.</p>
<p>To the spiritual seekers who have Masters, I say that if they doubt themselves, then they are deliberately insulting the capacity of their Master. They have accepted the spiritual path. Now, why have they accepted their Master? Because they have felt that the Master has the capacity to take care of their spiritual life. In the depth of their hearts they know the capacity of their Master. But if they start doubting themselves after having accepted a real spiritual Master, that means that they are doubting the acceptance or the confidence or the promise that the Master has given them.</p>
<p>When a spiritual Master accepts someone as his disciple, what does it mean? It means that one day, at God's choice Hour, he will take the disciple to God. If you do not have faith in the Master, then who asked you to accept that Master as your own? Just because you felt something and saw something in the Master, you had confidence in him. That is why you accepted him. Once you have accepted him sincerely, the question of self-doubt does not arise, because you are not responsible for your life. You are responsible only to surrender your life. If doubt comes, then surrender it to the Master. If fear comes and tries to become part and parcel of you, if it makes you feel that you are really useless, then offer this fear to the Master.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, I wish to say that the seekers who are following a specific path must not doubt themselves. If they doubt, that means that they are belittling their own inner potentiality and they are deliberately standing in the way of their Master's self-offering. The Master is offering himself totally and unreservedly to the disciples. But if the disciples start doubting themselves, then when the Master comes with all his love and concern, they will reject it.</p>
<p>They will not be able to receive anything. So I tell the seekers that they must not doubt themselves. The moment they doubt themselves, they have to feel that they are deliberately rejecting the offering of the Master.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it permissible sometimes to tell little white lies?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it permissible sometimes to tell little white lies?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Suppose you see a little boy being chased by a grown man who wants to strike him. You see the little boy go and hide somewhere, and then the man comes and asks you if you know where the little boy is. Now, this man is filled with animal anger. He wants to strike the boy; perhaps he will even kill him. What will you do? If you tell a white lie at that time, and say, "No, I don't know where he is," then in God's Eyes you are doing the right thing. Human truth has no value in a case such as this. If you tell the truth, you will be helping the bad man to hurt the boy, who is, perhaps, innocent. Then, if the boy dies, you will be another culprit, and you will have to pay part of the karmic debt.</p>
<p>Here is another example. Suppose today I decide to hold a seven-hour meditation. You have come into the world to realise God. But let us say that your friend is having a party today, and you promised her that you would go. Now, if you tell her that you cannot come to her party because you have to go and meditate, she will be annoyed. But instead, if you tell her that you are not feeling well, you may feel that you have told a lie, so you will be punished according to the law of karma, but for seven hours you will be praying to realise the highest Supreme. If you have the highest and most powerful meditation for even one hour, do you not think that this one hour of meditation will more than nullify the punishment that you would have received? And your friend will not be annoyed if you tell her that you are sick.</p>
<p>Once you have free access to the Supreme, you will see where the law of karma comes from. It comes from a level that is far inferior to the Supreme's Compassion. The law of karma is at one place, but the Supreme's Compassion is at an infinitely higher place, so it can easily nullify the law of karma.</p>
<p>By pleasing the Supreme, you are running the fastest to reach the goal. By pleasing a human being, by going to a party, what are you gaining? If you feel that you have to keep your appointment just because you told her a month ago that you would go, then you are bound by your morality-sincerity. But you also have divinity-sincerity. You have the inner cry to climb the highest and dive the deepest. So which one will you choose? If you choose your friend and keep your promise to her, she will be very happy that you have enjoyed her party, but what about your soul? Will her party be able to raise your consciousness or feed your soul at all? On the contrary, it will lower your consciousness like anything. But if you come to pray and meditate, you will not only raise your own consciousness, but you will be able to raise your friend's consciousness also, by offering her your goodwill during your meditation.</p>
<p>If you do the right thing, eventually you will inspire others to do the right thing. If you are bound by your morality because you promised this and you promised that, then what are you gaining? Your aspiration will give you one thousand dollars' worth of divinity, and perhaps your white lie will give you five cents' worth of punishment. If you get one thousand dollars from one place, can you not afford to lose five cents? And if you pray and meditate sincerely, you will please Somebody who is infinitely superior and who has the capacity not to punish you even this five cents' worth. If you tell the lie and then go to see another friend, or to some other place, then the Supreme will not be responsible for your lie, even if your mind says, "This is more important." But if you are going to a spiritual place, you have to realise that you should sacrifice other activities for this. God will forgive you if you tell a white lie because you want to pray and meditate. These lies are not lies, but wisdom.</p>
<p>So what is more important? Every day you do not get the same spiritual opportunity, whereas you can easily see your friend the following day or at any other time. A seven-hour meditation happens so rarely. If you miss it, you do not know when you will have the opportunity again; whereas in the case of ordinary earthly opportunities, if you miss them today, tomorrow you will get them again. We are here on earth to realise God, not just to keep our promises. God will definitely forgive you if you tell a little white lie so that you can pray to Him for liberation, salvation and realisation.</p>

<h2>Vital demands</h2>

<p>There are several kinds of vital demands. One kind of vital demand exists on the unlit, emotional level. Certain disciples want to lead every kind of undivine, corrupted life and, at the same time, they want my sanction so they can stay in the Centre. If I do not scold or threaten them, then they do not think that I am only tolerating them; they take my silence as my full approval. Then they continue to lead their absolutely unthinkable lower vital life and, at the same time, they say that they are members of the Centre and that they belong to my spiritual family. That kind of lower vital life cannot be combined with spiritual life.</p>
<p>Another type of vital demand is when people try to become very close to me outwardly by hook or by crook. Yet when I give them the opportunity to become close inwardly, they close their heart's door. They only want to be close in their own way. This is the difficulty. If you want to be close to me, I will definitely show you the way. But you say, "No, I don't want to come that way, I want to come this way." You want to come, but you do not want to come by the door that I open for you. Instead of going through the open door as I am asking you to do, you try to go through the closed door.</p>
<p>Some of the disciples are like that almost all the time. They feel that whatever I have asked some other person to do is more important than what I have asked them to do. If I ask them to vacuum the living room, then they will worry about what others will think of them. At the same time, if I ask somebody else to go to England and do something for me, he will not go happily. He will be sorry that I did not give him the chance to vacuum the rug. Meanwhile, the one that is vacuuming will think, "Oh, Guru thinks that I am an idiot. That's why I can't go to England and other parts of the world to spread Guru's Light."</p>
<p>Sweeping the floor or driving me somewhere or going to other parts of the world are all equal if the disciple does the task devotedly. While sweeping, if you do it with devotion, you are getting one hundred out of one hundred. But if you feel that your job is not important, then at that time you also become unimportant. But again, you must not think that the work I give you is really important, and that others' work is unimportant. No, your work is important for you, and the other person's work is important for him. In that way there is no comparison. You will not feel inferior or superior.</p>
<p>Our difficulty is that if someone is doing mental work, then the one who is doing physical work feels miserable, inferior. And the one who is doing mental work thinks, "Oh, Guru always says that the mind is very bad. Perhaps he wants to cheat me a bit, so he's giving this dedicated physical service to somebody else." Look at this tricky mind! Here we see vital demands operating in the mind.</p>
<p>I wish to say to all of you that if I have given you a job on the outer plane, please feel that this particular job is most important for you. And those whom I have not asked to do something, for the time being please feel oneness with those to whom I have given some job. Your very offering of goodwill is most important. If you offer your goodwill, I will give you a hundred out of hundred for your goodwill.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Forces are always loitering around. Once they have conquered one person, they try to go to someone else. Every year after our main celebration in India, how many undivine calamities used to take place! Sometimes even on that very day many sad things took place.</p>
<p>If you know that someone in your spiritual family is doing something wrong, then tell me. The patient should be brought to the doctor as soon as possible. What is spirituality? It is oneness, oneness, oneness. You are afraid to tell me, but when the patient is dead, at that time you will say, "I knew it long ago." A doctor will get the proper opportunity to cure the patient only if he catches the disease right at the beginning. I am your spiritual doctor, but you do not give me the proper chance.</p>
<p>When close disciples leave, how many people actually sympathise and how many people get malicious joy? Most people only shed crocodile tears. If twenty persons really try to bring back the one who has left, then the hostile force that has taken away the disciple will have to surrender. But how many people will pray to the Supreme to bring back that disciple? Again, when I try with my love to bring back disciples who have left, they are afraid of me because they feel that I have some magnetic power.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There they are receptive. Although they are fighting and making war in the vital world, when they feel light they try to receive it. On the physical plane, no matter how much light I give, sometimes it does not work. On the inner plane, they may do the same wrong thing, but they appreciate light and immediately try to accept it. On the lower planes, light is not appreciated at all, because when there is light, people immediately feel that they will be exposed. In the inner plane, the attitude towards light is different. There people surrender to light, whereas here they do not surrender.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unless you fight with them, how can you keep them outside yourself? If you throw your wrong thoughts out of the kitchen, then they will go and hide in another room, and you will relax. But they will not go outside the house, and after a few days they will come and strike you again. It is a wrong theory that they will die. The thoughts will only remain calm and quiet for a while, until their strength increases. The problem is that when a thought remains inside the body, no matter how small it is, it is infinitely stronger than the ones that are outside the body. Forces that come from outside cannot immediately attack you, but when forces come from around the navel, they can create tremendous problems! First you allow them to come inside you. Then they increase their power.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not at all. But we have to know what is meant by ambition. We have to know what kind of ambition we cherish in the physical world. There is ambition like Julius Caesar's ambition: "I came, I saw, I conquered." This is the ambition of desire. There is also ambition in the vital world and in the mental world. But another form of ambition is wanting to be good, wanting to see God in everyone, wanting to serve all human beings because in them is the living presence of God. That kind of ambition we can and should cherish in the spiritual world.</p>
