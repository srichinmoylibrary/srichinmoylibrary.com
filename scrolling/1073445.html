<p>My eagerness is my glorious privilege<br /> To see one step ahead, unlike others.<br /> My eagerness does not expect surprises,<br /> For my Captain has fully convinced me<br /> That He not only knows the Way<br /> But also has already planned everything for me.</p>
<p>From my Captain my eagerness has learned<br /> To see every second as the birth of a new day,<br /> And in it the complete life of a new year<br /> To please Him in His own Way.</p>
<p>My Captain says to me,<br /> "My child, because of your life's eagerness<br /> I am giving you My Eternity's Life.<br /> My child, because of your heart's eagerness<br /> I am giving you My Infinity's Heart.<br /> My child, you are your<br /> Aspiration-spontaneity-eagerness,<br /> And I am My<br /> Satisfaction-Immortality-Fondness."</p>

<p>Captain, my Captain,<br /> My dear, sweet and compassionate Captain,<br /> Fifty-six years ago,<br /> out of Your infinite Bounty,<br /> You sent this soul into the world<br /> To unconditionally love You, serve You<br /> And please You in Your own Way.<br /> You alone know how far I have succeeded.<br /> Captain, my heart's Captain, my life's Captain,<br /> Today, on this most auspicious occasion<br /> In my life,<br /> I am begging You to grant me<br /> A very special Boon.<br /> Do grant me the capacity<br /> To please everybody on earth.<br /> "My stupid child,<br /> I have created this world.<br /> Since I do not have the capacity<br /> To please each and every human being<br /> on earth,<br /> How can I grant you this Boon?<br /> To please each and every human being<br /> Is an impossible task.<br /> I try to please each human being as far as I can.<br /> Then I leave it up to their fate.<br /> "Again, there are human beings<br /> Who are pleasing Me even far beyond<br /> Their own imagination.<br /> For them is My Vision-Eye,<br /> For them is My Compassion-Heart,<br /> For them is My Satisfaction-Divinity.<br /> From today on I am asking you<br /> To please only those who think and feel<br /> That to please Me in you<br /> Is their only duty, earthly and Heavenly.<br /> Do not waste even one moment<br /> Of your precious time on earth<br /> On those whom you have to please,<br /> Whose feet you have to touch at every moment<br /> To catch a glimpse of satisfaction-smile<br /> In their eyes.<br /> "Be brave within!<br /> Be brave without!<br /> This pilgrimage is only for the brave,<br /> Only for the few<br /> Who are supremely chosen instruments<br /> of Mine.<br /> Unfortunately, there are many<br /> Who want from you and from Me<br /> Nothing but attention.<br /> But what they need from you and Me<br /> Is the hunger for aspiration<br /> And the thirst for perfection.<br /> "My child, My Eternity's child,<br /> Your boat is sailing fast, very fast.<br /> Many, many, many more will join your boat<br /> On the way.<br /> And again, on the way,<br /> All those who become tired<br /> Will jump out of the boat on their own.<br /> You have no time to look into ignorance-sea<br /> To watch who is drowning.<br /> Your boat will never come empty.<br /> It will come at its full capacity<br /> And reach the Golden Shore,<br /> My Immortality's Heart-Abode."</p>
