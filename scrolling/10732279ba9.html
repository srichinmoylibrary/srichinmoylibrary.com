<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please try to avoid meat and fish; and, of course, liquor and tobacco are out of the question. All fruits and vegetables, as well as dairy products, are fine. Processed foods may also be eaten as long as they do not interfere with good health. Also, coffee and tea are not good, except for herbal teas. To me, coffee and tea are slow poison. They just take a little longer time to kill you. Of course, each person has some power of resistance, so if it is a very slow poison, if we fight we can win the battle. But we must not squander our power by using it to fight against these slow poisons.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The safest, surest way is to start gradually. A disciple of mine used to drink tea six times a day, so I asked him to drink it five times, then after a month I told him to reduce it to four times. Eventually he stopped completely. Serious things must be done gradually. If he had stopped all at once, he might have suffered from some serious disease. If the body is not strong, any sudden change in its habits can cause a serious attack upon one’s health.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Please tell me if we are in better contact with the Divine when we are fasting, drinking only juice and water. Does fasting help us to realise God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Please tell me if we are in better contact with the Divine when we are fasting, drinking only juice and water. Does fasting help us to realise God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you drink juice you are not fasting. Many people say, “Early in the morning I drink a cup of coffee, and at noon I have a glass of juice, and in the evening only a glass of milk.” This is their idea of fasting. But to me that is not fasting. In true fasting, you can have only pure water and nothing else.</p>
<p>If you decide to fast, you have to know why you are doing it. If you feel that by fasting you will realise God, it is foolishness. The real name of God is Delight and Joy. If your Father is all Joy, will He ask you to torture yourself in order to come to Him? God is the possessor of boundless Joy, and we know that He is also infinitely compassionate. He gave you the body — it is His body — and if you start torturing His body, will He be pleased? Never! If you start fasting for God-realisation, God will say that you are walking on the wrong path.</p>
<p>But fasting can help us reduce weight, cure some of our physical ailments and purify our nerves and mind. Very often we eat unwholesome food, and the poor body needs some rest and purification. Also, when we look at undivine people and things, their vibrations enter into us from the atmosphere and affect our physical body — the skin, the muscles, the nerves. If we want to fast one day a month to purify our system, it is advisable. We need purity to appreciate God’s existence on earth. It is in purity — pure thoughts, pure deeds, pure consciousness — that God abides. Fasting can help us to a great extent in self-purification. And when purity enters into us, we go faster towards our God-realisation. But this is only the first step; fasting alone will not give us God-realisation.</p>
<p>So for purification you can try fasting — drinking only water — once a month. Now, I am only speaking from the spiritual point of view. I know nothing about your physical constitution. If you are strong and healthy you can fast; otherwise it is not advisable. But even if you don’t fast, if you are a sincere seeker you can, once a week, reduce the amount of food you take. This can be done especially on Sundays, when you do not have to be very active. On Sunday most people get up late in the morning, so they can easily forget about breakfast. At lunch time they can say, “Every day I eat. If just today I eat a little less, it will not hurt me at all.” Then in the evening, at dinner, they can say, “At lunch time I did not eat the usual amount, and it did me no harm. I am still quite energetic. Why not do the same now?” So once a week, on Sundays especially, if you can lighten your meals it will help you enormously. And you need not undergo a severe, torturing fast, which real spiritual figures do not recommend.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If fasting really helps us to purify ourselves, then why shouldn’t we fast more often than once or twice a month?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If fasting really helps us to purify ourselves, then why shouldn’t we fast more often than once or twice a month?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fasting from time to time does help purify our body. It gives our body and our subtle nerves a kind of rest. This resting of the nerves gives us a sense of purification, for our subtle nerves play a considerable part in our Self-realisation. But if we fast too often it will just weaken our nerves and body, so instead of helping us in our God-realisation, it will hamper our inner progress.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a short story. Once a Guru’s disciple went to the Lord Buddha. The Buddha asked him, “Could you please tell me what your Guru teaches with regard to God-realisation?”</p>
<p>The disciple said, “What my Guru has told me is very simple. My Guru says that when you walk somewhere you should close your eyes. Then you won’t see any beautiful women, who will distract your mind and keep you from thinking about God. And you must cover your ears.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“So that you will not hear any distracting sounds. You will not hear people quarrelling or gossipping. Also, you must keep your mouth closed. If you stop speaking, then you will not tell lies.”</p>
<p>The Lord Buddha said, “In that case, all those who are blind, deaf and dumb must already have realised God. Let us go and touch their feet, since they are all realised souls.”</p>
<p>The Buddha taught us the middle path, the path of moderation. He tried the extreme path of fasting and extreme austerity, but found it was not satisfactory. If we starve our organs, our eyes, nose, ears and mouth, do you think we are going toward God? No! Everything should be moderate. We should use each thing for a divine purpose, for a divine cause.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are upset or even if you are hungry or thirsty, it is natural that you will not be able to meditate well. That is why we need perfection of the physical also. The body has to be calm and poised. Inside the body, the outer wall, is the soul. The outer temple has to be kept well. The physical has to be taken care of properly in order for good meditation to be possible. Kalidasa’s great epic, <em>Kumar Sambhaba</em>, reads, “ <em>Shariramadyam khale</em>....”, “The body is, indeed, the first instrument for spiritual discipline”; therefore, the body cannot be neglected. We must pay attention to the needs of the body, but we must not take all the body’s demands as necessities. If we become the slaves of our bodies, we will never be able to meditate.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to meditate after eating a full meal such as lunch or dinner, you should wait at least two and a half hours. If you have had a very light breakfast, you can meditate after an hour and a half. Before that you will not have a deep, true meditation because your subtle nerves will be very heavy and sluggish. The major cords — <em>Ida, Pingala</em> and <em>Sushumna</em> — find it extremely difficult to allow the cosmic energy to pass through them if the body has just taken a full meal.</p>
<p>If you want to meditate most sincerely, it is always advisable to meditate on an empty stomach. Now, empty does not mean totally empty. If you are pinched with hunger, eat something very light: otherwise, your hunger will disturb your meditation. You can have a cup of juice or water. And after meditation, you should try to wait for at least half an hour before you eat, for it takes this amount of time to assimilate the spiritual forces that you have received.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The <em>soma</em> the Yogis use is the juice of the <em>soma</em> plant. Only the Vedic Seers knew how to use this herb. Here in the West people are experimenting with plants, but these have nothing to do with the <em>soma</em> plants which the ancient Seers used. Also, they do not know how the Seers used them. The process the Westerners are using now is absolutely wrong. The experiences they are having are totally counterfeit. They are ruining some of their subtle nerves. I have students who once upon a time were victims of these drugs. Now that they are living the spiritual life most sincerely, they can easily distinguish between real spiritual experiences and what they were having before.</p>

<h2>Question: How can we use the senses properly?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The proper fulfilment of the senses will come only from God. The body has the senses, but the body is not the owner; the real owner is God. If we can consciously go to the owner, then the owner will tell us how to utilise His possessions properly.</p>
<p>The senses are instruments, God’s instruments. God originally entrusted us with these instruments, but we consciously chose not to ask God how to utilise these senses. Instead of asking God how to use the senses that He had given us, we asked the wrong teacher, ignorance. Or rather, before we actually asked ignorance to teach us, he I came running to us to offer his wisdom. Since we gladly listened to him, we are now paying the penalty.</p>
<p>We could use our eyes, for example, to see the divine beauty in humanity and in all of God’s creation. We could see the divine Light everywhere. But instead, what do we do with our eyes? We use our eyes either to possess the world or to reject it. When we see something that pleases us, immediately we try to possess it. And when we see something that displeases us, we try to reject it. The universe is all Light, but we do not see it. If we had taken the lesson from God on how to use the eyes, nose, ears and other sense organs, He would have given us proper instruction.</p>
<p>There is always time to receive instruction from God: better late than never. Each aspirant can consciously and devotedly pray to God to instruct him from within on how to use the senses. God will be most happy and proud to teach us. But we do not have to ask God about each sense individually. We need only approach God with sincere aspiration, and inside our aspiration He will see what we are crying for.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you say something about self-control in the body?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you say something about self-control in the body?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life self-control is most important, significant and fruitful. No self-control, no self-realisation! Self-control is the most difficult concept to practise. If one wants to have self-control, one has to surrender oneself to the Source. This Source is Light; this Source is God.</p>
<p>A child wants to have many things — many useless, harmful things. But the mother knows that if she gives the child these things, he will be ruined. And just because mother and child are one, the mother will also be ruined. So the mother does not fulfil the child’s countless unlit, destructive desires. Similarly, the body is a child. If you fulfil all its desires and demands, in the long run your life will be ruined.</p>
<p>Why does the body not listen to us when we try to control it? The answer is very simple. Our body does not listen to us because we do not listen to our soul. If we will listen to our soul, the body also will listen to us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I conquer my physical desires?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I conquer my physical desires?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, we have to know whether desire really fulfils us or not. We think that when our desires are fulfilled we shall be happy. Before we actually desire, we have the fruit of the desire in our mind; that is to say, we feel that the desire will bring us satisfaction or fulfilment. But since we have launched into the spiritual life, we will feel with our inner being that desire can neither satisfy nor fulfil us. Once we feel this we can easily avoid desire or turn our life to other things.</p>
<p>When we are in the ordinary world, we see the fulfilment of desire as taking the form of satisfaction; that is why we get some hope of happiness in trying to fulfil our desires. But if we observe the life of desire from the spiritual point of view, we will see that in the first chapter there is no light, in the last chapter there is no light, and in the chapters in between there is no light. The light of desire is darkness from beginning to end. Darkness means absence of divine satisfaction. There is no satisfaction either in the birth of desire or in its fulfilment. Desire and aspiration are two worlds. For a non-aspirant, desire is the all-important thing on earth. For a seeker, aspiration is the all-important thing on earth. An ordinary, unaspiring person does not consciously have the capacity to go beyond the boundaries of pleasure. But he who wallows in the mire of desire eventually feels that inside the mire is frustration, and inside frustration is destruction. He eventually realises that when he lives in the realm of the physical and material desire, he is caught in the jaws of a devouring tiger. But the sincere seeker begins his journey with aspiration; the middle of his journey is aspiration and the end of his journey is also aspiration. Inside aspiration, from the very beginning, there is divine satisfaction. The moment one aspires, one feels true satisfaction, because aspiration has the capacity to identify itself consciously and soulfully with the farthest corners of the globe, with the deepest and inmost Being and with the highest transcendental Self. If one feels the real necessity of aspiration, one will see that no desire — whether physical, vital or mental — can knock at his heart’s door. Instead, Peace, Light, Delight and other divine qualities will freely abide there.</p>
<p>As you know, the sun rises in the East. If you face the sun early in the morning when you meditate, your concentration and meditation will be directed to the East. If you are running toward the sun, you will not be able to see other directions properly. But if you are running East while looking toward the West, you will lose speed and stumble. So if you see that the goal is in one direction, you have to focus your attention in that direction and run in that direction. Always, at every moment, you have to aim at your goal. If your goal is God-realisation, if your goal is liberation, then you should not look behind you or around you, but only run toward the Light.</p>
<p>How can you conquer your physical desires? Do not think of physical desires; think of your aspiration. Try to be a runner, and try all the time to surpass and go beyond all that is bothering you and standing in your way. Be a real runner so that ignorance, limitations, imperfection will all drop far behind you in the race.</p>
<p>Aspiration-cry is the only answer. I have written an aphorism which says:</p>

<p><em>When I think, I sink.</em><br /><em>When I choose, I lose.</em><br /><em>When I cry, I fly.</em></p>

<p>When I think of the entire world, of worldly problems, I sink. When I choose, when I make my own decisions, I really lose, because it is God who should make all decisions in and through me. But when I cry from the inmost recesses of my being, immediately I get inner strength, inner power, the inner urge and inner capacity in infinite measure to fly in the firmament of Light and Delight.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the highest kind of purity I can aspire to?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the highest kind of purity I can aspire to?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The highest kind of purity is purity in the physical, that is to say, the lower physical, the emotional vital. The region below the navel has to be purified totally. Human beings have purity to some extent in the heart; in the mind there is very little. In the vital, purity is mixed up with impurity; there dynamism and aggression work together. So whenever you feel aggression, it is impurity, and when you feel divine dynamism, it is purity. Below the vital is the physical. There, due to inertia and sloth, darkness reigns supreme. Where there is darkness, impurity is bound to play its role.</p>
<p>You have to aspire for purity in the gross physical. How can you do it? It is through constant prayer and your constant inner cry for Light. Light and darkness cannot stay together. Impossible! Just as fear and courage cannot go together, similarly purity and impurity cannot stay together.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does your philosophy say that the body always has to be an obstacle in the communication with God and can never be a part of our self-offering to God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does your philosophy say that the body always has to be an obstacle in the communication with God and can never be a part of our self-offering to God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, the body need not always be an obstacle, a hindrance to God-realisation. The body is unconscious right now, true. But it need not always be so. An infant is unconscious, but that does not mean that he will not grow into childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Let us regard the body as an unconscious child. The child will grow through the inner nourishment it gets from the soul on the strength of our aspiration. When a child goes to school, he gets knowledge. He also gains inner wisdom day by day. Similarly, when we pray, concentrate and meditate, we are invoking Light inside us, and this Light tries to permeate our whole outer existence.</p>
<p>You are absolutely right when you say that the body is a hindrance. It is a hindrance for a long time, until the Light of the soul comes forward and takes charge of the body. But if you say that the body will constantly and eternally stand against the soul, then you are making a mistake. If the body were to stand permanently against the soul’s possibilities, then nobody would be able to realise God. For God-realisation takes place only on this planet, only on earth.</p>
<p>In the beginning it is absolutely true that the body stands against the soul’s progress. But there comes a time when the soul comes to the fore and compels the body to become its faithful, perfect instrument. This achievement represents the victory of both the body and the soul. When the soul consciously makes the body feel what it should do, and when the body is willing to listen to the dictates of the soul, then the body and the soul run together. At that time, realisation, revelation and manifestation become inevitable. When we are advanced, when we are nearing our Goal, we see that the physical consciousness is totally merged in the psychic consciousness, and we see the body in its transformed luminosity. The soul and the body become part and parcel of the one Truth, and that Truth is God the infinite.</p>
<p>There is a piano and there is a pianist. Both are equally needed to produce music. If there is no instrument, how can the player play? And again, if there is no player, the piano cannot function. Similarly, the soul needs the body in order to fulfil its highest mission. And the body needs the soul to give purpose to its existence, to realise the Highest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two methods to divinise and transform the body. One is through constant aspiration, the physical aspiring along with the soul. The other is through evolution. After going back to the soul’s region and returning to earth many times, the soul will gradually reach a stage at which it will be able to act here on earth the way the Supreme wants. At that time, it will be in a position to transform the body from within.</p>
