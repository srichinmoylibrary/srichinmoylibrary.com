SCA 940-944. Excerpts from an interview with <em>Pravda</em> which took place at Aspiration-Ground on 10 June 1990. Dr. Felix Kuznetsov and his wife were also present on that occasion.</p>
<h2><em>Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart</em></h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy first lifts the reporter overhead as part of his</em> Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart <em>programme. Before the lift, the singers sing the song</em> Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart.</p>
<p><em>Reporter [while standing on the lifting platform]:</em> This is like going to paradise, with the angels singing.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy [after lifting the reporter once]:</em> I would like to lift you once more. You are our sister-friend from the Soviet Union, whereas I am from India. India and the Soviet Union are extremely, extremely good friends. Therefore, I would like to lift you a second time. The first time I lifted you, I offered my love and gratitude to the Soviet Union. Now when I lift you, I shall be offering my love and gratitude to the soul of India. May the soul of the Soviet Union and the soul of India forever and forever enjoy their unique friendship and eternal oneness.</p>
<p><em>Reporter [after descending from the lifting platform]:</em> Thank you! It was great!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Reporter: What is your message to the world and possibly to the young people of our country? What is the essence of your credo?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Reporter: What is your message to the world and possibly to the young people of our country? What is the essence of your credo?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My message is very simple. We all must try to become better citizens of the world. Now let us say at the present time we are good — you are good, I am good, he is good, she is good. But even though we are good, we feel that we can become better and best. As we make progress in this way, we get more joy and more satisfaction in our lives.</p>
<p>Our goal is to have a peaceful feeling in ourselves. First we have to establish peace within ourselves, and only then can we try to offer peace to others. If I feel peaceful, then I shall not find fault with you or quarrel with you. If you feel peaceful, then you will not quarrel with me or with somebody else. So if I can find inner peace within myself and if you can find peace within yourself, then that peace will grow in the world like a flower, petal by petal. Each country in the world is a beautiful petal on the flower of oneness. The Soviet Union is a petal. India is a petal. America is a petal. Each petal has to contribute its beauty and fragrance to the flower as a whole. Only then can they form a most beautiful oneness-flower, which the whole world will be able to appreciate and admire.</p>
<p>So my message is that each country has to come to the fore with its inner message of love and feeling of oneness.</p>

Is it through meditation or through doing good things or through a better way of living?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the individual. Some people may try to establish peace on the strength of their prayer and meditation, while others will try to establish peace on the strength of their dedicated selfless service, by working to make the world a better place. A third person may combine both — a life of prayer and a life of service.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Dr. Felix Kuznetsov: We would like to offer you gratitude for your heart&#039;s welcome to us. Through us, you are welcoming our whole country — all the Soviet people. We feel that it is coming from your heart. Meeting with you has been one of the most important events in our visit to America.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Dr. Felix Kuznetsov: We would like to offer you gratitude for your heart&#039;s welcome to us.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We belong to one big family. When a family is big, a few members of the family go out of the house and live elsewhere. They live in different places, but they still have the same parents, the same brothers, the same sisters. Similarly, God's creation is one family. Some members are living in the Soviet Union, others are living in America and still others are living in India, Canada and different parts of the world. But we are all God's children, and we are all brothers and sisters. Our goal is the same; our destination is the same: universal oneness and peace.</p>
<p>When we pray and meditate, we live in the heart and we come to realise our oneness with one another. If we do not pray and meditate, we live in the mind, where everything is division. If we live in the mind, we find that even in our own being there is division. Our mind wants us to do one thing and our vital wants us to do something else. Therefore we can never have satisfaction. But if we live in the heart, all the parts of our being work together. Let us live always in the heart. The little brothers and big brothers have to go together. The rich countries and the poor countries have to go together, for we are all one.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is your oneness-heart that is speaking. You feel in me what you yourself are deep within. You have a most beautiful jewel inside you, locked deep within yourself. But you have misplaced the key, and now you are searching for it. My job is only to show you where you have kept the jewel and to help you find the key. Once you have found the key, the treasure inside will be all yours. It is your jewel, your soul.</p>

 <p>
SCA 945-946. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in Huntington, New York on 20 July 1999.</p>
<h2>Question: Where does a person go when he dies?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on how the individual spent his life on earth. Each soul has a place of its own in the soul's world. According to the growth of the soul, the soul will go to a particular place in the soul's world. There is no hard and fast rule that all human beings, when they pass beyond the curtain of Eternity, will go and stay together. The Supreme alone decides where each soul will go after it leaves the body.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One thing is to die with God's approval. Another thing is to die with God's tolerance, and a third thing is to die by accidental death. These accidental deaths are caused by hostile forces. There are many who are not destined to die, but some hostile forces attack them either directly or through other individuals who are on earth, such as through assassination. God can approve of someone's death — at the age of eighty, someone may die a natural death. At the same time, some extremely powerful hostile forces can snatch away someone's life at an early age for some reason that we may not be able to know. There is no hard and fast rule as to whether the Supreme sanctions someone's death or not. Only this much I can say: hostile forces do exist. We cannot say that all of the deaths that are occurring are fully and gladly approved by God.</p>

<h2>On the Olympics</h2>

<p>The very word <em>Olympics</em> is, for me, a magnificent thrill, absolutely a universal thrill, and it raises the consciousness of humanity in the inner world. True, in the outer world we may notice some wrong forces, but in the inner world the Olympics is a great opportunity for the upliftment of human consciousness.</p>
<p>This world is full of sadness, sorrows, frustrations and depression, and so many unfriendly, hostile things happen. But in the Olympics at least we get the opportunity to meet together for a few weeks and create a oneness-world-family. Alas, afterwards we go back to our animal life.</p>

SCA 948-953. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in New York on 25 November 1999.</p>
<h2>Question: At your New Millennium Peace Concert in Central Park, it felt like you were heralding a consciousness that was completely different than what we know of on this earth. When you are offering these New Millennium Peace Concerts, what is the consciousness that you are bringing in?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I want to uproot the old tree, the ancient tree, which is now absolutely rotten and fossilised. I am trying to have a totally new tree. If the old tree exists and beside the old tree you plant a new tree, that new tree also will be affected. That is why I want to uproot the whole tree and throw it away.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there any quality that will be most important for us to develop for the New Millennium?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there any quality that will be most important for us to develop for the New Millennium?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the New Millennium, we have to be sincere, not only to God but to ourselves. Not only this past year, but year after year after year, we have not been sincere to God; we have not been sincere to ourselves. If we cannot be sincere to ourselves, then it is like a stupid fellow who steals something and then ten times he tells himself that he has not stolen anything. He knows he has stolen something, but by saying ten times, "I have not stolen, I have not stolen," he convinces his mind that he has not. If he is sincere with himself and admits that he has stolen, then he will not steal any more.</p>
<p>In the New Millennium, people will make the fastest progress if they are sincere to themselves and to God. Sometimes people are sincere, but they are not sincere to God. I have done something wrong and I know I have done it, but I do not have the courage to tell God, "God, I have done something wrong."</p>
<p>Yesterday I was reading an Indian joke. One fellow went to a priest for confession. The fellow said, "I threw peanuts into the river."</p>
<p>The priest said, "It is a mild crime."</p>
<p>Another fellow went to the same confession box and said, "I threw peanuts into the river."</p>
<p>The priest again said, "Your crime is not a serious crime."</p>
<p>A third and fourth person came and confessed the same thing, and the priest told them the crime was not serious.</p>
<p>Finally a little boy came to the priest. The priest said to him, "What? Do you also have the same confession — you threw peanuts into the river?"</p>
<p>He said, "No! I have not thrown peanuts. I <em>am</em> Peanuts!"</p>
<p>Previously I did not give any value to the Christian way of confession, but now I see that this practice has its own value. If people cannot illumine their mind and purify their heart on the strength of their aspiration, then it is better to make a confession. Then they feel that somebody else is there to help them. When they make a confession, they have faith that the priest will do something to help them. If you can solve your own problems by praying and meditating for God's Forgiveness, that is best. But if you cannot, if you are again and again suffering and suffering for the mistakes that you make, then the best thing is to tell someone such as a priest. Let him also take a share of your suffering and let him pray for you. If he is a good person, he will pray for your illumination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Instead of justifying your fear, you have to conquer it. There are two ways of conquering fear. One way is to feel that at any moment you will be strangled by hostile forces. Then you will remain alert. You will always remain inside the citadel, inside the fort, where you will be absolutely well protected.</p>
<p>The other way of conquering fear is to imagine or feel how much strength fear itself has. Fear is a power. You have to feel how much strength this fear-power has. Then you will pray to the Supreme, "Please give me infinitely more power than the power that this fear embodies." Then the Supreme will give you infinitely more power than the power that is embodied in fear.</p>
<p>You have to challenge fear. Otherwise, there is every possibility that one day you will be tempted to come out of the fort to see whether fear is really strong or whether it is your imagination. When people are well protected inside, sometimes they go outside because of temptation. They want to see how beautiful it is, who is waiting for them, who is looking at them and so on. But if you come out and challenge the fear, then not only at home, but even in the street you can be fearless.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What gave me the most joy? Mahasamrat's smile. I mean it! Nobody smiles like Mahasamrat. Mahasamrat's smile gave me the utmost joy and strength. When I lifted 600 pounds, 300 with both arms, and he said, "Guru, you have done it!" he gave me the strength, joy and satisfaction of ten elephants. When I lifted the dumbbells, I looked at Mahasamrat, and his smile gave me the utmost satisfaction — that smile of infinite affection, love and confidence.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is spiritual. He is a giant, not only physically but spiritually. His name, Mahasamrat, means 'emperor sovereign'. He is not only extremely strong physically, the 'Best Built Man of the Twentieth Century'. Spiritually also, he is very powerful, very strong. People who are very strong spiritually will immediately recognise me spiritually. People who are not spiritually strong will not recognise me the way he has recognised me. As soon as he saw me, he saw my aura. And when I first heard his name in Japan, even though I had never heard about him before — at that time bodybuilding was not my line — the very name 'Bill Pearl' was ringing and ringing inside my heart for hours and days because he is inwardly very strong, a spiritual giant. Both in his inner life and in his outer life, he is a giant.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the best way to make progress through pain and sickness? I am sick so often.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the best way to make progress through pain and sickness? I am sick so often." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best results you will get when you feel that you are not the one suffering. Feel that Somebody who loves you so much is suffering in and through you. That is the best way for you to make the fastest progress. God loves you so much. He loves you infinitely more than you love yourself, but He wants to have an experience in and through you, which you are calling pain. You are suffering, suffering, suffering. You have to feel that Somebody loves you so much, and He feels that this is the best way for you to make progress.</p>
<p>You are not invoking or inviting the pain, the suffering and all the ailments that you so often get. You are not inviting them and you are not enjoying them. Some people enjoy getting an ailment so that they do not have to go to work. When they have a headache or a stomach upset, they intensify it. If they have a headache, they make it into a migraine headache. By putting force into a silly headache, they can justify to themselves that they do not have to go to work. First they magnify their pain and then they justify why they do not have to do this or that.</p>
<p>In your case, you have to feel that this is a very special experience. You are praying to God for His Fulfilment. You are praying for God's Victory, the Supreme's Victory, your Guru's victory. That you have to continue to do. Even while you are suffering, you have to do this, not only while you are physically all right. You will pray always for God's Victory, the Supreme's Victory, my victory. If you can continue with this prayer, then only will you have the true sense that your suffering is for a special purpose. If you are for God's Victory all the time, then only will you feel that for a special purpose God Himself is having this physical pain in and through you.</p>
<p>When you are suffering, you should not say, "God does not want me to work for Him. That is why He is giving me this pain. God wants somebody else to make the fastest progress. God has given me this pain so that I cannot make progress." The human mind will think this way, but the heart will say, "God loves my physical body infinitely more than I can ever love my body, but He Himself is having an experience in and through me which I do not understand and I do not have to understand." Then you can make the fastest progress.</p>

SCA 954-961. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in Curitiba, Brazil on 27 December 1999.</p>
<h2>Question: Could you please say something about Sahadeva from the Mahabharata?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sahadeva of the Mahabharata was a palmist. He had occult power also to some extent. He was not an excellent archer, but he was very, very wise. Both of the twins, Sahadeva and Nakula, were very close to Arjuna. Being the youngest brother, Sahadeva received utmost affection from their mother, Kunti. Nakula was very, very beautiful, and Sahadeva was extremely wise.</p>
<p>When Draupadi was humiliated by the Kauravas, Sahadeva was the first one who wanted to fight and defend her honour. He was extremely fond of Draupadi, so he wanted to fight and destroy the Kauravas. Arjuna, Bhima and Nakula were unwilling to disobey Yudhishthira, but Sahadeva came forward. He wanted to destroy the Kauravas.</p>
<p>All the brothers cherished Sahadeva because he was the youngest. When they were in exile in the forest, their mother Kunti suffered so much for Sahadeva because he was her youngest son.</p>
<p>One personal experience of mine I can relate. In this life I am very fond of Arjuna. When I was five years old, I was supposed to play the role of Sahadeva in a play. At our stage rehearsal I had such trouble. The organisers forced me to wear a dhoti wrapped like a girl's sari. It was too much for me. I was crying and crying, "Why do I have to wear a sari?" The following day, during the performance, I had only one line to say. On the stage I completely forgot the line. Nervousness attacked me ruthlessly. I was supposed to say that line to Arjuna. Arjuna prompted me to say the line, but still nothing was coming out. This was how I performed Sahadeva's part. That was my five-year-old experience. The director was my cousin, who was extremely fond of me.</p>
