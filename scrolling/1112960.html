 <p></p>
<h2>The third eye</h2>

<p>I wish to give a very short talk on the third eye; then we shall most soulfully concentrate, meditate and contemplate on the third eye.</p>
<p>The third eye fascinates curiosity-seekers. Fortunately, we are not curiosity-seekers. The third eye helps sincere seekers considerably on their way to self-discovery. Here we are all sincere seekers. Sincere seekers are those who know perfectly well that there is only one way to achieve abiding satisfaction in life, and that way is to offer the results of all their actions to the Absolute Supreme soulfully, unreservedly and unconditionally. The third eye fulfils God's Dream in and through the sincere seeker precisely because sincere seekers are true God-lovers.</p>
<p>The third eye is the eye of vision-light. What is vision-light? Vision-light is at once our self-transforming and self-transcending, God-revealing and God-manifesting reality. What else is vision-light? Vision-light is the capacity that we embody to differentiate our animal past and human present from our divine near future and our supreme distant future.</p>
<p>The message of our past was total destruction. The message of our present is conscious or unconscious division. The message of our near future is oneness, satisfaction in oneness. And the message of our distant future is perfection in satisfaction and satisfaction in perfection.</p>
<p>Some people are of the opinion that it is not advisable to open the third eye, for if it is opened prematurely, our inner progress will come to an end. They are of the opinion that opening the third eye is not a boon. In fact, they feel that it is a veritable curse. But seekers must know that if they are really sincere, if they have an intense inner cry, then God, the Author of all good, will not open their third eye untimely. If they are sincere, God will do everything for them at the right hour. But if they are insincere, then naturally they may have to pay the penalty if their third eye is opened prematurely.</p>
<p>Fear is the worst enemy of a seeker when he wants to open his third eye. On the one hand, he is consumed with the desire to open his third eye. On the other hand, the moment the idea flashes across his mind that when his third eye opens he will be able to see his past lives, he is afraid. What happens when an insincere seeker opens his third eye is most deplorable. If his past was not satisfactory, if it was most discouraging, then immediately he is shocked. He curses himself and loses all hope. He thinks that because he was so bad in the past, for him there can be no bright future and he is doomed to disappointment. His mental sky is overcast with clouds.</p>
<p>When an insincere seeker sees the future, the result is equally deplorable. If he sees something discouraging, frightening or saddening in the near future, then he is frightened to death. If he sees that one of his dear ones is soon going to die, then before the event actually occurs, he himself dies with fear and anxiety. For these reasons, the insincere seeker often is afraid to open his third eye. But if a sincere seeker has the indomitable will right from the beginning to see the past and to enter into the future with a surrendering attitude, placing the results at the Feet of his Beloved Supreme, then fear cannot torture his life. If he sees that he was not aspiring in his past incarnation, so what? He knows that he has the golden opportunity to aspire in this incarnation. Just because he did not do something positive or constructive in the past does not mean that he cannot do it in the present. Just because he was not an honest man before, there is no reason why he cannot be honest now.</p>
<p>When our third eye is open, if we see that something is going to happen to someone in the immediate future, we have to remember who loves that particular individual more: we ourselves or the Source of love. Right now, our love is very limited. We all know it. But there is Someone who has unlimited, infinite Love. We are right now praying to that Being or to that omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent Reality. That all-loving Reality undoubtedly has more compassion, more vision-light than we have; therefore, it is our bounden duty to surrender to His will. If we are ready to place the results, the capacities, the achievements and the fruits of our vision at the Feet of the Supreme, then we are safe. There is no other way, when we have our third eye open, to make the fastest progress in the spiritual life.</p>
<p>When the third eye opens up, it sometimes creates tremendous excitement. If we know that something good is going to happen, if we come to see that something most encouraging and inspiring is going to happen, then we become overexcited. This excitement quite often delays the event. It also takes away our mental poise. Then, in the inner world again we become bankrupt. So when we get an encouraging message by virtue of opening our third eye, we should look around and see if there is anybody on earth who has achieved more love, more knowledge, more wisdom, more light than we have. If we are sincere, then we are bound to see that there were people, there are people and there will be people who have achieved infinitely more than we. When we see this, then immediately our excitement pales into insignificance. We can be happy; but if we are overexcited at seeing what is going to happen, then we lose our mental poise. Once we lose our mental poise we cannot make further progress in the spiritual life. So we should not be overexcited when we see that something good is going to happen and, at the same time, we should not be depressed or disheartened when we see an inauspicious future or past with the vision of our third eye.</p>
<p>Before we accept the spiritual life, we wallow in the pleasures of ignorance. When we sincerely accept the spiritual life, we try to give up our bad habits; and sooner or later we do succeed in giving up our bad habits. This is the proof that we have made considerable progress. This is the proof that we do not belong to the past reality but that we belong to the future reality, which is growing in the immediacy of our aspiring today.</p>
<p>We pray and meditate with the hope that one day we shall enter into trance, for each seeker feels that trance, which is nothing short of bliss, is necessary in the spiritual life. It is something most advantageous, most illumining and most fulfilling. Here I wish to say that if one can open the third eye, this facilitates or expedites the attainment of trance, or samadhi. When the third eye is opened, we can run the fastest along the mental road to God. The mental world is obscure, dark, impure and insecure. But when we open the third eye and walk along the mental road, immediately everything that is insecure is made secure, everything that is impure is made pure, everything that is undivine is made divine. Everything that is dark is illumined by the third eye.</p>
<p>Now, there is a slight difference between the third eye and the trance-life. We have two ordinary human eyes. When we use our human eyes, we see that the reality is at one place and the person who is watching the reality is at some other place. If you are sitting in front of me and I am looking at you, then you are the goal and I am the starting point. The destination and the starting point are at two different places. I am the starting point, and you are the goal. This is the understanding that we get from our human eyes. But if we use the third eye at that time we see that the starting point and the destination are at the same place. They cannot be two; they are together. When we enter into trance, we get one experience which we usually do not get from the third eye. The third eye will show us that the starting point and the goal are together. But this vision of oneness may not give us immediate Delight. If we can enter into trance, then immediately we get the universal Life and the transcendental Life together; therefore, we are flooded with Delight.</p>
<p>When we enter into trance and get abundant, boundless bliss, we are totally satisfied. We do not know who embodies this infinite Delight. We cannot see the personal God who embodies both the transcendental Life and the universal Life. Just by entering into trance, we cannot see the Owner, the Possessor. But if we can open the third eye, then we can see the Absolute Supreme in His subtle, personal aspect. Infinity is one thing, and the absolute Reality is something else. When we enter into the highest trance, we enjoy infinite Peace, Light and Bliss. But He who embodies this infinite Peace, Light and Bliss may not be visible at all. But if we open the third eye, then we see the Transcendental Absolute, the Absolute Supreme. The Absolute Supreme is far above infinity and infinity's Light, Delight, Peace and Bliss.</p>
<p>Our aim, our goal, is to please the Absolute; therefore, we shall pray and meditate. If we feel that opening the third eye will help us so that we are not assailed by fear, doubt, anxiety and worry, then we should definitely meditate on the third eye. For the sooner we can clear away our mental jungle, the sooner we will reach our destination, which is the Golden Shore of the ever-transcending Beyond.</p>
<p>Now we shall concentrate on the third eye. The third eye is located in between the eyebrows and a little above. In this spot we shall concentrate, meditate and contemplate.</p>
<p>While concentrating, let us imagine for a few minutes in the third eye a flame, a burning golden flame. What we call imagination is nothing short of an existence-reality, a world of its own. So let us concentrate, and while concentrating let us feel that there is a burning flame in our third eye. Please breathe in as slowly and as quietly as possible. While breathing in, try to feel that you are not breathing in through your nose: you are breathing in through your forehead. While breathing out you are also breathing through your forehead. Then please feel the presence of burning flames inside your forehead, precisely inside the third eye.</p>
<p>Now let us meditate on the third eye. This time, also, please breathe in and out through your forehead. But now please imagine the planet sun or the inner sun, which is infinitely brighter than the planet sun. Please imagine at least one sun inside the forehead at the third eye, and inside that sun please imagine countless flames or rays of light. This time, please keep your eyes fully open so that you can feel the vastness of the sun along with its light and power.</p>
<p>Now we shall contemplate. From the spiritual point of view, contemplation is the sweetest form of inseparable oneness. This oneness is the oneness of the divine lover with the Beloved Supreme. The oneness that abides between the divine lover and the Supreme Beloved is called contemplation. It is by virtue of contemplation, proper contemplation, that we come to realise that we are not only divine seekers but also divine lovers, and that God is our Beloved Supreme. We are like tiny drops, while God is the ocean. Countless drops form the ocean, and again, the ocean embodies all the drops. First we imagined flames, then the sun itself. When we can contemplate properly, we will become one with God Himself. When the God-loving seeker and God together play, sing and dance, at that time God sings the song of multiplicity in unity. When the One Absolute remains in His transcendental aspect, and the seekers and God-lovers approach Him, then God is singing the song of unity in multiplicity. So let us contemplate on the third eye. For a few minutes let us feel that we are the lover-flames: then we shall feel that we are the Beloved-Sun. Thus, we shall change our respective roles.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A seeker is a singer</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="A seeker is a singer" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A seeker is a singer. Unlike other singers, he sings only two songs: his song of self-giving beauty and his song of God-becoming duty. His heart's soulful cry is his self-giving Divinity-song. His life's fruitful smile is his God-becoming immortality-song.</p>
<p>When a seeker says to the Supreme, "O my Beloved Lord, I am for You only," he sings his song of self-giving. When he says to the Supreme, "O my Beloved Lord, You are my ever-transcending vision's height and my ever-increasing reality's depth," he sings his song of God-becoming.</p>
<p>When a seeker says to the Supreme that his life is constant dedication to the eternal Source, he sings his song of self-giving. When he says to the Supreme that he is devotedly and unreservedly one with His Infinity's Goal, he sings his song of God-becoming.</p>
<p>The seeker's inner resolution is his song of self-giving. The seeker's inner revolution is his song of God-becoming. Inner resolution is an art. Slowly, steadily and unerringly the seeker learns the art of divine love, divine devotion and divine surrender. Inner revolution is also an art. Slowly, steadily and unerringly the seeker learns the art of realisation, revelation and manifestation.</p>
<p>The inner resolution is nothing short of inspiration in action. The inner revolution is nothing but aspiration in action. Inspiration is a bird. This bird carries the seeker on its wings and shows him the Face of his Beloved Supreme. Aspiration is a ladder. The seeker climbs up this ladder and reaches the ultimate Height. There he becomes one with Infinity's Height and Immortality's Life. God is supremely pleased with him. God descends on the same ladder. He comes down and makes the seeker His faithful, devoted and unconditional instrument.</p>
<p>God offers Himself here on earth completely, and His devoted seeker singer sings with Him soulfully and unconditionally. While singing the song with his Beloved Supreme, the seeker increases his realisation-power, realisation-peace, realisation-light and realisation-delight. While singing the song with the seeker-singer, the Beloved Supreme manifests His Divinity, His immortality and His Oneness-Reality here on earth devotedly, unreservedly and unconditionally.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Aspiration</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Aspiration" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I am an aspirant. I aspire. When I aspire, I radiate: my entire being radiates, my physical reality radiates, my whole face radiates. The seekers around me get inspiration from my radiation, and my radiation serves them by increasing their aspiration. In this way, with my aspiration I offer a special service to those who are around me.</p>
<p>My aspiration is my illumination. When I aspire, I illumine my own unlit, dark and obscure parts. I illumine my own ignorance-life, and those fellow travellers who are around me get illumination from my illumination. In this way, my illumination serves the seekers who are around me by helping to illumine their unlit and obscure lives. My aspiration is my realisation. There was a time when I cheerfully and madly danced a dance of division. In those days, I wanted division to reign supreme in my entire life. "I" and "my": these were the two songs I knew then. But now in my aspiration-life, I see that division cannot solve my problems. It is only my union, my Oneness with the Source — the perennial Life-Tree which through Eternity has been growing inside my heart — which can and will solve all my problems. My oneness tells me that there is only one Source, and to that Source all human beings and the entire creation belong. In oneness founded on a solid basis I get satisfaction far beyond my imagination.</p>
<p>My aspiration is my perfection, and perfection is my experience of self-transcendence. At every moment, by virtue of my aspiration, I transcend my previous heights, and each time I transcend myself I get new inspiration. My entire being is inundated with a new inspiration-dawn. Perfection is my constant self-transcendence to satisfy the seeker in me and to satisfy my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Aspiration is torture: so says my lethargic body. Aspiration is pressure: so says my unruly, restless vital. Aspiration is terror: so says my doubting and suspecting mind. Aspiration is pleasure: so says my crying heart. Aspiration is leisure: so says my loving soul. And finally, my Lord Supreme says that aspiration is nothing short of treasure. Out of His infinite Bounty, He tells me that my aspiration is not only my treasure but also His treasure.</p>
<p>My desire-life unconsciously wanted to destroy me, my reality-existence. My aspiration-life consciously wants to employ me and make me perfect so that I can serve my Beloved Supreme constantly in His own Way. My Beloved Supreme compassionately tells me that He will give me what He has and what He is: infinite Compassion. I tell Him that I shall give Him what I have and what I am: a tiny drop of devotion. He accepts what I give Him lovingly, smilingly and unconditionally. I accept what He gives me devotedly, soulfully and unreservedly.</p>

<p>Prayer is man's soulful cry for God. Meditation is man's fruitful smile in God.</p>
<p>Prayer is personal, also universal. Meditation is impersonal, also transcendental.</p>
<p>Prayer is petition, also adoration. Meditation is absorption, also perfection.</p>
<p>Prayer needs God's Compassion-Shower. Meditation needs God's Illumination-Tower.</p>
<p>I pray for Immortality in mortality. I meditate on Infinity in Eternity.</p>
<p>Prayer is night crying for light. Meditation is light searching for delight.Prayer reminds us of our hidden sins. Meditation reminds us of our forgotten sun.</p>
<p>Through prayer God says, "My child, I am waiting for you. Come and see Me."</p>
<p>Through meditation God says, "My child, wait for Me. I am coming to see you."</p>
<p>Prayer is the purity that counts. Meditation is the luminosity that mounts.</p>
<p>My prayer-teacher shows me the beauty of soulfulness. My meditation-teacher blesses me with the duty of oneness.</p>
<p>Prayer soulfully reveals man's faith in God. Meditation smilingly reveals God's faith in man.</p>
<p>My God is mad because nowadays I do not pray either in the morning or in the evening. My God is sad because nowadays I do not meditate sleeplessly and unconditionally.</p>

<p>God? Who, you?<br /> God? Who, he? No!<br /> God? Who, I? No!<br /> Who, then, is God? God is my prayer-purity's quest.<br /> Who, then, is God? God is my meditation divinity's nest.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">I Meditate</h2><span property="dc:title" content="I Meditate" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I meditate. I meditate not out of curiosity. I meditate out of necessity.</p>
<p>I meditate not out of fear. I meditate out of love.</p>
<p>I meditate not out of possessiveness. I meditate out of selflessness.</p>
<p>I meditate on God not because God is great. I meditate on God because God is good.</p>
<p>I meditate on God not because God will give me everything I want. I meditate on God because God will give me only the things that I need.</p>
<p>There is a special reason why I meditate. I love to converse with God. He is such a charming conversationalist, and I am a charmed listener.</p>
<p>I meditate to unlearn and to learn. I meditate to unlearn my earth-bound mind-education. I meditate to learn my Heaven-free heart-aspiration. I am my heart's hunger-cry. God is His Heart's Feast-Smile.</p>
<p>Some people think that I am not practical, while others think that I am not sincere. Still others think that I am stupid. We all know that criticism is the order of the day. Such being the case, how can I expect to be an exception? Again, in all sincerity, I must tell the world that perfection is still a far cry in my life. I have made an inner promise: I shall fear no criticism when I am right; I shall ignore no criticism when I am wrong.</p>
<p>Meditation is the flowering of my confidence in myself and my confidence in God. I have no confidence in human beings, precisely because I know them and precisely because I do not know them. I have complete confidence in God not because of my helpless life, but because of my sleepless heart. I have complete confidence in myself not because God is my only choice, but because He is always His unconditional Boon.</p>
<p>When I do not meditate, conscience torments me, peace hides from me, joy deserts me and satisfaction ignores me. When I meditate, God's blue Eye blesses me, God's green Heart embraces me and God's red Feet shelter me.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, when I hear God's Voice, I open my inspired eyes and meditate. During my morning meditation, God says to me, "My child, go and prove to the world that you are all for Me." Late at night, when I hear God's Voice, I close my tired eyes and meditate. During my night meditation, God says to me, "My child, lo and behold, you are of Me unmistakably and eternally."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Prayer</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Prayer" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>What is prayer? Prayer is possession. What is prayer? Prayer is renunciation.What is prayer? Prayer is fulfilment.</p>
<p>With our human prayer we possess. With our divine prayer we renounce. With our supreme prayer we fulfil-we fulfil the Will of the Supreme soulfully, unreservedly and unconditionally,</p>
<p>The human prayer says, "Lord, give me." The divine prayer says, "Lord, take me." The supreme prayer says, "Lord, give me, if so is Your Will; take me, if so is Your Will. I have only one message for You: I am all for You, only for You."Human prayer says, "Lord, give me what You have, and make me happy." Divine prayer says, "Lord, take me, along with all my possessions, and make me happy." The supreme prayer says, "Lord, in me and in others, please Yourself only in Your own Way, and thus make me happy."</p>
<p>Earth's prayer is a slowly ascending cry. Heaven's prayer is a speedily spreading smile. Earth prays for the immortal life. Heaven prays for the eternal satisfaction. Earth-prayer is God-Beauty's Perfection. Heaven-prayer is God-Duty's Satisfaction.</p>
<p>Prayer has a soulful brother: meditation. Prayer's God is high above. Meditation's God is deep within. Prayer is the strongest intensity in a seeker's life. Meditation is the steadiest immensity in a seeker's heart. Prayer's God is greatness and goodness. Meditation's God is fulness and oneness. When I pray, I speak to God devotedly. When I meditate, God speaks to me affectionately. This is how we enjoy our fruitful conversation.</p>
<p>On the strength of my prayer, I go to God. On the strength of my meditation, I bring God to me. I go to God and tell Him what He can most compassionately do for me. God comes to me and tells me what I can cheerfully do for Him. Prayer is humanity's momentous success. Meditation is divinity's continuous progress. Prayer's ultimate goal is God-Infinity's Sound-Glory. Meditation's ultimate goal is God-Eternity's Silence-Beauty.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Meditation</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Meditation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Meditation is invocation. We invoke God's Presence. God's Presence is satisfaction.</p>
<p>Meditation is an act of inner listening. We listen to the dictates of God. When we listen soulfully, devotedly, unreservedly and unconditionally, we derive satisfaction in boundless measure.</p>
<p>Meditation is acceptance. It is the acceptance of life within us, without us and all around us. Acceptance of life is the beginning of human satisfaction. Transformation of life is the culmination of divine satisfaction.</p>
<p>Meditation is self-giving. We give what we have and what we are. To the finite reality we give what we have. To the infinite Reality we give what we are. What we have is concern. This concern we offer to the finite. What we are is willingness. This willingness we offer to the infinite.</p>
<p>Assurance we offer to the earth reality. Acknowledgement we offer to the Heaven-Reality. To the earth-reality we offer our constant assurance that we are undoubtedly and unmistakably for the earth-reality, for the transformation and illumination of the earth-reality. To the Heaven-Reality we offer our most sincere acknowledgement of the supreme fact that we are of the Heaven-Reality, that our source is the Heaven-Reality.</p>
<p>Meditation and prayer are two aspects of one and the same soulful reality. The Eastern world is fond of meditation. The Western world is fond of prayer. Both prayer and meditation lead us to the selfsame goal. Meditation and prayer are like brother and sister; they are divine twins. We can say that prayer is the female and meditation is the male. Prayer says to meditation, "Look, brother, there is something high above. Let us cry and fly, fly and cry, and there above we shall get everything that we have been longing for." Meditation says to prayer, "Look, sister, there is something deep within us. Let us dive deep within and we are sure to get everything that we have been longing for from time immemorial. Let us dive deep within.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna meditated. His meditation-power has taught us many things. But the most important thing it has taught us is this: Truth will ultimately prevail; the justice-light of Truth will one day inundate the entire earth-consciousness.</p>
<p>Lord Buddha meditated. His meditation has taught us that this human life of suffering will, without fail, one day come to an end. The excruciating pangs that each human being undergoes will one day come to an end, and human suffering will be transformed into divine ecstasy.</p>
<p>The Saviour Christ prayed. His prayer has taught us many sublime, soulful and fruitful lessons. It has offered us the message of divinity in its tangible form. But his most essential teaching is that the Kingdom of Heaven is within us. This Kingdom of Heaven is God's creation, God's Vision and God's Reality. God's transcendental Vision and God's universal Reality are within this Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<p>Let us meditate devotedly, soulfully, unreservedly and unconditionally. From our meditation we shall discover the supreme truth that as we need God, even so God needs us. We need Him constantly to reach our own highest height. He needs us constantly to manifest His own deepest depth.</p>

<h2>Question: Does God create at the animal level?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, He does. God Himself is in the process of ever-transcending perfection. It is He Himself who becomes the animal and it is He who will become the man. God wants to experience Himself through various forms of manifestation. A potter, when he makes a pot, changes the shape constantly until it reaches a standard that satisfies him. Similarly, God is perfecting Himself through the animal kingdom as well as through humanity, because He Himself is the Spirit which has descended into all matter. This is His divine Game.</p>
