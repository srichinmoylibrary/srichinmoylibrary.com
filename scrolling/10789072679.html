<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are so many ways to meditate. If you look at my Transcendental picture and meditate, that is one form of meditation. If you do dedicated service, that is another form of meditation. And if you read my writings soulfully, that is also a form of meditation. Today if you are angry with me for some reason and you don’t feel like meditating on your heart or looking at my picture, just read my writings soulfully. If you read my writings, you enter immediately into my consciousness, and to enter into my consciousness is the highest form of meditation.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are displeased with me in your mind, but it is not affecting your physical. At that time, if your physical wants to work, it should work devotedly. Suppose you are working at the restaurant, at Dipti Nivas. Your mind may be angry with me, but if the physical has to clean the dishes at that time, then your boss will catch you if you do not do your job. When you work, your physical meditation is taking place. Mental meditation is not taking place because you are displeased with me for something. Your boss will not be able to catch you there because she cannot read your mind. But on the physical plane, when you don’t clean the restaurant, you are caught. So you see, when you work for the mission, at that time you are doing meditation in the physical.</p>
<p>Sometimes the heart is full of love and the mind is full of doubt. Now what will you do? The heart is meditating most soulfully but the mind is not meditating because the mind is full of doubt. You have so many parts of your being: body, vital, mind and heart. If you can’t meditate in all parts, then if you can meditate in at least one part, say in the physical by doing dedicated service, then it is a form of meditation. Similarly, if the vital does some dedicated service, through inspiration or enthusiasm, then that is a form of meditation. And if all the parts of your being — physical, vital, mental and psychic — work together devotedly, then that is the best form of meditation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the Master meditates, there may be twenty seekers that are restless, but the Master is not affected. He maintains his inner peace and he offers his peace to those meditating with him. Then when you go home, you also will feel peaceful. The strength of my peace enters into those seekers who are sincere. Even now as I am talking, peace, light and bliss are emanating from me.</p>
<p>You people represent the world. The world is something very huge, but you create the world and I create the world. Let us say that this little room is a miniature world. From here you will get something from me, and then you will offer it to somebody else. So you see how peace can spread from one person to two persons and so on.</p>

Should I stop and surrender or should I try to keep on aspiring during the meditation and go higher?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you see that I am smiling during your meditation, at that time the joy that you get will lift you. The joy that you get from seeing my smiling face will be more powerful than if you just continued going on aspiring. My smiling face will be able to give you the tremendous push that you need to go to the Highest. After seeing me, if you want to separate your aspiration from my smiling face, then you will try again with your personal effort to go up. Once you have seen me, that means you have come into contact with my smile, that is, my higher Reality. Once you get into my higher Reality, at that time let my heart push you up. A child is trying to climb up a tree while the father is just waiting, observing him. But if the child has got the father to help him up, naturally the father will be able to take him up to the highest bough of the tree. So, at that time, only allow the smile to enter into you and assimilate it. Let the power of the smile, which is oneness, carry you to the Highest. Do not make any more personal effort.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If we set a specific time for our morning meditation, do you feel disappointed if we sometimes oversleep?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If we set a specific time for our morning meditation, do you feel disappointed if we sometimes oversleep?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I meditate on you, I do not depend on your getting up. My meditation is unconditional. When I meditate on you, I don’t hope that you will get up early in the morning at your scheduled time. But if you do meditate on time, then you become conscious of what I am doing. My difficulty is that my disciples are not conscious of what I do. They don’t realise that I love them infinitely more than they love themselves.</p>
<p>All problems will be over when each individual consciously feels that God loves him infinitely more than he loves himself. Humanity should know and believe that the Creator loves His creation more than He loves Himself. You may say, “How can it be possible?” But you have to know what value the creation has. When you think of the mother and child, in so many instances you will see that when the child is very sick and near death, the mother sincerely prays to God, “Take me, take me. Let my son stay here. He is young and he has to do so much work.” Her creation is her son, and she wants her son to stay on earth.</p>
<p>So here you see that the Creator loves His creation more than Himself. My spiritual disciples are my creations. Physically your parents brought you into the world. But when I gave you the message of the soul, the day I kindled the flame of aspiration within you and accepted you as my disciple, on that day you became my child. He whose inner flame I have kindled is my child, my spiritual child. When I kindle the flame of aspiration within someone, I give birth to a spiritual soul; I create life and aspiration, which is going to be transformed into realisation in the future. So naturally I will have boundless concern for my disciples, because I know what God’s Vision is for them and I know how God’s Capacity will flow through them. But what I created need not know this until the last moment, because the Vision of God is with the Master, not with the disciple. God’s Vision is also with the disciple, but he cannot always see it. But the Master’s third eye is open and he knows how far God wants to take an individual in this incarnation.</p>
<p>So if you are not up meditating at your specific time, I will be sad, but only in a human way. In a divine way I will not be sad, because I know that sadness does not serve any purpose. You have made friendship with ignorance. So I will try at that time to have more conscious power to awaken you and illumine you. In everything human there is always success and failure. But in the divine way, where is success and where is failure? They are nothing. In the human life, every second is either success or failure, and what we call success this moment may seem to us like failure the next moment.</p>
<p>This moment I am painting and in a human way I am successful. My human mind will say, “I am painting and I am enjoying it here with so many people listening to me and admiring me. I am such a lucky fellow.” Then again, the same stupid mind will say, “Look at this. My friend, another God-realised soul, is now in silence. He is meditating and enjoying the delight of Brahman and I am here with a bunch of ignorant human beings.” This moment my mind has told me how lucky I am that you people are adoring me, and the next moment my mind can tell me that all this is worthless because someone else is enjoying his transcendental trance.</p>
<p>But if I use my divine consciousness, I will say that what I am doing is right because God is asking me to be with my spiritual children and give them some illumination. Again, what my friend is doing is also right because God right now is asking him to do his highest meditation. So I am fulfilling God’s Will in my own way and he is fulfilling God’s Will in his own way. If I am in the mind, this moment I will flatter myself and the next moment I will criticise myself. But if I go beyond the mind, then I will see that it is all the time God who is acting in and through me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we find our Inner Pilot and listen to it?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we find our Inner Pilot and listen to it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to find the Inner Pilot, you have to go deep within. Meditation is bound to carry you to the Inner Pilot. Meditation is a process that shows you how to go deep within. Meditation is a road that leads you to the ultimate destination. Meditation also is an inner assurance of your connection with the Absolute. When a seeker meditates, he hears the messages from above, from his Beloved Father, or he hears messages from his own inner being. And when he tries to listen to the dictates of his inner being or the messages from above, he transforms his outer life of imperfection into a life of perfect perfection.</p>
<p>In school you have a teacher who is teaching you and offering his wisdom-light to you through language. In the spiritual life also, the teacher teaches through language. But the language of the spiritual teacher is meditation. Meditation is the inner language, and the teacher teaches meditation through silence. It would not be easy for your professor to teach through silence, and for the student also it would not be easy to learn through silence. But a spiritual teacher will meditate for five minutes in silence and during his meditation he will offer peace, light and bliss. He can instruct you to meditate either by giving you specific instructions or through his silent gaze. But most of the time the spiritual teacher teaches through silence, because that way is most effective.</p>
<p>In school you are studying philosophy and you are using the searching mind. But in meditation, the mind is not used at all. That does not mean we have become an imbecile; far from it. Only you go far beyond the domain of the mind and in the realm of the soul you grow.</p>

Why do you do this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Last Sunday I called out the names of those who meditated well and disclosed your marks. Marks were given not out of sense of competition, but only to give you more joy and inspiration, so that everyone will try to meditate well. So it was far from any kind of competition spiritually. If you want to say your left hand did a better job or your right hand did a better job, then I have to say one did do better. But again, right hand and left hand are one. I feel that everybody meditated well today and I am very happy and very proud. But again I wish to say that there should be no comparison, no competition. We have to feel oneness if we have not meditated well and if the one sitting beside us has done well. We are all one family and, on the strength of our oneness, we have to feel this. Even if we have not meditated well, then we should be proud, because we are one with those who did do well. If we have tried our best but at the same time someone else has done better, we should be happy. Our senses will tell us that he is a different person, but the soul will say that we are one.</p>

<h2>Question: Sometimes I'll get a real high sound in my ear, even though I am not meditating. I'll just be sitting and all of a sudden I'll get this sound. Could you explain it to me?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are not meditating consciously, but your soul is meditating. This is called spontaneous meditation. Your soul is meditating, although your physical mind does not know that the soul is meditating. This sound you hear is like unconditional Grace from above. When you pray, when you do something good, at that time you feel that in return you will get something. But God gives many things unconditionally. He is like a mother. A mother does many things for her children unconditionally. You may say that the mother feels that one day the children will grow up and then help her. No. The mother knows very well that when the children are twelve or thirteen, they will leave the family. Very often the physical mother, does things unconditionally for her children. God, being our eternal Father and Mother, does everything unconditionally for us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I recognise a spiritual experience as such?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I recognise a spiritual experience as such?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In your case it is easy. Millions of times you have had the feeling of true eagerness to help humanity, and with God’s Grace you have helped humanity according to your capacity. Then you have gotten joy. But do not take this joy as the result of your action. When you have inner joy, please do not feel that it is the result of a fulfilled desire or a successful action.</p>
<p>Do not feel that you are happy because the result is satisfactory. No, immediately separate yourself from your action. Then you will see that the joy you are having is from a feeling of oneness — oneness with the universal Consciousness or cosmic Consciousness or your own consciousness.</p>
<p>Spirituality is always natural. Anything that is unnatural can never be spiritual. Right now, you are not seeing truth as your birthright. Truth is something unnatural; somebody else possesses the truth, but you do not possess it. But when you are in the spiritual life, you see that spirituality is everybody’s property.</p>
<p>In your case, spiritual experiences you have had many, many times, Whenever I concentrate on you, I do see that you want to be illumined and guided by the Supreme. This very idea that you want to be illumined, guided or moulded by somebody who knows how to guide and mould you, is not a desire. It is more than an aspiration even. What it is, is an outer expression of your soul’s inner experience. It is your soul that is having this inner experience. An unaspiring person says, “/I/ have to save myself. <em>I</em> have to do everything. Nobody will do anything for me.” But in your case, I have seen many times that you have the desire to be helped and guided by the Supreme in me. This is the highest, or you can say, the most effective experience of your soul, expressed in the form of desire or in the form of aspiration. So constantly you are getting experiences when you feel that you are a child in the Lap of the Supreme. That very feeling, you will see if you go deep within, is an experience which is embodied by your soul, and only you are trying to manifest it in the form of aspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There should be no split in your consciousness. When you are properly meditating, at that time your consciousness will become a single entity. If you feel that you are enjoying a running commentary, then you have to know that either your mind or your vital or your physical is not totally one with your meditation. Your heart is meditating most devotedly, but the mind may not be there. In our path we give more importance to the heart than to the mind. But that does not mean that you can neglect or ignore the mind. The child whom we call “heart” is our dearest. But the mind also is our child, so we cannot throw away the mind. The mind has to become one with the heart so that the soul can carry both of them together. When you are meditating, sometimes your mind does not want to sit beside the heart or become one with it. That’s why you feel the running commentary; it comes from the mind. Very rarely does it come from the vital.</p>
<p>There are three stages of meditation. The first stage is where your particular experience takes place. In spite of having a very good, high, deep, sublime meditation, you feel that your whole existence is not there. You can separate your existence part by part. If your whole inner existence were there, then you could not separate it; the body, vital, mind, heart and soul would go together. Although in your psychic consciousness you are having a very high meditation, it will not be totally fruitful because all the members of your inner family are not participating.</p>
<p>In the second, or higher stage of meditation, you will see that you have become totally one with your consciousness. Now we are just using the term “consciousness,” but in that stage you will actually be able to see and feel what consciousness is. At every moment you will be able to see the divine streak of light, the all-pervading light inside you which has united you with the Highest. In this stage of meditation, you have become the connecting link between earth and Heaven.</p>
<p>Then there is the third state, the highest state of meditation. In that state, you will be able to feel or see yourself as both the meditator and the meditation itself. Here the seer and the seen come together. This happens only in the highest transcendental Consciousness, when you go beyond nature’s dance. All the disciples will one day have that realisation because all will have to rise above the dance of nature. The dance of nature means here temptation, frustration, anxiety, fear, failure, success and all that.</p>
<p>In one of our Upanishads it mentions that there are three kinds of meditation: gross meditation, subtle meditation, and transcendental meditation. So, your particular experience will be only gross meditation. The second stage that I mentioned will be subtle meditation. The third one is transcendental meditation, where you become totally one with your meditation and, at the same time, you remain beyond your meditation. All the time you feel that you are beyond, beyond. But again, it does not mean that in gross meditation you cannot enter into your deepest meditation. No, you can. But only one part — your heart — will enjoy the deepest meditation; the physical, the vital, the mind will not enjoy the deepest meditation. That is why it is called gross.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The face is smiling because you are meditating well, according to your own standard. Or it may be smiling for another reason: to ask you not to be disturbed by the ignorance and the dark forces that you still have. It is smiling to encourage you and strengthen you so that you can conquer them. These are the two reasons. One is that according to your standard you are pleased and the smiling face is pleased with you; the other is that it is asking you not to be frightened by the wrong forces that are still inside you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I had an experience in which I felt the purity of God and the feeling of Eternity and Power.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I had an experience in which I felt the purity of God and the feeling of Eternity and Power." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This was an act of sheer Grace. The Supreme, the Divine, the Absolute, out of His infinite Bounty, unconditionally offered His Grace to you. That is why this experience was possible. These things are not hallucinations. Spiritual Masters have these experiences and you also can have them. But you also have to know that for that you have to practise Yoga. You have to pray and meditate.</p>
<p>The Supreme in the Master can show you what He has. He will say, “This is all for you. But right now you are a child. First you have to grow up.” The father can bring the child right in front of the safe and show him all his wealth. Then he says, “Look, I have millions of dollars. It is all for you, but you have to work for it. You have to grow up properly. You have to please me. Then this wealth is yours.</p>
<p>The first time you got this experience, it was because of Grace. But then impurity came. Any spiritual wealth that you may have, no matter what kind it is, will all be destroyed if impurity comes. Many people have good experiences one day, and then the next day they indulge in lower vital life, and all their higher experiences are destroyed. But if they do not enjoy vital life and emotional life, then the higher experiences grow. They grow up and become very solid, like a banyan tree. So when you have experiences, it is always necessary to be extremely careful not to indulge in the vital life, so that you can have still high, higher and highest experiences. You can have them, you can embody them, you can reveal them and you can manifest them.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the significance of seeing glowing white light or a point of white light in meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the significance of seeing glowing white light or a point of white light in meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are seeing a white glow. White signifies purity, the consciousness of the Divine Mother. If it is a glowing white light, then it is coming from the opening of a certain spiritual centre inside you. Purity is operating in and through you, therefore a spiritual opening is taking place. But it can also be a false experience, because in some cases when one’s vision is getting worse, one sees white light. Again, some people see white or blue or green light when their eyesight is getting worse. Sometimes when human eyes are getting worse, if you keep the eyes closed, you may see a vision or light, but it is actually a false experience. Many people have had that experience, so you have to know if your experience is real. Please see which is applicable to you. If it is a real experience, then it is most encouraging.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is nothing wrong with this. It is quite possible that it is doing this. When this happens, the head has become a conscious part of the universal Existence and the head responds to the universal Existence.</p>
<p>There is an occult way of developing oneness with the universal Consciousness. That is what you considered as breathing. An occultist will touch his right knee, for example, and he will make himself feel that the knee is his only reality that is part and parcel of the universal Consciousness. He has no name, no existence other than his knee. Then the occultist will feel that his knee is breathing and it alone has life, nothing else. Or the seeker can touch one finger saying only this finger exists. His whole existence is the finger — he doesn’t have hair, he doesn’t have legs, he doesn’t have shoulders. This finger alone is responding to the universal breathing. So when you feel that your head is breathing, that means that your head has become consciously part of the universal Consciousness. It is a very good experience.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you get a higher experience, it is something that will nourish you, feed you, strengthen you and illumine your life. But if you are exhausted, your energy is drained, that means that you have pulled beyond your capacity. Otherwise, right after meditation, if it is proper meditation, you gain the strength of a lion. Sometimes it happens that you feel that you have gone high, very high, and then you have distributed everything that you have received. But that has not happened in your case.</p>
