<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one has great faith in his own religion, then he should cultivate the same type of faith in other religions, only he should not follow all the religions. Religion is like a road. If one tries to walk along all the roads while heading towards his destination, then his progress will be very slow. This moment he is on one road, the next moment he is on another road and the following moment he is on a third road. Each time he changes roads in order to reach the destination, naturally he is losing time. So the thing to do is to feel that each religion is true in its own way but that he prefers to walk along the path of the particular religion that he has. But all religions in God's Eye are equally significant and equally important.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not only possible but practicable and inevitable. If there is no mutual understanding, then there can be no respect; if there is no mutual respect, then there can be no mutual understanding. Mutual understanding and mutual respect go together. If there is mutual understanding and mutual respect, then only can the different religions feel an abiding harmony.</p>
<p>Each religion has to realise that in order to be complete, perfect and whole, it has to feel its presence in the heart of other religions. Likewise, the other religions also have to feel the presence of that particular religion. Each religion must feel its presence in the heart of other religions. Also, each religion has to feel that it is only a branch and not the whole tree. The tree is God or Truth. Some religions do not believe in God or find it difficult to reveal the existence of God, but they do believe in the existence of Truth. There is no religion on earth that does not believe in the existence of Truth. So if a religion believes in the existence of Truth then that is more than enough. This Truth-existence is the Reality-tree in life on earth. If Reality is a tree, then naturally it will have a few branches, and each branch is a religion.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the seeker fails to feel and understand that the living teacher is an embodiment of Jesus or the Buddha, then it is advisable for the seeker to have faith either in Jesus or in Sri Krishna or in the Buddha or in another spiritual Master who is not in the physical. If the seeker finds it difficult to feel or see the presence of the previous Masters in the living Master, then he should meditate on the one who he feels is best, according to his inner capacity, inner receptivity, inner devotedness, inner surrender. But if the seeker can feel that the living Master embodies Krishna-consciousness or Christ-consciousness, then he has no difficulty in approaching either the Christ or Sri Krishna through the living Master. The living Master is also the son of God, who has assumed a different name and different form. And the new form means a new personality, a new divine personality. Sri Ramakrishna declared, "He who was Krishna, he who was Buddha, he who was Rama, in one form is Sri Ramakrishna." Only the name or the form will change. The inner reality is one and the same. So if the seeker is advanced, then he is bound to feel that if the living Masters are real, then they are serving the same purpose. They are leading humanity to one goal.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one way we can encourage a world-wide recognition of the basic unity of all major religions. First we have to become perfect ourselves, as individuals. If we become God-loving and all the time are serving God in humanity, then our perfection will automatically encourage others to become perfect. When we become perfect, automatically our perfection will permeate the votaries of other religions. So, as individuals, we have to become perfect no matter which religion we belong to. Then our perfection will spread the perfume, the fragrance of the divinity-flower which is meant for all religions and lovers of religion. That flower is for everyone to appreciate and to grow into. Once everyone grows into his own divinity-flower, then everyone will see and feel the basic unity of all religions for the worship of the ultimate Truth in life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between Yoga, Zen and Hinduism?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between Yoga, Zen and Hinduism?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The root was Hinduism. Then from Hinduism came Buddhism, and from Buddhism came Zen. Let us take Hinduism as the grandfather, Buddhism as the father and Zen as the son.</p>
<p>Let us think of Hinduism as an eternal religion, or we can take it as a form of self-discipline that will one day allow us to feel boundless joy, boundless peace, boundless love. When we think of Buddhism, immediately the compassion-aspect of reality comes forward into our mind. The world needs compassion badly. I show compassion to you, you show compassion to me and with our mutual compassion we live on earth. When I am in need of your compassion, you show me compassion; when you are in need of my compassion, I show you compassion. In this way we exist together. If we don't show compassion to humanity, then we don't exist.</p>
<p>When we come to Zen, what we need is awareness. We have to be fully, consciously and constantly aware of what we are doing, what we are seeing, what we are growing into. Zen requires constant, conscious awareness. If we are meditating, we are aware of it; if we are eating, we are aware of it; if we are talking to our friend, we are aware of it.</p>
<p>When we come to Yoga, we sing the song of oneness. Yoga is a Sanskrit word that means oneness. Yoga says that if we establish our oneness with something or someone, with an incident or an experience, then we get everything. If I am one with you, then I know what is happening inside your heart, inside your mind. If I am one with somebody else, them immediately I have a free access to him and I know what is happening in him. And if I can establish my oneness with an incident or experience, then I become part and parcel of that incident or experience in life.</p>
<p>At the highest point in Zen there is something called Satori or illumination. If once you are illumined, then there is nothing and no one on earth with which or with whom you cannot establish your oneness. Before illumination there is darkness on one side and light on the other side. This side of the sea is darkness, the other side is light and you are in between. But if you go and take shelter in illumination, then your own inner effulgence envelops and encompasses the whole world. Before illumination takes place, you are in ignorance and you feel that the world is in ignorance. But once illumination takes place, which is called Satori in Zen, you become one with the Vision of the Absolute. At that time, you live in silence-life, you live in sound-life, but everywhere is illumination and you grow into this illumination. Once you are illumined, you are freed from the meshes of ignorance. For millennia you lived in ignorance, but once illumination has taken place, then there is no ignorance in you at all. This room is dark, but then an electrician brings in some light. For days and months and years this room has remained unlit, unillumined, dark, but then the electrician comes and the room is illumined. So the greatest gift of Zen is illumination: the highest illumination, all-illumining illumination, all-fulfilling illumination.</p>
<p>Yoga's greatest contribution is not only illumination, but also perfection in our constant oneness with what God has offered to us, what God is going to give us and what God Himself is. If somebody is suffering, then Yoga becomes totally, inseparably one with that sufferer. If somebody is in the seventh heaven of delight, then Yoga becomes one with him in the seventh heaven of delight. Illumination, on the other hand, is a process, a regular process in which we come out from ignorance-night and enter into wisdom-light. Once we grow into wisdom-light, then we are totally freed from bondage, from limitation, from imperfection, from so-called death.</p>
<p>If we follow the path of Zen, then we go from ignorance to illumination: and when our whole consciousness is illumined, we derive boundless satisfaction. If we follow the path of Yoga, then on the strength of our identification we feel that we <em>are</em> that which we want and we actually become that thing. So Yoga is oneness and perfection, whereas Zen is illumination and liberation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does this mean that Zen and Yoga have different goals?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does this mean that Zen and Yoga have different goals?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. They are like two members of a family. They belong to the same family and they deal with the same basic thoughts and ideas. Only in practice each may apply something a little new, although in a sense it is not new at all. Here is the goal. The father is reaching the goal from one direction and the son is reaching the goal from another direction. In going towards the goal, they may use different methods to some extent. But the goal always remains the same. If one becomes liberated from ignorance as a result of spiritual discipline, then naturally he is illumined. And if one identifies himself with Light and Illumination itself, then naturally he also is liberated and illumined</p>
<p>I touch water and immediately I get the consciousness of water. I touch a wall and immediately I get the consciousness of the wall. Again, if I touch the feet of a saint, then immediately I get the consciousness of the saint. This is Yoga: oneness, oneness, oneness. But you don't have to touch anything. Just through identification you can get the consciousness of the person who is a saint, the person who has illumination. In the Zen process, you get what the saint has by concentrating on what you want. The process in Yoga is to identify oneself with the goal. But the goal that you reach by concentrating in Zen and the goal that I reach by identifying myself with someone is the same.</p>
<p>There is a very good Zen teacher in Rochester named Philip Kapleau. He is a friend of mine and a great authority on Zen. He wrote a book called <em>The Three Pillars of Zen.</em> If you are interested, you can learn from him. Again, if you feel like coming to our meditations on Tuesdays and Fridays here, you can see what we get from our meditation. If you can come and join us, I assure you that you will feel something.</p>
<p>I am in no way trying to take you away from Zen; far from it. Let us take meditation as one shop and Zen as another shop. If you come into a shop, there will be some items that may please you. Basically, these two shops offer the same thing: love of truth. You enter into one shop and it has the thing that you need; you enter into another shop and it has the same thing. It is you who have to make the choice from which shop you want to get the thing that you need.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there no sense of strong discipline in Yoga?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there no sense of strong discipline in Yoga?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Zen process demands a strict discipline, almost like military discipline. But the Yoga process is relaxation based upon confidence. It is like a child's confidence that comes from his oneness with his mother and father. A child does not have a nickel with him. But if his father is very rich, then he feels that he also is very rich. Even if right now he does not have a single dollar, in a few years time he will be able to utilise all his father's riches. He feels his oneness with his father, with the members of the family. Whatever the members of the family have, he rightly and legitimately claims as his very own. If his father has a car, then immediately he feels that it is his car. He does not think that it is his father's car or that it belongs to his family. No, he will tell his friends, "Look, this is my car." He is absolutely right on the strength of his oneness. And a day will come when he is older and he is going to be the one to drive that car.</p>
<p>The child feels that the father is everything for him and a day will come when he will be able to claim everything the father has. Even now he claims it. Since he is a child, he may squander his father's money, so his father is not giving it to him. But when he is mature, since he has established his oneness with his father, he will be able to get his father's property and utilise it properly.</p>
<p>In the Yoga process, you just feel that God is yours, that He loves you and you love Him. You feel your oneness with the Almighty. And if you feel your oneness with the Almighty, He is bound to give you what He has and what He is.</p>
<p>In the Zen path you have to prepare yourself. If you do this, then you will get something. But if you are not following strict discipline, then you are not going to get anything. In Zen it is personal effort, personal effort. But in Yoga we believe in grace. We feel that the father will show his affection, love and compassion and the child will reciprocate. When the child gets love from his father, he himself gives love, when the child shows love to his parents, they give him love in return. Always there is give and take, give and take. But with Zen, first you have to become something and then only you will get something. And you become something, you grow into something by following strict discipline. If you follow strict discipline in your own life, if you do this, if you do that, than you become something. Once you become, then naturally you deserve, and illumination takes place.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we stay in the heart when we are doing tasks which involve the mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we stay in the heart when we are doing tasks which involve the mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can remain in the heart, even when the mind is necessary to perform specific tasks, if we know that we are not the mind or the body or the vital, but the heart. If we know that we are nothing but the heart and that we have nothing but the heart, then automatically everything that we do is being done in and through the heart. Now we feel that we have a mind, we have a vital, we have a body, we have a heart and we have a soul. But if we feel that we have only one thing, the heart, then naturally we will use only that one thing when we want to achieve something or give something.</p>
<p>If we feel that we have many levels of being then naturally we will be tempted, we will be inspired to use all these when we feel it is necessary. But if we can make ourselves feel that what we have and what we are is the aspiring heart, then the consciousness of the heart will come to the fore and inundate the whole body from top to bottom, from the sole of the foot to the crown of the head. If I repeat, "I am the heart, I am the heart," then we will only have the heart's consciousness no matter what we do. Then the problem of the mind's involvement in our activities will not arise. For we are not using the mind as such; we are using only the thing that we claim to be our own, our very own, and that is the heart.</p>
<p>So if you always think of yourself as the all-loving heart, all-illumining heart, then the heart itself will take care of the so-called problems that we face every day in our multifarious activities.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What are the major qualities of the United Nations soul?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What are the major qualities of the United Nations soul?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many, many qualities but universal oneness is the most important quality that the soul of the United Nations wants to offer. This universal oneness houses both the one and the many. The United Nations is like a tree with countless branches. Here many have become one and, again, one has become many. This moment the United Nations is the tree; the next moment it is the countless branches. A tree without branches is not a tree. Again, if the branches do not belong to a tree, then they cannot exist. Many become one for realisation and one becomes many for manifestation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What do the delegates and ambassadors who are participating in the General Assembly offer to the United Nations spiritually?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What do the delegates and ambassadors who are participating in the General Assembly offer to the United Nations spiritually?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am giving only my own inner feeling. Since all the delegates, all the diplomats, have a heart and a soul they have the best intention to serve mankind as such. From the practical point of view, they may not succeed. But their intention is always good. Otherwise, they would not come to the United Nations to be of service. Their inner motive is excellent. However, when we try to do things on the outer plane, we often meet with countless problems. If we give way to these problems then we don't succeed.</p>
<p>But all the diplomats and delegates have something spiritual to offer. They have come, first of all, to serve their country, their nation. Their nation is not one person but thousands and millions of people. They represent their nation, so millions of people are inside them, speaking through them to the world at large. So the message that the ambassador of a nation gives is something that the nation wants the whole world to hear. It is the nation's collective freedom or collective contribution to mankind that the ambassador is offering. Therefore, we must realise there is something deep or meaningful inside him, something fruitful inside him. This very thing, on the outer plane, may not bear fruit all at once. But just because it does not bear fruit immediately, we cannot say that the nation does not have a good motive or that the individual who represents the nation has a bad intention.</p>
<p>Each delegate is a human being and each human being has a soul. That means a solid portion of God's Consciousness-Light is inside each individual. Each individual has the capacity, the potentiality, the needed power to serve mankind spiritually. But it takes time. Some individuals open up to the light sooner than others. But nobody — no diplomat or delegate or individual — can live without in some way offering to the Source the love, concern, sympathy, compassion, devotedness and all the other good qualities that come from the Source.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What should our attitude be toward working at the United Nations?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What should our attitude be toward working at the United Nations?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our attitude should be one of conscious self-giving. This self-giving can take various forms on the outer plane. Here we are dealing with many individuals. If we find it difficult to give ourselves to many individuals, many countries, at least we can have an attitude of forgiveness. We forgive in order to make forward progress.</p>
<p>If we have so-called enemies, then we will all the time harbour evil thoughts towards our enemies. When we feel that we have enemies around us we actually forget our own goal. We think only of our enemies — how to conquer them, how to annihilate them. This becomes our goal. Then what kind of progress are we going to make?</p>
<p>So the best attitude is to always think of the goal. The goal is always found in self-giving. The more we can give soulfully, the sooner we shall get satisfaction in what we are doing or what we are growing into. Each individual knows how to offer some things to the world at large. Each individual knows how to offer something to his body, vital, mind, heart and soul. Only we have to do it.</p>
<p>We create thoughts, ideas and ideals. Let us say that a thought has entered into our mind. Immediately if we want to nourish that thought, we can put a good feeling into the thought. And that feeling comes from the heart itself. If we do not nourish the thought with our heart's psychic feelings, the thought remains powerless, it remains unfulfilled. Here we are talking about attitudes on the mental plane. But the real divinity, or the real essence of anything divine, lies only inside the heart. So anything that we see in the form of creation or anything that we create ourselves must be nourished by the feelings of the heart.</p>
<p>At every moment we can be attacked by negative thoughts, assailed by undivine thoughts. Again, at every moment with our inner will we can create good thoughts, loving thoughts, illumining thoughts, fulfilling thoughts. These thoughts can only function properly when we have an inner feeling from the heart.</p>
<p>The feelings of the heart we can increase only by self-giving. Right now we use the term "self-giving" precisely because we have not sufficiently cultivated or developed the capacity that makes us feel that we are of the one and for the many. We have not yet discovered our universal oneness. But once we have discovered our oneness with the rest of the world, then it is not self-giving; it is only the fulfilment of our own inner awakening. When my hand does some thing for my leg or vice versa, they do not take it as self-giving. Hand and leg are part and parcel of one reality; they are one reality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at the present state of our evolution, our limited vision has not granted us the capacity to feel everyone as our own. So let us start with the idea of self-giving. We shall give what we have and what we are; we shall give our good thoughts.</p>
<p>So the best attitude right now is the attitude of self-giving. If there are adversaries, wrong forces or others who do not see eye to eye with us, then we have to move forward on the strength of our forgiveness-capacity or our forgetfulness. We shall not forget our ideal, no. We will forget only unhappy, unhealthy experiences that we get from others while we are trying to serve the divine purpose within us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can you overcome feelings of resentment and anger that you feel when your superiors appear to be unfair?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can you overcome feelings of resentment and anger that you feel when your superiors appear to be unfair?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we work in a group, there are many individuals, many ideas, many thoughts and propensities working together. But we have to do our best to feel that all the individuals in the group, all the ideas and propensities, are part and parcel of our own existence. We have to feel that they are all limbs of our own body, and that all our limbs are working together.</p>
<p>We feel that our superiors do not understand us, do not value us, do not appreciate our sincere effort and dedication. By arguing with our superiors, by trying our utmost to convince them that they are wrong or that they have no feeling of oneness and sympathy with us, we cannot change their way of life. But if we take them as part and parcel of our own existence and feel that we belong to them and that they belong to us, then we can change them.</p>
<p>If we consider our superiors as human beings who are totally different from us, who are perfect strangers to our ideals, ideas and goals, then we shall never be able to get happiness from life. We have to consider our superiors as limbs, or as branches of the one reality-tree. Then, if we notice that one branch is not functioning well, we try to cure that particular branch with our inner love, inner concern, inner light. If today our arms are defective, or if any part of our existence-reality is suffering from a particular shortcoming, what do we do? We focus all our concentration on the defective part and show it all our concern, love, sweetness and affection. We try to muster the rest of our being and show all concern to the defective part. And we eventually cure the defective part.</p>
<p>By a mere wishful attitude we cannot bring this about. In order to do this most effectively, we have to pray and meditate in silence to the Author of all good. It is He alone who has the capacity to cure a defective limb, and He is more than willing to listen to our prayer for the transformation of our so-called "superiors." So, it is only our inner prayer and meditation that can eventually and radically change their life. But before that happens, we can try to feel that they belong to us and we belong to them. We can feel that their misunderstanding, their lack of faith in us and lack of appreciation for what we do, is a fault, a defect, in our own existence-reality.</p>
<p>Again, we have to know that the appreciation of our so-called "superiors" is not of real importance. In the long run, in the plan of our evolution, it may be of no avail at all. If we get joy from our own service to the body and the soul of the United Nations, then only we are doing the right thing. What matters is not what our superiors are telling us, or what opinion of us they have. No, what is of paramount importance is how sincerely we are trying to serve the United Nations. When we work at the United Nations, we are trying to please the body and the soul of the United Nations, and not just our superiors. If we can please the Real in us, God, then we are also pleasing the same real Existence that is in our superiors. If we are only for the satisfaction of the Real in us and in all human beings, then our superiors are also included. So, automatically a day will come when the Real in us will change the minds and attitudes of our superiors. As a matter of fact, there is only one superior and that superior is our inner cry for perfection, more perfection, most perfection, continuous perfection in our own life, in each human life and in each creation of God. Our cry for perfection is the only superior reality in us and for us.</p>
