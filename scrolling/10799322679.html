<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends. Suppose you feel that It Is a very Important matter and that the person is talking in a rude, undivine manner. At that time say to the person, "Please be calm and quiet and talk politely. I am ready to hear you." But if the person is only coming to harass and bother you, at that time you have every right to tell him to leave. If it is only casual talk and the person becomes unnecessarily rude and unkind, at that time tell him to leave you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you realise God, He will not ask you, "What did he think of you?" or "What did she think of you?" God will immediately ask you, "What did you think of yourself?" or "What did you think of Me?" God will not ask you what others thought of you. As soon as you stand in front of God, He is not going to give you a pass-mark according to others' opinions of you. He is not going to look to see whether others appreciated or admired you. No, He is the boss; He doesn't need others' recommendation. When You go to the Supreme, at that time He will not ask what the world thought of you: He will ask if you paid attention to your spiritual life of aspiration and dedication. And you will have to prove that you have done this and you have done that for Him.</p>
<p>Suppose someone speaks highly of you. Do you think that person is lifting you up to the top of the Himalayas? Similarly, by depreciating you, by speaking ill of you, that person can't bring you down. No! His opinion has no value. You are to God what you actually are: what you think of yourself and what you think of God in yourself. Your assessment is your own value. Again, our assessment may not always he right. Sometimes we think we are pure, but we are impure; but no harm. When we make a wrong assessment, God is there to show us compassion and kindness. But God doesn't want us to waste a single minute worrying about what others think of us. Your life is God's Life. God's Life and your life are inseparable and God doesn't need the opinion of the world to assess what you are doing. If you are praying and meditating, you are an excellent seeker. Your action is your certificate; your action is everything in God's eye.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we don't keep our awareness, what happens? We become friends with inconscience and ignorance. And when we keep our awareness, when we remain alert, what happens? If we are alert we go much faster. Alertness is speed in life if we have to cover twenty miles, if we are alert, nothing can distract us or prevent us from running the fastest toward the goal. If we have a goal, then we can discard unnecessary things. Suppose your goal is a Master's degree. If you go to movies and night clubs, how can you reach your goal? There is a goal and you want to run the fastest to the goal. So naturally you are going to do the thing that will automatically make you run the fastest. And that is to keep your awareness. If always you think of the goal, then there will be inspiration, aspiration and an inner urge to reach the goal as soon as possible.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can conquer the dark forces provided you know who your boss, your supreme boss, is. You have to feel that the forces are like two little boys. One is divine and the other is undivine. The divine one is afraid of the undivine one because the undivine one wants to strike him and he feels he doesn't have enough strength to put up a brave fight. But if he sees that his father is standing beside him, he knows his father has more power than the other boy and will protect him. If you feel the presence of the Supreme inside you, the hostile forces can't attack you because there is someone to protect you. If they attack, immediately He will come and frighten them. Just as the little divine boy knows his eternal Father is inside him to protect him, save him and illumine him, you also have to feel that the Absolute Supreme is inside you to do the needful for you. Provided you have confidence in Him, He will do everything for you and He will not allow the undivine forces to come and attack you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation is conscious awareness of God. Here we are all seekers. When we are seekers, it is our duty to become aware of God twenty-four hours a day. If we are believers in God, then naturally we feel that God exists. But this feeling is not spontaneous; it does not last twenty-four hours a day. When we meditate, we come to feel and realise twenty-four hours a day that we are of God and we are for God. Constant and conscious awareness of God-His Truth, Light and Bliss-is called meditation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can one increase one&#039;s purity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can one increase one&#039;s purity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can increase one's purity by repeating a special word or mantra. There can be no better word than 'God'. One can repeat 'God' while breathing in and out. While breathing in, you have to feel that at least seven breaths are coming inside each breath and offering you more life-energy. While breathing in, repeat 'God', and inside the breath try to see God seven times. And then, after some time, try to see or feel God fourteen times. In this way, try to increase your purity by increasing your count.</p>
<p>There is also something else which I advise my students to do. Start repeating God's Name right from today. Today you try to repeat God's Name twenty times most soulfully, tomorrow thirty times, the next day forty times. In this way, you bring the number up to one hundred. Then you start descending: ninety, eighty, seventy, sixty, fifty, forty, thirty, twenty, until the circle is complete. When you try to increase the number please use your imagination to feel that your purity is increasing. And when you decrease the number at that time please feel that you are not decreasing the number; you are only assimilating the increased purity that you have felt. While going up, try to increase your purity, and while going down try to assimilate in your system the purity-force that you achieved by repeating God's Name.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What Is God? Where is He?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What Is God? Where is He?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is everywhere. But if we do not see Him or feel Him inside our hearts, then we will not be able to see Him anywhere. First, we have to see Him within us and talk to Him inside our hearts. If we do this, then only will we be able to see God elsewhere also. If inside our heart God is missing, then we shall not be able to see God anywhere and we shall not be able to speak to God or mix with God.</p>
<p>Now, what is God? God is both formless and with form. He is pure energy and, at the same time, He is the most luminous form. He is endless energy and beginningless energy; and He is also the most luminous form. God is both water and ice. Some people like water, while others like ice. Again, some people at times like to drink water and at times like to have ice.</p>
<p>It depends on the seeker and what he wants. He may want to see God in a human form — but as absolutely divine, supreme, perfect. He feels that if there is a form, then it will be easier for him to recognise God or realise God. So he likes to see the personal God. But again, if one says that he wants to go beyond the personal God, beyond form, beyond duality and remain always in the infinite Peace, Light and Bliss, that also can be done. And the same seeker can in the morning ask for God with form-attributes and in the evening cry for God as formless, boundless energy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can one maintain inner tranquillity at work when he is in an atmosphere with a great deal of pressure?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can one maintain inner tranquillity at work when he is in an atmosphere with a great deal of pressure?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can maintain inner tranquillity no matter what happens in his office or how many wrong forces from the office try to assail him. He can do this provided he feels that the forces which are attacking him are in no way a match for his love of Light.</p>
<p>Let us take an attack as a force of darkness. When you are in the office you are constantly attacked by the force of doubt, which is the representative of darkness. If you feel that you have nothing to break these forces, then you are totally lost. You have to feel that inside your heart there is something called Light — boundless Light — and that this boundless luminosity is definitely more powerful than the attacker. This Light that you have inside you can easily transform these forces. When darkness consciously or unconsciously enters into Light, it is bound to be transformed. You will be able to feel this just because you pray, just because you meditate, just because you want to increase your love of God every day, every hour, every minute, every second. Each second you are aware of God's Presence inside your heart, so you can rest assured that you definitely embody Light and that this Light is constantly increasing in you. And if you see a constant increase of divine Light inside your heart, that means there is something immortal inside you which will never surrender to the wrong forces.</p>
<p>The wrong forces are coming from outside; and inside, the strongest force, the mightiest force, is Light. When you can bring your mightiest force, Light, to the fore, then you will see to your great astonishment that the outer forces immediately will give way, because the inner force is in constant communication with the Source, the Almighty Absolute. So the more you can increase your inner Light, which is the divine force, the sooner you will see that the outer wrong forces which are attacking you will be transformed into Light. When darkness consciously or unconsciously enters into Light, it is bound to be transformed.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have colleagues in your own department, and they speak to you every day. The days you meditate they see something totally different in you from the days when you do not meditate. If you have achieved something in your meditation, they are bound to see something pleasing, soothing, beautiful, enlightening and illumining. So the higher and deeper your meditation, the more your face and outer being will radiate. When your being radiates, your friends and colleagues will see something totally new. At the same time, they will feel something familiar although they don't know what it is. Why familiar? Because we have all come from the same Source. They have not discovered this secret, whereas you have discovered it. You have tried, you have practised meditation. They have not yet practised it, but they will. Your own example — not only your example, but your very presence — will inspire them.</p>
<p>Here on earth oneness is not established. Oneness you cannot establish on the ordinary human level where there is anxiety, worry, fear and doubt — unless you aspire. If you aspire, then your inner being tries to act all the time like a magnet. It tries to see whether there is someone whom it can call its own. So, if somebody is sitting beside you with divine joy, divine love, divine peace, then naturally the magnet that you have inside you will draw these divine qualities from that person. Again, if an unaspiring person sits beside you, who is given to worldly life and worldly temptation, immediately you will find a kind of restlessness inside your own being.</p>
<p>Outwardly, you don't have to tell others hundreds of times how you have changed your life or what you can do for them. This you can tell them once in a blue moon, but it will be almost useless. But they will see you on two different days: one day when you have not meditated well and on another day after you have had a good meditation. The day you have meditated well, they will see a tremendous change in you. They will try to know what makes you on one day divine and what makes you on another day undivine. What is It that they want to have from you when you meditate, and what is it that they don't want from you when you do not meditate? What they do not want is darkness and ignorance. What they want is the inner divinity which comes to the fore and tries to illumine the persons and the things around you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, meditation is for everybody whether he is consciously seeking God or not. The only thing is that one has to know how far one wants to go. Somebody can study at the kindergarten. Again, somebody else can go on to high school, college and university and get a Master's degree or Ph.D. But this is outer knowledge. Meditation gives us inner wisdom.</p>
<p>You may be satisfied with an iota of inner wisdom. Again, you may find that you can satisfy yourself only with boundless Peace, Light and Bliss. So it depends on where the seeker wants to stop. Just as we go to school for outer knowledge we have to meditate in order to get inner wisdom. If the seeker wants to be satisfied only with a fraction of Peace, Light and Bliss, then he will get it. And if he wants to get boundless Peace, Light and Bliss, then he shall also get that provided he continues to meditate regularly, devotedly, soulfully, unreservedly and unconditionally.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life good character is of paramount importance. Good character means that life-energy — soulful, boundless energy — is operating in and through the seeker. If the seeker does not see the boundless Energy, Peace, Light and Bliss, then how can he remain in his highest consciousness?</p>
<p>If one is a seeker, then he has to be a man of character otherwise, his life will be contradictory. God is all purity. It is through purity that one realises God. If one wants to realise God as fast as possible, then purity must come first. To make real, solid, tangible progress, purity is indispensable. Now, if one does not have a good character, then how can that person have purity? And if one does not have purity inside the heart and inside the physical then how can he make progress?</p>
<p>Purity and character come simultaneously. If someone has inner purity, then he also has good character. And if there is somebody with good character then he is maintaining in his inner life tremendous purity. Purity is the ladder we climb up in order to reach God's Abode. If there is no ladder, then how can we climb up?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What does it mean to be a spiritual Master?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What does it mean to be a spiritual Master?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A spiritual Master is a private tutor. He is the elder brother in the family. Either you can call him a private tutor or you can call him an elder brother. The school teacher examines the student and either fails or passes him according to merit. If he has done well, the teacher will pass him in the examination. If he has not done well, the teacher will dispense justice. But the private tutor will all the time teach the student at home so that he can pass the examination. The spiritual teacher privately teaches the student how to stand in front of ignorance and face ignorance so that when ignorance challenges him, he will be able to pass the examination.</p>
<p>Again, the teacher is the eldest member in the family. Just because he has a little more Peace, Light and Bliss than others, God has chosen him to give his little Peace, Light and Bliss to his younger brothers and sisters. He knows that he is not the father. And, also, his younger brothers and sisters know that he is not the father. The father is somebody else. But because he is the elder brother, he is supposed to know where the father is. The elder brother of the family tells the younger ones: "Come, I will show you where our Father is." And once he can bring the younger ones to their common Father, his role is over. They will be on their own as soon as he shows them where the Father is.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we practise spirituality, if we pray and meditate soulfully, our very illumination will encourage others. It is we who have to be illumined first before we can encourage others. The world will be inspired by us only when we grow into something and become something. Each individual's religion is, after all, his code of life. His code of life is his religion. When his life responds to some higher, deeper realities, then it is meaningful and fruitful and it can inspire others.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can the different religions best respect and value each other?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can the different religions best respect and value each other?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each religion must feel that it is nothing but a branch. If there is a branch, then there has to be a tree; and the tree is love of truth. Truth finds fulfilment only when it embraces the Vast as its very own. Each religion has to feel the necessity of embracing other religions for its own satisfaction, for its own perfection. Alone it can never be satisfied, alone it can never be perfect. Two hands are required to produce a sound. Similarly, two things or even more will be needed to create something beautiful, soulful and fruitful. But when you go deep within, you do not see two things or three things; you see only one thing that Is operating in and through many forms, many ideas, many ideals and realisations.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can tell your mother that you studied in that particular school and you did not care for it. Now you are studying in a different school and you like the teacher, you like the students and you like what you are being taught. The Catholic Church teaches Truth, Light, Peace and Bliss. You are also trying to bring to the fore Truth, Light, Peace and Bliss in a different way. So if you take the Roman Catholic Church as a school and our spiritual organisation as another school, then you have every right to say that you like one particular school and not another, and that is why you are going to that school.</p>
