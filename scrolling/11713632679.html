  <h2 id="page-title">Question: After we pray and offer it to you, is there anything we can do on the outer plane to create more harmony in a situation where we are in charge of something when there has been gossip or criticism?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: After we pray and offer it to you, is there anything we can do on the outer plane to create more harmony in a situation where we are in charge of something when there has been gossip or criticism?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, you have to make yourself more humble than a blade of grass. The second thing is to feel that you are not indispensable for this project. The responsibility for its success or progress depends on God. The feeling that you are indispensable has to go, and you have to feel that if you do not succeed, in no way will I blame you or delay your God-realisation — far from it! Anything that you are involved in, you will try your best, but then you have to say, "This much I can do. O God, give me more Grace so that I can do better." The easiest way to create harmony is to discard the feeling of supremacy. As long as supremacy looms large, there is no harmony. Today, America is suffering because of its feeling of supremacy. When there is a feeling of supremacy, you can forget about harmony.</p>
<p>Another way to create harmony is to offer others appreciation. If someone has done something wrong, just say to that person, "If I had been in your position, I would have done something infinitely worse." This is not false modesty; this is the way you can lift up the other person. You know for sure that you are not going to do such a stupid thing or bad thing. But to make that person happy, you will say, "In your circumstances, I would have done something infinitely worse." By saying this, you will have already raised his standard high. He will be getting joy by thinking that he is not alone in making the mistake. Then you can play a trick. You can say, "I do not think I have the capacity to do it any better, but I strongly feel that you have the capacity to do it better, and you will succeed." In a clever way you will be turning a sinner into a saint. You can call it cleverness or wisdom. I call it wisdom. You are using wisdom to change the life of someone and help him turn over a new leaf. You will never say that he is bad. If you say that he is bad, then you are creating one more enemy in your life. If you want to help anybody, if you want to raise someone up, there are two ways. One way is to offer advice, but who is going to listen to your advice? The other way, if you really want to lift someone up, is to bend. If you want to lift someone on your shoulders, do you keep your body erect? No, you bend. When you bend, you lower your own height so that the other person can climb on top of you. When he is high on your shoulders, in terms of height he is higher than your head, but whom will people appreciate? People will appreciate you because it is you who lifted him up. Once you lift him, you get the credit because you are so strong.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: It seems that as life goes on, responsibilities multiply. Is there a point where a job, a house and all the other things become a burden on our aspiration?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: It seems that as life goes on, responsibilities multiply. Is there a point where a job, a house and all the other things become a burden on our aspiration?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. Always think that each responsibility is an opportunity to please God. If you take responsibility as a heavy elephant on your shoulders, then you are doomed. You will feel that your responsibilities are killing you. Always we have to use wisdom. If you have ten responsibilities, then you have to feel that you have ten opportunities. If you can please God, our Beloved Supreme, in ten different ways, will He not be happy?</p>
<p>If you think of responsibility as a heavy burden on your shoulders, you will be miserable. You will say, "Others are better off. They do not have any responsibility, but they get the same smile from Guru. They do nothing, nothing. I am going to another city to lead a Centre and doing so many things that prevent me from being in Guru's physical presence. Then he is smiling at others in exactly the same way." These kinds of thoughts will torture you.</p>
<p>If you take responsibility as opportunity, you will say, "I am so lucky to have this opportunity. Who cares what others are doing? They are not qualified in this field. That is why Guru is sending me to this place and that place. If he has confidence in me, then I should also develop confidence that I can please him in his own way." Every time a new responsibility comes, take it as a golden opportunity. When you say 'golden opportunity', then you are bound to get joy. Opportunity carries a sweeter than the sweetest feeling, whereas responsibility can carry a bitter feeling.</p>
<p>Your name means progress, faster than the fastest progress. How will you make faster than the fastest progress? By taking responsibility as such? No. Always take responsibility as opportunity. In my case, at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram I had only two or three responsibilities, but in the beginning that was enough to destroy my joy. To somebody I had to go each day and give a rose from the Mother. At first I did not like to do it, but later the divine in me took it as an opportunity. Then I had to distribute raw eggs from the Mother. It was my responsibility not to drop and break the raw eggs. These were the kinds of responsibilities I had. Now, daily hundreds of responsibilities loom large before me. I take them all as opportunities because the Divine in me really takes them that way. Similarly, in your case, take each responsibility as an opportunity. And if you have the capacity to please the Supreme in ten ways, why do you have to restrict yourself to only one?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I wanted to see beauty in myself because that is what my soul&#039;s name is. I felt like my soul told me, &quot;If you want to see me, then you have to see beauty and goodness in other people.&quot; Is that a legitimate experience of my soul?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I wanted to see beauty in myself because that is what my soul&#039;s name is. I felt like my soul told me, &amp;quot;If you want to see me, then you have to see beauty and goodness in other people.&amp;quot; Is that a legitimate experience of my soul?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely. But do not take others as separate from yourself. Take them as an extension of your own being, your own earthly existence. When you look in a mirror, you can see any part of your body. You can hold up your little finger and see if it is good or beautiful. Then you can hold up two, three or four fingers. If they are your own fingers, you will always see them as good. In the same way, take each individual that you are encountering as a limb of your own body. If you take them as a third person, it may be very difficult to see beauty in them. A third person can be a friend or he can easily be an enemy. My little finger is not my enemy. My thumb is not my enemy. Any part of my physical body is not my enemy. They are my friends. In a machine, we need all the parts. In the same way that you take your body as one unit, you have to take each human being as part and parcel of your own reality. When you can feel this, it is very, very easy to see good things. If you want to appreciate yourself, easily you can because you are under no obligation to listen to others who may say, "Oh, she is not beautiful."</p>
<p>Always take the whole world as part and parcel of your own existence. Do not take the world as a third party. If you take the world as a third party, then competition comes forward. Always see the world inside you — not before you, around you or behind you. See the world inside your own heart, inside your own divine reality. This divine reality is all beauty. Beauty is blossoming sleeplessly and breathlessly inside your heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Before I do anything, I always weigh the pros and cons. Is this a bad habit?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Before I do anything, I always weigh the pros and cons. Is this a bad habit?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You weigh the pros and cons because your mind is so powerful. Luckily your mind surrenders to your heart. Definitely it surrenders to your heart, but it gives a brave fight before it surrenders! In some cases, the heart loses in the battlefield of life. In your case, the heart wins eventually. Always what we need is the heart's intensity, the heart's feeling of oneness with the Master's will. Recently I asked you to do something. You knew what I wanted, but you were giving the excuse that you did not have enough money. But if you use your heart, then money comes out of the blue because your oneness with me is bound to work a miracle. When anyone identifies himself with my heart, then my heart can create constant miracles.</p>
<p>If God asks me to do something, that means He has given me the capacity to do it. I could not have done anything that I have done for the world if God had not given me the capacity. Similarly, when I ask someone to do something, I am absolutely sure that God has given that person the capacity. Otherwise, I will not open my big mouth. No, no, no. If I ask you to do something, rest assured that the capacity is given, even more than you need, because it has come from the highest Source. A mother knows whether her child will be able to lift up one pound or two pounds or five pounds. In exactly the same way, when God tells us to do something, He knows how much capacity we have. At that time, God will not ask us to do anything beyond our capacity. In almost all cases, our problems can be solved in a better way if we use the heart instead of the mind.</p>
