<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you walk through the city, you can elbow people, you can push this way and that and you can strike someone. Then you will feel that you are very smart. This is aggression. But dynamism does not mean that you will elbow your way through a crowd. On the contrary, dynamism means only that you will be very wise and you will not lose any opportunity to manifest the Supreme. Aggression comes from the physical vital, but dynamism comes from the illumined vital.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Total humility comes first. Humility is the best thing, but even in humility there is a sense of two persons: "I am humble to somebody else." In real surrender, there is no superiority; each one is the other's own illumined part. Unconditional surrender is infinitely more important than divine humility. Many people who are humble may not aspire for the light that they will immediately get from unconditional surrender. Humility can have tremendous devotion, but the cheerfulness of oneness is not there. In unconditional surrender, whatever the Master says, the individual will do immediately and cheerfully. Surrender means real oneness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you were not aware of it at one point, you could not have asked me about it now. Something does take place, and when you actually have the experience, at that time you are aware of it.</p>
<p>There are many planes of consciousness. It is like a ladder. After the experience you came down through various descending rungs. Right now there is no link between the last rung and the rung on which you had the experience. Now you are in the physical consciousness, which is where most of us remain during the day. So the experience that you had in the inner world cannot function properly, since the physical consciousness in most cases does not have a free access to the plane of consciousness where the experience occurred. Only when the physical consciousness is surcharged with the divine light can it have a free access to all the planes of consciousness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we continually aspire for spiritual purity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we continually aspire for spiritual purity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When an individual does not have purity, then he is in no way better than an undivine, aggressive, strangling animal. If you can sincerely feel this, then you are bound to make progress in achieving spiritual purity. See what an individual is when he does not have purity, and then see what he is and what he can be when he has purity. If somebody has been without purity for one week, and the following week he starts developing or crying for purity, then he himself can be the observer or judge. Immediately he will see the difference. When he makes the comparison, he will see that the first week he was leading an animal life and the second week he was leading the life of a saint.</p>
<p>Always try to make a comparison: what you were and what you are and what you are going to become. Just compare yesterday's impure life to today's pure life. When you see the yawning gulf, the enormous distance between the two, automatically the strength of your purity increases. You have to know what you were before you accepted the spiritual life and what you have become and are going to become by walking along the spiritual path. It was a little bit of inner purity that brought you to the spiritual life and, as your purity increased, your progress in the spiritual life also increased. We were animals, we are human and we are going to become divine all by virtue of our inner purity. In this way you can feel the importance of purity in the spiritual life, and if you feel its importance, you are bound to aspire for it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you consider God on the physical, vital, mental or psychic plane, or any other plane except His own highest plane, then He will have more love for me than for Himself. Where there is a sense of separativity between God and me, and I am even one inch lower than He is, then He will have more love for me, because I am His child. A mother has more love for her child than for herself.</p>
<p>The Creator has more love for the creation than for Himself. But if the Creator feels that He and His creation are of the same standard, that He and His creation are inseparably one, at that time you cannot separate them; you cannot say who is loving whom more. The Supreme is loving me more when I pray to my highest Consciousness. But when I enter into my highest Consciousness, at that time there is no difference between the Supreme and me, for we are totally one.</p>

<p>I do not need human appreciation. But when my disciples appreciate me, at that time they enter into me with joy and love, and this gives me joy. Also, with their joy and love they can manifest the Highest.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is consciousness?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is consciousness?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Consciousness is the connecting link between earth and Heaven. It is found inside the physical body, the subtle body and the causal body. Consciousness and the soul are like twin brothers; or you can say that the soul is ice and consciousness is water. Ice and water go together. This moment it is ice; next moment it is water. Consciousness can be earth-bound or Heaven-bound, limited or unlimited. Consciousness is like a drop in the ocean. If we want to separate the drop from the ocean, we can. But we have to know that it is the drops that have made the ocean. If we take away the countless drops, then there is no ocean at all. Inside the drop, we see the consciousness of the ocean. If we touch the drop, then immediately we will feel the consciousness of the water. So the drop and the vast ocean go together. Consciousness can be like the drop; again, it can be a big wave and it can be the ocean itself.</p>
<p>Consciousness is always immortal. After death, naturally there is consciousness, because consciousness is just like a flow. Sometimes it goes very rapidly; sometimes it goes very slowly. But consciousness does not die. It may progress in some cases very slowly; sometimes its progress is not satisfactory. But consciousness never dies; it is always progressing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we say that someone's body is perfect, then we are just giving an overall view. But when we say "perfect perfection," it means that each cell is perfect; everything that is inside that body is perfect. Perfect perfection is the perfection of the entire being. Whatever the being has and whatever the being is, is perfect.</p>

PHRY 23-41. On 7 November 1977 Sri Chinmoy was interviewed by a reporter from the San Francisco Examiner. This is the transcript of the interview.</p>
<h2>Examiner: Do you have any disciples in India?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here in America I have four or five Indian disciples. But I do not have any spiritual Centre in India. I have quite a few admirers and followers in India, but I do not consider them to be my actual disciples.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What he thinks, he will say. I will say what I know. I am not trying to contradict his philosophy, but I know much better than anybody else does what I am and what I stand for. I have no idea why other spiritual Masters have come to the West. It is up to the individuals to answer this statement. In my case, I definitely listened to the dictates of my Inner Pilot. He wanted me to be of service to Him in the sincere seekers in the Western world, who are my spiritual brothers and sisters. He is like a father. A father has every right to have many homes, and if the father wants a particular son of his to go to some other house, and help or serve him inside the aspiration of his other children, then he is perfectly entitled to do so. And the son who is devoted to the father must listen to him. So America is one home of our Father Supreme, India is one home; Russia is one home; Japan is one home. All the countries are homes of our Eternal Father. And being the Father, He has every right to ask His children to move from one home to another to help His other children.</p>

They are delegates, diplomats and U.N. staff. Twice a week we pray and meditate there. Sometimes I give talks and answer spiritual questions.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, certainly. This world belongs to the Supreme, and He has many spiritual children who are in a position to be of help to sincere seekers. Now, there are some seekers who will be able to go much faster if they take help from somebody else, rather than from me. If I just accumulate them and keep them in my family for the sake of numbers, their progress will not be satisfactory, so I would be doing an act of injustice to their souls. But the ones who are meant for our path should be encouraged and accepted, for they will make the fastest progress on this path. I will never say that if somebody cannot follow our path, he is not spiritual, or he is not a sincere seeker. Far from it. But they are also my spiritual brothers, and if I know that by following some other path, they will go much faster, then I should advise them to follow that path. I want everybody to reach the Goal as soon as possible.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Familiar in the sense that I have read about them and heard a little about them from some seekers. But I am not in direct contact with other Masters, either inwardly or outwardly. Only I have a close connection with Pir Vilayat Khan, the head of the Sufi order. We are good friends.</p>
<p><em>Examiner:</em> He was here recently.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I think he was. But I have regard for all the sincere spiritual Masters.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this world there are good people and bad people. In God's creation there is day and there is night. But I am not in a position to say who are good teachers and who are bad teachers. Only I wish that the sincere seekers will get the good teachers. If they are really sincere, they will not remain with false teachers.</p>
