<p>When I run near Dobbs Ferry, I start near the Hudson River and run for three miles. The first mile is all uphill. At one point I run fifty metres straight to the top of a hill. Right at the top I am always attacked by dogs.</p>
<p>Once Nathan was bragging that the hills he runs in Arizona are very steep. So I told him, "You come with me." At first he didn't want to admit that the hills I ran were steeper. But when I started barking at him, he confessed that these were steeper and more difficult.</p>

<p>The other day, when I was in the car on my way to do hill work, I saw four girls at the one-mile mark — Tina, Christine, Diane and Irene. Instead of running, they were standing around in a circle.</p>
<p>Later, I heard that they have a club. They run together every morning. After one mile they meditate before going back.</p>

<p>During a two-mile race in Alley Pond Park, I saw a husband and wife who were also running. After twelve hundred metres the wife was unable to keep pace with the husband, and she wanted to give up. But the husband was encouraging her to continue. He was saying, "This is discipline. If you don't have discipline, you can't accomplish anything."</p>
<p>I thought, "This mantra that he is saying is absolutely descending from Heaven. God is speaking to her through her husband." I was so moved.</p>

<p>Rejean won the two-mile race in Cunningham Park today, and they gave him only a handshake. If the organisers of the race did not plan to give the winners anything, why did they charge a dollar fee to enter?</p>
<p>Since Rejean was the best runner, he should have shook their hands as hard as possible. Then they would have remembered his handshake. They might have forgotten his running, but they would never have forgotten his handshake.</p>
<p>So victory today went to Rejean. Abadh was second. Then just a little behind was Utpal. Nirvik also did well. He has broken his previous record.</p>

<p>Nirvik and I are great. First we ran a one-mile race in Eisenhower Park, and then we went to Central Park and ran five miles of hills, all up and down. Then we ran in the Green Leaves and Ripe Fruits race. A great Master and a great disciple! The only difference is, the disciple massages the Master after running, even while he himself is dying.</p>

<p>Early in the morning is the best time for running. There is no car problem. You can run in the middle of the street.</p>

<p>Saturday I was under a hundred and forty pounds. Then I ran in a two-mile race. During the race I felt that I had conquered the world, but after the race I felt tired and exhausted. Then relaxation started, and I gained four pounds.</p>

<p>Today I was running very fast, taking long strides. Each stride was at least fifty inches, going up to sixty-two.</p>
<p>The man who lives across from me was out with his dog. He was on the sidewalk and I was on the street. He always greets me first. But this time we just looked at each other. I did not recognise him, and he did not recognise me.</p>
<p>When I saw him enter into his house, I came to know who it was. Then I felt miserable. I said, "Every day he greets me, but today he did not greet me. "Baoul went to speak to him. He was very sad that he had not recognised me. So we both felt sad. I went home and felt sad, and he went home and felt sad.</p>
<p>Later I was playing the esraj on the porch, and he happened to be outside. Iraised my hand, and he smiled. In this way we compensated.</p>
