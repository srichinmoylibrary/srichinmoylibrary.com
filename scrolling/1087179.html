<p>There is a lady in Woodstock who has so many little, little crafts in her store. She also sells super-excellent flutes. After trying out two flutes, I told her the one I liked. Then she said, "I have a special surprise for you. It is a gift." She told me that Tanima had given her money to get a flute for me, and she had kept it aside. After I played on Tanima's flute, I saw that it was the best.</p>
<p>Anupadi had also gotten me a gift from that store. So I wanted to give the lady some money so that Tanima and Anupadi could get gifts for themselves the next time they came in.</p>
<p>I trusted the lady, but she insisted on giving me a receipt.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was shopping in Valdivia, Chile. I was looking at a jacket in a store window when all of a sudden Tanima's soul came to me and said, "Pretty!"</p>
<p>I asked her soul, "Is it the right size?"</p>
<p>The soul didn't know. So I went inside the store and saw the price was 5,500. I always bargain; it is an Indian tradition. But how could I bargain, since I didn't speak Spanish? So I wrote down 5,500 on a piece of paper, then crossed out the first 5 and wrote in 4. So it went on. The owner smiled at me and I smiled at her. Finally I bought the jacket.</p>

<p>It takes such a long time to buy things in Chile because you have to write down what you want. I went into a restaurant to buy 100 cups of yogurt, but they thought I wanted only 20 cups.</p>
<p>I tried to show them that I wanted five times 20, but they thought I wanted just five.</p>
<p>Finally I took out the 18 or 19 yogurts that were there and then asked for more. Then at last they understood.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Lost in Lima</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Lost in Lima" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I was told by a disciple that there is a particular street in Lima that sells lots of musical instruments. So Agraha, Savyasachi and I went looking for it. When we came to a one-way street, Agraha and I got out of the car, and I told Savyasachi to drive around and meet us from the other direction.</p>
<p>After walking a few blocks, Agraha asked someone in Spanish if there were some music stores on that side of the block. The person said it was on the other side of the block and in the other direction-on Emancipation Street.</p>
<p>I decided to walk three or four blocks in that direction while Agraha continued looking in the original direction. After six or eight blocks my legs were hurting, so I turned around and started coming back.</p>
<p>After going several blocks, something within me instigated me to look across the street at a pastry shop, even though I had no inclination to eat. As soon as I looked, I saw Emancipation Street. It was only half a block away from where I had started 15 or 20 minutes before! But there were no instrument stores there. I wanted to go back to the hotel, but no taxi would stop for me. Finally, when one did stop and asked me where I wanted to go, I didn't know the name of our hotel. I said, "Miramar," but the driver said there was no such hotel. I told him I would give him directions, but he didn't trust me. So he wouldn't take me.</p>
<p>Suddenly I saw Agraha and Savyasachi, so I was saved.</p>
<p>When you are lost, each minute is torture. How many taxis passed by without stopping! And when one did stop, I couldn't tell the driver the destination.</p>

<p>Savyasachi has more compassion than I do. I wanted to buy something, but I could not get the price I wanted. So I went away without buying it. But Savyasachi thought I liked it, so he went back and got it for me.</p>

<p>It seems that everywhere I go, people recognise me. Today I went into Manhattan with Vinaya to buy some saris. Garima was also with us. At one point we went into a coffee shop, and I asked Garima to get me a grilled cheese and a piece of pizza.</p>
<p>The restaurant was worse than the worst, darker than the darkest. We only stopped there because I was so hungry. The first floor was very narrow and seated only three or four persons, so I went upstairs to see if there were any empty seats.</p>
<p>Two young girls were eating there. As soon as they saw me, one of them said, "Sri Chinmoy is here."</p>
<p>The other girl said, "Oh, Sri Chinmoy wouldn't come here!"</p>
<p>I smiled at the one who recognised me.</p>
<p>The grilled cheese Garima got was very bad, and the pizza she didn't buy because she didn't understand my English. So we went across the street to an Indian restaurant, Delhi Palace. They were so fast. It didn't take them ten minutes to bring our food.</p>
