  <h2 id="page-title">Chapter V: Renunciation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chapter V: Renunciation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Comparison was the order of the day. So is it still. Perhaps forever it shall remain so, especially in the field of manifestation. Renunciation and selfless action are now being compared. This is Arjuna’s request.</p>
<p>“Both you extol, O Krishna, renunciation and selfless action. Tell me decisively once and for all, which is the better of the two? ”</p>
<p>Sri Krishna’s immediate answer is: “Both lead to the Bliss Supreme, but action is easier, action is superior.”</p>
<p>The Divine Teacher makes it clear, however, that renunciation cannot be achieved in the twinkling of an eye. And to achieve the fruit of renunciation without selfless action is next to impossible.</p>
<p>Yoga is action freed from separativity. The awareness of a separate feeling is the death of renunciation. Action done with a feeling of universal oneness is the glorious birth of renunciation.</p>
<p>Two schools. One school teaches the renunciation of any work whatsoever. The other school teaches the performance of action, right action. One school says: “Stop doing anything.” The other school says: “Start doing everything.” Alas! Since the message of the Gita has not been truly understood in India, that country abounds in both dry ascetics and unlit men of action.</p>
<p>From action, action springs. Action as such can never put an end to action. Action is continuous. Action is perpetual. No matter how hard we work, how long we work, mere action can never show us the Face of the Supreme. He is a true Karma-Yogi who works for the Supreme and for the Supreme alone. Indeed the Karma Yogi is also the greatest renouncer, for he seeks nothing, rejects nothing. Likes and dislikes to him have equal importance. At his high command are all pairs of opposites. They exist to affirm him, to fulfil him, to crown him with victory, inner and outer.</p>
<p>Krishna’s teachings aim at one Goal, the Bliss Supreme. Human temperaments are bound to differ. Human beings have varying tendencies and leanings. Such being the case, it is difficult for Arjuna to assess the most immediate and most direct path.</p>
<p>Action and renunciation are identical. Action is the tree. Renunciation is the fruit thereof. One cannot be greater than the other. The tree and the fruit grow in the bosom of Infinity to be loved by Eternity and embraced by Immortality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Freedom</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Freedom" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Is there any freedom? If so, where is it? There is freedom. It lives in our conscious surrender to the Supreme’s Will. Our unreserved surrender is our infallible oneness with the Supreme. Since the Supreme is the Infinite Freedom, we, in essence, cannot be otherwise.</p>
<p>It was Marlowe who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It lies not in our power to love or hate, For will in us is over-ruled by fate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true only when our fate is determined by the ego’s extremely limited dictates. This deplorable fate of ours undergoes a radical transformation — stark bondage is transformed into boundless freedom — when we, with our ever-mounting aspiration-flame, live in the soul’s unlimited and all-powerful Will. What we have within and what we see without is the consciousness of the evolving, expanding and radiating freedom. No matter what kind of freedom it gives us, physical or spiritual, this freedom is not just to succeed bondage or even to replace bondage, but to transform the very breath of bondage into freedom’s Immortality. And this is freedom, as a world-figure once remarked, without quotation marks.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Service</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Service" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Service can do many things for us. First of all, we should know that service done in a divine spirit is the greatest opportunity that we have in our possession to kill our pride and vanity and to obliterate the stamp of ego. It is in dedicated service that we see the universal harmony, we grow into the universal consciousness.</p>
<p>Our will becomes God’s Will. What we call service is nothing but the fulfilment of the Divine Will. Here on earth one has the capacity; another has the need. The capacity and the need must go together. Capacity offered, not only is the need fulfilled, but also the capacity is recognised, the capacity is valued. Capacity by itself receives only partial satisfaction. But when capacity and need run abreast, full satisfaction dawns.</p>
<p>“From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.” In our daily life, this truth is significantly applicable.</p>
<p>God has to occupy one’s mind; and in this state of divine concentration, one should serve humanity. At that very hour, service itself becomes the greatest reward. Although meditation and service constitute totally different approaches in the field of spirituality, work and dedicated service are nothing short of pure meditation.</p>
<p>Krishna now tells us about pleasure and pain. “Sense-pleasure ends in pain. Hence sense-pleasure is shunned by the wise. Constant self-control is the real and perpetual happiness.</p>
<p>Self-control continued, self-mastery dawns. The world-existence and the world-activity are at the command of self-mastery. The easiest way to achieve self-control is to take the path of self-consecration. Self-consecration is always blessed by the soul’s illumination. The turbulent forces of our senses must needs bow down to the soul’s illumination. He who has the inner illumination knows that his existence on earth is the embodiment of God and his actions are the expressions of God. He feels that he is never the doer; he is a mere instrument.</p>
<p>We now come to learn from the Gita what the body is. “The body is a city within nine gates.”</p>
<p>To quote Wesley La Violette from “An Immortal Song” (The Bhagavad Gita):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The body is a city with many gates in which the sovereign mind can rest serenely. Within that city is the sacred Temple of the Spirit, Mind, where there is no desire to act, nor any motivating cause, yet always the glad willingness to follow Duty when it calls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true that the body has a sacred temple. Equally true is it that the body itself is hallowed. Whitman’s powerful assertion is to be gratefully welcomed. “If anything is sacred, the human body is sacred.”</p>
<p>Today the body is the insurmountable obstacle. Tomorrow this very body can be and will be the pride of Divinity, for in and through this body God shows the world what He looks like, what He does and what He is.</p>
<p>Towards the end of this chapter, Sri Krishna firmly says that sensuality has to be shunned totally in order for man to live in and possess Divinity fully. The tiger-passions have to be conquered. The aspirant has to concentrate constantly on his Liberator. Indeed, for him alone is the Goal, the Salvation unique.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Chapter VI: Self-control</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chapter VI: Self-control" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>No more hesitation! No more fear! No more confusion! The first verse of the sixth chapter tells Arjuna that a Sannyasi and a Yogi are one. “He who does his duty with no expectation of the fruit of action is at once a Sannyasi (Sankhya-yogi) and a Yogi (Karma-yogi).” Abstention and selfless dynamism are one.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it is renunciation that unites Sannyasa and Yoga. This renunciation is the renunciation of desire and the renunciation of expectation. Action, right action, must be done. Action is no bondage. Action is aspiration. Action is realisation. The Gita demands our freedom from the stark bondage of action and not from action. The evil bondage that is our foe is within us and not without us. So also is our divine friend, freedom. It seems that we are at the mercy of our mind. Milton in his <em>Paradise Lost</em> speaks of the mind: “It (mind) can make a Hell of Heaven or Heaven of Hell.” But a true devotee can easily transcend this deplorable fate. His aspiration and rejection make him one with God’s Will. He soulfully sings:</p>

<p>If I ascend to heaven, Thou art there;<br /> There too, Thou, if I make my bed in hell.</p>

<p>In this chapter Sri Krishna has used the words Yoga and Yogi at least 30 times. Here he tells Arjuna for whom the Yoga is meant.</p>
<p>“Arjuna, this Yoga is neither for an epicure, nor for him who does not eat at all, neither for him who sleeps overmuch, nor for him who is endlessly awake.”</p>
<p>Self-indulgence and self-mortification are equally undeserving. To a self-indulgent person, the Goal will always remain a far cry. He who follows the philosophy of Charvaka lives in the world of indulgence which is nothing other than frustration. And this frustration is the song of destruction. The philosopher Charvaka declares:</p>
<p>“The pain of hell lies in the troubles that arise from foes, weapons and diseases, while liberation (Moksha) is death which is the cessation of life-breath.”</p>
<p>On the contrary, liberation is the life-breath of the human soul. And this life-breath was before the birth of creation, is now in creation and is also beyond creation.</p>
<p>We have dealt with self-indulgence. No let us focus our attention on self-mortification. The Buddha tried self-mortification And what happened? He came to realise the true truth that self-mortification could never give him what he wanted — Illumination. So he gladly adopted the middle path, the golden mean. He accepted neither starvation nor indulgence. With this peerless wisdom the Buddha won his Goal.</p>
<p>Arjuna’s sterling sincerity speaks no only for him but also for us. Yoga is equanimity. How can the restless mind of a human being be controlled? Unsteady is the mind. Unruly like the wind is the mind. Krishna identifies himself with poor Arjuna’s state of development. Krishna’s very consolation is another name for illumination.</p>
<p>“O Arjuna, the mind is unsteady, indeed! To curb the mind is not easy. But the mind can be controlled by constant practice and renunciation.”</p>
<p>What is to be practised? Meditation. What is to be renounced? Ignorance.</p>
<p>Krishna’s firm conviction, “Yoga can be attained through practice,” transforms our golden dream into the all-fulfilling Reality.</p>
<p>Practice is patience There is no short cut. “Patience is the virtue of an ass,” so do we hear from the wiseacres. The impatient horse in us or the hungry tiger in us will instantly jump to this grandiose discovery. But the revealing peace in the aspirant and the fulfilling power in the aspirant will clearly and convincingly make him feel that patience is the light of Truth. The light of Truth is indeed the Goal.</p>
<p>A great Indian spiritual figure, on being asked by her disciples as to how many years of strenuous practice had brought her full Realisation, burst into roaring laughter.</p>
<p>“Practice! my children, what you call practice is nothing other than your personal effort. Now, when I was like you at your stage, unrealised, I thought and felt that my personal effort was ninety-nine per cent and God’s Grace was one per cent, no more than that. But my utter stupidity died the moment self-realisation took birth in me. I then, to my amazement, saw, felt and realised that the Grace of my merciful Lord was ninety-nine per cent and my feeble personal effort was one per cent. Here my story does not come to an end, my children. Finally I realised that that one per cent of mine also was my Supreme Father’s unconditional and soulful concern for me. My children, you feel that God-realisation is a struggling race. It is not true. God-realisation is always a descending Grace.”</p>
<p>What we truly need is patience. When impatience assails us we can, however, sing with the poet:</p>

<p>Thou, so far, we grope to grasp Thee —</p>

<p>But when our consciousness is surcharged with patience, we can sing in the same breath with the same poet:</p>

<p>Thou, so near, we cannot clasp Thee —</p>

<p>It is not unusual for us to see that sometimes even an earnest seeker fails in the spiritual path. In spite of the fact that he had faith and devotion in ample measure, he fails to complete his journey. This question haunts Arjuna’s heart. He says to Krishna: “Though endowed with faith, a man who has failed to subdue his passion and whose mind is wandering away from Yoga (at the time of passing away) and who fails to attain to perfection, that is, God-realisation, what fate does he meet with? Does he not meet with destruction like a rent cloud? He is deprived of both God-realisation and world-pleasure. His fate has deluded him in the path of Yoga. He has nowhere to go. He has nothing to stand upon.</p>
<p>Alas, the inner world does not accept him, the outer world rejects him and condemns him. He is lost, totally lost. If he is successful, both the worlds will embrace him and adore him. If he fails, he becomes an object of ruthless ridicule.</p>
<p>Before Sri Krishna illumines Arjuna’s mind, let us bring Einstein into the picture. The immortal scientist declares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If my theory of relativity is proven successful, Germany will claim me as a German and France will declare that I am a citizen of the world. Should my theory prove untrue, France will say that I am a German and Germany will declare that I am a Jew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To come back to the Teacher and the student. The Teacher illumines his student’s mind with the rays of consolation, hope, inspiration and aspiration.</p>
<p>“O Arjuna, no fall is there for him either in this world or in the world beyond. For the fatal evil destiny is not for him who does good and who strives for self-realisation.”</p>
<p>The Teacher also says that he who falls from the path of Yoga in this life enters into a blessed and hallowed house in his next life to continue his spiritual journey.</p>
<p>Each human incarnation is but a brief span and it can never determine the end of, the soul’s eternal journey. None can achieve perfection in one life. Everyone must needs go through hundreds or thousands of incarnations until he attains Spiritual Perfection.</p>
<p>A devotee always remains in the breath of his sweet Lord. For him there is no true fall, no destruction, no death. How he has apparently failed, or why he has failed, can be only his surface story. His real story is to be found in his ever-cheerful persistence, in his ultimate victory over ignorance, in his absolute oneness with the Supreme. Let us recall the significant utterance made by Jesus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Martha, I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?” Martha said to Jesus: “Yes, Lord, I do believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, with Arjuna, we can in all sincerity and devotion say to the Lord Krishna: “O Krishna, the eternal Pilot of our life-boat, we believe in you. We can go one step ahead. Krishna, you are our eternal journey. You are our Transcendental Goal.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Chapter VII: Knowledge illumined</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chapter VII: Knowledge illumined" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Out of his infinite Bounty Sri Krishna tells his beloved disciple that he will give him all that he has and all that he is: Infinity and Eternity. He expects only two things from the disciple in return: Yoga and dependence. We may call this dependence devoted surrender, which is the indivisible oneness of the finite with the Infinite. To know Sri Krishna is to know the Knowledge Supreme. To realise Sri Krishna is to realise the life of everything in essence.</p>
<p><em>Manushyanam sahasresu....</em> — "Among thousands of men scarcely one strives for spiritual perfection, and of those who strive and succeed scarcely one knows me in essence.”</p>
<p>It seems that the third verse is throwing cold water on the seeker. But Krishna’s intention is anything but that. Krishna is not only all-Wisdom, but also all-Compassion. He wants to tell Arjuna what actually takes place in the spiritual marathon race. Not for him the Knowledge Supreme, to be sure, who owns childish curiosity, shallow enthusiasm, weak determination, flickering devotion and conditional surrender. Any of these undivine qualities will, without fail, fail the inner runner.</p>
<p>The sixth and seventh verses describe the relation that exists between Sri Krishna and the universe. “I am the beginning and the end of the universe. I am the Source of creation and I am the place of Dissolution. Beyond Me, there is nothing. All this is threaded upon Me as pearls on a string.”</p>
<p>When we concentrate on “All this is woven unto Me like gems into a necklace,” we immediately vision the peerless poet Krishna.</p>

<p>Sattva is the chief of the qualities of nature. It embodies harmony. Let us know the existence of harmony in relation to the universe. To quote Dryden:</p>

<p>From harmony, from heavenly harmony<br /> This universal Frame began:<br /> From harmony to harmony<br /> Through all the compass of the notes it ran,<br /> The diapason closing full in Man.</p>

<p>The possessor of the Sattvic quality has undoubtedly a heart of gold. He knows that his life has a significance of its own. His breath is pure. His patience is luminous. Unparalleled is his fortitude. Infallible is his certainty.</p>

<p>Rajas is the second quality. A man with the rajasic quality is always filled with dynamic passion. He wants to possess the world. He wants to rule the world. He has practically no time to enter into the world of inner illumination. His life cherishes just two things: Fight and conquest. He has the possibility either to be a divine warrior or to be a warrior of stark falsehood. He has the strength to build a temple of Truth. He has also the strength to break and destroy it. Unfortunately he often breaks and destroys the temple owing to his unlit vision and the mad elephant in him.</p>

<p>Tamas is the third quality. It is sloth, darkness, ignorance, sin and death. It is also the worldly delusion and the deluding illusion.</p>

<p>Sattva is the soul with clear vision.<br /> Rajas is either the fruitful or fruitless life.<br /> Tamas is the dance of death.</p>
<p>Sattva manifests itself through the aspiring light.<br /> Rajas manifests itself through the desiring might.<br /> Tamas manifests itself through the darkening night.</p>
<p>A man of virtue wants to live the truth.<br /> A man of action wants to enjoy the world.<br /> A man of inactivity enjoys nothing. On the contrary, he is enjoyed constantly by darkness, ignorance and death.</p>
<p>A man of virtue has a friend: aspiration.<br /> A man of activity has a friend: Inspiration.<br /> A man of inactivity has a friend: delusion.</p>
<p>A man of virtue tries to live in the truth of the present, past and future.<br /> A man of action wants to live in the glorious present. He does not care much for the future.<br /> A man of inactivity does not live in the proper sense of the term. He sleeps. His days and nights are made of lightless sleep.</p>
<p>The first one wants to transcend himself soulfully.<br /> The second one wants to expand himself forcefully.<br /> The third one destroys himself unconsciously.</p>

<p>Those who follow the inner path have four distinct roles to play:</p>
<p><em>Arta</em>, the depressed, the afflicted. Life is a bed of thorns. He has realised this truth and cries for life’s transformation. He wants to possess a bed of roses. Pain is his painful possession. He can successfully sing with Francis Thomson:</p>

<p>Nothing begins and nothing ends,<br /> That is not paid with moan;<br /> For we are born in other’s pain,<br /> And perish in our own.</p>

<p><em>Jignasu</em>, the seeker, the enquirer. What he wants is knowledge. Knowledge tells us why a man suffers. Further, since knowledge embodies power, it transforms the breath of suffering into the breath of seeing and kindling knowledge.</p>
<p><em>Artharthi</em>, the seeker of true wealth, the Truth absolute. He has no sorrow. He has no earthly desire. He wants to live in perpetual freedom, liberation.</p>
<p><em>Jnani</em>, the wise. He who is wise knows that the Supreme is everywhere and the Kingdom of Heaven is within him. He lives in the Supreme. His life is the life of oneness with the Supreme. His world is the world of true fulfilment. Thickest is the intimacy between him and the Supreme.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna continues: “Noble and good are they all, but I hold the wise, the enlightened as my chosen soul and my own Self; fully united, absolutely one we are. When his life has played its role, when the hour of silence knocks at his door, I place him in my Heart where the Breath of Eternal Life grows.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Chapter VIII: The imperishable Infinite</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chapter VIII: The imperishable Infinite" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Brahman is the imperishable infinite. Another name for Brahman is <em>AUM</em>. <em>AUM</em> is the Creator. <em>AUM</em> is Creation. <em>AUM</em> is in Creation. Also <em>AUM</em> is beyond the Creation.</p>
<p>This chapter begins with a volley of most significant questions. Brahman, Adhyatma, Karma, Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva, Adhiyajna — what are these? The Lord answers: “The imperishable Absolute is Brahman. Adhyatma is the self-revealing Knowledge of Brahman’s primeval Nature. Karma is the birth of activity, natural and normal. Adhibhuta is the perishable material manifestation. Adhidaiva is the knowledge of the Shining Ones. Adhiyajna is the sacrifice made by Me in order to unite the manifestation of finite forms with My infinite Life.”</p>
<p>Krishna affirms that self-realisation or the realisation of Immortality must be achieved during life in the body and nowhere else. As each human being creates limitations, imperfections and bondages, so also is he capable of transcending them. He will finally enter into the planes of Fulness, Perfection and Freedom.</p>
<p>Our existence is the result of a previous existence. This earth of ours is the result of an earth that existed before. Everything is evolving. The essence of evolution is an inner and outer movement. This movement or change takes place even in the world of Brahma. Even after attaining Brahma’s world, one cannot escape the snares of rebirth. To be sure, our earthly days and nights are nothing but an infinitesimal second in comparison to the Days and Nights of Brahma. A thousand ages breathe in Brahma’s one single day, and a thousand ages breathe in Brahma’s one single night.</p>
<p>No use in taking shelter in our earthly days and nights, for they are fleeting. No use in taking shelter in Brahma’s days and nights either, for they are also not eternal. We can, we should and we must take shelter only in the Lord Krishna’s Eternal Heart, which is our safest haven, where no day is required, no night is required since His heart is Infinity’s Light and Eternity’s Life. Nothing else do we need save devotion. Our choice supreme is devotion. Our heart of devotion responds to His Heart of Love. Says He: “Only the devotion unswerving has the direct and free access to my Life Immortal, my Truth Absolute.”</p>
<p>What is within will sooner or later be manifested without. The possessor of divine thoughts will also be the doer of divine deeds. It is possible only for a dedicated and aspiring man to think of God consciously while leaving the earth scene.</p>
<p>Krishna tells us how a Yogi enters into the Ultimate after leaving his mortal sheath. “His senses are under control. His mind is placed in the heart, He meditates on Me. <em>AUM</em> he soulfully chants. He gives up Prana, the life-breath, and enters into the Ultimate Realisation in Me.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Aum</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Aum" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>If you read my article, "The Significance of <em>AUM</em>",<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> you will know in detail about <em>AUM</em>. Madame H.P. Blavatsky, the founder of Theosophy, observed <em>AUM</em> in a very simple and significant way. She said, “/AUM/ means good actions, not merely lip-sound. You must say it in deeds.” In order to know what <em>AUM</em> is and what it stands for one is well advised to study the Upanishads that speak of <em>AUM</em>. The Mandukya Upanishad offers us the significance of <em>AUM</em> explicitly. The meaning of <em>AUM</em> can be known from books. But the knowledge of <em>AUM</em> can never be had by studying books. It must be achieved by living an inner life, a life of aspiration, that will transport the aspirant to the higher levels of consciousness. The easiest way and the most effective way to go up high, higher, highest is to surcharge oneself with pure love and genuine devotion. Doubt, fear, frustration, limitation and imperfection are bound to surrender to devoted love and surrendered devotion. Love and devotion have the power unparalleled to own the world and be owned by the world. Love God’s Manifestation; you will find that the cosmic creation is yours. Devote yourself to the cause of the cosmic manifestation; you will see that it loves you and claims you as its very own.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr /><ol><li id="fn1"><p>Sri Chinmoy, <em>Prayer-World, Mantra-World And Japa-World</em>, Agni Press, New York, 1974</p>
<p>It is true that knowledge can give you what love and devotion give, but very often knowledge is not cultivated for the sake of truth, but for the fulfilment of desires. Fruitless is the pursuit of knowledge when desire looms large in it. When the aspirant is all love and devotion, he soars.</p>
<p>During his journey’s flight he sings:</p>

<p>No more my heart shall sob or grieve.<br /> My days and nights dissolve in God’s own Light.<br /> Above the toil of life my soul<br /> Is a Bird of Fire winging the Infinite.</p>

<p>At the end of his journey’s flight he sings:</p>

<p>I have known the One and His secret Play;<br /> And passed beyond the sea of Ignorance-Dream.<br /> In tune with Him, I sport and sing.<br /> I own the golden Eye of the Supreme.</p>

<p>He has now grown into his own Goal. Self-amorous he sings:</p>

<p>Drunk deep of Immortality,<br /> I am the root and boughs of a teeming vast.<br /> My Form I have known, and realised.<br /> The Supreme and I are one — all we outlast.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Chapter IX: The Secret supreme</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chapter IX: The Secret supreme" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The Secret supreme is the Knowledge supreme. It cannot be told. It has to be realised. This supreme Secret is written in letters of gold in the inmost recesses of each divinely human heart. It rejects none, no, not even the one who is dead in sin. He who has no faith in what Krishna says will have no escape from the fetters of ignorance. To have faith is to have a piece of singular good fortune. Like exemplary devotion, faith too needs a personal God, and it has one. Faith is not blind belief. Faith is not a blind, unquestioning surrender to the sacred books. Faith is the conscious awareness of one’s limitless freedom. Krishna says: “O Arjuna, salvation is not for him who has no faith. Forever he is bound to the sorrows of life and to the pangs of death.” He who walks along the road of faith will see for himself the Truth supreme here on earth. The determination of the seeker’s aspiring heart is his mystic faith. The conviction of the seeker’s revealing soul is his triumphant faith. An ordinary, unaspiring man is buoyed by the worlds of false hopes. But a man of faith always lives in the worlds of forceful affirmation. Cheerfully and unreservedly he heaps more and more fuel of sterling faith at the Altar of God. Needless to say, the flowering of his soul runs apace.</p>
<p>Krishna smilingly says: “The deluded slight Me, my human incarnations, knowing not that I am the Lord supreme of all beings.”</p>
<p>To recognise an Avatar is not an easy thing. Either one has to be blessed by the Avatar himself or one has to possess the gift of inner vision. An aspirant has to prepare himself in order to recognise an Avatar. He has to shun sense-pleasure. He must not be controlled by passions. It is he who has to control his passions. He has to breathe in constantly the breath of purity. Fear he has to tear down. Doubt he has to smite. Peace he has to invoke. Joy he has to imbibe.</p>
<p>To perform abstruse rites and ceremonies is not necessary. Self-giving is the only thing required. He accepts everything with greatest joy. We can start our inner journey offering Him leaves, flowers and fruits. Even the smallest act of offering to God is the truest step on the path of self-discovery and God-discovery. We think. If we offer our ‘thinking’ to God, this very act of offering our thought will ultimately make us one with God the Thought. An ordinary man feels that he thinks just because he lives. But Descartes holds altogether a different view: “I think, therefore I am.” This “I am” is not only the fruit of creation, but also the breath of creation. Significant are the words of Bertrand Russell: “Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth — more than ruin, more even than death.”</p>
<p>If we can discover a true, divine thought, then in no time God will ask or compel time to be on our side. Nothing save time can help us feel the breath of Truth and touch the feet of God. We can own Eternity’s time if we truly want to. Sweet and meaningful are the words of Austin Dobson:</p>

<p>Time goes, you say? Ah no!<br /> Alas, Time stays, we go.</p>

<p>We serve. If we serve Him, Him alone in humanity, we become one with His absolute Reality and His universal Oneness. We must not forget that our dedicated service must be rendered with a flood-tide of purest enthusiasm. Verse 29 is a very familiar and popular one. “To Me all are alike, I know no favour. I know no disfavour. My loving devotees who worship me are in me. I am also in them.” This is an experience that stands out in bold relief in a true seeker’s life. There is no special privilege. Everybody is granted the same opportunity. It goes without saying that a true devotee has already gone through arduous spiritual disciplines. Now if he grows into a genuine devotee and becomes dear and intimate to Krishna, then it should be understood that he is having the result of his past iron disciplines and severe austerities. No pain, no gain. No sincerity, no success. Have aspiration. It will accelerate your progress, inner and outer.</p>
<p>The devotee aspires. Sri Krishna resides in his aspiration. The devotee realises. In his realisation he discovers that Krishna is his eternal breath. A devotee is never alone. He has discovered the true Truth that his sacrifice unites him with his Lord. The more he consciously offers himself to the Lord, the stronger becomes their divine bond of union nay, oneness.</p>
<p><em>Anityam</em> (Not lasting, fleeting); <em>Asukham</em> (pleasureless, joyless). The outer world abides in our earth-bound consciousness. This earth-bound consciousness can be transformed into the Eternal Consciousness through aspiration, devotion and surrender. And the Eternal Consciousness houses perpetual joy. Liberation has to be achieved here in this world. Any man of promise will gladly subscribe to Emerson’s dauntless declaration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other world! There is no other world. Here or nowhere is the whole fact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we look at the world with our inner eye, the world is beautiful. This beauty is the reflection of one’s own divinity. God the Beautiful has our aspiring heart as His eternal Throne. We, the seekers of the Supreme, can never see eye to eye with Nietzsche’s proud philosophy. He utters: “The world is beautiful, but has a disease called Man.” On the contrary, we can say in unmistakable terms that the world is beautiful because it has been illumined by a supernal beauty called Man.</p>
<p><em>Anityam</em> and <em>Asukham</em> cannot blight the heart of a true seeker. His faith is married to his golden fate. He sings and sings:</p>

<p>My eternal days are found in speeding time,<br /> I play upon his Flute of rhapsody.<br /> Impossible deeds no more impossible seem,<br /> In birth-chains now shines Immortality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Chapter X: The perfection divine and universal</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chapter X: The perfection divine and universal" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>What is within us is perfection. What is without us is imperfection. The outer world can have perfection only when the inner world inspires, guides, moulds and shapes the outer world.</p>
<p>Yesterday dreamt of today as perfection. Today dreams of tomorrow as perfection. Perfection already achieved pales into insignificant imperfection before the birth of the fast approaching future.</p>
<p>Perfection grows. It has been doing so since the beginning of the creation’s birth. Unlike us, God has one Dream: perfect Perfection. This perfect Perfection must shine in the aspiring hearts of individuality and universality so that the absolute Reality can be the total expression of the cosmic Vision.</p>
<p>Everybody is dear to God. But the sweetest and the most intimate relation exists only between a devotee and the Lord. A true devotee worships the Lord with no desire’s brood. The Lord blesses him not only unreservedly but also unconditionally. What a devotee needs is the determined strength of his heart. Once he has achieved it, his self-realisation will no longer remain a far cry.</p>
<p>To understand the truth is one thing. To believe in it is another. Not to understand the truth is no crime, far from it. But to disbelieve the truth is nothing short of an unpardonable sin. A child does not understand his father’s vast wisdom. Nevertheless, his faith in his father’s wisdom is spontaneous and genuine.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna is the Wisdom Absolute. He is the Glory Supreme. His Glory nobody understands. No, not even the gods. Arjuna may not understand Krishna, but his implicit faith in Krishna speaks for him: “O Krishna, Thou art the Lord of the Lords. Supreme art Thou. This I believe. Neither the gods nor the demons comprehend thy mysterious manifestations. The source of all beings art Thou. Thou art known by Thee alone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the thing believed is incredible, it is also incredible that the incredible should have been so believed. — <em>St. Augustine</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Belief is the complete liberty of the mind. Belief is the full independence of the heart.</p>
<p>Krishna now makes it clear to Arjuna that His divine Glory can be elucidated and demonstrated but can never be exhausted.</p>
<p>The universe in its entirety is but a tiny spark of His infinite Magnitude.</p>
<p><em>Pandavanam Dhananjaya</em>, says Krishna. “Among the Pandavas I am Dhananjaya.” Dhananjaya is an epithet of Arjuna. Each person has one body, one mind, one heart and one soul. How can one standing in front of another say that he is verily the other person? Does it not sound absurd? It does so only when we live in the physical, not when we live in the oneness of the Spirit. When we declare that all human beings are one and the same, we just state a bare fact that we inwardly believe or try to believe. It is the sense of identification that makes us one. Krishna says: “I am this, I am that, I am everything.” Again He says that He is the best, highest and mightiest in everything. Does it mean that His Consciousness is tinged with preference? Does He discriminate? No, He has no preference, He has no discrimination. “Arjuna, I am the Self seated in the heart of all beings. I am the beginning and middle and also the end of all beings.” He wants to illumine Arjuna’s mind by saying that in the process of cosmic evolution He is unveiling and manifesting His own perfection. His divine manifestations are endless. He has mentioned only a few by way of example. From Him spring permanence, goodness and mightiness. He tells Arjuna that he has not to learn His divine manifestations in minute detail. It will simply confuse his mind. “I established the whole universe with a portion of Myself.” Knowing this the seeker in Arjuna can easily satisfy his hunger.</p>
<p>“I am the seed of all things, animate or inanimate.” Arjuna now realises that Krishna is not the mere body. He is the Self all-pervading. Arjuna wishes to know under what particular form the Self is to be worshipped. “Under all forms,” is Krishna’s immediate reply. Nothing there is without the Self. The Self is in all and all is in the Self. This is the wisdom that the seeker’s knowledge must possess.</p>
<p>The Gita teaches us the purest oneness. This oneness is the inner oneness. This inner oneness is at once spontaneous and unique. This oneness can never be truncated or dwarfed by the mind. The realm of oneness is far beyond the approach of the physical mind.</p>
<p>Self-knowledge is the knowledge of the universal oneness. Divine perfection can be founded only on the fertile soil of universal oneness. Serve humanity precisely because Divinity looms large in humanity. Know Divinity and you will in no time realise God’s Immortality in you and your Immortality in God. God in man and man in God can only announce the truest embodiments of perfect Perfection.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Chapter XI: The vision of the Universal Form and the Cosmic Manifestation of the Lord</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chapter XI: The vision of the Universal Form and the Cosmic Manifestation of the Lord" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Out of His infinite Bounty, boundless Love and deepest, soulful Concern, Sri Krishna has unveiled the Secret supreme that He is in everything and He embodies everything. Arjuna’s stark delusion has been removed and dispersed. He now enjoys his soul’s translucent peace.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna speaks out of the abundance of His love. Arjuna listens to Him with his heart’s loftiest devotion, and believes in Him unreservedly and soulfully. Arjuna’s singular belief cries for its transformation; his aspiration cries for an experience. His mind understands the truth. But his heart pines to vision the truth and to live the Truth. Hence he needs this experience, unavoidable and inevitable. Sri Krishna graciously and immediately grants it, the Experience Unparalleled.</p>
<p>“O Arjuna, Behold in My body the entire universe.” Arjuna’s physical eyes naturally fail to vision it. The Lord grants him the eye of supernal vision, the eye that sees the unseen — the Yogic eye.</p>
<p>The body that the Lord speaks of is a spiritual body. Hence to see the spiritual body, Arjuna must needs be endowed with a spiritual eye. The body signifies form. The formless abides in this form. The Vision Transcendental and the Reality Absolute play in unison in and through the cosmic form. The body of flesh and blood undergoes innumerable vicissitudes, but not the body of unlimited, divine form and deathless substance. This divine body is the embodiment and revelation of truth’s Divinity, Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.</p>
<p>Sanjaya says to Dhritarashtra, “O Rajan, Krishna, the supreme Master of Yoga, the Almighty Lord, reveals to Arjuna His Form divine, supreme. Arjuna now sees Krishna as the Supreme Godhead, Parameshwara.”</p>
<p>Arjuna sees the many in the One Supreme possessing myriad mouths, numberless eyes, limitless marvels, wielding divine weapons, wearing divine garments and jewels, bearing celestial garlands of supernal fragrance. The effulgence of a thousand suns bursting forth all at once in the skies will hardly equal the supreme splendour of the Lord. Arjuna, in the divine person of Krishna, beholds Infinity in multiplicity. Overwhelmed, ecstasy flooding his inmost being, with his hands folded, his head bowed, he exclaims, “O Lord, in Thee, in Thy Body, I behold all gods and all grades of beings, with distinctive marks. I see even Brahma seated resplendent on His Lotus-Throne and seers and sages all around, and symbolical serpents — all divine.”</p>
<p>When we go up with all our hearts’ snow-white flaming aspiration, we enter into the cosmic consciousness of the seers. This path is an upward path. It is the path of embodiment and realisation. There is another path known as the path of revelation and manifestation. This path is the downward path. Here our consciousness flows down through the cosmic energy, the symbolic serpents, circling and spiralling.</p>
<p>Verses 15-31 eloquently and psychically describe what Arjuna saw in Krishna with his newly acquired Yogic sight. The fight is yet to start. The mighty warriors are ready and eager to fight. To his greatest surprise, Arjuna sees the utter extinction of the lives of the warriors in Krishna. Before the birth of the fight, he sees the death of the warriors. Destroyed they are. As he sees the fires of Krishna’s flaming and all-devouring mouth, his very life-breath quivers. The disciple cries out, “Thy compassion, my Lord Supreme, I implore. I know Thee not. Who art Thou?”</p>
<p>“Time am I. Time, the mighty destroyer, am I. Doomed they are. Whether you fight or not, they are already dead. Even without you, your foes will escape no death. Arise, O Arjuna, arise. Victory’s glory and renown you win, conquer your enemies, enjoy the vast kingdom, enjoy. By me is ordained their lives’ surrendered hush. You be the outer cause. Just be my instrument, nothing more.” “Nimittamatram Bhava.” “Be Thou the mere instrument.”</p>
<p>There can be no greater pride, no better achievement, than to be God’s own instrument, for to be an instrument of God is to be infallibly accepted as His very own. In and through the Instrument-Disciple, the Master-Guru sees and fulfils God’s Divine Purpose.</p>
<p>Krishna is the all-devouring time. This vision, according to our outer eyes and understanding, is terrible. But according to our inner vision and inner comprehension it is natural and inevitable.</p>
<p>“Time,” says Sri Aurobindo, “represents itself to human effort as an enemy or a friend, as a resistance, a medium or an instrument, But always it is really the instrument of the soul.</p>
<p>“Time is a field of circumstances and forces meeting and working out a resultant progression whose course it measures. To the ego it is a tyrant or a resistance, to the Divine an instrument. Therefore, while our effort is personal, Time appears as a resistance, for it presents to us all the obstruction of the forces that conflict with our own. When the divine working and the personal are combined in our consciousness, it appears as a medium and condition. When the two become one, it appears as a servant and instrument.”</p>
<p>Krishnaprem, the great seeker, says, “It is impossible to state in words this wondrous insight. All things remain the same yet all are changed. Time flashes bodily into Eternity; the streaming Flux itself is the Eternal, which, though It moves unceasingly, moves not at all.”</p>
<p>The Upanishadic lore echoes and re-echoes in our aspiring hearts: “That moves and yet That moves not, That is far distant and yet That is close and near...”</p>
<p>Time houses Truth. Sri Krishna tells the Truth, the Truth Eternal, about Himself. Here we can recollect the significant words of Virginia Woolf: “If you do not tell the truth about yourself, you cannot tell it about other people.” Conversely, if you know the spiritual truth about yourself, you must needs know the truth about others. Sri Krishna showed the Divine Truth that was Himself.</p>
<p>We can also cheerfully walk with Marcus Aurelius: “I cannot comprehend how any man can want anything but the Truth.”</p>
<p>To doubt the spiritual master before one’s own illumination dawns is not uncommon in the spiritual history of the world. Even some of the dearest disciples of great spiritual masters have done so. But for the seeker to leave the master precisely because doubt haunts him is an act of sheer stupidity. Stick, stick unto the last. The blighted doubts will disappear into thin air. The splendour of Infinity and Eternity will blossom in the bosom of Time. Your mounting aspiration will accomplish this task.</p>
<p>Arjuna’s throbbing heart voices forth, “Thou art the primeval Soul....” He cries for Krishna’s forgiveness. Owing to his past ignorance, he had not realised Krishna in His divine nature. His past was full of wrong deeds, what with ignorance and what with carelessness. He begs with a throbbing heart for forgiveness for his acts of omission and commission rendered to Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>“Bear with me as father with his son, as friend with his friend, as Lord with the beloved.” Sri Krishna no doubt forgives Arjuna. He assumes his normal, natural and familiar form.</p>
<p>Arjuna comes to learn that it is only the Grace Divine that has endowed him with the Yogic eye to see the Unseen, the Glory Supreme of the Lord, the present, past and future.</p>
<p>He also learns from the Lord that “neither the study of the Vedas, nor sacrifice, nor alms, neither austerity nor study can win this cosmic vision...” Even the gods yearn for a glimpse of this Universal Form which He has just shown to Arjuna out of His boundless Compassion.</p>
<p>Faith, devotion, surrender. Lo! Krishna is won. No other way Him to realise, Him to possess.</p>

He who has realised Spirit’s (Purusha’s) eternal Silence and Matter’s (Prakriti’s) cosmic dance may live in any walk of life, whether as a doctor or a philosopher, a poet or a singer; he has achieved the perfection of supreme realisation. There are some who realise the Supreme Spirit in meditation; others by knowledge (the Sankhya philosophy). There are also others who realise the Supreme Spirit by the Yoga of Action and Selfless Service. In addition, there are those who are not aware of it, but who have heard of the Supreme Spirit from others and who have started worshipping it in devotion, and cling firmly to the Truth. They also pass on beyond mortality and cross beyond the snares of death.</p>
<p>Spirit is in Matter. It tastes the qualities born of matter. It does experience the physical existence. The qualities acquired determine its rebirth. Spirit is the Supreme Himself. Although Master of the body, it experiences mortal life. The way to God is to see the Eternal Life in the fleeting life, to know that Prakriti, not Purusha, is to action attached. All activities, says the Gita, divine and undivine, arise in Prakriti. Purusha is actionless. No action is possible in Purusha, for Purusha transcends both time and space. Yet without Purusha, there can be no universe, no manifestation.</p>
<p>Spirit is self-existent and all-pervading, whether within the body or without the body; always unaffected the Spirit remains.</p>
<p>To know that Purusha and Prakriti are one and inseparable is to know the Truth, the Truth of Unity and Divinity in humanity, which will eventually be manifested as the Divinity of humanity.</p>
<p>The Gita does not house arid, logical metaphysics. Its teachings have no need for any support from intellectual argument. Human reason cannot knock at the door of Transcendental Reality. Never. What is the Gita, if not the Transcendental Reality supremely and divinely embodied?</p>
<p>Each human being has to learn five supreme secrets from the Gita:</p>

<ol><li>See the Truth.<br /></li>
<li>Feel the Truth.<br /></li>
<li>Be the Truth.<br /></li>
<li>Reveal the Truth.<br /></li>
<li>Manifest the Truth.</li>
</ol><p>In this chapter we observe that the Gita is at once the significance of life and the divine interpretation of life. Unfortunately, this particular chapter has become the victim of dire contradiction in spite of the very fact that the Gita, from its journey’s start to its journey’s close, sees not the face of contradiction. The Gita sees and reveals only the face of Truth’s unity in multiplicity. Scholars and commentators are at war with each other over their theories. Nor have the philosophers the inclination to shun this battle. Each is inspired to impose his lofty theories on the others. But a genuine seeker of the Supreme Truth is truly wise. He prays to the Lord Krishna to have the Gita as his personal experience. Sri Krishna smiles. The devotee cries out:</p>

<p>Thou that hast given so much to me,<br /> Give one thing more, a grateful heart.<br /> Not thankful when it pleaseth me.<br /> As if thy blessings had spare days;<br /> But such a heart, whose pulse may be<br /> Thy praise.</p>
<p>— G. Herbert</p>

<p>Lo, the devotee has won the race! The devotee needs a Guru, a Master. Sri Krishna is the Guru and Arjuna is the disciple. An eminent Indian scholar, Hari Prasad Shastri. writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the Guru, or Master, an absolute necessity to the realisation of Truth? The reply, according to the Gita, is “Yes". The Guru is the person who teaches the unity of the soul with the Absolute and who lives the life of Sattva. He can be of either sex and according to the Gita, need not be a recluse, living in the snows of the Himalayas, cut off from the world, speaking through chosen apostles only, and sending fantastic letters through the ‘astral mail.’ The Guru of the Gita is a man like any other good man, whom anyone can see at any convenient time, who lives in human society and does not claim any superiority over others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally the Gita tells us that the Guru of all gurus, the real Guru, is God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Chapter XIV: The three gunas</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chapter XIV: The three gunas" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>SATTVA is purity. Sattva is light. Sattva is wisdom. Happiness and Sattva stay together. Harmony and Sattva breathe together. The senses in Sattva are surcharged with the light of knowledge. If one leaves the body when Sattva prevails, then to the pure abode of the Sages he goes.</p>
<p>RAJAS is passion. Rajas is desire. Rajas is unlit activity. Rajas binds the body to action. Rajas stays either with stark dynamism or with blind aggression. Restlessness and Rajas breathe together. To separate toil from Rajas is practically impossible. Rajas is another name for passionate movement. If one dies when Rajas prevails, then he is reborn among those attached to action.</p>
<p>TAMAS is slumber. Tamas is darkness. Tamas is ignorance. Stagnation and Tamas stay together. Futility and Tamas breathe together. Impossible for Tamas to be separated from naked pangs. Tamas is another name for slow death. Death in Tamas is followed by rebirth among the senseless fools.</p>

<p>Sattva-tree bears the fruit called harmony.<br /> Rajas-tree bears the fruit called pain.<br /> Tamas-tree bears the fruit called ignorance.</p>

<p>Sattva offers to the world at large luminous knowledge; Rajas, passionate greed; Tamas, rank delusion. He whose life is flooded with Sattva looks up into the skies. Hence he goes to higher spheres. He whose life is fired with Rajas looks haughtily around the world. Hence here he dwells. Blind is he whose life is covered with tenebrous Tamas. Stone blind is he. Hence down he sinks.</p>
<p>The Lord says that he who understands the origin of action in these three-fold qualities of Prakriti, and at the same time understands Purusha, who is beyond the qualities, comes to Him and enters into His Nature. And finally, when he goes beyond the length and breadth of these three qualities, Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas, he drinks deep the Nectar of Immortality.</p>

<p>Do all the good you can,<br /> By all the means you can,<br /> In all the ways you can,<br /> In all the places you can,<br /> At all the times you can,<br /> To all the people you can,<br /> As long as ever you can.</p>
<p>— John Wesley</p>

<p>This precisely is expected of a Sattvic man. Now you may ask, how is it that he too has to transcend his nature? Is he not unique in his service to mankind? He may be unique in his large human family, but perfect freedom he has yet to achieve. Silently, secretly and, alas, at times even unconsciously the poor Sattvic man is attached to the fruits of his generous service, to the effects of his sublime knowledge. So with a view to achieving absolute freedom and perfect perfection a Sattvic man has to transform and transcend his nature.</p>
<p>After having transcended the three Gunas one has to make a choice, whether one wants to remain in the Transcendent, far above the field of manifestation, or one wants to serve the Eternal Breath of the Infinite in humanity and inspire humanity to the Realisation of the Supreme Bliss, Peace and Power.</p>
<p>Not one, not two, but three significant questions Arjuna asks. What are the marks of him who has transcended the three qualities? How does he behave? How does he go beyond the three qualities?</p>
<p>Krishna’s answers are:</p>
<p>The Yogi who has transcended the three qualities in his own life will neither hate nor crave for the fruits of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Within and without he is flooded with his soul’s equanimity. He is absolutely independent. He has realised the absolute independence of his divinity within. Something more: he serves God with his sterling devotion. He does it soulfully. He serves mankind with all his love. He does it unconditionally. He sees God and God alone in all human souls. Such a Yogi ultimately becomes without fail the Self Supreme.</p>
