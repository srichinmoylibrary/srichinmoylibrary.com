<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mothers should realise that once upon a time they too were children. They behaved exactly the same way as their children, if not worse. If their own parents were good enough to swim in the sea of patience-light, then the mothers should do the same for <em>their</em> children. What we learn, we teach. The mothers' parents taught them the message of patience, and the mothers now should practise it in their own lives. The result will be world-illumining children.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A teacher is not a slave-driver. A teacher is an ignorance-transformer, a knowledge-revealer and a wisdom-fulfiller. One can listen unconditionally to one's teacher if one can make oneself feel that the teacher has no ulterior motive. If we can feel that the teacher is teaching out of sheer joy, out of sheer love, out of sheer concern, then one can easily listen to him unconditionally.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: At what age should a child be taught spirituality?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: At what age should a child be taught spirituality?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A child should be taught spirituality from the very first moment he sees the light of day. When the child cries for the first time, the mother must ask herself why the child has cried. Is it because the child saw ignorance-sea for the first time and became afraid? Or is it because the child is missing the Light and Delight which he was wont to enjoy?</p>
<p>If the mother feels that it is ignorance-sea which has frightened the child, then she must tell the child that this ignorance-sea is short-lived, and that soon wisdom-sea will come into existence. At that time, the child will be able to swim and enjoy supreme satisfaction.</p>
<p>And if the mother feels that it is the separation from Heaven-Light that has compelled the child to cry, then she must tell the child that God is not only in Heaven but also on earth. She must tell the child that God sent him down to earth to fulfil a special purpose. In either case, the mother must speak to the inner reality of the child, which is the soul.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can learn to conquer self-doubt by consciously asserting your faith in God and God's faith in you. Your faith in God will tell you that you will realise Him without fail. God's faith in you will tell you that God has already done everything for you. You have only to watch and enjoy.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The quickest way to learn from our mistakes is to be determined not to make the same mistakes again. There are two ways to do that: the positive way and the negative way. The positive way is to make ourselves feel that each mistake is a pathfinder, an unconscious or conscious pathfinder to the Truth-existence. The other way, the negative way, is to remember the untold sufferings that we have gone through as a result of committing the mistake. If the experience remains vivid for some time, then we will be always on the alert, and our alertness will save us from committing the same mistake again.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not necessarily. If you are striving to achieve a higher life, a higher wisdom, a higher perfection in life so that you can offer these higher qualities to the world at large, then it will not pull you away from the heart. But if you are striving for a higher degree in order to make others feel that they are inferior, then naturally it will pull you away from the heart. If your attitude is divine, then no matter what height you achieve, still your heart quality will not diminish. On the contrary, when your attitude is good, only then will your ever-transcending illumination-mind and ever-loving fulfilment-heart help you become truly happy and supremely fulfilled.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to educate the unaspiring parts of one's being is to make them conscious of the supreme necessity of happiness — happiness in life and a life of happiness. In order to achieve happiness in life and discover a life of happiness, one must aspire. What is aspiration? Aspiration is God-satisfaction. And what is non-aspiration? Non-aspiration is animal-satisfaction.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The supreme duty of an educator is to give himself away thrice: before he begins teaching, while he is teaching and after he has taught.</p>
<p>Before he begins teaching, he has to give himself away soulfully. While he is teaching, he has to give himself away unreservedly. After he has taught, he has to give himself away unconditionally.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us try to know the spiritual significance of tolerance. Tolerance is not conscious submission to a superior power. Real tolerance is compassion in disguise. When we have real tolerance, the seeker in us sees the expansion of his loving heart, his illumining soul and his fulfilling goal.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A teacher who is spiritually unawakened can never learn to teach with his heart. Before he can teach with his heart, he must first teach his mind. He must teach his mind how to become receptive, how to unlearn the teachings that its ignorance-teacher has taught it over the years. Unfortunately, the mind-student is not obedient, whereas the heart-student is not only obedient but also self-giving.</p>
