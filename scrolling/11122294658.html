<p>This morning I ran three miles. Pulak drove me to the course. The scenery was very good and the place was very beautiful. I like that course so much, but today there were so many people playing this game and that game.</p>
<p>Pulak took millions of pictures. He would go ahead of me and take pictures. Sometimes he would be down on the ground as I ran past. But then nothing came out and I felt very sorry for him.</p>

<p>Today, when I came back from the UN, I went for a walk. On the way, I saw two young girls who were very tall, very thin. They were about to cross the road in front of me, but then they felt shy and they waited for me to go by.</p>
<p>As I was passing them, one of them said, “You are very strong. Is your name Sri Chinmoy?”</p>
<p>I said, “My name is Sri Chinmoy.”</p>
<p>Then they asked, “Where do you live? Do you live around here?”</p>
<p>I replied, “I live near 150th Street.”</p>
<p>Both of them were very, very nice. Instead of walking to their destination, they followed me for some time, staying about thirty or forty metres behind me. Then they came very close and said, “Bye!”</p>

<p>After seeing those two girls, I continued walking and walking. As I was re-turning, I saw somebody cycling very fast. I said, “Who is cycling so fast?”</p>
<p>All of a sudden, he made a left turn and I saw that it was our great Abedan. Then he bowed to me. He was wearing a yellow helmet and a yellow uniform. At that hour our Abedan was riding a bicycle very fast.</p>
<p>This evening we watched an Olympic cycle race. Abedan should have joined! One cyclist was going ahead of all the others. I felt sure he was going to win. Then, at the last moment, somebody came and overtook him.</p>
<p>Cycling is great fun if you watch it, but not if you cycle! If you cycle, you get cramps. Then you cry! I will never forget how many times I got cramps when we joined the 24-Hour Bike Race in Central Park. I still remember my worst cramp. The pain was excruciating. The muscles were all coming out of the body. Arpan came to me as my saviour. He saved my life by massaging me.</p>
<p>I also had the same experience when I used to run marathons. I have long forgotten that I did twenty-two marathons, but I will never, never forget the cramps that I got. The cramps during my marathons will remain immortal, but the marathons themselves I have forgotten. How much I suffered!</p>

<p>Yesterday in the morning, when I went walking, I saw Sumadhur crossing the street. He was going towards Agni Press. Then I walked a few blocks to Hoover Avenue. Yesterday I did not even know the name of the street, but today I looked for the street sign.</p>
<p>I was just a few metres from the end of the street. I did not cross the street; I was on the pavement, walking nicely. In front of me, a car was coming towards Parsons Boulevard. When it was about thirty metres from me, all of a sudden, both tyres on the right side gave way. The driver was panicking because he could not control his steering wheel. He was unable to drive the car straight and the car went up onto the pavement. There it did not stop. It was coming directly towards me. O God, what was I going to do?</p>
<p>I was so lucky that I was almost at the end of the street. Immediately I turned left and the car did not turn right. It went straight. After forty or fifty metres, the car stopped. The driver got out of the car and he was shaking all over.</p>
<p>What an experience I had yesterday! They say the sidewalk is safe, but no-where is safe. At any place, something can happen. Yesterday’s incident happened in a matter of a few seconds.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon I went for another walk. I saw an elderly lady. She looked very, very nice and dignified. She said to me, “Good afternoon, Sir!”</p>
<p>Poor me, nothing came out of my mouth because I was in my high meditation. I tried to say, “Good afternoon,” but nothing came out. I only smiled. Luckily, my smile saves me.</p>

<p>This morning one lady got a little bit mad at me. She wanted to know the time, but instead of asking me, she was just pointing to her left wrist. I did not understand what she wanted. She was just pointing and pointing. What could I do? Then she got annoyed. I did not know why she was angry. Then afterwards, when I walked away, I realised what she meant. She did not have a watch. I also was not wearing a watch.</p>
<p>This happened when I came to the Grand Central Parkway Service Road and crossed Parsons Boulevard. She was standing on the corner waiting for a car or something. She was pointing to her wrist, but I did not understand what she was asking. I have such funny, funny experiences when I go out.</p>

<p>This morning I walked three miles. The temperature was only 38 degrees! I made a right turn on the Grand Central Service Road and went a mile and a half. When I had come back about 600 metres, I saw a tall, thin, black runner taking very long strides. She said to me, “Okay, Sri Chinmoy!”</p>
<p>She was offering me her genuine encouragement.</p>

<p>Then I walked another 400 metres, and a small, red car stopped. I was on the pavement, so there was no problem. A tall, stout man came out of the back seat of the car and said to me very respectfully, “Salaam, God-man.”</p>
<p>Immediately I knew that he was Muslim. A young man was driving and the stout man was sitting in the back. I smiled at him and he entered into the car again and they drove away.</p>

<p>At my 200-metre mark I saw Chetana standing on the other side in a yellow jacket. She was standing there for her birthday, so I looked at her. I was in a very, very, very high consciousness, so I was not able to say hello to her. Inwardly I blessed her profusely.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw Nilima on 150th Street also. She has her own peculiar style.</p>

<p>Then I walked on the track for about two miles.</p>
