  <h2 id="page-title">Part I — Concentration, meditation and contemplation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part I — Concentration, meditation and contemplation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>1.</h2>

<p>Concentration means total identification. You focus all your attention on something and identify yourself with the object or the subject. Then you receive and grow into its essence, its divine essence.</p>
<p>When you concentrate, you have to choose something that gives you immediate joy. If you have a Master, your Master's picture will give you immediate joy. If you don't have a Master, select something that is very beautiful, divine and pure. A flower has all of these qualities. You can concentrate on a flower or anything else that gives you joy. Look at the flower and, while looking at the flower, feel that you have entered into the flower and become the flower. Then, in a few minutes, try to feel that you have become one with the consciousness of the flower. There will be no thoughts, good or bad, remaining in the mind. When you become one with the flower, the fragrance of the flower and the divine qualities of the flower will enter into you.</p>
<p>In the beginning you need a completely quiet place in which to concentrate. But if you are really advanced, at that time it does not matter. When I meditate and sing during a public function my concentration is very powerful. At that time it does not bother me when people are talking. But the talking may make other people unable to concentrate on my song. If I am concentrating here and somebody next to me is talking, I am totally unaware of him. I am in another world. But if someone starts making a noise, I will tell him to be quiet. It is not for my sake. Only I want to offer something, and if there is noise, then you will not be able to receive my offering.</p>
<p>After concentration comes meditation. In meditation, we enter into something vast. It may be Peace, Light or Bliss. When we get immense Peace, Light or Bliss in boundless measure, then we are meditating. When we meditate, we have to make our mind calm and quiet. This is absolutely necessary. If the mind is thinking of many things, then meditation can never happen.</p>
<p>Next we have to invoke the Presence of God. While invoking the Presence of God, we have to feel His constant inner guidance. Then, Peace, Light, Bliss and Power will descend. We can also get inner guidance from a spiritual Master. A Master can bring the soul of the seeker to the fore. The moment the soul comes forward, the heart immediately gets abundant joy and power. The power and joy of the heart then enter into the mind and the vital.</p>
<p>In terms of aspiration, the distances between concentration and meditation and meditation and contemplation are not the same. Between meditation and contemplation there is a very big gap. Many people do concentration when they have a great vital desire. If they want to become first in school or if they want to become a great football player, they will use tremendous vital power. When people are throwing the shotput or doing the pole vault, tremendous will power or concentration is needed. That is concentration from the vital. The power of concentration we automatically develop when we enter into sports. Athletes may not call it concentration. They only say, "My object is to throw the shotput farther than anybody." But that very idea or goal is concentration. But when it comes to meditation — making the mind calm, quiet, sublime and absolutely peaceful — that is too much for them. They will say that meditation has nothing to do with them. Again, many, many people on earth meditate or pray. Prayer and meditation are very similar. The only difference between prayer and meditation is that prayer goes up and meditation brings down. Both prayer and meditation are linked by a common goal. Prayer and meditation are like a see-saw. You are on one side and the Supreme is on the other side. You are going up and bringing down, but the Supreme remains on the other side.</p>
<p>Contemplation is a different process. During meditation and concentration, there is somebody with whom you are trying to be one. But in contemplation there is an interchange. You are playing two roles. At one moment you are what the Supreme is, on His side of the see-saw; you are on the same level with the Absolute. The next moment you are on the other side of the see-saw; He is acting as your Lord Supreme and you are acting as His supreme lover. Usually, the human mind is such that it says: "I have been worshipping Him all the time, so how can I be on the same level with Him?" But in contemplation this question does not arise. That is how contemplation is different from meditation and concentration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can you speak more on concentration?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can you speak more on concentration?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are three steps in the spiritual life: concentration, meditation and contemplation. Aspiration embodies all three of these divine qualities. We have to do first things first. If we cannot concentrate, then we cannot succeed in anything. If a student does not know how to concentrate on his studies, then he may fail every year. He will study, but if he has no power of concentration, then he won't remember anything.</p>
<p>The spiritual life also is a form of study. It is an inner study which is infinitely more difficult to learn. Once we start getting the result of this study, which is inner knowledge, at that time we feel that this knowledge is infinitely more important than the outer knowledge. So in the spiritual life we have to use our concentration at every second. If we do not know how to concentrate, then we are lost; we are doomed. We may meditate for ten hours, but we will not get any satisfactory result.</p>
<p>Concentration is our total or integral attention on a particular subject. We focus our attention on an object or subject and totally forget about the rest of the world. We do not allow the rest of the world to enter into our mind. Only we and the object of our concentration exist. When there is no third person before us or around us, that is concentration.</p>
<p>Even while we are doing japa, repeating God's Name, then also we can concentrate. In between each repetition there is a gap. During each gap we have to feel that there is nothing. Similarly, while we are concentrating, we have to feel that nothing exists between us and the object we are concentrating on.</p>
<p>In the ordinary life when we look at our fingers, the pinky may get sixty per cent of our attention, the ring finger may get twenty per cent, and the other fingers will get the rest. One is getting more attention than the others, true; but it is not getting one hundred per cent of our attention. When we concentrate various other things remain around us, like the other fingers. We may think of our breakfast or what somebody has said. These ideas are all around us like our other four fingers. But all our attention remains on the object of concentration. The pinky will get one hundred per cent of our concentration. In this way the seeker develops his power of concentration. Once he has achieved the power of concentration, then meditation becomes extremely easy. And when one has the capacity to do deeper and higher meditation, then contemplation becomes easy. So in this way we progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is prayer necessary?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is prayer necessary?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Prayer is necessary and meditation is necessary. However, if one becomes experienced in meditation, then prayer is not necessary. When I pray, I talk and my Father listens. When I meditate, my Father talks and I listen. There will come a time when I will not have to talk, because I will be the Supreme's conscious instrument. When I make total surrender, He will act in and through me. Once we go deeper in the spiritual life and our meditation becomes profound, we listen to God and no longer need to ask Him for anything.</p>
<p>Once we become His perfect instruments, He will execute His own Will in and through us. But until then, or as long as we feel that God does not care for us as much as we care for ourselves, we have to pray to be freed from ignorance and insecurity. Once we are realised, or on the verge of realisation, we see that God always knows our needs, so there is no necessity to pray for different things. We only want to surrender. When we feel that God is omnipresent and cares for us infinitely more than we care for ourselves, then prayer is not necessary because we belong to Him and we are His property. If we are His property, then we do not have a claim upon ourselves, although God will claim us as His very own.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People are showing considerable interest in meditation precisely because they are not satisfied with what they have and what they are. They want to have something more meaningful and fruitful in their lives. They have tried in every possible way to get that very thing, but unfortunately they have not acquired or achieved it. So they feel now that meditation is the answer. They are trying to explore meditation in order to have some satisfaction in life.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: How can I start meditating in the heart right from the beginning without going through the mind first?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You must direct your full, intense concentration on the heart. You must feel that you are not the mind. You have to feel that you are growing into the heart. You are only the heart and nothing else.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When I am meditating, sometimes I have trouble distinguishing whether what I feel is my mind imagining my heart or whether it is really my heart.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When I am meditating, sometimes I have trouble distinguishing whether what I feel is my mind imagining my heart or whether it is really my heart." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If it is your real heart, then you will get a sense of satisfaction, pure satisfaction. If it is the mind you may also get satisfaction, but immediately you will also get something else and that some thing else is doubt. Your experience will be attacked by other thoughts: "How can I have this kind of satisfaction? I am so bad, I am so impure, I am so ignorant. This morning I told a lie and yesterday I did something very wrong, so I cannot have this kind of satisfaction." When that kind of idea comes, then you will know that your experience was from the mind. When you get an experience with the mind, you may temporarily feel very happy, delighted. But you won't be able to establish your identification with what the mind has seen or felt or realised.</p>
<p>But once you get an experience from the heart, immediately you feel your oneness with it. When you see something with the heart, you get joy and immediately you are one with it. When you see a flower with your mind, you appreciate and admire it. But when you see it with your heart, immediately you feel either that your heart is inside the flower or that the flower is inside your heart. So when you have an experience and feel a kind of satisfaction, if you feel that you are one with the experience itself, then you will know that it is from the heart. But if you feel that the experience is something outside you that you are achieving, then it is from the mind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The thing is that while you are meditating, you do something with your eyes which is not good at all. You strain your eyes to a certain extent; they are so tight and stiff. You are normal, but your eyes are just pinched. So when you do something unwise with your eyes, the actual pressure falls on your heart centre and it is very harmful to your aspiration. If you can keep your eyes normal while you are meditating, without tightening them, then this pressure will go away. So when you meditate, try to feel a smooth flow inside you when you breathe in. You can keep your eyes open or keep your eyes closed; no harm. Only don't make them unnaturally stiff.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are pulling beyond your capacity. You feel you are meditating inside your heart, but you are being misguided. Actually you are meditating in your mind, but you are not able to feel the presence of your mind. If you really meditate on your heart you will develop the sense of identification. Then no matter how intensely you meditate, there can be no such problem.</p>
<p>Please be more conscious; then you will be able to discover that you are meditating in the mind. If you meditate in the heart, then no matter how many hours you meditate or how much Peace, Light and Bliss enters into your heart, you will not get headaches.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know what kind of inspiration it is. If it is an illumining inspiration, then you should follow it. If it is a creative inspiration to do something really good, then follow it. Any creative thought, anything that gives you a higher goal, should be followed. If a particular inspiration brings something new into your life, if it will transform your life, then that inspiration you should follow. Only then can you become really great and good.</p>
<p>But inspiration has a very wide range, from the lowest to the highest. While you are in a very low consciousness, when inspiration comes, it may be absolutely gross and mundane. During meditation some people think of making most delicious cookies or eggplant. While you are not praying, if you get inspiration to cook something, that is different.</p>
<p>You have to know that the mind makes you feel that inspiration is only in the mind whereas aspiration is only in the heart. But you have to know that aspiration can be in the mind and inspiration can be in the heart. Inspiration can come to aspiration and vice versa. One can go into the other. But it must be of a very high type, or it cannot help us at all.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can one discipline the mind during meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can one discipline the mind during meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is only during meditation that you get the opportunity to discipline the mind. When you are not in meditation you will see that each thought or idea is composed of words. If you enter into an idea you will see that it is formulated with words. Words come and form a sentence either inside or outside your mind and there you get an idea. But during deep meditation, you do not need words to form an idea. There the idea comes in a flash in the form of light, or light will bring the idea right in front of your vision. At that time you will immediately see the incident or truth that you want to envision in your life.</p>
<p>How can you discipline your mind during meditation? You can discipline the mind only by forgetting the existence of the mind and feeling that you do not have a mind. You may think, "If I do not have a mind, then how can I exist? I will become an idiot without a mind." But I tell each and every one of my disciples that the mind you get from books, the mind you utilise while conversing with people, the mind you require in order to exist on earth, cannot take you even an inch towards God-realisation. It is lame. It is blind. It is deaf. The mind is your enemy.</p>
<p>During meditation if you can really make yourself feel that you have only the heart, or if you can feel that you do not even have the heart, but that your whole existence from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head is the soul, then you will see that the mind does not exist. But if you cannot feel the presence of your soul, you can easily feel your heart's presence and your heart's glow. When you see light glowing in the heart or in the soul, you can rest assured that you have already transcended the intellectual mind. At this stage you have entered into the illumined mind, which is very different from the reasoning, intellectual mind.</p>
<p>When the light grows in the heart or the light comes out of the soul and permeates the entire body, at that time the mind is automatically disciplined. If you want to discipline the mind by hope, it is impossible. It is just like straightening the tail of a dog. But if you can live in the soul or even in the heart, then the light of the inner existence either transforms the physical mind and brings it into the higher regions, or it brings down the all-fulfilling peace from above into the gross physical mind. When peace descends or the mind ascends into the higher domain of light, at that time the mind automatically disappears.</p>

<h2>Question: After I have a good meditation I lose it. What can I do to maintain my meditation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Consciously, you don't want to preserve the treasure. Either you mix with unaspiring people or you don't want to preserve your meditation. You are not valuing the treasure. You think: "Even if I lose it I will get it again tomorrow." No, you have to value it, preserve it in the heart-pocket. I always tell you to assimilate your meditation. Once you eat something you must assimilate it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When we are having a high meditation, what is the method that we can use to stay at that point where we know and feel that there is no separation between any of us?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When we are having a high meditation, what is the method that we can use to stay at that point where we know and feel that there is no separation between any of us?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How can we feel that we are all one? It is on the strength of our conscious aspiration. Right now, let us say, early in the morning we meditate for ten minutes, and then we go to work. For seven or eight hours we are unfortunately compelled to mix with people who are unaspiring. We are thrown into a world of desire, fear, anxiety, worries and so forth. At that time we lose our best consciousness and then it becomes almost impossible for us to feel our oneness with others.</p>
<p>Here in the meditation hall we are all aspiring; that is why our consciousness is elevated. Then, when we go home, our consciousness will go down. Some calamity will take place or something else will happen and we will lose our aspiration. Even if there is nothing outwardly to prevent us from aspiring, our own limited being will not allow us to stay on the top of the tree. Sometimes there is no outer disturbance, but even then we find it difficult to remain on the top of the tree because we do not normally live there. We aspire for half an hour with utmost sincerity and then relaxation starts. We feel that we have worked very hard. We have played our part for five minutes or half an hour, and now we feel we can take rest for an hour or two. So we start reading a newspaper, or watching television, and in this way we enter into relaxation.</p>
<p>But if we want to maintain our standard, the height of our aspiration, then we should be continuous, flowing. Suppose we have meditated for an hour. We may not be able to meditate again for another hour or so. No harm, we shall do something which will maintain and preserve our meditation. We can read spiritual books or sing spiritual songs. At that time, automatically our inner being will inspire us to read books. We won't have to use the mind to think, "Oh, the time has come for me to read." No, our inner being will help us to do the right thing. Right now the inner being is deep inside us, deeply hidden; but we are trying our best, through yoga, to bring the inner being to the fore. Then, after reading for a half hour or an hour, we can go to visit a spiritual friend or, if that is not possible, call him up on the phone and speak about our experiences.</p>
<p>Then we can write about our own experiences. We won't want to publish them, no. But while we are writing them down we are revealing our own inner light and perfecting our spiritual nature. For half an hour we can write and we can read what we have written. Each time we read about one of our own experiences, we get abundant peace, light and bliss. This is not our false imagination. As soon as we have written, we have created something. The creator always wants to enjoy his creation. Look at the gardener. The gardener takes great pain in planting the flower and watering it. Then, after six or seven months when he sees the flower, he deeply appreciates and admires it. Similarly, we also get joy from our own creations.</p>
<p>In this way, doing all these things, we can go on for five or six hours. Even while we are eating we can remember what experiences we had while meditating early in the morning. This imagination is like a battery. We are charging our memory with our spiritual progress. In this way we can continue, entering or retaining our meditation.</p>
<p>But unfortunately we don't do this. We meditate for half an hour or forty-five minutes. Then we feel tired and exhausted. So we mix with unaspiring people, we read unaspiring books, we do so many wrong things after we meditate. We feel that we have seen one shore of the river, so we want to go to the other shore. But the other shore is unfortunately all darkness. We have to try to remain on the shore that has light. We have to do things which will increase our meditation or, at least, retain the power of the meditation. We have to be very wise in our day-to-day lives in how we spend each hour, each second. A time will come when we won't have to have any restrictions in our life; our life itself will be a continuous flow of aspiration. But now we have to use our conscious mind in order to aspire.</p>
<p>So we have to meditate early in the morning and then read, sing spiritual songs or mix with spiritual people. Then, when we are in the office or doing some other activity, we have to try to remain with the spiritual flow that we had early in the morning. From our early morning meditation we acquired peace, light and bliss, which is spiritual money. We have to then deposit this money inside our heart, which is the safest of all banks. Then, when we are in the office, when we need protection from unaspiring people, we can concentrate on our heart and bring forward a little of the peace, light and bliss which we acquired early in the morning. In this way we will be able to maintain our own spiritual standard and keep our level of consciousness high.</p>

<h2>Question: What is the advantage of joining a specific path and meditating with others?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It becomes easier to meditate if you follow a specific path. From your spiritual family you will get additional strength. If you don't have a spiritual family, then you will feel that you are lost. In your family you have a father, mother, brother, sister and dear ones. When you fall sick, immediately somebody else in the family will take care of you. In this case, falling sick means to have doubt. That is the real sickness. If you have doubt, the medical hospital will not be able to help you. It is only the spiritual hospital and the spiritual doctors, who are your brother and sister disciples who will be able to help you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not others' impurity or any other negative force that is entering into you. No. Your difficulty is that when you sit in front, you try to pull far beyond your capacity. When I am on stage, the whole stage is flooded with light, When you sit in front of me and look at me, you try to pull. It is as if you are in a shop and you see all sorts of most beautiful things. Like a greedy fellow you want to buy everything, yet you have in your pocket only five cents. When you try to pull beyond the capacity of your receptivity, at that time you get head pain.</p>
