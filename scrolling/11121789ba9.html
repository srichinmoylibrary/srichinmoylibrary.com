<p>In our Father's Day Marathon, one Swedish girl was so strong! She was wearing trousers, thicker than the thickest. She was trying to lose weight and not going fast. But she was very, very strong. And it was so hot, so hot! Of all the runners, Surabhi should get a prize for her style.</p>

<p>Yesterday my pace was 18:40 per mile walking. Today it became 17:30 â€” so I am progressing. And yesterday somebody insulted me very badly. I was struggling and struggling. After my two-mile mark, each stride was agony. An elderly white man passed by me and said, "Why don't you go to a lunatic institute?" He was very serious. It was not a joke. His voice was full of contempt. I thanked him.</p>

<p>Yesterday, early in the morning at 4:35, I left my house to go walking. When I came to my 500-metre mark on 150th Street, I saw a car coming towards me. I was on the sidewalk and the car was on the same side of the street. Someone in the car called out, "Stop, stop!" I stopped and I saw that two young men were in the car. The driver was drunk. He said to me, "Shrai, Shrai." The other one was Puerto Rican. He said to me, "Sri Chinmoy, you are a man of wisdom. Please give me some wisdom." The driver screamed, "No, man, he is a man of light, light, light. Give me light, light." He was screaming very loudly. This drunk one was quite aggressive. I said to myself, "Oh, what an experience to have at this hour!" Just then a bus came up behind them and chased the car away. So I continued walking. Then, when I came to my 700-metre mark, the same car came back in the other direction, on the other side of the street from me. This time the Puerto Rican was driving. He said, "Sri Chinmoy, is it true that you have lifted such heavy weights?" I said, "Yes." He went on, "I see your picture all around." Then he added, "I trust you." Just at that moment we reached the Grand Central Service Road. I made a left turn and the car made a right turn. I did not see them again.</p>

<p>When I came to my 1200-metre mark, right near Main Street, one American man was jogging. He was behind me, but he passed me. As he went by, at least six or seven times he said, "Good morning, Sri, Sri, Sri." Then I said "Good morning" several times. At Main Street, he made a left turn and I kept going straight.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The car thieves</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The car thieves" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>How much can happen in one day! I crossed Main Street and I was coming towards Queens Boulevard. When I came to my 1500-metre mark, I saw a tall, young man and a girl near one of the cars up ahead. All of a sudden, they left that car and went to the next car right in front of that one. Perhaps they were opening the car. Then I started walking a little faster towards them and the girl ran away in the direction of the side road that goes to Union Turnpike. So I suspected something. When I came near the man, I said, "What are you doing?" The man repeated, "What am I doing?" He had something with him, an iron instrument. He immediately put his hand inside his pocket and brought out a cigarette. He said, "Man, can you give me a match?" I said, "You are planning to break into this car. I am going to bring my students to thrash you." He said, "No!" Then I said, "I am going to this house to inform them." He looked at me and I looked at him. Then he said, "Damn you!" He did not break into the car. He just went away. I saw the number of the plate on the small grey car â€” LOX 118. When I saw that this fellow had left, I continued walking.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">&quot;Lord Jesus, save me!&quot;</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&amp;quot;Lord Jesus, save me!&amp;quot;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My walking experiences were not yet over. I continued to my mile and a half mark. I was walking slowly, since I can barely walk. I reached the mark and I was returning the same way. When I had gone another 100 metres, an old, black man with short, grey hair came from behind me and passed me. He was carrying newspapers. He was about thirty metres ahead of me when, all of a sudden, he stopped. When I came near him, he asked, "What is the matter with you? You cannot walk." I said, "I have a very bad knee injury. That is why I cannot walk." I placed my hand on my right knee. The old man was very sympathetic. He said, "Let me accompany you." So we started walking together. At first he was walking fast, but when he saw that I was struggling, he slowed down to accompany me. I gave him a smile. He started saying, "Lord Jesus, save me! Lord Jesus, cure me!" Then he said, "Now say this with me." So I joined him. Nobody was there to hear us. He started accompanying me at my one mile plus 600-metre mark. At the 300-metre mark, he started chanting out loud. Both of us were saying, "Lord Jesus, save me! Lord Jesus, cure me!" together. When we came to the one mile and 100-metre mark, he turned down the side street going towards Union Turnpike, near the Motor Inn. I thanked him profusely. He was such a simple man, with such faith in Jesus. But Lord Jesus did not listen to my prayer. So all these things happened in one day.</p>
