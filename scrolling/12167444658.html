  <h2 id="page-title">Flight Technicalities</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Flight Technicalities" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In the beginning the pilot started talking to us. He said, "I know it does not make any sense, but we have to do our duty." Then he started telling all about our speed, our altitude, and so-on. But he was right. It was too technical.</p>
<p>The plane was going 1,320 miles per hour or even 1,500 miles per hour. The flight usually takes three hours and twenty-five minutes, but this time it took only three hours and five minutes.</p>
<p>When the plane is stopping, it goes 225 miles per hour. At that time you can appreciate that it was going 1,300. But when it is going at the fastest speed, you are not aware of it; you cannot see anything. The plane was flying at twice the height of Mount Everest.</p>
<p>Because it was such a short flight, I didn't get any leg pain. Even going to Puerto Rico, which is often a three-and-a-half-hour trip, I get cramps in my legs. But after the Concorde ride, when I stood up, there was no pain. Now I will go to California, and it will take five and a half hours!</p>
<p>From now on when I go to India, how I wish I could go to London on the Concorde. Otherwise, it is such a long trip, I suffer so much. But it is really expensive! I am not a millionaire and my disciples are not millionaires, so this was perhaps my first and last time flying on the Concorde.</p>

<p>On the plane everyone got a souvenir ballpoint saying that they had been on the Concorde. They said that anyone who wanted could come up for a certificate. A few ladies went up to get one. When the last lady went up, the certificates were all used up. The stewardess apologised and said to her, "Hope to see you again."</p>
<p>The lady replied, "I can't afford to see you again."</p>
<p>Right from the beginning of the ride, the flight attendants came and asked, "Do you want anything?" They meant well, but they didn't have enough people to give us excellent service. They should have more attendants helping.</p>

<p>When I was waiting on line in the immigration area here at Kennedy Airport, a young girl behind me gave me a smile and started talking to me. She said, "Do you mind? I am behind you but I am very tired, very exhausted. Can I go before you?"</p>
<p>She was a young girl of 23 or 24 years, and I am an old man. She was not an American, because we were both in the alien area, but I thought perhaps she was a French girl. There were many people on line, but she asked only to go ahead of me. After me, she couldn't go forward anymore because I was at the front of the line. I didn't see if she was actually behind me on line to start with. Perhaps this is how she got to the front of the line from somewhere near the back.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Harmonium Experiences</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Harmonium Experiences" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Before I left for California, Vinaya ordered a case for my new big harmonium. I gave him the money and he bought it, only to discover it was too big — three times larger than the instrument itself. And he had measured the harmonium first!</p>
<p>I said, "Vinaya, you have bought my coffin!"</p>
<p>That particular harmonium is by far the best, so I wanted to take it to San Francisco. Two weeks earlier I had received it from India. The last time I was in Calcutta I played it in the store and I liked it so much. The people in the store were kind enough to send me the same one.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Japan I went via San Francisco. In San Francisco I liked a particular harmonium and I bought it. They said, "Oh, we will ship it to New York," and I believed them. When I got back to New York there was a- harmonium, but not the one I had bought.</p>

<p>A woman who came to our concert in Davies Hall was so moved by my singing and playing. Afterwards she wrote a long letter to our music store saying how happy she was to have been able to come because it was so worthwhile. Then, in the last line she said, "I have never heard God play on the flute before."</p>
<p>This time San Francisco gave me two "God" experiences. The other one occurred on the plane on the way home.</p>

<p>Chandika's brother helped arrange my first trip to California. I'll never forget that unique experience when I went to see him in the Morning Star commune near Santa Cruz. There were cockroaches and other insects all over. Nobody has asked me so many questions in this incarnation as he did.</p>

<p>The first time I went to Berkeley, it was not at all a good experience. One person would ask me a question and six others would stand up to answer it. I could not answer a question before two or three others also started answering the question. Then, while I was speaking, people in the audience were whistling.</p>
<p>But they have made progress at Berkeley. This time when I came they were silent, and they were kind enough to clap after the meditation.</p>

<p>In San Francisco's Chinatown a man recognised me in the street. He said, "It's Sri Chinmoy! I can't believe this! I went to your concert last night. It was so beautiful." He was so happy and excited to see me.</p>
<p>The man was with a friend. He asked me to bless a coin that he had. So I put the coin in my right palm and meditated on it — not for one second, but very seriously, very powerfully I blessed his coin. He was so moved and grateful.</p>
<p>When he saw me on the stage I was wearing my Indian clothes. In Chinatown I was wearing a track suit, but he still recognised me. This man was very nice. When people are nice to me, I try to be nice to them.</p>

<p>At the Guinness Museum we saw a 455-pound man. Previously, he and his brother had both weighed the same, but recently his brother died.</p>
<p>His wife weighs only 95 pounds. He said that his wife is thin but his brother's wife is fat. Everybody was curious to know his brother's wife's weight. It is 125 pounds!</p>
<p>When I saw his thigh, I couldn't believe it. Of course, he has custom-made trousers. Then we saw the tallest woman and the tallest man — he is eight feet something.</p>

<p>For my flight to San Francisco, Sandhani the great got me a discount. I almost never fly first class, but economy class is real torture for me, because there is no room to stretch out and after three hours my legs give way. I get such pain! And San Francisco takes practically six hours' flying.</p>
<p>Garima is always kind to me. When I said that I always have knee trouble because of the lack of room in economy, she wanted to change my ticket from economy to ambassador class for the return trip. She was asking me to let her change my ticket because she said the ambassador-class seats are very wide. She was begging me to let her pay the difference.</p>
<p>So I agreed, and Garima had to pay the difference, first between super-saver and economy, and then between economy and ambassador.</p>

<p>At the airport the plane was an hour and a half late. I was chatting with the disciples in the lounge, cutting jokes and just killing time. As usual, the disciples were looking at me with affection, love and devotion, as though they were all about to realise God in the next second.</p>
<p>One middle-aged man was observing us. When it came time to board, strangely enough the disciples were allowed to come very near the entrance to the plane. So that man got mad. He came up to me and said, "Who do you think you are — God? These people are worshipping you as if you were God. Since you are God, you enter first!"</p>
<p>I said, "I am not blocking your way. You please go first."</p>
<p>Standing in front of him were Agraha and Brad. Immediately they wanted to go with me into the plane to protect me, but I said it was not necessary.</p>

<p>Once I entered into the plane, I took my seat in the ambassador class section and was getting ready to write poems. In five minutes' time the same man came to me with a pillow and a blanket and said, "God, take this!"</p>
<p>Previously he was mad at me, but this time he was joking. I didn't say anything to him. I just smiled. God didn't accept his offering, but God was grateful to him.</p>
<p>Then he put the pillow and blanket on the seat next to me.</p>

<p>Then the man said, "You should sue the airline. You are paying for ambassador class, but the seats are so narrow! They are gypping you."</p>
<p>I also felt that the seats were unbearably narrow, but I didn't want to make a fuss. I just thought that I would cut jokes with Garima afterwards, saying that this was her ambassador class — extra cost, but no extra room! Then I said to myself, "Perhaps I should sue Snigdha; she works for that airline."</p>
<p>When my friend started complaining, a stewardess came and said I would get a full refund. Some of the planes have the new ambassador-class seats, but this particular plane had not yet been remodelled.</p>
