<p><em>(A holy man is swimming in the river. An onlooker is sitting idly on the bank watching him. The holy man sees a scorpion right in front of him. Feeling sorry for the poor creature, he catches hold of it and very slowly, very gently puts it on land. While he is doing this, the scorpion stings him severely. The man begins to weep with pain.)</em></p>
<p>HOLY MAN: I wanted to save you, and I did save you. Is this my reward? Anyway, I have done my duty.</p>
<p><em>(A few minutes later the scorpion again falls into the river. Again the onlooker observes.)</em></p>
<p>HOLY MAN: Ah, poor creature, you are suffering again. I feel sorry for you.</p>
<p><em>(He lifts the scorpion again and puts it on land. Once more the scorpion stings him, this time even more severely. He screams with excruciating pain.)</em></p>
<p>ONLOOKER: You are a fool! Why did you do that? The first time you made a mistake, and the second time you repeated the same mistake.</p>
<p>HOLY MAN: My friend, what can I do? My nature is to love, my nature is to save. The nature of the scorpion is to hate, the nature of the scorpion is to sting. I have to follow my own nature, and the scorpion has to follow its own nature. If it falls into the water again, I shall lift it up again, no matter how many times it falls. I shall be stung, I shall cry, I shall moan; but I shall not deny my nature, which is to love, to save and to protect others.</p>
<p><em>(The onlooker immediately jumps into the river to touch the feet of the holy man.)</em></p>
<p>ONLOOKER: You are my teacher, you are my Guru. I have been searching, longing for a Guru. Today I have found in you my real Guru. Since I am your disciple, from now on if the scorpion falls into the river it is I who will put it back on land.</p>
<p><em>(Disciple sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Amar bhabana</em><br /><em>Amar kamana</em><br /><em>Amar eshana</em><br /><em>Amar sadhana</em><br /><em>Tomar charane</em><br /><em>Peyechhe ajike thai</em><br /><em>Moher bandhan hiyar jatan</em><br /><em>Timir jiban shaman shasan</em><br /><em>Halo abasan nai nai ar nai</em></p>


<p>[My thoughts, my desires, my aspiration, my<br />     life’s disciplines<br /> Have found their haven at Your Feet today.<br /> The bondage of tempting attachment and pangs<br />     of the heart,<br /> The life of darkness and the torture of death,<br /> No more I see, no more I feel.]</p>

<p><em>(He helps the holy man out of the river. The Guru now sits on the bank and watches the scene. In a few minutes the scorpion again falls into the river. The disciple catches hold of it and puts it on dry land, but the scorpion does not bite him.)</em></p>
<p>DISCIPLE: How is it, Master, that I was not stung at all? I thought that I too would be stung by the scorpion. Twice you were stung mercilessly. I don’t understand.</p>
<p>MASTER: My child, you don’t understand? Shall I tell you? Will you believe me?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: Please, please tell me. I shall believe you, Master.</p>
<p>MASTER: The scorpion also has a soul; and its soul told the scorpion that, if it had bitten you, instead of putting it on land you would have killed it immediately. The scorpion knew that you would not accept it, that you would not tolerate its ingratitude. From you the scorpion did not get any assurance of its safety. The scorpion did not sting you because it felt this. In my case, the soul of the scorpion knew that I would never kill it, no matter how many times it might sting me; I would just catch it and put it on land for its safety. In the everyday world also people fight, quarrel and threaten others only when they see that their opponents are either weak or unwilling to fight. If they see that somebody is stronger than themselves, they will remain silent.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: Master, do you have disciples?</p>
<p>MASTER: I have many, many disciples.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: What do you do with them?</p>
<p>MASTER: I give and take, and take and give. I take their poison every day, and I give them nectar. I take their aspiration, and I give them realisation. I take from them what they have, ignorance; and I give them what I have, wisdom. They give me the assurance of my manifestation, and I give them the assurance of their realisation. We need each other. You need me so that you can empty yourself into me: your impurity, imperfection, obscurity and ignorance. And I need you so that I can empty my Joy, Love and Light into you. I need you so that I can fill you with my all, with everything that is within me. This is how we fulfil each other. Your nature is to give me what you have: Impurity, obscurity, imperfection, limitation, bondage and death. My nature is to give you what I have: Purity, Love, Joy, Light, Bliss and Perfection. When your nature enters into my nature and my nature enters into your nature, we both are totally manifested and totally fulfilled. This is how the seeker and the teacher fulfil the Eternal Pilot, the Supreme.</p>

<p>PRAJAPATI, THE CREATOR</p>
<p>THE EYE</p>
<p>THE EAR</p>
<p>THE ORGAN OF SPEECH</p>
<p>THE MIND</p>
<p>THE LIFE-ENERGY</p>
<p>THE BODY</p>
<p>A terrible dispute arose among the Eye, the Ear, the Organ of Speech, the Mind and the Life-Energy. Each one was sure that he was by far the greatest. They quarrelled and quarrelled, but they could not come to any satisfactory conclusion; so they decided to go to Prajapati and settle the problem once and for all.</p>

<p><em>(Prajapati’s abode. The Eye, the Ear, the Organ of Speech, the Mind and the Life-Energy appear, bringing the Body with them. They all bow to Prajapati.)</em></p>
<p>THE ORGAN OF SPEECH: O Prajapati, save us, save us. We are having a terrible dispute. Each of us feels that he is the greatest, and now we want to know for sure who is the greatest among us.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: My children, you have put me into terrible difficulty. If I tell any one of you that he is the greatest, the others will be displeased and angry with me, and they will literally hate me. Why don’t you solve your problem yourselves?</p>
<p>THE MIND: O Prajapati, we have tried our best. We have tried to solve this problem, but it is simply impossible for us. Each one of us feels that he is the greatest. It is you alone who can solve our problem. We shall, without fail, accept your judgment.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: Is it true? Are you all sure that you will accept my judgment? Whatever I say, you will believe gladly, cheerfully and wholeheartedly?</p>
<p>THE EYE: Of course, of course. Had it not been our intention to accept you as the judge supreme, we would not have come to you. Please tell us who is actually the greatest among us.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: My divine children, allow me to concentrate for a few seconds. Then I shall let you know. <em>(Concentrates.)</em> Ah, I have an excellent idea. I won’t have to tell you who the greatest is. You will be able to find out for yourselves.</p>
<p>THE EAR: O Prajapati, you are avoiding the issue. We could not solve our problem ourselves; that is why we came to you. And now you are telling us that we can solve the problem ourselves. We have come here; we are bowing down to you and touching your feet, O Prajapati. Please do not avoid us, do not evade the issue. Tell us frankly, we beg of you, who is the greatest among us.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: My sweet children, just listen to me. You can easily know who is the greatest, and I will tell you how. Here you all are before me: the Eye, the Ear, the Organ of Speech, the Mind and the Life-Energy. Now will you do one thing?</p>
<p>THE ORGAN OF SPEECH: Yes, we shall do it. We shall at least try.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: Try. You will succeed; you are bound to succeed. Now, here is my advice. One by one you will leave the Body for a year. The one whose absence makes the Body suffer most, or prevents the Body from functioning at all, is the most important.</p>
<p>THE MIND: Ah, that is very easy. We shall easily find out who is really the greatest.</p>
<p><em>(With folded hands they bow to Prajapati and leave. The Body follows them.)</em></p>

<p>THE ORGAN OF SPEECH: Let me go out of the Body first. Let me get the first chance. I know I am the greatest. If I don’t speak, the world will think that the Body is dead. It is I who bring glory to the Body. I speak, and people appreciate and admire. I teach the world with my knowledge and inner wisdom. It is I who bring all joy, pride and satisfaction to the Body. Undoubtedly I am the greatest. You have not believed me so far, but now I will go out for a year; and when I come back you all will see and realise that it is I who have all along been the greatest.</p>

<p>THE ORGAN OF SPEECH <em>(to the Body)</em>: How is it that you are quite all right? I thought that you would suffer greatly. Did you not suffer from my absence?</p>
<p>THE BODY: I am sorry, but I did not miss you badly. As a matter of fact, I did not miss you at all. On the contrary, my silence gave me much inner strength. As you know, a dumb person does not speak, yet he exists on earth. In my case, since I am spiritual, I found your absence quite helpful. I enjoyed it tremendously. At long last I was able to take a little rest. You talked too much for a long time.</p>
<p>THE ORGAN OF SPEECH: You ungrateful creature! Just wait; I shall show you! I shall teach you a lesson!</p>
<p>THE EYE: O Speech, I always knew that you were not the greatest, and here is the proof. In your absence we <em>did</em> exist, we <em>did</em> enjoy everything. Now it is my turn. I shall show you all. I shall prove to you all who is the greatest.</p>
<p>THE EAR: For God’s sake, O Eye, don’t brag! Until my turn is over the rest of you cannot know who the greatest is.</p>
<p>THE EYE: Oh, be quiet! I am leaving now. Just watch what happens to you all, you fools!</p>

<p>THE EYE: How strange, how strange! I can’t believe my eyes! How is it that you were not affected at all by my absence? You seem to be quite happy and healthy.</p>
<p>THE BODY: O Eye, you are perfectly right. In your absence I enjoyed something really deep and profound.</p>
<p>THE EYE: What nonsense do you speak? What did you enjoy? Tell me! What kind of deep realisation did you have during my absence?</p>
<p>THE BODY: O Eye, in the past you showed me many uncomely things, many ugly things on earth. I saw tremendous suffering through you. But this year I have not seen any ugliness, darkness, imperfection, poverty or other undivine things, and for that I am truly happy. A man without sight can easily live on earth. There are many people who cannot see, but still manage most satisfactorily. I enjoyed your absence, and I have profited and gained tremendously from it.</p>
<p>THE EYE: O ungrateful Body, wait! Wait! I shall smash your pride one day! Just you wait!</p>
<p>THE EAR: O Eye, I told you before you left that you could never be the greatest, and now you see that my prophecy has come true. Now it is my turn. We shall see how well you can get along without me!</p>

<p><em>(A year has passed. The Ear comes back.)</em></p>
<p>THE EAR: O Body, I can’t believe my ears! I can’t! How is it that you have not suffered in the least during my absence? How could you live one full year, one long year, without me? It is unthinkable, unimaginable!</p>
<p>THE BODY: O Ear! I did not suffer at all in your absence. When you were here, I used to hear gossip; I used to hear about others’ jealousy, about others’ shortcomings, imperfections, limitations — about all kinds of deficiencies in human nature. But for one full year I did not hear anything undivine. Nobody bothered me, no body brought me news; I did not hear any quarrels. I myself was my only thought, my only idea and my only news. I was so happy. I didn’t miss you at all. On the contrary, you did me a great favour by leaving me for a year. From the human point of view, you know that a deaf person can easily live on earth and do everything except hear. Who cares for hearing, as long as one can stay on earth happily and peacefully? Your presence is not at all essential, and here is the proof.</p>
<p>THE EAR: O ungrateful Body, wait, wait! A day will come when I shall teach you a serious lesson. Then I shall humble you; I shall bring down your pride and smash it. There will surely be some way for me to make you feel how great I am. Wait; wait and see!</p>
<p>THE MIND: Now it is my turn. O Organ of Speech O Eye, O Ear, you have all failed. Now it is my turn.</p>
<p>THE ORGAN OF SPEECH, THE EYE AND THE EAR <em>(together)</em>: Try, Mind, try. Like us, you too will be unsuccessful. Don’t boast. We know your capacity, which is incapacity!</p>
<p>THE MIND <em>(angrily)</em>: The time will soon arrive when you will see how badly you need me, you fools, you brainless sheep! I will prove to you in my absence that you are all idiots, nothing but idiots! Wait and see what happens to you when I am gone!</p>

<p><em>(A year later the Mind returns.)</em></p>
<p>THE MIND: What? Are you all right? It is beyond my imagination! How, how can you exist without me? O Body, didn’t you feel <em>anything</em> during my absence? Didn’t you see that the world hated you for your stupidity and your ignorance? It is I who am all knowledge, all wisdom inside you. I am sure that, the moment I left, the world began to despise you, to ridicule you. You must have behaved like a real fool, an idiot, an imbecile. Tell me what actually happened in my absence.</p>
<p>THE BODY: O Mind, in your absence I enjoyed something very vast, something very profound.</p>
<p>THE MIND: What is all this nonsense? What did you enjoy during my absence that was so vast and deep? It is unthinkable, unbelievable!</p>
<p>THE BODY: Mind, you caused tremendous suffering for me. You brought doubts into me, you brought suspicion into me and, what is much worse, you brought jealousy into me. O Mind, in your absence I had such peace, such peace! I did not think of anybody with suspicion, fear, doubt, anxiety or worry. I was all peace, all peace. If one does not have a mind one can exist on earth. There are many who do not have a mind at all, but they live on earth in their own way. Look at children. They do not have the mind. They need to be told everything. Yet how pure, how sweet, how loving, how divine they are! But when you come, everything is lost. They gain the mind and their whole existence becomes mean, suspicious and destructive. You are not needed, not at all! In the spiritual world we see how happy we are when we go beyond the mind. At each moment we enjoy the vast, infinite Peace, Light and Bliss. When we transcend the mind, we become one with the universal consciousness. No, Mind, you are not indispensable.</p>
<p>LIFE-ENERGY: My friends, all of you have tried and all of you have failed. Now I shall try. I have no idea what my fate will be but, if I succeed, we will all be able to share the glory. If I fail, then I will be one of you, and have the same deplorable fate. I shall share my success and glory with you if I succeed. And if I also am defeated, I shall share your disappointment.</p>
<p>THE ORGAN OF SPEECH: Stop, Life-Energy! Don’t be so modest, don’t be so humble! What is wrong with you today? Why are you saying such divine things? Where was your consciousness when we went to Prajapati in order to know who is the greatest? For so many years you quarrelled and fought with us, as we did with you. Now today you are saying that you will share your success with us. Why this sudden generosity? We don’t care for your false modesty. You go out and see. Your pride will also have to bite the dust. You will also fail miserably, just like us.</p>
<p>LIFE-ENERGY: Even if I fail I shall not curse the Body. I shall accept my defeat cheerfully and gladly.</p>
<p>THE OTHERS <em>(together)</em>: Go ahead and leave. Stop giving us your philosophy, and leave!</p>
<p><em>(Life-Energy is about to leave the body.)</em></p>
<p>THE BODY: Oh stop, stop! Where are you going? I am practically dead. I can’t exist without you. I can live perfectly without the Organ of Speech, the Eye, the Ear and the Mind; but without you, it is impossible for me to exist. O Life-Energy, don’t leave me!</p>
<p>THE EYE: Oh, I am blind! I can’t see anything! I am lost! I am in total darkness! Everything around me is dark!</p>
<p>THE EAR: I don’t hear anything! What is wrong with me? I can’t hear. I am now totally deaf. On the earth, children are playing, but I don’t hear their shouts. There are rivers, but I don’t hear their murmuring. There is no sound. I am dead. My existence is nullified.</p>
<p>THE ORGAN OF SPEECH: Oh, I am gone! I am lost! I can’t say a word! I have so many things to tell the world, so much advice to offer, but I can’t, I can’t. I am dead! I have no strength, no power!</p>
<p>THE MIND: Oh, I am lost! I can’t think of a thing! I am worse than a fool. I don’t have even one idea. Nothing comes to my mind. What is wrong with me? I can’t exist in your absence, O Life-Energy. I have to think, I <em>have</em> to! If I can’t think, I am lost. O Life-Energy, don’t leave me, don’t leave!</p>
<p><em>(Prajapati appears before them. All bow to him with deep gratitude. Prajapati blesses them, one by one.)</em></p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: So, my children, now you know who is by far the greatest among you.</p>
<p><em>(Except for the Body and the Life-Energy, the others are sad, depressed and angry.)</em></p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: I have come to you with divine advice. Listen to me. This advice will make you happy and immortal on earth. It is time for you all to enter into a new Cosmic Game. From now on you, Organ of Speech, will only tell the Truth. Truth is all; Truth is above all. It is my Truth that holds the world. Tell the Truth. Nothing is greater than Truth. Don’t utter anything false; don’t mix with falsehood anymore. Use the Truth as your divine weapon to please the world and to win the world. <em>(To the Eye.)</em> O Eye, from now on try only to see the Beauty in my creation. See Beauty in human beings, Beauty in every object! Beauty, only Beauty. If you see Beauty, then you can become one with my inner and outer divinity. It is in Beauty that one can see and grow into Perfection. Beauty is the manifestation of Truth. Beauty is the only Reality of Truth. <em>(To the Ear.)</em> O Ear, from now on hear only the Truth. The message of Truth comes only from real spiritual seekers. When you have a spiritual Master, whatever you hear him say is the Ultimate Truth. Cry to hear his voice, his Truth, his Light, it is only by hearing the Truth that your inner awakening will take place. It is only by listening to him that you will be able to realise the Highest. Use your capacity to hear only divine things from divine people, and not to enjoy gossip and other undivine utterances from the world. <em>(To the Mind.)</em> O Mind, from now on remain in the Heart. There you will be safe. The aspiring Heart will always receive Light from the Soul, and this Light the Heart will offer to you at every moment. When you receive the Light from your Heart, you will be illumined. There will come a time when you will be able to transcend yourself. You will enter into the ocean of Peace, Light and Bliss. Mind, no longer allow doubt, suspicion, fear, anxiety and worry in your life. You can have boundless Peace, Light and Bliss when you remain in the breath of the Heart. You can transcend yourself. <em>(To the Body.)</em> O Body, remain always pure, pure, pure. If you do not remain pure, my Reality, my Truth and my Existence will not be able to manifest themselves divinely and supremely. It is in your Purity that the members of your family can have abiding joy. When you lack Purity, everything is deplorable, nothing is beautiful, nothing is meaningful, nothing is worth having or achieving. It is through your Purity that every divine quality can enter permanently into the human nature. O Body, you have the capacity to transform yourself with the Light of the Soul, with the messages offered by the Life-Energy, with the Truth pronounced by the Organ of Speech, with the Beauty perceived by the Eye, with the divine wisdom that the Ear brings you from seekers and spiritual Masters and with the vastness that the Mind brings. O Body, it is with your Purity and in your Purity that the members of your family can enjoy perfect freedom and at the same time manifest me totally and integrally on earth.</p>
<p><em>(The Body, the Organ of Speech, the Eye, the Ear, the Mind and the Life-Energy bow with deepest gratitude to Prajapati.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Shiva, Durga and their sons, Kumara and Ganapati, are eating together. Suddenly Shiva stands up and begins to leave.)</em></p>
<p>DURGA: What is the matter? We have not quarrelled at all. I have not said a word to you and you have not said a word to me. What is wrong? Why are you leaving? What are you doing? The children are here. Have you no sense?</p>
<p>SHIVA: I am coming back. I have to do something very important.</p>
<p><em>(Shiva leaves and the children follow their father.)</em></p>
<p>CHILDREN: Father, Father, Mother has not said anything wrong. She is quite innocent. Why are you going away? Has anything gone wrong, Father?</p>
<p>SHIVA: Nothing is wrong with me, Kumara and Ganapati. Please go back and eat with your mother. It is something inner. You won’t understand now because you are children. A few years later you will know what your father does in the inner world. I shall come back shortly.</p>
<p><em>(exit Shiva)</em></p>
<p>GANAPATI: Mother, Father is not angry with you. He says he has to do something inner which we won’t understand right now. He will be coming back soon.</p>
<p><em>(Durga gives them a smile and they start eating. A few minutes later Shiva returns. )</em></p>
<p>DURGA: Now tell me, why did you leave? What was wrong with you?</p>
<p>SHIVA: Nothing was wrong with me. A great devotee of mine was attacked by a hooligan. He invoked me and I went to help him. But I saw that right after invoking me, he himself put up a brave fight and defeated the hooligan. I need not have worried at all. My devotee had the strength to punish the hooligan. I went there to save him, but now he has taken care of himself. I am always concerned for my devotees.</p>
<p>DURGA: Yes, I know how much concern you have for your devotees. You have next to none! I have never seen anyone as indifferent as you.</p>
<p>SHIVA: Indifferent? I</p>
<p>KUMARA: Mother, Mother, you are insulting our father.</p>
<p>GANAPATI: He will not eat. He will go away.</p>
<p>DURGA: You children have no idea how indifferent your father is to some people.</p>
<p>SHIVA: Tell me who?</p>
<p>DURGA: I know that you have a great devotee on earth. He is an old man. He begs from door to door. He makes next to nothing. Early every morning he begins praying to you, and he prays to you all day. Nobody meditates so devotedly and sincerely on you as he does. He prays to you twenty-four hours a day, yet he has to go begging from door to door to maintain his life on earth. He has nobody on earth to take care of him. And even you do not take care of him. You don’t give him any money; you don’t do anything for him so that he does not have to go out begging every day. Poor man! Even in winter, when everybody shivers with cold, he has to go out begging alms from door to door. This is your compassion for him; this is your concern for him.</p>
<p>SHIVA: What can I do? That is his fate.</p>
<p>DURGA: What is his fate? You can change his fate.</p>
<p>SHIVA: No, I cannot change his fate.</p>
<p>DURGA: Why not? Occultly can’t you put some money right by his door? In the morning, before he goes out, you can put a pile of gold coins right in his path. When he gets it he will not have to beg any more.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Father, that is a wonderful idea, Why not? You can do it, you can do it!</p>
<p>GANAPATI: Father, please do it. Since Mother wants it and it is a nice thing to do, why let the poor man suffer? If he is your greatest devotee, he should be given some money and he should be made happy. Poor man; he needs some comfort. There is nobody to look after him.</p>
<p>SHIVA: All right, I shall listen to your mother and to you two.</p>

<p><em>(The cottage of Shiva’s devotee. Shiva enters in occult form and places a pile of coins outside the door, then leaves.)</em></p>
<p>OLD MAN <em>(to himself)</em>: Now I am old. A day will soon come when I will lose my eyesight. Since I have to go from door to door, let me start practising walking along the street with my eyes closed. From now on, let me beg with my eyes closed, and then when I really lose my eyesight, I will have no problem. <em>(The old man closes his eyes and goes to the door. He is pretending.)</em> Oh, I have lost my eyes, I can’t see! <em>(Praying.)</em> O Shiva, you are so kind, you are so full of compassion. My vision is gone, but the strength of my legs still remains. Even now you have given me the capacity to walk, and my hands still work. I am so grateful to you. I am waiting for the hour when you will call me.</p>

<p><em>(Shiva’s home.)</em></p>
<p>SHIVA <em>(to Durga)</em>: See? I listened to you, but he went out with his eyes closed and he didn’t get the money that I left for him. If he had seen it, by this time he would have been very rich. And for the rest of his life he would have been most comfortable. But he didn’t see it. Who can change his fate? His fate is like that.</p>
<p>DURGA: My Lord, now I understand. Many times I thought that you were unkind to people who think of you, who meditate on you. But now I realise that although you try your best to help them, their fate, their karma from the past, in some way does not allow them to receive your blessings. Today I have seen that receptivity is needed. They have to develop the capacity of receiving. If not, no matter what you give them, either they will not be able to receive it or they will not value it.</p>
<p>GANAPATI: But Father, you could have done something else.</p>
<p>SHIVA: What is that?</p>
<p>GANAPATI: You could have gone to his place and personally given him the money. Then he would not have missed it.</p>
<p>KUMARA: That is a nice idea. Why didn’t you do that, Father? Tomorrow you can go and do it. Father, do it, do it, do it!</p>
<p>SHIVA: Kumara, Ganapati, you two sons of ours are really stupid. You do not know what will happen.</p>
<p>TOGETHER: What will happen, Father?</p>
<p>SHIVA: When I go to him he will say, “Lord, you have come!” When I give him the money he will say, “Lord, you have come here to deceive me! You are giving me money so that I will lead a comfortable life and forget you. I have no money now. That is why I depend on you. I go begging from door to door and all the time I pray to you. When I come back I also pray to you. When I am in front of other people’s doors I beg, beg of you. I beg alms, and at that time I pray to you and repeat your name. The moment I become rich I will stop thinking of you. Please, please, don’t be so unkind to me. I want only to think of you, pray to you, meditate on you. This is the only boon I want from you, my Lord. The little food that I need in order to live on earth you can give me in other ways. But do not take me away from your heart. I want to remain in your heart through my prayers, constant prayers.” What shall I say to him when he tells me this?</p>
<p>DURGA: Nothing. Now I know why you say that your heart is all the time in your devotees. You are all for them. This particular devotee of yours far outshines the others. He is teaching the world that what is most needed is not money or wealth, but your heart, your feet, your compassion. This devotee of yours is teaching the world that you, you alone, are the supreme object of love and adoration. In you is the fulfilment of the world; with you is the perfection of the world.</p>
