  <h2 id="page-title">Kuru (act I, Scene I)</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Kuru (act I, Scene I)" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>(King Kuru and his minister.)</em></p>
<p>KURU: Minister, come with me. Follow me. <em>(Minister follows him for a good distance.)</em> This is a vast plot of land. I want this land to be cultivated, and I want a bumper crop from this land very soon.</p>
<p>MINISTER: That is a wonderful idea, your Majesty. I shall appoint some farmers to cultivate this land. <em>(Enter Indra.)</em></p>
<p>INDRA: O King, on this land hundreds of sages have meditated and prayed. Here they have performed sacrifices. Here they have performed their rituals; they have meditated on God. This is soil of sacrifice, soil of aspiration and realisation. O King, don't destroy this hallowed land.</p>
<p>KURU: I don't believe in all that spirituality-meditation and sacrifice and all that. I need this land. I don't want it to remain uncultivated. I am a man of principle, a man of wisdom. Don't fool with me. This is my Kingdom. This is my land.</p>
<p><em>(Indra disappears, then enters in the form of a Brahmin.)</em> INDRA: Your Majesty, this is your Kingdom, this is your property. I have no right to advise you, but I wish to say that the gods will be happy in Heaven if you leave it as it is.</p>
<p>KURU: Then pray to God. I will allow this land to remain uncultivated provided you pray to God that whoever dies in this place will go to God immediately. It is said that whoever dies in Kashi (Benares) goes to Heaven. I want this place also to be as sacred as Benares. No matter who he is, if he is a thief, a murderer, a man of the worst possible principles, whoever dies here must go to Heaven immediately. If this desire of mine can be fulfilled, then I shall leave this place uncultivated.</p>
<p><em>(The Brahmin immediately changes back to Indra.)</em></p>
<p>INDRA: I fulfil your desire. This will be one of the most sacred places in India. Just because the sages prayed and meditated here, just because of my presence, just because of your surrender to my will, everybody who dies here-even if he is the worst possible man-will go to Heaven. And I wish to say that here also the battle of life will take place. The Divine and the undivine will fight. The Divine will eventually conquer the undivine and manifest and fulfil God on earth. On the physical plane, the undivine will be swallowed up by the one Divine Compassion-Light. But on the inner plane, on the spiritual plane, the undivine will enter into the Divine and be transformed, perfected and fulfilled. Once conquered by the Divine, once surrendered to the Will of the Divine, the undivine will become part and parcel of the Divine and will be utilised for the Divine. It will feel boundless joy and delight. It will see the difference between pleasure, which it once had, and joy, which it now has. The undivine will be lost in the Divine and will become Divine itself and here it will find its real fulfilment.</p>

<p>DWITA: That is a splendid idea. Let us go and get all we can, whatever wealth his disciples give us. This is our opportunity. Right now they are mourning, they are crying for their Master. This is the time when they will be very large-hearted and sympathetic toward us.</p>

<p><em>(The three brothers have gone to the homes of the disciples. Each disciple has offered them gifts. They are returning home with many cows and expensive things. Ekata and Dwita are behind the cows and Trita is ahead of the cows. Suddenly Trita sees a bear and runs away. While running, he falls into a very deep well. The bear does not disturb the other two brothers. It just leaves the place. Trita cannot get up out of the well. He shouts for his brothers.)</em></p>
<p>EKATA <em>(to Dwita):</em> Dwita, this is our opportunity to go home with all the cows and the money. We shall share it only with each other.</p>
<p>DWITA: Trita is the cleverest and the most learned. He always manages to get the most of everything. This is the time for us to share with each other and not have him in our family anymore.</p>
<p><em>(Exeunt Ekata and Dwita)</em></p>
<p>TRITA: O God, come and save me. My two brothers are so inhuman. They have heard me crying, but they are not coming to my rescue. Save me, God, please save me.</p>
<p><em>(Enter a cosmic god.)</em></p>
<p>TRITA: Please help me out of this well.COSMIC GOD: With my occult power, I am filling the well with water again. The water will raise you to the top of the well. Then you will be able to get out.</p>
<p><em>(Trita soon climbs out of the well.)</em></p>
<p>TRITA: Since you are so kind to me, please grant me another boon.</p>
<p>COSMIC GOD: What is the boon?</p>
<p>TRITA: That whoever touches the water of this well will be purified. No matter what kind of sin he has committed, he will be forgiven if he touches the water of this well.</p>
<p>COSMIC GOD: Granted.</p>
<p>TRITA: Now, give me a third boon.</p>
<p>COSMIC GOD: What is your boon?</p>
<p>TRITA: I will be so grateful if you grant me the boon that any desire of mine will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>COSMIC GOD: You will have to pray and meditate to get that boon. Stay here; pray and meditate. If you please me, that boon also I will one day grant. You pray and meditate here. When the time comes, I shall come and bless you, and your wish will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>TRITA: Thank you, O Lord. I shall do nothing but pray and meditate until you come back again.</p>

<p><em>(In Heaven.</em> )</p>
<p>GAUTAMA: O Lord Supreme, I have hundreds of disciples, but it is only my own sons who are quarreling and fighting. Look at this. Two sons did not come to save the third. A cosmic god went and helped him. Now he is meditating to get a boon from the cosmic god that all his desires will be fulfilled. Look at these three sons of mine! I am ashamed of them. How is it that my sons behave this way when I was so spiritual? By Your Grace I realised You. How is it that my own sons are unspiritual? How did it happen?</p>
<p>SUPREME GOD: Gautama, the physical sons are not your children, it is the spiritual sons who will realise you. They cry inwardly. They need spirituality, they need God, they need Love, they need Light, they need Truth. Your physical sons do not care for these things. Whoever cries for Truth, Love and Light will get them. Look at Krishna. Krishna's own children were not spiritual at all. In your case, also, it is the same. But Krishna's devotees, like Arjuna and Vidura, realised Me. So don't worry. Your real sons are those who think of Me and meditate on Me. Your physical sons, from now on, are only part of My creation. Do not expect anything from them. Expect everything from your spiritual children who are thinking of you, meditating on you and praying to you and to Me. They will attain realisation. As you know, we are dealing with Infinity, and Eternity. One day your physical sons will also realise Me. But right now, I wish you to consider only those who cry for Light and Truth as your real sons.</p>
<p>GAUTAMA: I understand, O Lord, that my real sons are those who think of You and meditate on You, those who need Light and want to live constantly in Light and for Light.</p>

<p>TRITA: You two rogues! You unnatural brothers! You didn't care to save me from the well.</p>
<p>EKATA: We didn't know where you had gone. We looked for you.</p>
<p>DWITA: We thought that you had been killed by the bear.</p>
<p>EKATA: I shouted so loudly. I shouted myself hoarse for you. I didn't hear any reply. I wept and cried because I thought that you had been killed.</p>
<p>DWITA: I searched for you everywhere, but I did not; see you anywhere. I searched and searched but you were nowhere to be found. Finally I came to the conclusion that you had been killed.</p>
<p>EKATA: I also thought that you had been killed. That's why I cried and wept so bitterly. We didn't hear you calling us.</p>
<p>TRITA: You rogues! You people were talking loudly, both of you. You said how happy both of you were that you would be able to keep all of Father's property and all the gifts and cows that we got from his disciples. You wanted to share only between yourselves. I heard you saying it. You didn't hear me? You liars! I heard you talking in normal voices, while I was shouting and screaming from the well. You didn't hear me? Oh no, certainly not!</p>
<p>EKATA: Believe me. I didn't hear you.</p>
<p>DWITA: Believe me, I didn't hear you either.</p>
<p>TRITA: All right, both of you did not hear me. But I have come out of the well anyway. A god came because he was pleased with me. Now, I have meditated, and I have occult powers. With my occult vision I see clearly that you heard me.</p>
<p>EKATA AND DWITA <em>(together):</em> We don't deny that you have occult powers, but we didn't hear you.</p>
<p>TRITA: More lies? Still? Now listen. If you really did not hear me crying for help, you will remain on earth as you are now. Both of you will enjoy Father's property, and I will have my own life: a life of spirituality, a life of renunciation. I shall have my own followers, and I shall live without you. But if you did hear, then at this moment I curse you. Both of you will turn into bears.</p>
<p><em>(Immediately both brothers turn into bears and run away into the forest. Trita walks away from the wealth left behind by his two brothers. He wants to lead a life of renunciation.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Jamadagni is in a field, shooting arrow after arrow at a target. Renuka brings the arrows back to him. Hours pass.</em> )</p>
<p>JAMADAGNI: Renuka, why are you no longer bringing the arrows back so quickly? Are you tired?</p>
<p>RENUKA: I am really tired. I am exhausted.</p>
<p>JAMADAGNI: Why? Why are you so tired?</p>
<p>RENUKA: Lord, you can see how bright the sun is. It is like a furnace. My head is aching and my feet are burning from this scorching heat.</p>
<p>JAMADAGNI: I have the power to curse the sun, to punish him. You know that I have tremendous occult power.</p>
<p>RENUKA: Yes, my Lord, I know it.</p>
<p>JAMADAGNI: Then right now I shall look at the sun and punish him.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Surya in the guise of a Brahmin.)</em></p>
<p>JAMADAGNI: What cam I do for you? Do you want anything special from me?SURYA: No, I have not come here for a favour. I saw from a distance that you were practising archery, and your wife was bringing your arrows back. I was really amused and inspired. I got tremendous joy from watching you play this game, so I came to observe it from close by.</p>
<p>JAMADAGNI: All right, wait and see what I am going to do. I am now going to destroy the sun with my occult power. The sun is ruining our game. Because of the heat, my wife is not able to bring the arrows back to me so quickly. There is no joy in the game if I have to wait such a long time for her to bring back the arrows. So I am now going to threaten the sun, and see what the sun says.</p>
<p>SURYA: May I give you some advice?</p>
<p>JAMADAGNI: Advice! Do I need advice from any human being after having realised God? I don't need any advice. But anyway, tell me, what is your advice?</p>
<p>SURYA: If your wife could have a pair of shoes and an umbrella . . .</p>
<p>JAMADAGNI: Shoes? What are shoes? And what is an umbrella? I have never heard of these things. Brahmin, it seems you are talking nonsense.</p>
<p>SURYA: No, no, O Sage. <em>(He brings out from his robe a pair of shoes and an umbrella.)</em> This is called an umbrella and these are called shoes.</p>
<p>RENUKA: Shoes? What are they for?</p>
<p>SURYA: To protect your feet.</p>
<p>RENUKA: And the umbrella, what is it for?</p>
<p>SURYA: To protect your head, to protect your whole body.</p>
<p>RENUKA: But I don't know how to use them. I have never seen them before.</p>
<p>SURYA: Come, I will show you. <em>(He puts the shoes on Renuka's feet and opens the umbrella for her.)</em> This is how you use them. When it is very hot, when the sun is unbearably bright, your head will be protected by the umbrella's shade, and your feet will be protected by the shoes. <em>(Turning to Jamadagni.)</em> O Jamadagni, O Sage, protection is needed from below and from above. When one has protection from above, one can rise, one can go up to the highest, one can realise the highest; and when one has protection from below then one can manifest the deepest. You have realised God; that is true. But in the field of realisation, there is no end. You have realised a portion of the Truth; the Transcendental Truth you have not realised. You have touched the foot of the tree-that is your realisation. But there is a realisation which is infinitely superior. That realisation you will have when you can climb up to the top of the tree, bring the fruit down to the ground and distribute it to others who do not know how to climb. This is the highest type of realisation. What you have realised within also has to be manifested without. For that you need protection. If you are not protected here on earth, you cannot manifest the Divine. Shoes and umbrella will protect your wife from the forces of the outer world, and will remind you of the protection which you need in the inner world in order to reach the highest Goal.</p>
<p><em>(The Brahmin changes into Lord Surya. With his effulgent Light, he looks at Jamadagni and Renuka. They bow at his feet.)</em></p>
<p>JAMADAGNI AND RENUKA <em>(together):</em> O Lord Surya, you came to us in the garb of a Brahmin, and offered us protection. Your outer protection will comfort our outer lives and your inner protection will immortalise our inner lives.</p>

<p>MASTER: Insincerity, you are killing me. Impurity, you are killing me. Jealousy, you are killing me. Insecurity, you are killing me.</p>
<p>INSINCERITY: Master, I know that I am insincere, but please tell me how I can become sincere.</p>
<p>MASTER: Fast for one day. Fast today for the whole day, and tomorrow come and see me.</p>

<p>INSECURITY: Master, I know I am insecure. At every moment I am insecure. Please tell me how I can be secure, how I can have confidence in my life.</p>
<p>MASTER: Don't eat anything today. Fast. Don't have even a glass of water. Come back tomorrow and I shall tell you how you can have a life of security. All of you go home and come back to me tomorrow. I shall tell you <em>(to the boys)</em> how you can be sincere and pure, and how you <em>(to the girls)</em> can get rid of jealousy and insecurity.</p>

<p><em>(The following day the four disciples return to their Master together.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Insincerity, how do you feel today?</p>
<p>INSINCERITY: Master, I feel very, very weak. Yesterday I didn't eat anything. That's why I feel so weak.</p>
<p>MASTER: See, you have become sincere today. Yesterday you didn't eat and that's why you are weak. So your sincerity has spoken through you. You are no longer insincere. But now, how can you maintain your sincerity? From now on, see two persons in your life. There are two types of people: one is inferior to you and one is superior to you. When you see someone inferior then immediately say inwardly to yourself: "It is beneath my dignity to lie to this person who is inferior to me. Why should I be afraid of him? Let me speak out freely and say what I think." And when you see someone who you feel is superior, then say to yourself, "Oh, he is my superior. Today or tomorrow he will catch my lies, and I will be punished. So why should I lie to him? Punishment and embarrassment will be my fate." You can conquer your insincerity in this way. By telling the truth to both inferiors and superiors, you can bring Perfection into your life. <em>(To Impurity.</em> ) Impurity, how do you feel today?</p>
<p>IMPURITY: Oh, I feel much purer today. I feel really pure today.</p>
<p>MASTER: Once a month you should fast, and drink only water and juice. Don't eat solid food one day each month. That will help you in your purity. But in order to maintain inner purity all the time, early every morning, breathe in and out at least fifty times. Each time you breathe in, feel that you are breathing in not air, but purity. And each time you breathe out, feel that you are breathing out only impurity. And in the evening, feel that you are breathing in Light and breathing out gratitude to God. This way you will have purity every day, every hour, every second in your life. <em>(To Jealousy.)</em> Jealousy, how do you feel today?</p>
<p>JEALOUSY: I feel quite fine. I feel that I am lighter today. Yesterday I didn't eat at all, and today I feel lighter.</p>
<p>MASTER: For only one day you have not eaten, and already you feel light. Now feel that the food that you did not take yesterday was ignorance. For one day you did not eat ignorance. For one day you did not allow this food to enter into you. That's why you feel light. So feel, Jealousy, that there is a kind of food which is ignorance. If you eat it, you become heavier. If you don't eat it, you become lighter. From now on, do not allow yourself to be tempted by this food called jealousy. When you don't eat it, you will feel light; then you can run the fastest toward your Goal. What do you want? You want to reach your Goal, the sooner the better. So don't eat this ignorance-food, which is jealousy. <em>(To Insecurity.)</em> Insecurity, how do you feel today?</p>
<p>INSECURITY: Master, I feel very weak today. It seems to me that my insecurity has increased today along with my physical weakness.</p>
<p>MASTER: It is true. Insecurity is already spiritual weakness, and when you do not eat, you become physically weak as well. When physical weakness is added to weakness in your inner life, naturally you will be even more helpless than you were before. First make yourself physically strong. You can make yourself physically strong by eating normal food every day. And you can make yourself spiritually strong, confident, by feeling that God needs you and wants to have you in His Heart, because He wants to be complete; He wants to be universal. Always feel that He whom you need God, also needs you in order to be all-pervading. You feel that God is very great and He can easily do without you. Yes, He can do without you, but He cannot be perfect unless and until He has made you perfect. Since He is for all, He can be all-perfect only by making you perfect. So try to have confidence. This is your security. Give to God what you have: ignorance. Don't hold it for yourself; give it gladly, cheerfully, constantly to Him. And feel that since you have played your part, then it is His Duty to give you what He has: Light. Devotedly, confidently give Him your ignorance, and receive devotedly and confidently His Light. In this way you will always remain secure and confident.</p>

<p>[Forgive me, forgive me,<br /> this is the last time, forgive me.<br /> I shall offer to You at Your Feet<br /> the garland of Victory.<br /> I am the silent compassion of Your Infinity.<br /> You are the Ocean, I am the tiniest drop.<br /> This is my only identification.]</p>
