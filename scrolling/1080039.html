<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Religion plays a significant role in the life of the aspiring seeker. Religion is our spiritual home. We start in our spiritual home and then go to the Home of God. Religion is the home we live in until we enter God's Palace and establish our conscious oneness, constant oneness with God.</p>
<p>It is not good to be afraid of God. God is all-loving. But if someone thinks of God only with fear, then I wish to say that it is better to think of God in this way than not to think of Him at all. Most people who are practising religion are afraid of God. If they do something wrong, they feel God will punish them. That is often why they think of God. First they approach God with fear, and only afterwards they approach God with love, innocence and oneness. This is called religion. In religion, most of the time an unknown or unconscious fear looms large in us; and this fear compels us to think of God and to pray to God. This is the situation most of the time, but not always. People follow a particular religion because they love God and they are afraid of God. But when we practise spirituality it is never out of fear. Where there is oneness, there is no fear. It is out of sheer necessity that we practise spirituality. Necessity compels us to love God. He loves us unconditionally and it is our bounden duty also to love Him.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The goal of religion is to bring God into one's multifarious activities. God has to be felt as a living God. Otherwise, if we are just believers in God, we cannot and will not accomplish much. The role of religion is to make each person feel that God is somebody living, or that God is infinite Peace, Light and Bliss. That also is living. If an individual wants to feel that his God is a living God, this conviction must be brought to the fore by religious feeling or by following a religious faith.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The original significance of religion was to have man see, feel and consciously dedicate himself to the existence of the One in the existence of the many: to see the One in the many. There are many countries, many faiths, many creeds many sects. Religion has to combine everything. Religion has to make a synthesis; among all countries religion has to establish a sense of oneness. The length and breadth of the world have to sing the song of oneness. This is why religion came into being.</p>

Can you explain the sacred and divine purpose that the family is supposed to have?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The sacred and divine purpose of each family lies in the discovery of the real reality of each individual. You may ask why each individual has to discover his real reality. If one does not discover the real reality in himself, then he denies the promise that he made once upon a time in the soul's region. When the individual was in the soul's region, he chose a particular family out of the millions of families on earth in order to fulfil the promise he made to God, in order to do something special for God. He promised to realise God, to reveal and manifest God. This sacred promise can come to the fore only when the individual becomes conscious of what he is going to become. If he claims God as his very own and feels that one day he shall become one with God, then he is destined to reach his goal. If he claims some higher reality which he will achieve only by transcending himself, then he is doing the right thing. While transcending, himself, he comes to realise the sacredness and divine purpose of his own existence and of the family that he belongs to.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, but one has to know here what religion is. Religion is a code of life that connects one with the rest of humanity. If one feels that his life has a special connection with others' lives, then only can he achieve or try to achieve oneness. First he has to feel an inner connection. If he starts with this connection, then only can he think of establishing his inseparable oneness with others.</p>
<p>So, if you follow any specific religion, then you will feel that you have something in common with others, that you have an inner connection with others. Then, from this connection you have to go deep within in order to establish your inseparable oneness with others and with the rest of the world. And when you establish your oneness, naturally what you see inside you and around you is brotherhood and love.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Religion as such cannot overcome this narrow outlook. Only when religion takes help from spirituality, its elder brother, does it become possible to overcome this narrow outlook. Religion sees God, but spirituality makes the seeker become God. Religion can go as far as believing in the Light or even seeing the Light. But spirituality goes much higher, much deeper. It helps the seeker or the votary of religion grow into the Light itself and become one with God-Consciousness and God-Light.</p>
<p>Religion stops at seeing the reality; it does not want to grow into reality. Spirituality, like religion, sees what the reality is, but then it goes one step ahead and wants to grow consciously into the reality itself. So if religion takes help from spirituality, then it is quite possible to overcome all the narrow outlooks found in religion.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What does God like best about religions?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What does God like best about religions?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What God likes best in each religion is a big heart. Let each religion tolerate the others. If tolerance is there, then let each religion go one step further. Let it recognise other religions also. Once recognition is given, each religion has to feel sincerely that other religions are as good and as nice as itself. It has to feel that each religion is right in its own way, that all are equal in this way.</p>
<p>Tolerance of others exists as long as there is a sense of separativity. Once a particular religion gives due value to other religions and sees their existence as an expression of truth, then that particular religion can go high, higher, highest and deep, deeper, deepest. Seeing and establishing its conscious oneness with all other religions, it can claim that there is only one religion — not two or three, but only one religion. When a religion once comes to realise that all religions form one religion, one eternal religion, one eternal eye of Truth, an eternal heart of Truth, then that religion is perfect. This kind of discovery and achievement God likes best in the world religions, not only in one particular religion but in all religions.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Wonderful question! One gives his time to God in the first place because he sees that, unlike him and unlike others, God is the Alpha, God is the Omega. He is the beginning. He is the end. He is this. He is that. At the same time, He transcends what He eternally is.</p>
<p>God is all-pervading; He is everywhere. Whatever we do, whatever we say, whatever we grow into is nothing short of His own expansion of His own Reality-Existence. Right at the outset, at the very outset, we have to know that He alone exists. Just because He alone exists, no matter what we do, we know that our action is motivated by Him and also finds its result in Him. Our action fulfils itself, our capacity is increased and our realisation is strengthened just because He exists and He is. Therefore, either consciously or unconsciously, either cheerfully or dolefully, God has to come into the picture.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each religion has an ideal of its own. All religious ideals cannot be of the same type and the same standard. Also, the meditation cannot be of the same height and the same standard in every religion. The result will depend on the type of meditation and the ideal of the particular religion, the height of the ideal. If the ideal is high, and at the same time the meditation is very soulful, the result will be extraordinary.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two major obstacles. When one does not have enough feeling for one's own religion, one cannot go very far. So first one has to develop a sincere feeling. Then he has to make his religion a living reality, just as the body, the vital and the mind are living realities. Unless one knows and feels that religion is a living reality, he will not be able to make progress through his religion.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They do not love and respect each other more precisely because the capacity of their heart is limited and not unlimited.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each religion not only <em>claims</em> to teach the truth but actually teaches the truth. But merely teaching or preaching the truth is not enough. If the religion can live the truth — that is to say, if it can bring to the fore the living breath, the reality-light of truth — then that religion is the most true. The religion that lives the truth in all its aspects — in its height and depth, in its universality and transcendence — that particular religion is the most true. The religion that embodies and lives the ultimate truth of love and oneness is by far the most significant, the most important and indispensable religion.</p>
