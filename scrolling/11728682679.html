<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The outer importance of the marriage ceremony is to share joy with others â€” with dear ones and well-wishers. The inner importance is to convince the outer mind that here on earth, where division reigns supreme, oneness can also play its role.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why do you feel marriage is compatible with the spiritual life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why do you feel marriage is compatible with the spiritual life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Marriage may or may not be compatible with the spiritual life in any particular case. It is up to the individual to decide whether or not marriage is compatible with his or her spiritual life. It is not at all obligatory for a seeker to get married. it entirely depends on the individual. To say that marriage is compatible with the spiritual life is to say something which may be very far from the truth in some cases. It is the individual seeker who has to decide whether marriage and the spiritual life can and should go together for him or for her.</p>
<p>In a good marriage, immediately two eyes become four eyes, two arms become four arms. Everything is doubled: strength, consciousness, reality, divinity, everything. In a bad marriage, everything is weakened. Frustration looms large and, finally, destruction plays its role most ruthlessly. There is no hard and fast rule that one should not get married in the spiritual life or that one should get married. It entirely depends on the soulâ€™s decision. Some souls feel that through marriage they will be able to make faster progress, while others feel that marriage will be a hindrance to their spiritual progress. God and the individual souls must make the decision, not the human mind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Two seekers who have accepted the spiritual life and who want to continue making progress must slowly and steadily purify the lower vital. It is a slow, steady, illumining and convincing process. Gradually, the lower vital movements can be transformed into inner and deeper ecstasy.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fidelity is of paramount importance in married life. If, in the process of evolution, a being has come into the human kingdom, then that being must fulfil the demands of the human kingdom. Each kingdom has rules and regulations. The plant kingdom and the animal kingdom have their own rules and regulations. Similarly, the human kingdom also has rules and regulations. If one wants to remain in the human kingdom and not in the animal kingdom, then fidelity in marriage is of utmost necessity from the spiritual point of view.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there should always be some spiritual practices. These spiritual practices alone will enable the seekers to have harmony in their marriage. Purity in thought and action, patience, both in the inner life and the outer life, and always to live in the loving heart rather than in the doubting mind â€” these are the spiritual practices that can support a marriage.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The householderâ€™s attitude should be all-loving, all-serving and all-illumining. The householder should feel that the outer world is only an expansion of his or her own world; it is not isolated from his world. The householder should feel that the vast world and the world that he himself embodies or represents must go together. The microcosm and the macrocosm, the finite and the Infinite, must go together.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Both the husband and the wife must feel that the husband is the son of God and the wife is the daughter of God, who is both Father and Mother.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Householders must take money as material power, which has to be utilised divinely. Money-power is not to be used to lord it over others, but to meet with the necessities of life. This power has to be used judiciously, devotedly and in a fulfilling manner. Money has considerable power, but whether it is good or bad depends on the individual. The individual can use it divinely or undivinely. When money-power is used properly, it is a divine boon; if it is misused, it is a veritable curse.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Divorce is detrimental when the inner beings want to continue to be together, when the inner beings feel that, in the course of time, both husband and wife will better understand each other and lead a more illumining life. The inner beings must determine whether or not the marriage should be continued. If the seekers do not listen to the voice of their inner beings, if their outer minds compel them to get a divorce, then the divorce will be detrimental to their spiritual progress. It is the inner beings that should determine both marriage and divorce.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the members of a family have faith in rituals, then certainly rituals will be of benefit. But just because there are people who have faith in rituals, that doesnâ€™t mean that all couples should observe rituals. Rituals are preliminary stages in the spiritual life, like kindergarten. Some children study in kindergarten before they enter into primary school. Some students skip kindergarten. It depends on the individual case.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Most people desire children because they feel the necessity of expansion. On the human level, they want to show that they have a family and a comfortable life. The smile of their child gives them tremendous joy. On the inner plane, it is the same song: expansion. One wants to become many.</p>
