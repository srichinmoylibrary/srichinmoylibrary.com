<p>One day, when Khurram was a young man, Nur Jahan invited him to come to a special fair. This fair was organised by the palace women. They had little stalls where they sold trinkets, fabric and other items. There Khurram first saw Arjumand Banu, who was Nur Jahan's niece. To Nur Jahan's great joy, he fell in love with this young girl and later married her, thus strengthening the Persian presence at the court.</p>
<p>Arjumand Banu was henceforth called Mumtaz Mahal, 'Chosen One of the Palace'. Shah Jahan loved her above all others and she was to bear the Emperor fourteen children.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Shah Jahan&#039;s thirst</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Shah Jahan&#039;s thirst" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once Emperor Shah Jahan went out on an expedition with some of his relatives, friends and admirers. He was walking quite fast ahead of his entourage and, at one point, he became separated from the group. The Emperor was not familiar with the area and, unfortunately, he got lost. His friends and relatives searched and searched for him, but they could not trace him.</p>
<p>After some time, the Emperor became very thirsty. Alas, there was no water nearby. Then Shah Jahan saw an old man carrying a container of water on his back.</p>
<p>The Emperor said to him, "My friend, I am parched with thirst. Can you spare some water for me?"</p>
<p>The old man did not recognise the Emperor. He replied, "All right, since you are so thirsty, I shall give you some." He poured a large quantity of water into a container and offered it to the Emperor. The Emperor began drinking the water very quickly.</p>
<p>The old man became worried, for he felt that it was not advisable for anyone to drink so fast. Since he was also carrying a sack of grass on his back, he took a handful of grass and threw it into the container from which the Emperor was drinking.</p>
<p>Shah Jahan became furious. He said, "What are you doing? Why did you throw grass into my water? You were so kind to give me this water. You have saved my life. Now why are you preventing me from drinking the remainder of the water?"</p>
<p>The old man explained, "My good friend, I have a number of asses and I never allow them to drink water rapidly. If I put grass in their water, they drink more slowly and carefully. If you drink too fast, you may develop colic pain. I was only trying to be considerate of your health."</p>
<p>In the meantime, Shah Jahan's friends and admirers had discovered the Emperor. From a distance, they saw the old man throw grass into the Emperor's water and immediately they became furious. They came running to the scene in order to strike and beat the old man mercilessly.</p>
<p>But Shah Jahan stopped them. He said, "No, no, no! This man has saved my life. It was only out of concern for me that he put grass into my water."</p>
<p>Then the Emperor turned to the old man and said, "You do not have to make your living by working with asses any more. I am all gratitude to you. I am making you the head of a village because you have saved my life."</p>

<p>Another time Shah Jahan went out on an expedition with some soldiers and officers in his army. Suddenly, a man came up to him crying, "Your Majesty, your Majesty, I have a complaint to make against one of your officers."</p>
<p>The Emperor asked, "Is he here? Who is it?"</p>
<p>The man pointed to one of the officers and said, "Yes, he is here, sitting on that horse. I work for him, but for the last four months he has not paid me. I assure you, your Majesty, I work very, very hard."</p>
<p>Shah Jahan asked the officer in question if this accusation was true. The officer remained silent and then, with his head bowed, he admitted that it was.</p>
<p>Shah Jahan ordered the officer to dismount. Then he turned to the servant and said, "Now, you get on the horse. You will ride with the others in my army who are coming with me on this expedition. Wherever I go, you follow me on this horse."</p>
<p>Then the Emperor turned to the officer and said, "You have to remain on foot and follow the expedition wherever we go. You have to run at our speed. This is my command."</p>
<p>The officer started running, following Shah Jahan wherever he rode. Soon he started panting and after a short time, he cried out, "I am dying, I am dying, I am dying!"</p>
<p>The Emperor stopped his horse and said to the officer, "You deserve to die. I give you money because you serve me. This innocent man serves you day in and day out. How is it that you do not pay him? You must pay him his back salary right now."</p>
<p>The officer said, "I am more than ready, but I do not have the money with me right now."</p>
<p>The Emperor said, "Then take the money from me."</p>
<p>The officer took the money and gave it to his servant. Then Shah Jahan said, "As you know, I never give loans. Whenever I give something, it is always as a gift. But promise me that from now on you will always pay this man. If you break your promise, I will give him your post and make you his lifelong servant."</p>
<p>Needless to say, the officer gave his solemn promise to the Emperor.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Muslim mendicant</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Muslim mendicant" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Shah Jahan had heard many good reports about a particular Muslim mendicant. People said that he was constantly praying to Allah and that he was very pious and spiritual. Everybody felt that this mendicant said and did the right thing at all times, and they greatly appreciated and admired him. The Emperor was also full of appreciation for him and he had a strong desire to meet him. Of course, since he was the Emperor, Shah Jahan could have asked to see the mendicant at any time. But Shah Jahan never wanted to summon him or in any way force him to come to the court.</p>
<p>One day, when Shah Jahan was on the third floor of his palace with some of his close friends and relatives, this particular mendicant happened to pass by the palace gates. The Emperor's companions saw him from the window and said to the Emperor, "Look, here is the mendicant whom you have wanted to meet for such a long time."</p>
<p>Shah Jahan said to them, "Since he is near the palace, please tell him that I would be extremely grateful if he would come to see me for a few minutes. Tell him that he does not even have to walk up the stairs. We will hang a basket off the balcony by a rope and lift him up to the third floor."</p>
<p>The mendicant was a very humble man and he was extremely surprised to hear that the Emperor himself wanted to see him. He said, "If His Majesty wants to see me, how can I refuse?"</p>
<p>So he sat in the basket and Shah Jahan and a few others pulled him up. The Emperor welcomed the mendicant respectfully and said, "I am so happy and grateful that you have accepted my invitation. Today I wish to discuss spiritual matters with you. All the time I am with people who do not practise spirituality and I am also in that same category. If I wanted to, I could make time for my spiritual life. Unfortunately, I do not have sincere aspiration. But I do appreciate you and admire you very much."</p>
<p>The mendicant said, "Your Majesty, I do not deserve your appreciation and admiration. You and your subjects see only my face; you do not know what is going on inside my mind. My mind is uglier than the ugliest. I have so many bad thoughts. Outwardly I may appear very calm and peaceful, but inwardly my mind is very undivine. So I do not deserve your appreciation."</p>
<p>The Emperor smiled and said, "I deeply appreciate your sincerity, but I know and I also feel that you are truly a very pure and pious man. Please tell me how you have become so close to Allah. Is it because you pray and meditate all the time?"</p>
<p>The mendicant said, "No, no, no! You think that I am close to Allah, and many others also believe the same. But I tell you, I am not closer to Allah than any of His other children. It is like the relationship between an Emperor and his subjects. I am one of your most useless subjects. I have no capacity. Would I ever have dared to request an audience with a great Emperor like you? A beggar, an insignificant creature like me, would never ask you to grant him an audience. It is your kindness, your affection, your love and your concern for a useless fellow like me that enabled me to come and speak with you. I do not deserve to see you at all.</p>
<p>"You wanted to see me and honour me. If I had cherished pride and haughtiness, I would not have come to see you. I would have thought: 'Oh, although he is the Emperor, he does not pray or meditate. So why should I go to him? I do not need him!' But I know that I am nothing by myself. I was also moved by your invitation.</p>
<p>"Similarly, I am moved by the Call of Allah. Allah does not need an insignificant creature like me. Allah does not need anyone. Out of His infinite Love and Compassion, He calls me and I respond. In this way, He calls each and every person in secret. But very few are lucky enough to be able to respond to His unconditional Call. Because I have been fortunate enough to respond to His Call, I am becoming close to Him. It is not my capacities or qualities that have brought me close to Allah, but His unconditional Love and Compassion for His creation. In the same way, He can and will call each and every human being on earth. Alas, how many will ever respond to His Call?"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The arrogant officer</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The arrogant officer" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Every evening, the Emperor Shah Jahan held an open audience with anyone who wanted to see him. Hundreds of his subjects would attend and the Emperor would listen to their problems and chat with them for about an hour.</p>
<p>Nobody was allowed to sit directly in front of the Emperor. One evening, an officer deliberately sat down in the forbidden area. The Emperor and the members of his court were all furious. Shah Jahan said to the officer, "How dare you show such disrespect by sitting right in front of me! I want you to leave this palace immediately. I am dispensing with your services and you will never again be given another position in my government. From now on, you can only perform ordinary, menial jobs."</p>
<p>The very next day after the officer had been dismissed, he again came to the public audience and sat down in the exact same spot right in front of the Emperor. The previous day, he had at least shown the Emperor a little bit of respect, but this time he had absolutely no respect. His face showed extreme haughtiness.</p>
<p>Shah Jahan said to him, "What is the matter with you? Yesterday I dispensed with your services for good. I had you thrown out of the palace and said that you cannot work here any more. Why are you now being even more disrespectful?"</p>
<p>The man replied, "Your Majesty, yesterday I was dependent on you for my salary. Since I was dependent on you, I was always obedient. Now I am not serving you any more, so I am independent. I can do anything I want to with my life. Previously I was at your mercy, but now I am on my own. I do not have to obey you any more because I am no longer serving you."</p>
<p>All those who were present were shocked at what the former officer was saying and they wanted to thrash him for his insolence. But Shah Jahan stood up and embraced the man, saying, "I want all my subjects to have this kind of independent spirit." Then Shah Jahan gave the man back his job and also gave him a bag of gold coins.</p>
<p>The following evening, everybody was wondering where the officer would sit, now that he had his job back. Finally, they noticed him sitting at the very back of the Audience Hall. Someone asked him, "What are you doing there?"</p>
<p>The officer answered, "An arrogant person can fight with another arrogant person, but he cannot fight with a man of boundless compassion and forgiveness. That is why I cannot fight with the Emperor any more."</p>

<p>When Mumtaz Mahal died in 1631 while giving birth to her fourteenth child, Shah Jahan was overwhelmed with grief. In order to pay homage to his beloved wife, he began the construction of a magnificent tomb made of white marble. It was built at Agra, on the banks of the Yamuna River. This 'Tomb of Light' is now known as the Taj Mahal and it is one of the wonders of the world.</p>
<p>Tagore has written about the Taj Mahal, "Only let this one teardrop, the Taj Mahal, glisten spotlessly bright on the cheek of time for ever and ever. O King! You sought to charm time with the magic of beauty and weave a garland that would bind formless death with deathless form!"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Jahanara&#039;s last wish</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Jahanara&#039;s last wish" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>After reigning for almost thiry years, Shah Jahan fell seriously ill. Each of his four sons laid claim to the throne. Their names were Dara Shikoh, Shuja, Aurangzeb and Murad. The most ambitious was Aurangzeb and he quickly seized Agra. To everybody's suprise and Aurangzeb's great disappointment, however, Shah Jahan did not die. So in 1658 Aurangzeb incarcerated his father in the Red Fort.</p>
<p>Shah Jahan's only daughter was Jahanara. Jahanara was extremely beautiful, extremely soulful and extremely self-giving. When her father was imprisoned, she decided to remain with him in prison to serve him and console him. She stayed with her father until his death, eight years later. In every way, she tried to keep him happy and well.</p>
<p>Long before he was imprisoned, Shah Jahan had built the Taj Mahal, one of the great wonders of the world, in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, whom he had loved very much. From a window in the Red Fort, Shah Jahan could look out across the Yamuna to the Taj Mahal.</p>
<p>Who knows what he would have done if Jahanara also had died before him? True, by that time he was no longer the Emperor, but he would perhaps have begged his most notorious son to do something very special for his all-giving daughter, Jahanara.</p>
<p>When Shah Jahan died, Jahanara greatly mourned the loss of her father. She now had full freedom to come out of her self-imposed prison-life and enjoy life as a member of the royal family. But Jahanara said, "How can I be happy when my brother is so cruel and undivine?" She felt that her life had no meaning without her beloved father. So she continued living in prison for her few remaining years on earth.</p>
<p>Jahanara's last wish was not to have a canopy over her grave. Instead, she wanted only grass to grow on top of her grave. She wanted a most humble funeral ceremony, just like that of an ordinary person. She said, "I have not lived the life of a princess for many years.

<p>The Crown Prince Dara Shikoh was good, sincere and pious. He studied the Hindu Upanishads and translated them. He was a sincere spiritual seeker, but his younger brother, Aurangzeb, was undivine to the extreme. When Shah Jahan fell ill, Aurangzeb was determined to prevent Dara Shikoh from becoming the Emperor, so he gathered a large army and started fighting against him.</p>
<p>The commander of Dara Shikoh's army said to him, "We will definitely win. Our army is much more powerful, and I am sure that it is Allah's wish that we win."</p>
<p>Dara Shikoh replied, "I do not know what Allah's wish is, but I am praying to Allah that His Will be done. Whomever He chooses to be Emperor, I will be equally happy. If He thinks that my brother will take better care of the empire than I will, then Allah should allow my brother to defeat me and proclaim himself the Emperor. I want Allah's children-all our subjects-to be well protected and well guided. Right now, my brother may be very undivine. But, who knows, if he becomes Emperor, perhaps he will be transformed. Perhaps he will become very nice, kind and pious. I do not know the future. If Allah feels that my brother will far surpass me in good qualities and that, under his rule, the empire will prosper much more, then I feel that my brother should be victorious and not me. I want only Allah's Will to be done so that His children can be really happy."</p>
<p>Although he had an heroic soul and would have made an excellent Emperor, in a short space of time Dara Shikoh was executed by his cruel younger brother, Aurangzeb.</p>

<p>This incident happened many years after Shah Jahan's passing. In 1836 an English colonel and his wife went to visit the Taj Mahal, the most beautiful tomb in the world. They pitched their tent on the lawn in front of the main building. Then the colonel said to his wife, "Tell me, what do you think of this tomb?"</p>
<p>The wife replied, "If you ask me what I <em>think</em> about it, I will speak about the architecture, the workmanship and so forth. But if you ask me what I <em>feel</em> about it, then I will tell you my real feelings. Will you honour my feelings?"</p>
<p>The colonel said, "Of course. I want to know your feelings and definitely I will honour them."</p>
<p>His wife continued, "All right. Then I must tell you that I would be willing to put an end to my life tomorrow if you would build a Taj Mahal like this one for me. Are you prepared to do so? I am ready to take my life at this moment, but are you prepared to build another Taj Mahal for me? Do you have that kind of love for me?"</p>
<p>The husband was speechless. The wife went on, "I can fulfil my promise at any moment, but I can see that you are not ready to give me your promise. You will not even dare to promise to build another Taj Mahal for me. You do not have that kind of love for me!"</p>
<p>The poor husband looked at his wife in silence.</p>

<h2>Suleiman's wish</h2>

<p>In his ambition to seize the throne, Aurangzeb was extremely cruel towards his three brothers. He had his brother Shuja pursued into the jungles of Burma, where Shuja disappeared. Aurangzeb then executed his younger brother Murad. Finally, he turned his attention to his older brother, Dara Shikoh. Dara Shikoh was captured and paraded through the streets of Delhi before being decapitated. The citizens of Delhi were heartbroken at the death of their beloved Crown Prince.</p>
<p>Dara Shikoh's son, Suleiman, went to Srinagar for asylum, but the King of Srinagar, instead of giving him shelter, arrested him and sent him to Aurangzeb, who had proclaimed himself Emperor. Aurangzeb's name means 'Ornament of the Throne'.</p>
<p>When Suleiman was brought before Aurangzeb, Aurangzeb felt a momentary sadness that his nephew was in such a miserable state. He asked Suleiman what he wanted. He assured his nephew that if he wanted to leave, he would not be killed. But Suleiman said, "If you want to fulfil my only desire, then kill me im mediately. You have killed my beloved father. Now I do not want to remain on earth."</p>
<p>Aurangzeb said, "What are you talking about? I shall not kill you. I shall allow you to go your own way."</p>
<p>Suleiman said, "I do not need that favour from you, uncle. Only one favour I want: kill me here and now."</p>
<p>This was Suleiman's oneness with his father. Alas, Aurangzeb's pitiless nature came to the fore and he imprisoned his nephew. Each day a powerful dose of opium was administered to Suleiman and his physical condition deteriorated. Finally, he was strangled by the prison guards.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Shivaji and Aurangzeb</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Shivaji and Aurangzeb" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a great Hindu king who fought against the Moghuls. In every way, he was a hero supreme, and he was appreciated, admired and adored by all Indians without exception. His name was Shivaji. He wanted to have freedom for his country, specially for the part where he was born, which is called Maharashtra.</p>
<p>In 1666 Shivaji received a letter from Emperor Aurangzeb inviting him to come to the royal court at Agra. Although Shivaji knew that the Emperor was capable of treachery, he accepted the invitation because he did not want to appear to be afraid of Aurangzeb. Shivaji arrived in Agra with his eldest son, Shambhuji, and a small contingent of soldiers on the 12th of May, which happened to be the Emperor's 50th birthday.</p>
<p>When Shivaji entered the Audience Hall and placed his offerings before Aurangzeb, the Emperor did not speak a single word of welcome to him. Instead, Shivaji was led to an inferior position at the back of the hall. It now became obvious that the great Maratha hero had been led into a trap. He and his son were captives of the Emperor.</p>
<p>Shivaji and his son were imprisoned in the Moghul capital for several months. However, Shivaji did not despair, but began making plans for his escape. One evening Shivaji and Shambhuji hid inside two huge fruit baskets. Shivaji had arranged for the baskets to be taken out of the palace and left at a lonely spot outside the city. Shivaji and Shambhuji waited until the porters had gone and then they emerged from the fruit baskets. They besmeared their bodies with ashes and made their way back to their own kingdom disguised as mendicants.</p>

<p>When Shivaji died in 1680, he was succeeded by his son, Shambhuji. Aurangzeb was determined to subdue the son of his old adversary and regain control of Maharashtra. In 1689, Moghul troops captured Shambhuji and tortured him mercilessly. When he refused to convert to Islam or to reveal where the Maratha treasure was hidden, they blinded him and cut out his tongue. A few days later, Shambhuji was executed.</p>
<p>The brutal death of Shambhuji caused all the Marathas to unite under the leadership of Rajaram, Shivaji's second son, and to renew their efforts to resist the Moghul domination of India.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Emperor gives up grapes</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Emperor gives up grapes" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once one of Aurangzeb's generals fell ill. This general happened to be the Emperor's dear friend. For months the general suffered, and then his case started getting worse and worse. Finally, the Emperor called in a Greek doctor to help the patient. The doctor gave the general some medicine and told him that he should not eat grapes. He said grapes were not good for him and were creating serious physical problems.</p>
<p>The general started arguing with the doctor. He could not understand how abstaining from grapes could improve his condition. Since he was very, very fond of grapes and they were one of his favourite foods, he was reluctant to give them up. But the doctor told him, "I am sorry. You must not eat any more grapes."</p>
<p>The Emperor had faith in the doctor's opinion. Again, he was extremely fond of the general and did not want to see his dear friend suffer unnecessarily. So he made a bargain with the general. He said, "You like grapes and I also like grapes. But if you promise not to eat grapes, I will also make the same promise. Then, when you are cured, you, Allah and I will all eat grapes together. But if anything should happen to you, if you do not survive your illness, then I will never eat grapes again."</p>
<p>The general was deeply moved by the Emperor's love for him and he promised not to eat grapes until he was cured.</p>

<p>Aurangzeb's son studied the Koran under a private tutor. In those days, the teachers were worshipped by their students and it was the custom for a student to wash his teacher's feet after he had taken a lesson.</p>
<p>One day, while the Prince was washing his teacher's feet, the Emperor happened to pass by. The Prince became frightened and the teacher also started trembling. How could the Prince wash the feet of an ordinary man?</p>
<p>When the Emperor saw the Prince hesitating, he began to scold the Prince: "My son, I clearly see that you are not washing your teacher's feet with utmost devotion and humility. Stop neglecting your duty and wash your teacher's feet properly!"</p>
<p>The Prince washed his teacher's feet with utmost devotion and Aurangzeb was very happy. The Emperor wanted his son to learn the lesson of humility. Meanwhile, the teacher was trembling the whole time!</p>

<p>Towards the end of his life, Aurangzeb repented for the many undivine things that he had done during his life and he often went to the mosque to pray.</p>
<p>One day, while Aurangzeb was praying at the mosque along with many other people, one of the mosque attendants noticed a hole in the carpet near the place where the Emperor was kneeling. The man cried out, "What will the Emperor think if he sees such a hole?"</p>
<p>The Emperor overheard the attendant and became upset. The man apologised profusely and said, "Please forgive me, O Emperor. Next time when you come here, there will be no hole in the carpet. It will be a brand new carpet."</p>
<p>Aurangzeb said, "You fool! That is not why I am angry. Why should you beg my forgiveness for a hole in the carpet? In my palace, if I had seen such a hole, I would have been really furious. There I would not tolerate such a thing. But I have come here not as the Emperor; I have come as an ordinary person, as one of you. I have come as a beggar to pray to Allah. This is Allah's special place, and Allah does not care for luxury and pomp. Here, simplicity and poverty are the real perfection. So do not worry about the hole; let it remain. Only if I pray in a simple place will I have true aspiration and true love for Allah!"</p>
