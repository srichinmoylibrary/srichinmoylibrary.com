<p>When I was running thirteen miles during the marathon last weekend, I was feeling such sadness and happiness. I was feeling sadness when I thought of my limp, and I was feeling happiness because I was still going on.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago Sunanda was practising speed work. She was running so fast! This morning she was taking exercise, bringing her leg forward to her chest. This very exercise I was trying to do at five o'clock this morning. After one try I got such pain in my toes! And this very exercise she did twenty or thirty times. I wanted to do ten, but I did only one.</p>

<p>Before the start of today's seven-mile race, I went to change my clothes in the men's room. One man was singing and chanting, "Sri Chinmoy Race, Sri Chinmoy Race," to his own tune. Each time he was changing the tune. He didn't know I was there.</p>

<p>At another point Ilona and I were running near each other. Once I stopped for water and walked for fifty or sixty metres. Then, finished! She took the lead. But then, near the end of the race, my ego came forward so powerfully, and I passed her.</p>
<p>The problem always starts when you drink. Good runners don't drink. If you drink, you are finished! You lose distance, and then for forty or fifty metres you feel miserable.</p>

<p>In today's race X very nicely surrendered. First she gave me a fight for one or two miles. Then I went ahead of her. I am so bad. Each time somebody was about to pass me, I looked around to see if X was coming. If I saw that X was not coming, I felt I was safe.</p>
<p>In the New Jersey marathon last week it was she who did not want to be behind me. She would increase her speed if I started to come up behind her. This time it was my turn to look around to see if she was coming.</p>

<p>I always say that the past is dust. In my case the past is gold. For inspiration I was watching a videotape of my best seven-mile race performance in Connecticut on 30 March 1980. That day I ran at a 7:19 pace. So the past for me is not dust; it is gold.</p>
<p>Five minutes before the race, Wally brought me a cup of coffee and I got strength from it in the beginning of the race. But later on it stopped working.</p>
<p>One man ran next to me. He was Mohan's brother-in-law. He gave me drinks along the way. Then he went ahead of me at the last moment. At the end, after finishing, he congratulated me.</p>

<p>At least ten times Jim Roser spoke to me during our twenty-four-hour race. I have never seen a runner who encouraged me so much. He was so nice. He was always cheerful and always had something nice to say. Once he said that he wanted to pronounce my name correctly because so many people were pronouncing it incorrectly.</p>
<p>At one point Nathan Whiting â€” the one with the long hair â€” said to me, "You do so many things."</p>
<p>I said, "I can't run."</p>
<p>He said, "So what? So many other things you are doing."</p>
<p>When I stopped to take rest, he said, "Everybody needs rest." He is very kind-hearted.</p>
<p>Dave Peabody, the tall man, is also very nice. He shook my hand.</p>
<p>Norman Allen ran with Beverly Nolan the whole way. He was calling himself "Beverly's friend." He wouldn't say his real name to the counters. He is a real joker. He was asking the counters to count Beverly's mileage and his mileage together so they would come in first. Tarak is also a joker. At one point, he was also calling him "Beverly's friend," instead of using his real name.</p>

<p>When I was running my last six miles during the twenty-four-hour race, I was going ahead of everyone, no matter which runner I came near. But I said to myself, "O God, some of them have run almost a hundred miles and I have run only twenty-two."</p>
<p>At one point I was behind Yasu. Poor fellow, he was holding his left leg, the hamstring. He was getting cramps. I prayed to God to give the cramp to me immediately, but God didn't listen to my prayer. My prayer was sincere. I said, "Let me suffer and let him go." He was only one metre ahead of me. I felt miserable, but God didn't listen to my prayer. So I went on.</p>

<p>Today I ran the 25-kilometre Marathon Tune-Up in Central Park. Quite a few disciples also ran. At the start, Nayana was standing just ahead of me with her husband at the eight-minute pace marker. I said, "Go!" Then, after some time I saw that she fell behind me.</p>
<p>At one point both Peter and Tulasi were asking people at the water stations if they had water, but they had run out.</p>
<p>Kurt Steiner likes me so much because we help the New York Road Runners Club in so many ways. Two or three times during the race he mentioned my name over the loudspeaker. When I finished, he mentioned my time. Niriha was standing with him on the platform taking video. She says that she helped him practise saying my name.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon around three o'clock I asked Vinaya to watch me while I did hill work on 150th Street. He is a good guard, except that he sometimes falls asleep when he is on duty. But this time he was wide awake.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the hill I saw a boy about thirteen or fourteen years old waiting for the Q-44 bus. The boy looked right at me and said out loud, "I don't know why everybody makes such a fuss about him. I don't see anything in him."</p>
<p>There was absolutely nobody else there only he and I. So I looked at him and said, "I don't see anything in you either."</p>
<p>Then he was really embarrassed and he turned away. I smiled at him and started running back up the hill.</p>
<p>The boy was very brave to say what he did, and I was also brave. He didn't walk away; he just turned around and looked at the fence, still waiting for the bus. By the time I went down the hill a second time, the bus had arrived and he had gotten on it. So I didn't have to encounter him again.</p>

<p>My oldest long-distance running route I discovered by myself. No one on my road crew found it. On this route I go down Union Turnpike to Springfield Boulevard and then to Northern Boulevard, and back. When I first used to take this route, instead of going back to Springfield and home along Union Turnpike, I would forget to turn and keep going straight along Northern Boulevard. Many times I would get lost.</p>
<p>I would be only one or two blocks away from Union Turnpike, and I would start asking people where Union Turnpike was. Sometimes I would have to go back on Northern Boulevard to Springfield because I couldn't find Union Turnpike.</p>
<p>Once I was actually standing on Union Turnpike and I asked someone whereUnion Turnpike was. My mind was so exhausted from my long run that day!</p>

<p>Today Pahar and I ran while Peter drove alongside us. We went on Union Turnpike to Springfield Boulevard and then to Northern Boulevard. At around seven and a half miles there was a very steep hill. I was dying, but Pahar was dancing inwardly and outwardly.</p>
<p>An elderly couple saw us running. The lady, who was quite fat, looked at me and said, "Keep going, keep going!" because I was panting so hard. I should have invited her to join us. I was dying and she had to say, "Keep going, keep going!"</p>
