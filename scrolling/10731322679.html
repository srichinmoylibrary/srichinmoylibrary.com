  <h2 id="page-title">The Boy With The Flowers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Boy With The Flowers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As I have told you before, you people are very nice — not naughty. Never be naughty! This story is about a little boy of your age who was very, very naughty.</p>
<p>One day at around noon an old lady was enjoying her siesta. The naughty boy came to her with a very big bouquet of flowers. He said to the old lady, “I come of a poor family. I am very poor. Will you buy some flowers? I shall sell them to you for a very cheap price.”</p>
<p>The old lady said, ”I feel so sorry for you because you are poor. But I have plenty of flowers just like these in my garden. If I didn’t have my own flowers, then definitely I would buy this bouquet from you. Such beautiful roses you have! But I also have roses in my garden, so I don’t feel like buying these. I'm sure there are others who will buy from you. Your flowers are so beautiful. I tell you what — tomorrow morning you come here, and I will give you the most beautiful rose from my garden.”</p>
<p>The boy said, “Oh no, you will not be able to give me the most beautiful rose from your garden. You won’t find it tomorrow.”</p>
<p>She said, “Certainly I will be able to give it to you tomorrow. Come with me. I will show you.” But the boy just disappeared with the bouquet.</p>
<p>The following morning the lady went to the garden, hoping that the boy would come to take the most beautiful rose from her garden. But to her wide surprise she didn’t see the rose she was looking for. In fact, all her roses were missing except for one which was at the entrance to the garden. She did find another very beautiful rose, but this was already lying on the ground. The rest of her roses had been picked. The naughty boy had stolen the most beautiful rose and the rest of the flowers as well.</p>
<p>When the lady saw the naughty boy selling flowers again the following day, she said to him, “I wanted to give you my most beautiful rose, but unfortunately I do not have it anymore.”</p>
<p>What would your answer have been if you had been the naughty boy who had stolen the flowers? You should not steal at all. But if you had, what would you have done?</p>
<p><em>D.:</em> Get new flowers and plant them.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Would they grow overnight? If that were possible, then whenever we need roses, Kanan would not have to go to Manhattan to the flower market anymore!</p>
<p><em>M.:</em> I would take the ones I stole and put them back.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> But they were already plucked.</p>
<p><em>L.:</em> I would have given her a big pink rose.</p>
<p><em>J.:</em> I would have told her that she didn’t have to show me her rose, because I had a flower for her that was more beautiful. Then the next day I would go and ask my mother to buy me a rose, and I would go and show her that the rose I had for her was more beautiful.</p>
<p><em>N.:</em> Just give them back.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The naughty boy’s answer is coming. The thief knew that he was caught. First he started to ask her for her forgiveness. But when he saw that she was not going to forgive him, he just threw down the flowers and disappeared.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Prime Minister</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Prime Minister" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All right, this will be the last story. It takes place during the Second World War. There was a first world war, and then a second; we hope that there will not be a third, or then we all will go to God.</p>
<p>During the Second World War the Prime Minister of an important country had to give a message to his countrymen over the radio. This Prime Minister was a very great, very powerful and very good man. He used to memorise his speeches and, very often, when he was taking a shower, he used to say them aloud.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister was supposed to give his talk at a very well-known radio station. As a matter of fact, it was the most famous radio station in the country. So, in order to be ready for his talk, he wanted to go to the station an hour early.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister had a car. It was very big, very beautiful, very expensive and very comfortable. But for some reason on this particular day his chauffeur was missing. So he had to go to the radio station by cab.</p>
<p>When he came out of his office, he saw a cab and asked the taxi driver to take him to the radio station.</p>
<p>The taxi driver said, “Oh no! I have to go home as soon as possible, and that radio station is on the other side of town. I want to drive north and you want me to go south. I can’t do that. Our Prime Minister is going to give a very important speech in an hour. I can’t miss it.”</p>
<p>The taxi driver did not know that it was the Prime Minister himself who was asking him to take him to the station.</p>
<p>Then the Prime Minister’s ego came forward. He thought, “Even a taxi driver appreciates my speech.” But he still had to get to the radio station, so he took out a pound note from his wallet and told the taxi driver he would give it to him if he would drive him to the radio station. In those days a pound talked very loudly.</p>
<p>When he saw the money, the driver signaled him to come into the cab and said, “Who wants to hear the Prime Minister’s silly talk!” But he used a curse word when he said it. Then he took the Prime Minister to the radio station.</p>
<p>Who was the Prime Minister, can you tell me?</p>
<p><em>N.:</em> Gandhi?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Gandhi never accepted any post at all.</p>
<p><em>A.:</em> The Chairman of England?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is the best answer! See, he is correct, only he is saying Chairman instead of Prime Minister. Prime Minister Churchill wanted to go to the BBC, and the taxi driver didn’t recognize him. He wouldn’t take him because he wanted to listen to Churchill’s speech! But when Churchill gave him a pound, the taxi driver changed his mind. All right, I have told many stories — all about naughty boys and clever people. I don’t want you people to be clever; only be intelligent. It is good to be smart, but you shouldn’t deceive anybody or tell lies. When you become extra-smart, you will deceive people. Don’t deceive anybody, and don’t tell lies. Again, I don’t want you to be fooled by anyone. Be intelligent.</p>
<p>Most of the stories that I have told have rogues and stupid people in them. So I don’t want you to be rogues and I don’t want you to be fools. I want you to be intelligent.</p>
