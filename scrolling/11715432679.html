  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Are you sure that your philosophy of love and brotherhood can solve all the problems of the world?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Are you sure that your philosophy of love and brotherhood can solve all the problems of the world?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My philosophy and your philosophy are the same: love, love, love. If you have love for somebody, then you are not going to quarrel and fight with him. And if he has love for you, who will fight? It is because people do not have peace inside their hearts that they fight. If somebody inwardly feels that he is weak, he tries to cover up his weakness by showing aggression. He tries to show how strong he is.</p>
<p>Now, if I feel inwardly strong, I am not going to fight with you. And if you feel inwardly strong, you are not going to fight with me. A little child goes and pinches his older brother or strikes him. Why? He wants to show that he is stronger than his older brother. The older brother already knows that he is much stronger than his little brother. So, out of compassion, he forgives his little brother. He says, "No, I do not want to fight with you." If we have peace, then we have love. And if we have love, then we have peace. Then where is the question of quarrelling and fighting?</p>
<p>How do we get this inner peace? If we do good things, we become good citizens of the world. We can read some spiritual books or pray and meditate or serve the world in some way. If we become truly good citizens of the world, then are we going to fight? The question of fighting does not arise at all.</p>
<p>He who loves God, he who loves Allah, is not going to fight. We pray to God four or five times a day to make us good human beings, to give us joy, to give us love, to give us peace. Who is going to pray to God, "God, give me the strength to destroy this person or that person"?</p>
<p>All those who want to become good people share the same philosophy: love, love, love.</p>

 <p>
SCA 1072-1076. Sri Chinmoy answered questions about flowers on a bus trip from Baltimore to New York on 13 May 1989.</p>
<h2>Question: How can we use flowers to help us in our meditation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you are placing a flower on the shrine, try to feel that this flower is reminding you of your heart, which you want to be as beautiful as the flower. You cannot see your heart, but you can look at a flower and say, "How I wish my heart were as beautiful as this flower!"</p>
<p>Then try to feel that this flower that you have placed on the shrine is breathing, the same way that your heart is taking in your life-breath. Connect your heart-flower and the outer flower. While you are looking at the flower on the shrine, feel that your breath is entering into it. Then again, feel that the flower has entered into your heart and there it is breathing. Your heart-flower and the flower that you have placed on the shrine are going to and fro, they are constantly interchanging. The flower that is on the shrine is entering into your heart, and again it is coming out to be on the shrine.</p>
<p>If you can do this during your meditation, then your heart will become purer than the purest, and you will be able to absorb God's Compassion, Love, Blessings — anything that He wants to give you — in absolutely abundant measure because your heart is all ready to receive.</p>
<p>By seeing something with our outer eyes, we can become it. By becoming something also, we can see it. But it is far easier to see something with our outer eyes and then imagine that we are becoming that same thing on the inner plane.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Nowadays people are doing things like grafting flowers to other flowers to create new forms.

Is this done by the Supreme through man or is it something that the Supreme is merely tolerating?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I personally feel that it is the tolerance of the Supreme. According to me, Nature's pristine beauty disappears when people change the colour of the flower and do all kinds of other things to it. I do not feel the Supreme is working in and through man at that time. The Supreme wants to keep Nature's beauty in perfect condition, in its own natural way. But man finds that it is necessary to add to Nature's beauty. Most of the time, we do not add anything to Nature's beauty.</p>
<p>Once, for a special occasion, one of our girl disciples put all kinds of make-up on her face. Then one old man said, "Before, she was beautiful. Now she looks ugly." In the same way, Nature's spontaneous beauty is absolutely the best thing. By adding to it from our fertile brain, the human in us may appreciate the result, but the divine in us may not be able to appreciate it. The natural beauty of a flower God will appreciate. But by adding foreign beauty to this natural beauty, you are taking away almost the life-breath of the flower itself. Then again, what can you do? Human eyes appreciate beauty in their own way.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Heavenly flowers are much more beautiful. They have much more luminosity than earthly flowers. The beauty of Heavenly flowers far surpasses earthly beauty. Earth is not as beautiful as Heaven. So naturally, anything that comes from Heaven is infinitely more beautiful.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Feel that you are offering them your heart's pure fragrance, and you are hoping that their heart will receive it. Also, you will pray to God at that time to give extra purity and extra beauty, divine beauty, to your heart and to the heart of the person to whom you are offering the flowers.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: At funerals, do flowers help the soul of the deceased person?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: At funerals, do flowers help the soul of the deceased person?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely they help — not only the soul but also the physical and vital of the person. The soul gets extra joy when there are flowers, and the physical and vital get added purity. Also, unfortunately, when some people come to visit the body, they come in a very low consciousness. At that time, the reality of the person who has passed away is the soul. Previously the soul was inside the body, where it was well protected. It was like a bird inside the cage. Now the soul is outside the body, but it has not yet left the earthly arena; it has not gone back to the soul's world. The soul-bird is outside the cage, and when it sees undivine people, sometimes the soul gets frightened. So flowers, incense and so forth can diminish the undivine qualities of some of those who approach the body.</p>

 <p>
SCA 1077-1089. On 10 December 1989, freelance journalist Mark Teich interviewed Sri Chinmoy in preparation for an article which later appeared in <em>Sports Illustrated.</em> Here are excerpts from the interview.</p>
<h2>Question: How did you become involved in ultra-distance running? I know you were a sprinter as a youth, but when did you fall in love with ultra-distance running?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> About twelve years ago. For physical fitness, I feel that long distance is better for most people than sprinting. One out of a thousand, or even one out of ten thousand can be a sprinter, whereas thousands of people can run long distance daily. Also, long-distance running reminds us of our inner life. It makes us feel that we are running along Eternity's Road. Each individual is a pilgrim. We are all pilgrims, and it is our bounden duty to walk, march and run along Eternity's Road. When we run long distances, we are reminded of our inner life. At the same time, long-distance runners receive many good things from Above: patience, consecration and a self-disciplined and dedicated life.</p>
<p>Every day long-distance runners spend half an hour, an hour or two hours running and, while running, they receive special blessings from Mother Earth, from nature. They are breathing fresh air. They are enjoying the fragrance of flowers and the blessings from the trees and so forth, whereas short-distance sprinters run on the track. There they deal with speed, speed, speed. They try to run fast, faster, fastest. They have no time to enjoy the beauty of nature or to receive the blessings of Mother Earth.</p>
<p>As a sprinter, I know a little bit about sprinting, and I saw that very few of my disciples are blessed with speed. But easily they can develop stamina and endurance by practising long-distance running for a few months. Also, for inner tranquillity, I feel that long-distance running is far, far better than sprinting.</p>

Did you do it because you felt the world would lose something if these events were not going on?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To start with, I wish to say that we are not cherishing any rivalry towards the New York Road Runners. Fred Lebow and I are very, very good friends. We are like complementary running souls. He is helping us considerably, and we are also trying to be of service to his New York City Marathon and whatever races he is sponsoring. In my case, I do not look around to see what others are doing. I entirely depend on the inner message. We all have God within us. When I pray and meditate, I receive messages from within.</p>
<p>My Inner Pilot wanted me to be a weightlifter and I have done it. Weightlifting was not my forté — far from it. I did not even like it, compared with other sports. I was good in sprinting and I liked sprinting, but I now have begun weightlifting because of an inner command.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I have been told that you have returned to sprinting.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I have been told that you have returned to sprinting." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I am once more sprinting. Again, it is because of the inner message. Always I listen to the dictates of my Inner Pilot. It is He who is asking me to practise sprinting, and I am trying to improve. Our goal is progress, progress. I am not trying to compete with the world's fastest sprinter.</p>
<p>I have students all over the world. Ours is like a small family. I happen to be their spiritual father, and they are my spiritual children. We are all trying to please our Inner Pilot. That is why I ask my students to organise ultra-distance races, not because it is not being encouraged by other running groups, but because I feel from within that it is the right thing to do. I am just listening to my inner dictates. If my Inner Pilot wants me to stop, I will stop and I will ask my students to stop. I am at His behest. Whatever He asks, I try to do with devoted oneness. And my students are also one with me. If I want to do something, they immediately come forward to help me. I am so happy, so grateful to them. They help, and together we undertake the project. It is not an individual effort. It is a collective effort, and we try to offer the results to the One who has inspired us, namely our Lord Beloved Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This creation is not mine. It is God's creation. Again, I am absolutely sure that God does not want anything that is good to disappear from His creation. Today He has inspired me to serve ultra-distance running. But if He sees that I am not doing well, or if He has had enough experiences in and through me, then He can easily choose another instrument. But I am absolutely sure that God will not ask human beings to give up long-distance running.</p>
<p>"Run and become, become and run" — this is the motto of our Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team. Something that is good in God's creation will always last; it will only make progress. From time to time we may see setbacks, but eventually it is bound to flourish.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Oh, no, no, no. We shall do it indefinitely, for as long as God wants us to do it. I do not envision in the near future that we are going to stop. We shall not give up running and then do something like wrestling or hunting, no. We will not do that!</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am most grateful to them, most grateful to them. But I also know how many things we are doing wrong. There is definitely room for improvement. When we look at the moon, we see that it is perfect at a distance, but up close it is full of holes. A flower can look so beautiful, but as soon as we go near it, we find some imperfections.</p>
<p>We can appreciate someone who is a great tennis star. We say that he has perfect strokes and so forth, but he himself knows how much he can still improve. There are so many areas in which he can improve. In our case also, we know we are not perfect. In fact, we are far from being perfect. So many things we need to learn. But our greatest joy is that we are not giving up. We may not be perfect, but our goal is progress, and we believe that through regular progress, gradual progress, we shall become better instruments of God.</p>
<p>If people appreciate our races, I am extremely grateful to them. But if they say that our races are absolutely perfect, I will be the first to disagree with them. I can only say that we are trying to be better. Each year we are improving. We know the shortcomings of previous years. In the areas where we did not succeed or could not do something according to our satisfaction, we are trying to improve.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In my case, I do not bring the future into the immediacy of today. What is going to happen in the next second of your life, you do not know and I do not know. Today's pressure is enough for me. I am overburdened with today's problems, the problems of here and now. Why do I have to bring tomorrow's elephant and place it on my shoulders? Now I am already carrying an elephant. Today itself is a big problem. So why do I have to anticipate what is going to happen and what is not going to happen? Let tomorrow come. I will be fully prepared. Whatever inspiration and aspiration I have is carrying me through today. Tomorrow, the aspiration that will be needed, God will supply.</p>
<p>What is going to happen tomorrow, I do not know. It will be all mental speculation, that has no value. So let tomorrow dawn. Then, when something happens, God will give me the inspiration to deal with it. To think of the future is not advisable. For myself, I find that it is not wise. What is going to happen tomorrow I do not know. I do not even know what is going to happen the next minute in my life. So this very moment I will try to use judiciously.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I have been reading some of your writings, The Outer Running and the Inner Running, as well as some things on meditation. In one talk that you gave before the New York City Marathon a few years ago, you told your students to run their best, but if they happen not to run their best time, if they fail in their personal expectations, not to worry about that at all.

Can you reconcile these two attitudes for me?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I have been reading some of your writings, &lt;em&gt;The Outer Running and the Inner Running&lt;/em&gt;, as well as some things on meditation. In one talk that you gave before the New York City Marathon a few years ago, you told your students to run their best, but if they happen not to run their best time, if they fail in their personal expectations, not to worry about that at all. You said the main thing was their cheerfulness, that the running itself was the most important thing. I also know that you do have a special respect for champions like Carl Lewis. Can you reconcile these two attitudes for me?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Both ideas can easily go together. I appreciate athletes like Carl Lewis and other world champions because I feel that they are a great manifestation of God. Let us take running as a garden. One rose may be most beautifully blossomed. Again, there are also many little buds. So I tell the little buds, "If you are not blossomed fully today, do not worry. Only pray to God to let His Will be done in and through you. And if you are cheerful, you will receive more inspiration, more aspiration."</p>
<p>Let us say I wanted to run the marathon in four hours and I complete the distance in four and a half hours. If I am doomed to disappointment, tomorrow I may not go out to run, I may even give up running. But if I cheerfully accept the result, then I will receive added strength. Today I have failed to achieve my goal, but failures, as you know, are the pillars of success.</p>
<p>Hundreds of times I failed to lift 300 pounds with one arm. But I continued, and afterwards I went on to lift 7,000 pounds. Our philosophy is never to give up. If we give up, how can we continue? And if we do not continue, how can we maintain our cheerfulness? To all my students I say, "Remain cheerful, no matter what the results." We are spiritual people. We know that it is our bounden duty to offer the results of what we do to God. He has given us the capacity to run. It is He who is running in and through us. So let us offer our gratitude to God.</p>
<p>Carl Lewis and other super-excellent stars in various walks of life we take as members of our family. Being spiritual seekers, we feel that the whole world is ours — not in the sense of possessing the world, but in the sense of embracing the world. You, he and I are all one. So if some member of the family does something, we feel it is our bounden duty to appreciate that person.</p>
<p>It is all one world. For my weightlifting programme, I have given the name <em>Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart.</em> Carl Lewis perfectly fits in with us. So do Roberta Flack, Narada Michael Walden, Bill Pearl and countless others. They are all members of our family. They love us and we love them. When a member of our family does something good, we feel it is our duty to appreciate and admire that person. In this way, we increase his capacity. Mutual appreciation is the right thing.</p>
<p>To those who are not champions, I say, "You do your very best, and place the results at the Feet of God." To those who are champions, if they do not do well at a particular time, I say, "Do not be disappointed! Do not give up!"</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I always give one hundred per cent credit to God. God gave Carl Lewis the capacity to become the fastest human being. Some people will say that it is because he practised so hard. True, he did practise, but even the aspiration and dedication he had to practise came from God. If I have to give credit, I will always give one hundred per cent credit to God. Carl Lewis had brothers who ran very fast, and he had so many athletic friends. They also practised. Why did they not become world champions? It was God who inspired Carl Lewis to become world champion.</p>
<p>In a class, there are so many students, but only one person comes first. Grace is operating in and through everybody. It is a matter of receptivity. That is why I give one hundred per cent credit for my success and others' success to God.</p>
