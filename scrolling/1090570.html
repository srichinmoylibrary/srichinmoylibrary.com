<p><em>[Matsyendranath's ashram. Matsyendranath is seated in very high meditation, surrounded by five of his disciples.]</em></p>
<p>FIRST DISCIPLE: Our teacher is such a great spiritual Master. Although he has tremendous spiritual and occult powers, he never misuses them. He always uses his power for God, only to fulfil God in humanity in accordance with God's express Will.</p>
<p>SECOND DISCIPLE: See how he is diving deep within! Let us meditate with him.</p>
<p><em>[All meditate for a while.]</em></p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH <em>[coming out of trance]:</em> My dear spiritual children, you are my most intimate disciples. Did you hear any conversation just now?</p>
<p>THIRD DISCIPLE: No Master, we didn't hear anything. There was nobody here, so how could we hear anything? We were all meditating with you in deep silence.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Did you see a glow around my face or an aura behind my head?</p>
<p>FOURTH DISCIPLE: I did, I did!</p>
<p>FIFTH DISCIPLE: I saw something like a glow around your face, Master.</p>
<p>FIRST DISCIPLE: And behind your head, an aura! I know that you have many auras, but I must have been seeing your most beautiful aura!</p>
<p>SECOND DISCIPLE: What delight to have this kind of experience!</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: It was all due to the presence of Lord Shiva. Shiva appeared before my inner vision to give me a special message. He told me that my best disciple, my absolutely best disciple, will be coming to me today for initiation.</p>
<p><em>[The disciples are inwardly shocked and displeased, but outwardly each one gives the Master a broad smile.]</em></p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Hypocrisy and spirituality don't go together. Be sincere. I know you are all sad that my best disciple is going to come to me today, and you will definitely be jealous of him. Now tell me why you are sad inwardly, although outwardly you are showing me happy faces? Why are you already jealous of him?</p>
<p>THIRD DISCIPLE: Master, you know it is not easy to conquer jealousy. We have been trying very hard for many years, but still it is extremely difficult for us to conquer jealousy.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Just try to remember that we are all in a battlefield. You are my soldiers; I am your commander. But we are not strong enough to fight against our enemies, the brooding forces of night, alone. We need someone really strong to come and take our side. Naturally, if he also adds to our strength, we are bound to win.</p>
<p>FOURTH DISCIPLE: O Master, now we are extremely happy! The happiness in our hearts shows in our happy faces.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: You are lying to me! Inwardly you are not happy at all. You are extremely jealous. You are jealous of him because you feel that it is his power that will enable us to win the victory, not yours. When he appears on the scene, when he takes our side, only then will it be possible for us to win. If he does not come, we cannot win. So you are jealous because while you do not have the inner power to bring about the victory, he does. It is useless for you to tell me lies, because I can easily read your thoughts. If anybody wishes to challenge my inner vision, that person should stand up.</p>
<p><em>[Nobody stands.]</em></p>
<p>FIFTH DISCIPLE: Master, it is useless to try to deceive you, but we know that our deception is no match for your compassion. Your compassion is infinitely more powerful than our deception. That is why we stay with you.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: You are jealous that my most devoted disciple is going to come because he will be my favourite. You are jealous that he will be the one who can win the victory for us. But instead of being jealous, why don't you consider the arrival of this brother of yours as the result of your many years of prayer and meditation with me? You have prayed for peace, light, bliss and power in boundless measure. Now why can't you take his arrival as the answer to your prayers? Do not think of him as an individual with personality. Think of him as the bringer of peace, light and bliss. This peace, light and bliss is coming to you because of your sincere prayers. Your meditation for divine victory has borne fruit. You prayed to God in me for the fulfilment and transformation of your nature. Now God is granting you this boon by sending you this unparalleled brother who will be my best disciple. Take him as the fruit of your aspiration, not as a rival who is endowed with much more capacity than you have. If you can do this, then you can cherish no jealousy toward him.</p>
<p><em>[Enter Gorakshanath with the traditional gifts of fruit for the Master.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, last night I had a vision. In the vision Lord Shiva appeared before me and told me that you are my Guru. So today I have come to you. Please initiate me.</p>
<p>FIRST DISCIPLE: This time, in all sincerity, I feel that all of us are inspired by our Master's advice.</p>
<p>THIRD DISCIPLE: We are actually feeling in this new brother our own living presence.</p>
<p>FOURTH DISCIPLE: We see and feel that his arrival is the result of our own aspiration.</p>
<p>FIFTH DISCIPLE: Master, we are most sincerely happy, delighted and proud to see this youth. We see in him our own achievement.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: My dearest and best disciple, if I have ever had divine pride in my life, then all my divine pride I offer to you. I know who you are and what you are. You are of me and you are for me. You have come to help me shoulder my responsibilities, and for that I shall be eternally grateful to you.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: You will be grateful to me? It is I who have to be grateful to you! You will initiate me and give me light in abundant measure. From you I will receive my realisation and liberation.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: You are grateful to me because I will give you my realisation, but I am grateful to you because you will be able to receive my realisation. I have been here now for many years, but I have not found anybody really receptive to whom I can offer my entire realisation. You are able to receive and I am able to give. It will take you a very short time to realise me. It is a matter of a few months. In these few months I shall be working most powerfully inside you to give you realisation and liberation. Once you receive my realisation, you will be able to manifest the Supreme in me. Now let me bless you and initiate you in the traditional way.</p>
<p><em>[Matsyendranath blesses Gorakshanath and gives him a string of beads.]</em></p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: I am giving you these japa beads. I have sanctified them, and they are only for you to use. This is a very special mala. Let me tell you a story about it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Scene II</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Scene II" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>[A forest. Matsyendranath's voice as heard; then characters enter and take over the story.]</em></p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Once Lord Shiva and his consort, Parvati, were roaming in the forest of Manapuri. When they wanted to go back home, they discovered that they had lost their way. Lord Shiva was extremely hungry, so he asked his consort to make him some food.</p>
<p>SHIVA: Parvati, you prepare a meal for me, and in the meantime let me go and look for a road so that we can come out of this forest. I will try to find a road that leads to the city. I am sure there is one.</p>
<p><em>[Lord Shiva begins to leave. Suddenly he has a vision.]</em></p>
<p>Parvati, I have just had a vision. I saw that as soon as I leave you a hostile force will come to attack you.</p>
<p>PARVATI: Please, please, if you have seen this then don't leave me here alone!</p>
<p>SHIVA: Don't worry. You can stay here in perfect safety. I am drawing a circle on the ground. You stay inside it. Do not go out of the circle. Now, I am leaving my trident with you. As soon as this asura comes, you just throw it at him, and he will be killed. I must go now.</p>
<p><em>[Parvati begins to prepare the meal. Enter a giant asura.]</em></p>
<p>PARVATI: O God! This asura is a giant! What a ferocious looking creature! I shall throw the weapon of Lord Shiva at him and pierce his heart.</p>
<p><em>[She throws and hits him. He falls.]</em></p>
<p>Oh! This awful asura is bleeding profusely. Look! His blood has fallen on my meal. The impure blood of the giant has poisoned Shiva's food!</p>
<p><em>[Enter Shiva.]</em></p>
<p>SHIVA: Parvati, are you all right? What a tremendous asura! A giant!</p>
<p>ASURA: Shiva, your consort has struck me with your weapon. Since my life has been brought to an end by you two, I am all gratitude. All my life I have done undivine things. I have become the champion devotee of ignorance. Now your divine weapon and your consort, who is the divine Mother, have taken my life away. Please grant me one boon, only one boon: that I may not recover. Do not use your power to revive me. Just let me die here. But first, please allow me to touch your feet and be blessed by you.</p>
<p><em>[He touches Shiva's feat.]</em></p>
<p>SHIVA: O giant, you will now be liberated. On the physical plane you will die, but on the inner plane you will be immortal because of your most sincere prayer for liberation.</p>
<p>PARVATI: My Lord, the impure blood of this hostile force has fallen on your food and polluted it.</p>
<p>SHIVA: I am concentrating on it, and with my compassion-power I am purifying it.</p>
<p><em>[He concentrates.]</em></p>
<p>Now that I have conquered this undivine force with my spiritual power, I shall taste a portion of this food. The world is full of ignorance. When ignorance is transformed it is a divine miracle. I am offering this portion of food to the giant, and I am using my spiritual power to transform the food that is left into mala beads. Whoever uses these beads for japa will get realisation without fail.</p>

<p><em>[Exactly the same as Scene I]</em></p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: My child you are destined to get realisation very soon in this incarnation; therefore, I am offering you these beads. My children, let me look at you to see whether you have again become jealous. No, you are not jealous at all. I see you have the firm conviction that it is the result of your aspiration that has been manifested in the arrival of your new spiritual brother.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, Master, here I am seeing five faces just like my own! Five bodies, five hearts, five souls just like my own! Am I right, Master, or is this just a hallucination?</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: You are absolutely right, my son. These are not your mere spiritual brothers and sisters, but they are part and parcel of your very existence. In you they have found their divine pride, and in them you have found your divine duty. It is you who will help them to realise the Highest, and it is they who have brought you here with their most sincere aspiration.</p>

<p>FIRST CITIZEN: He has gone crazy!</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN: He has become insane!</p>

<p>FIRST CITIZEN: Impossible!</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN: Impossible!</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN: He has created absolute chaos in the whole Kingdom. He says that everybody has to be equal, and he feels that the only way to bring this about is for everything in the market to be sold at the same price!</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN: Unthinkable! Unthinkable! How can gold and rice be sold at the same price? A seer of gold and a seer of rice! Ha! Ha! What a stupid King we have! There are things on earth which are extremely rare and there are things on earth which are extremely common. How can they be given the same price? Look at the stupidity of this King! He feels that this will make his Kingdom most prosperous, and that all will become friends. Ha! Just wait and see what unimaginable things will soon happen.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN: Well, when one loses one's brains, one does all sorts of things. The King thinks we will lead a perfectly happy life if the price of everything is equal. He is a fool, a real fool. What is worse, he is adamant in his command and we are helpless.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN: We are helpless, true, but I abominate him — his utterance, his decree, everything he does.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN: My friend, you hate him, and I wish to say that his very name has become anathema to me. He is despised and he will ever be despised by his entire Kingdom. I am a jeweller. From now on I have to sell all my most expensive jewellery at the price of eggplants, potatoes and tomatoes.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN: No matter, friend, how many aspersions you cast on him, you cannot change his mind. This is our fate.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN: Fate? I don't believe in fate. I shall abrogate my fate! You'll see. A day will come when Harabhanga will realise his folly and this Kingdom of ours, this beautiful country, will again have real life — a life of love, a life of harmony. Once more only the right will deserve the fair. A man of knowledge will have prestige; a man of ignorance will have to work for knowledge and only then will he get prestige. People will work hard in order to achieve something and only those who deserve it will get appreciation. Two different things cannot be of the same value. A man of ignorance and a man of knowledge cannot be put on the same footing. A man of sincerity and a man of insincerity, a thief and a saint, cannot be considered equal. Just by having all eat the same food, just by selling everything at the same price, this stupid Harabhanga cannot equalise all his subjects. Impossible! His brain has reached the zenith of stupidity.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN: And I tell you, the lion in me will not eat grass like the sheep who are the King's ministers. The King's ministers have no voice of their own. It is they who have agreed to the King's proposal. I am a lion; I shall devour the King and his sheep!</p>

<p><em>[Gorakshanath is meditating in his room. Enter Matsyendranath]</em></p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: My son, are you still here? Don't you know what King Harabhanga is doing to his subjects? He has said that everything has to be sold at the same price. Gold and eggplants will be sold at the same price.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: I know, Master. I have heard and I have read the newspaper. But I am a little amused. I am curious to see what will happen.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Curious, my son! Curiosity even at this stage? You have realised God. Now why do you allow curiosity to enter into you? I know your curiosity is innocent. You are pure: your heart is all purity, all luminosity, my son. But curiosity is still a dangerous thing. Very soon this whole Kingdom will be ruined. A catastrophe will take place, and I am afraid something will happen to you. I am concerned for you, and not for this Kingdom. I cannot help the innocent subjects. I can only sympathise with them.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, do you know what the King said? He says his Kingdom has to surpass Heaven in beauty, prosperity and divinity.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH <em>[laughing]:</em> You know how he will make his Kingdom superior to Heaven! He is an old man now. He has become senile.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, forgive me, I wish to see the end of this fun. If you allow me to stay here and see the end, I will be so grateful to you.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: I shall allow you to stay, but I tell you that your suffering is my suffering. If something serious happens to you, it is I who will have to help you or save you.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: O Master, then I shall go away. I don't want you to suffer because of me.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: No, no, stay here, Gorak-shanath. I want you to enjoy this. I want to feed your innocent curiosity. Don't worry about me. I will be able to protect myself and I will be able to help you out, too.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Then with your permission, Master, I shall stay.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Yes, you stay, with my permission. Let us see what happens.</p>

<p><em>[First citizen in his jewellery shop. Enter a customer. The customer begins looking at a beautiful ring.]</em></p>
<p>CUSTOMER: How much does this ring cost?</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN: One hundred rupees.</p>
<p>CUSTOMER: One hundred rupees? Why, this could not weigh much more than a few cloves of garlic! Let me go next door to the grocery store and see the price of garlic.</p>
<p><em>[Exit customer]</em></p>
<p><em>[First citizen is beside himself with rage and despair. Customer returns]</em></p>
<p>CUSTOMER: The price of garlic is one anna. Your ring certainly does not weigh as much as a whole bulb of garlic, but I will give you one anna for it. And I won't make a report to the King against you for telling me the price was one hundred rupees. Here is one anna. Good bye.</p>
<p><em>[Customer snatches the ring and starts to leave. Jeweller begins shouting.]</em></p>
<p>CUSTOMER: If you shout I will stab you. You know it is the King's order that everything be sold at the same price.</p>
<p>JEWELLER: I know it is the King's order, but I refuse to sell a gold ring for one anna. It's extremely valuable!</p>
<p><em>[Customer stabs the jeweller and runs. Jeweller starts shouting.]</em></p>
<p>JEWELLER: Help, help! Somebody save me! Thief! Thief! Arrest that man!</p>
<p><em>[Immediately from other shops people come on. The customer is caught and brought back in by the police.]</em></p>
<p>JEWELLER: That's the man. He has stabbed me.</p>

<p>MINISTER: Your Majesty, the man who stabbed the jeweller was put in jail yesterday, but today he has escaped.</p>
<p>KING: How?</p>
<p>MINISTER: He was a strong man. It seems he was able to break some of the bars of the prison window, and somehow he escaped.</p>
<p>KING: What is to be done?</p>
<p>MINISTER: That is up to you. Please tell me, I am at your command.</p>
<p>KING: Well, if you can't find him, look for any strong young man of his size, and bring him to me.</p>
<p>MINISTER: Only one person?</p>
<p>KING: No, bring everyone. Bring all the men of his size, and I will make a selection. I will have the strongest person hanged. It is an insult to me that a prisoner can break out of my prison and escape. So the strongest man will be put to death.</p>
