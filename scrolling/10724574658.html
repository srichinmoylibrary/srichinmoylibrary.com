<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is predestined that you will realise God without fail, either tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. The most significant events in your life are predestined, but if it is a question of what you are going to eat for breakfast, God is not interested in that. Again, even if it is predestined that you are going to die tomorrow, if you follow the spiritual life and God sees that you have genuine aspiration, you may not die. Instead, if it is God’s Will, you may just have a headache, that’s all.</p>
<p>Fate can be changed by the Supreme’s Will. In the highest sense, the only thing that is predestined is that you are bound to realise God. He, she, everybody is bound to realise God. Ignorance can prevent you from realising God for only one day or two days, but you cannot remain unrealised throughout Eternity. Let us use the term “predestined” only in a good sense. If some calamity is going to take place, if you are not going to realise God in this incarnation, then you can use your will-power, your aspiration-power to change your fate. Fate can be changed by an unchanging will.</p>
<p>Take yourself as a player. A soccer player can use his right leg or his left leg. When he comes near the goal post, everybody thinks that he is going to use his right leg, and they are ready to prevent the ball from going into the goal. Then, at the last moment, he uses his left leg and scores. You may think it was predestined that he would use his right leg, but it is not true. He can use his left leg, too. So if you see that something undivine is going to happen in your life, some calamity, then you can use your aspiration-power to change it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Read my books, read my books. Have you read the latest book, <em>The summits of God-Life?</em> Read, read, read that book. And again, please forgive me, but why do you ask such idle questions? When people ask me questions about realisation, <em>siddhi</em> and <em>samadhi</em>, the answers will be useless to them. You are asking about the top of the Himalayas when with greatest difficulty you may be able to come to the foot of the Himalayas. I am not discouraging you, but if you think about <em>samadhi</em> at this stage of your development, you will soon get discouraged. You will see that it is useless to think about these things, and you will just give up. Just climb up slowly, steadily and unerringly.</p>
<p>Some spiritual Masters used to say, “Don’t utter these words, ‘realisation,’ ‘liberation,’ ‘salvation.’ They should not be uttered at this stage of your spiritual development. Only use the words ‘aspiration,’ ‘dedication,’ ‘devotion,’ ‘love,’ ‘surrender.’ ” These are the things you should be thinking about right now. If somebody is studying in kindergarten and thinks of his elder brother who is completing his Master’s degree, a problem will start. He will be thrown into a sea of confusion and discouragement. Beginners should act sincerely. It is not that you will remain a beginner forever. One does not remain in kindergarten all his life. He goes to primary school, high school and then to college and university. But he has to know where he is. So you know where you are. Now is the time for you to think of your aspiration, love, devotion and surrender.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can anything be outside the Will of the Supreme?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can anything be outside the Will of the Supreme?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Will of the Supreme is in everything, true. The only thing is that we have to know what His ultimate Will is, and how much of that Will we are accepting as our own. He has given us a little limited freedom, just like the father who gives a penny to his child and watches to see how he uses it. If the child uses it for a good purpose, then the father gives him more — a nickel, then a dime. God has given us limited freedom in order to examine whether we really want to do the right thing. We have to be very careful. His Will is inside us, so that when He gives us a penny we will be able to use it properly. But because we develop our own ego, individuality and personality, we try to use this penny in our own way instead of going deep within to see why He has given us the money. When He gives us something, immediately we want to squander it. But if we use it in His own way, then He gives us more and more.</p>
<p>He has given us freedom so that we will get joy. If He tells us, “I have given you a dollar. Now you have to use it for this or that purpose; I am giving it to you only for that,” then we do not get joy. We feel that we are under compulsion. But when He says, “I have given you something. Now use it in your own way,” then we misuse it. But if we are wise, if we are clever, we will know that if we use it in His way, then He will give us much more. On the one hand He is giving to us, and on the other hand, He is examining us. At the same time, inwardly He is inspiring us to do the right thing. But because we want to retain our individuality and personality, we try to use it in our own way. We use our own very limited, infinitesimal will. What can poor God do? Only if we offer our will to His Will, then we are safe, we are fulfilled.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you go to New York on my birthday, it will be much more worthwhile for you. If you come on my birthday, then you will see all your brother and sister disciples. You will have their inspiration, plus the power of group meditation. There will be morning meditations almost every day, and other big meditations. There will be two weeks of spiritual activities every day, two weeks of joy and inspiration. But, if you go on your birthday, you will see only the local disciples. You will not get the strength of the long group meditations or the inspiration of multifarious spiritual activities every day.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do you have any practical suggestions for athletics, especially for the workers at the restaurant?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do you have any practical suggestions for athletics, especially for the workers at the restaurant?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Physical work strengthens your muscles. When I lived in an ashram, I was a very good athlete, but I voluntarily asked the ashram authorities to give me the job of washing the dishes. They reluctantly gave it to me, and I felt that it was the best job I had ever had there. I had had at least ten different jobs at different times, and the best job, according to me, was to wash the dishes. We were only four or five boys, and two thousand people used to eat. It used to take us three hours, but we got the greatest joy. There were no mental problems at all — we just had to wash the dishes.</p>
<p>While you are working at this restaurant, see how many times you have to go downstairs and upstairs. Now, if your conscious mind makes you feel that you are taking exercise for your participation in athletics when you go up and down the stairs, then automatically all your muscles will get enormous strength. But if you remain unconscious, twenty times you can go downstairs and come up and your muscles will not be developed.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life also, it is true that God is for us. But we are trying to become conscious of God. Most people are not atheists, only they are not conscious of God’s Presence. When you become conscious of God’s Presence, you pray and meditate in order to realise God. So while you are working at the restaurant, you will pray, you will meditate. While you are working you will be spiritual. But from time to time you will be aware that while you are doing physical work, you are strengthening your arms so that you can throw the shot-put well. While you are walking from one corner to another, feel that you are taking exercise. Everything is in your consciousness. Otherwise, you will work there for seven or eight hours just like any ordinary worker. They do not focus their attention on either the exercise aspect or the spiritual aspect, so this kind of work does not help them in any way.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, try to keep your consciousness on a particular subject or object. While you are working, you can inwardly meditate, not outwardly. If you start meditating outwardly, everything will be burnt. While you are in the physical plane, you have to be aware, you have to be conscious. Then you will make constant progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, I&#039;ve been earning my living through music for about ten years, but now it’s very difficult for me to take money for my art. I feel that I only want to serve the Supreme through music.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, I&#039;ve been earning my living through music for about ten years, but now it’s very difficult for me to take money for my art. I feel that I only want to serve the Supreme through music." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know that money can either be a divine power, or it can be misused. With a knife we can cut a fruit and share it with our brothers and sisters, or we can stab others. Money as such is not bad. Only we have to know how we are getting it and using it. We shall not get money by using foul means, and we shall not misuse money: this should be our attitude. Why should it be difficult for you to accept money for your music? Money can be God’s blessing if you use it properly.</p>
<p>I pray with you, I meditate with you, and then, out of your love and gratitude, some of you give me a love offering. Here I have not used foul means to get money. I could have said, “Come, I will give you immediate, instant God-realisation if you give your money to me. If you give me ten thousand dollars or twenty thousand dollars, your God-realisation is assured.” By these foul means I could have become a multimillionaire.</p>
<p>You have to know how you are earning your money. If you are singing lower vital, emotional songs and creating excitement, and if you feel that that is the only way you can earn money, it is absurd. You have to maintain your own standard. You will do something that will elevate the consciousness of others, not stimulate excitement. Vital music stimulates, whereas the soul’s music, psychic music, elevates. From now on, all our musicians must try to elevate the consciousness, not stimulate any excitement.</p>
<p>If you earn money by illumining and elevating somebody’s consciousness and with that money you support yourself or support the Centre, or do something good and divine, then how can anybody blame you? But you have to know how you are getting the money, from whom you are getting it and how you are using it. If you take all these things into consideration, then money-power need not be a stumbling block. Money-power is also God’s power, but it has to be used properly.</p>
<p>Money-power is necessary in this world. I have a little bit of spiritual peace, light and bliss. Now if I go to a grocery store or a restaurant and say that I will give them my peace and light instead of offering money, they will say, “Get out. We don’t need your peace, light and bliss. Give us money.” They are not asking for something strange or unusual from me. They are asking for something which they ask for from everybody else. It is a legitimate request. If I want to eat the same food as others, naturally I have to behave like others and buy it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we become more tolerant and understanding?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we become more tolerant and understanding?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First think of how many millions of things you have done wrong since you have been in this body. You will be able to count at least ten undivine things. Out of millions of things you have probably done wrong, you will be sincere enough to admit at least ten things. Then ask yourself if anybody has forgiven you. Naturally God has forgiven you. If He had not forgiven you, by this time you would have been in the other world. But when somebody else does something wrong, you become angry and want to punish that person. Try to count how many things that person has done wrong to you. He may have done many, many things wrong in his life but perhaps he has done only two things wrong to you; whereas you are the culprit for at least ten individual items, and the Supreme has forgiven you.</p>
<p>God exercises forgiveness. In your case and my case, what we exercise will be called the strength of oneness. Yesterday I did something wrong, and God forgave me. How is it that today I cannot identify myself with someone else and feel that the very thing that he has done, I could have done? What he has done wrong today, I can easily do tomorrow. I should be grateful to God that I did not do it today, and remember that tomorrow there is every possibility that I will do that very same thing,</p>
<p>We should sympathise with the person who has done something wrong, or on the strength of our oneness, we should tolerate it. Toleration is not an act of weakness. Far from it! Toleration is the acceptance of reality at a different level of consciousness. Mother Earth, the trees, the oceans and the mountains, do they not tolerate us? We do many, many things wrong; we abuse them in millions of ways. Yet they forgive us and nourish us continually. We are able to use every part of them for our own purposes.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes the aspirant knows, but sometimes he cannot tell. It is like a teacher and a student. The student may think that he is going to get a score of a hundred out of one hundred, but when the examination paper is graded, he finds he has failed the examination — or vice versa.</p>
<p>The students cannot necessarily tell how they are doing. Only the teacher can say. Sometimes the student is right. He feels that he is going to get good marks, and he does. But most of the time, the students miscalculate. In your case, you think that you are falling asleep, but you are totally wrong. So only the teacher knows if the student is doing extremely well or not.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are using the expression, “When I am asleep,” but when you are sleeping, how do you know what is happening? When you are sleeping, you are not aware. Only afterwards, when you get up early in the morning can you know that you have been energised. One day you will feel energised and fresh when you wake up; another day you will feel very weak and tired. But only spiritual Masters can feel what is happening to them during sleep, because they can easily keep the soul separate from the body, and the soul can observe the body. A spiritual Master can totally separate sleep from his wakeful consciousness. I can be sleeping soundly, but I will be fully conscious of what I am doing, and can see what is going on around me. From the spiritual point of view, I am totally awake. My body is sleeping at the same time that my consciousness is awake.</p>
<p>You don’t know what is happening while you are sleeping. When you get up early in the morning and you are energised, you have to feel that at night while you were sleeping, or just before you went to sleep, some divine forces were able to come to the fore from within. That’s why you feel extremely energetic the following day. Or it may happen that you have received extra unconditional divine Grace from above. If you do not feel energised, wrong forces may have entered into you, or you did not aspire at all. That is why you are lethargic.</p>
<p>It is a very good practise to meditate before you go to sleep for at least half an hour. And people who have vital problems, emotional problems, should please concentrate on their navel centre for purity before they go to sleep.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can be more responsible if you do everything soulfully and unconditionally. You usually do things soulfully, but at times you do not act unconditionally. That is where the problem starts. When you do something, the result will come in the form of either success or failure. Whichever it is, you have to feel that you are offering the result to the Supreme with equal delight. If you can cheerfully and unconditionally offer the fruit of every action to the Supreme and place it at His Feet, then you will make very good progress.</p>
<p>Sometimes you feel that you have done your best; you cannot do anything more. This may not be true. You can do more, much more. I will never ask you to do something unless I have given you the capacity in abundant measure. There is not a single disciple to whom I have not given the necessary capacity. If I ask you to bring me a heavy package, that means I have given you the capacity to carry it. I shall not ask a child to bring something heavy, because I have not yet given him that capacity. You are extremely devoted. I am in no way blaming you; but I clearly see in my mental vision, inner vision, that you can easily do more than what you are now doing.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we protect ourselves from the mind and from making a Himalayan mistake, especially when we are making decisions or judgements?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we protect ourselves from the mind and from making a Himalayan mistake, especially when we are making decisions or judgements?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a mistake to think that only with the mind you can calculate or judge things. This is a false distinction that we have given the mind. We are told by our parents and our teachers that only the mind can judge or make decisions; no other member of our earthly existence can do it. But this is not true. The heart can do it far better than the mind, and so can the soul. We have to consciously say to the mind, “I don’t accept you as a reality superior to the heart. You are a reality, and I don’t deny your existence, but just because in the outer body you are a few inches higher than the heart, that does not mean that in inner maturity, in spiritual development, you are superior to the heart. Far from it.” On the physical plane there are many here who are taller than me, but in terms of heart-power, I think I am one inch taller than you. Just because my heart is one inch larger than yours, your head is surrendering to me. Now you have to convince your mind that it is no match for the height of your own heart.</p>
<p>The mind has many things to do: add, subtract, multiply and divide. The heart has only one thing to do: to feel oneness. When it feels oneness, it grows into perfection. We must always feel that the heart is far superior to the mind. Unfortunately we do not do this. We have been trained by our parents, by our teachers, by our environment that the mind is superior, but it is not. Every day the mind digs a grave for us, but the heart will never do this. The heart always tries to save us; yet we take the mind’s side.</p>
<p>At the end of our life’s journey we should ask, “What has the mind taught us?” The physical mind, the earthbound mind has given us only information. If you can tell me who all the Presidents of the United States were, what do you gain? Only that others will say that you are not an idiot. This is what the mind can offer. But if you can identify yourself soulfully, with utmost love and concern, with whoever the President is, then you are becoming one with God’s creation. Only oneness with another creation of God will give you real satisfaction. You are a petal of a flower. Becoming one with another petal will give you tremendous joy. Just by knowing who the President is, you do not gain anything. You have only mental knowledge. But by becoming one with the soul of the President, you will receive tremendous joy. This joy you will never be able to receive from the mind.</p>
<p>If you become sincere, you will try to unlearn what the mind has taught you. You have learned too much; now try to unlearn. There are millions of things which you can unlearn. If you unlearn them today, you will not suffer so much. You are suffering because you have learned too much. The mind has learned many undivine things. If you can unlearn those things, you will be safe.</p>
<p>In the case of the heart there is nothing to unlearn. The heart has discovered the Supreme. The physical mind is nothing but information. We also have the intuitive mind, which is a higher mind, the overmind, the illumined mind and the supermind. These are not like the earthbound mind inside the head. In our spiritual development we can learn to use these higher minds. There we can have a quiet, calm and tranquil mind, and we can achieve boundless peace in the mind. But unfortunately we do not have access to these minds, or these levels of consciousness. We live only in the physical mind, which at every second is dividing us, separating us from others. It even separates us, in a very clever way, from its own outer life. In this respect children are far better than we. They do not use their minds. They live in the heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything that God has and is, is unlimited. God is eternally unlimited in all His aspects. “Nameless” is a term which we apply to God for different reasons before we have realised God and after we have realised God. Before we have realised God, we swim in the sea of ignorance. We do not know who God is or what God is; therefore, He is nameless. Once we have realised who He is and what He is, again we feel and we see that He is nameless, for His qualities cannot be grasped by the human mind. Eternity cannot be bound by name and form; Infinity cannot be bound by name and form; Immortality cannot be bound by name and form.</p>
<p>In God, Infinity itself is transcending its own Infinity; Eternity is transcending its own Eternity; and Immortality is transcending its own Immortality. Therefore, we cannot name God or give any form to His ever-transcending Reality; so again, God becomes nameless to us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we come to the realisation of God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we come to the realisation of God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can come to the realisation of God only when we feel that all that we have and all that we are cannot give us true satisfaction, not even an iota of true satisfaction. Material wealth, earthly achievements, cannot give us lasting satisfaction. Therefore, we dive deep within in order to discover if there is anything or anyone who can grant us satisfaction. Then there comes a time when our soul comes to the fore and convinces the doubting mind that there is a divine Reality in the inmost recesses of our heart, which is eternally flooded with Light and Delight. As outer hunger compels us to eat earthly food, our inner hunger will compel us to eat heavenly food. This heavenly food we call aspiration. When we aspire, slowly, steadily and unerringly, we come to the realisation of our Beloved Supreme.</p>
