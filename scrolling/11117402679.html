<p>This morning I ran eleven miles in the Father's Day Marathon around the Jamaica High School Track. When the race started, I waited until the last person was 30 metres ahead and then I started. The first person I passed was Chameli. As I passed her, I greeted her. Like that, I greeted many. I was getting such joy by competing with Anupadi. I passed her and greeted her seven or eight times. Many times I was looking at Anupadi's strides.</p>

<p>When I see any runner, I don't look at any part of him â€” not at his head, not at his face, not at his feet. Even in the car if I see somebody running, I don't see the runner. Immediately I look only at his strides. I have that wonderful disease; I can see only the strides.</p>

<p>What a difference between the days when ran in India and now! I don't know whether should laugh or cry. The best thing is to laugh at age, but perhaps age is laughing at me.</p>

<p>Today I had absolutely my best experience running! One of the disciples was following me in his car while I was running in Flushing Meadow Park. I had covered three miles and I was starting my fourth mile, when all of a sudden I heard a big crash, as if two cars had collided.</p>
<p>I turned around to see that the car that was following only 40 metres behind me had crashed into a lamppost. It was a really frightening experience. Then the disciple came out of the car only to tell me that he had been drinking Coke and eating peanuts to stay awake, but in spite of that he fell asleep.</p>
<p>Can you guess the name of the driver? Databir!</p>
<p>Now I ask anyone who follows me while I am running to drive 100 metres either ahead of me or behind me.</p>

<p>Yesterday around noon, I was walking down the 150th Street hill with my weighted shoes on. When I was coming back up, I saw four little boys â€” three black and one white. One of the black boys stood in front of me, practically blocking me, with folded hands. There was no joke involved. So I looked at him very soulfully. I couldn't believe my eyes: the other three monkeys were silent. For them to even remain silent was something. Three of them just looked at me, but the other one folded his hands.</p>
<p>When I passed by them, I didn't hear anything, so I knew that they were not cutting jokes. This kind of experience I very seldom get. I was very, very deeply moved to get that kind of treatment from those monkeys.</p>
