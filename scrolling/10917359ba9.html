<p>Once Akbar grabbed Birbal and said, "Now let me see how much strength you have. Can you release yourself? Can you escape from my grip?"</p>
<p>Birbal did not struggle or try to force his way out of the Emperor's grip. He simply started repeating, "Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama!"</p>
<p>Akbar cried, "What is this? By repeating 'Rama, Rama, Rama,' do you think that you will be able to release yourself and escape? I am holding you very tightly. 'Rama' will never release you. You fool! Exercise your power to come out of my grip!"</p>
<p>Birbal said, "You know that when one is haunted by a ghost, repeating Rama's name makes the ghost leave the body. It seems that you are worse than a ghost."</p>
<p>Akbar said, "No, no, no! I do not want to be worse than a ghost!" And he immediately released the Minister, who laughed and laughed.</p>

<p>One day Birbal asked Akbar, "Why is it that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west every day? Can it not sometimes rise in the west and set in the east?"</p>
<p>The Emperor said, "Only a fool like you can ask this kind of question, and only another fool can answer it."</p>

<p>Birbal had a young daughter who was very smart, just like her father. One day his little daughter went with him to the palace, and Akbar, just to have some fun, asked her, "Do you know how to talk?"</p>
<p>She was only a little child, but she said, "Yes, I know how to talk much, and I know how to talk little."</p>
<p>The Emperor said, "What is this? How to talk much, and how to talk little? How do you do that?"</p>
<p>The little girl answered, "When I speak to my superiors I speak little, and when I speak to my inferiors I speak much."</p>
<p>"Why do you do that?" asked the Emperor.</p>
<p>The Minister's daughter replied, "From my superiors I learn. So when I speak to them, I speak as little as possible and listen as much as I can. But when I speak to my little brother, I speak as much as possible, because he does not know anything. He has to learn from me."</p>
<p>This was the child's wisdom.</p>

<p>Birbal replied, "It is the distance between the eye and the ear. What we see with the eye is the truth, and what we hear with the ear is all gossip, all falsehood. So the distance between truth and falsehood is about three inches."</p>

<p>Birbal was one of the nine gems of Akbar's court. He came of a poor Brahmin family from Trivikrampur (now known as Tikawanpur) on the banks of the river Yamuna. Though popularly known as Birbal, his real name was Maheshdas. He also wrote poetry under the pen-name "Brahma".</p>
<p>By virtue of his wisdom and wit, he rose to be Akbar's favourite Minister and court jester. He was also an excellent soldier and administrator.</p>
<p>When Akbar formed his own faith, the <em>Din-e-Elahi,</em> which was a synthesis of Muslim and Hindu beliefs, there was only one Hindu among its followers — Akbar's true friend and sympathiser, Birbal.</p>
<p>Birbal met his death in battle while on an expedition to Afghanistan. Akbar was so grief-stricken that he burst forth:</p>
<p>"Birbal, you never hurt the helpless.</p>
<p>You always gave them whatever you had.</p>
<p>I am helpless now, and yet you have left nothing for me."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Akbar and the poet</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Akbar and the poet" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Akbar was very fond of poetry. He used to honour poets all the time, giving them gold and diamonds. Sometimes if a poem was extremely beautiful, he would ask the poet to stand on one side of a scale, and on the other side the Emperor would put gold coins to equal the poet's weight. Then he would give the poet all the coins.</p>
<p>Once a poet wrote a very beautiful poem, and the Emperor was very pleased with him. Unfortunately, the poet was very greedy. When the Emperor was discussing how much the poet would get, the man became so restless that he could not wait to hear the outcome. So he said to the Emperor, "Perhaps you will give me one lak of gold coins. May I see how many coins that is and how much it weighs?" The poet only wanted to see the coins. He did not actually know how much he would be getting.</p>
<p>Akbar was amused and said, "All right, bring one lak of gold coins to show him."</p>
<p>When the money was placed in front of the poet, Akbar said to him, "Now, what is happening inside you? Tell me!"</p>
<p>The poet said, "I am admiring you and appreciating you for having shown me all these coins. I have never seen so much money in my life, and perhaps I will never again see a lak of gold coins at one time. I have never seen such a huge amount!"</p>
<p>The Emperor said, "I want you to be grateful to somebody else, and not to me."</p>
<p>"Who is that person?" the poet asked.</p>
<p>The Emperor put all the coins in the poet's hands and said, "Look up. Now be grateful to Allah. I am giving you these coins in His Name. So please be grateful to Allah and not to me."</p>

<p>Akbar always used to appreciate the good qualities in everybody — artists, musicians, singers, architects, poets and so on. He specially used to admire and adore religious people. At one time, he decided to visit Guru Nanak. Nanak was praying and meditating with his disciples. Akbar was so moved by Nanak's spirituality that he wanted to give Nanak something in return.</p>
<p>Akbar said to Nanak, "I am the Emperor. Please take something from me. I am ready to give you land or anything else that you wish."</p>
<p>Nanak replied, "No, no, no, I cannot accept anything from you."</p>
<p>Then Akbar went to Nanak's wife and repeated his offer, but she also said the same as her husband.</p>
<p>Finally, Akbar went to Nanak's daughter and said to her, "I am giving you a vast plot of land." The Emperor was so adamant that she could not refuse his gift. So Akbar was successful in giving Nanak something indirectly through his daughter.</p>

<p>Although Akbar had eagerly welcomed the birth of his sons, each one proved to be a disappointment to him and Salim, the eldest, openly betrayed Akbar. While Akbar was waging war in the south of India, Salim proceeded to Allahabad and proclaimed himself Emperor. He then advanced on Agra with his army.</p>
<p>Akbar dispatched his faithful and much-favoured vizier or Prime Minister, Abu'l Fazl, to negotiate with Salim on Akbar's behalf, but Salim ordered his men to ambush the scholar-Prime Minister and assassinate him. The head of Abu'l Fazl was then sent to Salim to prove that his order had been carried out.</p>
<p>Akbar's grief knew no bounds. He decided to make Salim's eldest son, Khusrau, his heir instead of Salim. But a reconciliation between father and son was brought about by the female members of the family and Salim came to Agra to see his father. At this meeting, Akbar placed his own turban on Salim's head, thus acknowledging him to be his heir.</p>
<p>Then Akbar warned his ambitious son, "You hope to become Emperor after my death; but if you rule in the same manner in which you have acted so far, your empire will not last long."</p>

<p>A few months later, Salim rebelled again and Akbar decided to march against him. Akbar's mother, Hamida Begum, who was now almost eighty, came to Akbar and said, "My son, I beg of you, do not attack my grandson. You are such a great warrior. You have conquered the whole world. I can clearly see that my grandson has no chance of defeating you. My other grandsons, Murad and Daniyal, have both died. Do spare the life of this one. He is your only remaining son and I love him dearly. Do forgive him once more. If not, I shall not be able to go on living."</p>
<p>But Akbar would not listen to his mother. He set out for Allahabad with his army. On the way, he heard that his mother had become seriously ill. He turned back to Agra, but she died a few days after he arrived. Grief-stricken, Akbar negotiated peace with his son.</p>

<p>The death of Birbal, the murder of Abu'l Fazl, the uprising of Salim and the most recent loss of his mother together broke Akbar's heart. In 1605 he fell ill with dysentery, and this attack was to prove fatal.</p>
<p>During Akbar's last days, Prince Salim came to pay his respects to his father. In silence, Akbar motioned to his son to place the imperial turban on his head and take up the Emperor's sword which had belonged to Humayun. Then he signalled Salim to leave the room.</p>
<p>Only Akbar's thirteen-year-old grandson, Prince Khurram, and a few close friends remained with the dying monarch. When Khurram's mother tried to persuade him to go outside the room, he replied, "No! So long as there is a breath of life in Shah Baba [Akbar], nothing can induce me to leave him."</p>
<p>The indomitable Akbar died on October 27th, 1605 after a reign of almost fifty years. He bequeathed to Salim an empire that stretched from the doorstep of Persia in the west to Bengal in the far east of the sub-continent and southwards as far as the Deccan. It was one of the greatest and most glorious empires in the history of the world.</p>

<h2>The Emperor Jahangir punishes his son</h2>

<p>Prince Salim took the name of Jahangir, meaning 'World Seizer'. He was thirty-seven when he became Emperor and, unlike his father and grandfather, he inherited a stable empire.</p>
<p>One day Jahangir received a serious complaint against his eldest son Khusrau. What had happened was this: Khusrau had very happily and proudly ridden his elephant from the palace to a particular place in the kingdom. Along the way, the prince had seen the wife of a low-class man and he had thrown a piece of betel-nut at her in a very offensive way. When the husband came to know that his wife had been insulted by the prince, he went to Jahangir's court and lodged a formal complaint.</p>
<p>Jahangir became furious and made enquiries to find out if what the man had said was true. After some investigation, he learned that the story was correct. Jahangir immediately ordered that the low-class man should ride on the prince's own elephant from the palace to the same place where the prince had gone. Khusrau's wife would stand at the same spot where the man's wife had been standing. Then, when the low-class man passed by, he would throw a piece of betel-nut at the princess.</p>
<p>"This will be the only adequate compensation," the Emperor said.</p>
<p>The Emperor's decision was not at all popular. People asked, "How can the Emperor do this? She is the princess and this man is just a low-class person. They are not at all equal, so how can the punishment be equal? Plus, it will be so humiliating for the princess to endure this insult."</p>
<p>Jahangir replied, "No, my son has to learn that he cannot do this kind of thing. My order is my order. You have to execute it. Otherwise, both my son and his wife will be even more severely punished."</p>
<p>Finally, the low-class man ran out of the palace, crying, "I do not want them to be humiliated and I do not want them to be punished. I forgive your son."</p>
<p>Then Jahangir said, "Since he has forgiven my son, I have nothing to say." The Emperor turned to his son and told him, "He has forgiven you, my son. That is the only reason why I am forgiving you."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A lover of justice</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A lover of justice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The Emperor Jahangir was a lover of justice and was always willing to listen to his subjects' complaints. Sometimes they would file complaints through the proper channels, and then the Emperor would do the needful. At other times, the Emperor had a special way of receiving complaints. Outside the main gate of his palace at Agra, he kept a big gong. Anyone who had a complaint could come and sound the gong. If the injured party sounded the gong only once, it meant that he had lost a quarrel with someone which he felt he should have won. If the gong sounded twice, it meant that somebody always worked very hard but felt he was not getting the proper wages. If it sounded three times, it meant that somebody's house had been robbed and he was looking for the thief. And if the gong sounded four times, it meant that a murder had taken place.</p>
<p>The Emperor's soldiers used to watch and see how many times the person lodging the complaint struck the gong. Then they would immediately bring the person before the Emperor and announce the nature of the complaint.</p>
<p>One day a man struck the gong four times, which meant that there had been a murder. The soldiers asked him, "Who has killed whom?"</p>
<p>The man replied, "Somebody killed my father."</p>
<p>The soldiers asked, "When was he killed?"</p>
<p>"Forty years ago," the man answered.</p>
<p>The palace guards could not believe their ears. "Only now you want punishment?" they asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the man. "I just came to know that my father had been killed. My mother told me this morning."</p>
<p>The guards asked, "Why did your mother not tell you before now?"</p>
<p>The man said, "Because if she had told me, then I would have killed one of the Emperor's Ministers. This particular Minister killed my father forty years ago, and he is still in office!"</p>
<p>"Are you saying that the Minister should be executed?" they asked.</p>
<p>"Exactly," the man said.</p>
<p>The palace guards brought the man before the Emperor and told the Emperor the whole story. The Emperor turned to his subject and said, "You have to know who asked the Minister to kill your father. The Minister was only carrying out my order. Are you saying that I should be punished as well?"</p>
<p>The man responded, "I cannot go so far as to say that. But I have not seen my father for forty years. Indeed, that has been a tragic loss for me. During these forty years, the Minister has earned so much salary. As compensation for my father's death, may I receive only one month of the Minister's salary?"</p>
<p>The Emperor said, "I am ready to give you the equivalent of forty years of the Minister's salary — whatever money he has earned from the day he killed your father. Go and find out the exact date of your father's death from your mother and then come back and tell me."</p>
<p>The man's mother had forgotten the day, the year — everything. But the Minister had kept a record. It had only been thirty-five years. Jahangir summoned the man back to the palace to give him the money and told him, "Here in my hand is the Minister's salary and here, on the Minister's body, is his head. Which one do you want? I can give you either the Minister's head or the full salary that he has received over the years."</p>
<p>The man quickly said, "The Minister's salary, not his head!"</p>

<p>When Akbar's third grandson was born, Akbar named him 'Khurram', meaning 'Joyous'. Khurram became Akbar's favourite. When Prince Khurram was sixteen years old, however, his health was very poor. In addition, astrologers were making dire predictions about the future. So Jahangir held a special ceremony to try to change the fate of his son. He weighed the Prince and then distributed to the holy men and the poor an equal weight of gold, cloth, grains and other items. Khurram went on to become Emperor Shah Jahan and he reached more than seventy years of age.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">An age of culture</h2><span property="dc:title" content="An age of culture" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Jahangir was a connoisseur of art and a lover of poetry. He surrounded himself with artists and other cultured people. The gardens that he designed at Srinagar attempted to create Paradise on earth. He transformed the Moghul court into a centre of cultural splendour and refinement.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Jahangir fell increasingly under the influence of his powerful wife, the beautiful and intelligent Nur Jahan ('Light of the World'), who was the daughter of Jahangir's Prime Minister. In the Emperor's later life it was she who made most of the decisions and held the reins of power.</p>

<h2>The reign of Shah Jahan</h2>

<p>After Jahangir's death, Khurram defeated his brother Shahriyar, eliminated all other claims to the throne and proclaimed himself Emperor. He took the name Shah Jahan, meaning 'Sovereign of the World'. He then exiled the still influential Nur Jahan to Lahore and quickly subdued Rajput opposition. Shah Jahan's reign thus began on a powerful and decisive note.</p>
<p>Shah Jahan waged war in Southern India and Persia and he was able to expand and consolidate the Moghul Empire considerably. He also constructed many important buildings and mosques. He even built his own city, Shahjahanabad (now Old Delhi), at Delhi.</p>
<p>Upon the entrance to his Hall of Private Audience in his palace, he placed a Persian inscription in letters of gold: "If there be Paradise on earth, it is this, it is this, it is this."</p>
