<p>At times merciless criticism corrodes the human capacities. But in the case of Zatopek, the critics sadly failed. He was far beyond the snare of ruthless criticism. Form and style are indeed necessary, but speed and stamina are of paramount importance.</p>

<p>In 1956 Zatopek underwent an unfortunate hernia operation, which prevented him from running for three months during the summer. Still, at the age of 34, the immortal Zatopek placed sixth in the Melbourne Olympic Marathon. Although most runners would have considered this an excellent performance, Zatopek candidly acknow-ledged his failure with a smile: "I realised I was licked at the half way point. I started confident that I could make a good race of it, but I suddenly realised about all that was left was to go out like a champion. That was when I decided it was no use breaking my neck with any more speed and risk collapse ... This was my last race."</p>

<p>When Alain Mimoun of France won the Olympic Marathon in the 1956 Melbourne Games, he waited for Emil Zatopek, who had beaten him in every Olympic race he had ever run before. When Zatopek finally appeared, in sixth place, Mimoun said to him, "Emil, why don't you congratulate me? I am an Olympic champion. It was I who won."</p>
<p>Mimoun describes Zatopek's reaction: "Emil turned and looked at me as if he were waking from a dream. Then he snapped to attention. Emil took off his cap — that white painting cap he wore so much — and he saluted me. Then he embraced me."</p>
<p>Alain Mimoun sheds tears when he speaks of it. "Oh, for me," he said, "that was better than the medal."</p>
<p>Then Mimoun informed Zatopek that he had more good news for his friend. Mimoun had two days earlier become the proud father of a baby boy.</p>

<p>A man of principle he was. Nothing could swerve him from his inner duty. Humiliation untold he was ready to tolerate. Whenever his inner moral fibre was severely tested, he always came out easily triumphant, as was the case with his Olympic ordeals.</p>
<p>When the Russians invaded Czechoslovakia, Zatopek was a supporter of Alexander Dubcek. His loyalty to Dubcek was incredible. After the invasion, the Russians expelled him from the Czech army, in which he had held the rank of colonel.</p>
<p>From being a colonel, he had to take the job of a garbage collector in Prague. He suffered the excruciating pangs of humiliation, but cheerfully he went through it. Because he was a man of such principle, his friends and admirers became closer to him. Some kind-hearted men even helped him in his new job. He did a few more menial jobs, but indomitable was his spirit. Cheerful was his life. He braved the storms of life smilingly and thus triumphed in the battlefield of real life.</p>

<p>Emil Zatopek's timing has been bettered by present-day runners, but this in no way eclipses his supreme achievements. Zatopek's achievements were the foundation stones of today's unique achievements. How can there be any edifice if there is no solid foundation? The foundation makes its unique contribution.</p>
<p>When the immortal Czech was invited to be the Grand Marshal of the tenth annual New York City Marathon — the biggest marathon in the world — the New York Road Runners Club explained its choice: "We wanted someone for Grand Marshal who would conform to the highest standards of any athlete — in any sport, in any time. Emil Zatopek of Czechoslovakia is such a man."</p>
