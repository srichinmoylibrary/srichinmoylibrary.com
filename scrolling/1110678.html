 <p>
RF:93-116. On 30 August 1999, Sri Chinmoy spontaneously commented on these spiritual words offered by his disciples.</p>
<h2>Reincarnation</h2>

<p>According to some spiritual Masters, to talk about reincarnation is the height of stupidity. Again, according to other spiritual Masters, knowledge of reincarnation is of tremendous help. In my case, I subscribe to both views.</p>
<p>When you meditate on your previous incarnations, if you see or feel that you were not an important person, that you were most ordinary, then you can easily be doomed to disappointment. You will say, “Oh, I was so ordinary! There is no hope for me.” Again, if you take a positive view of your life, you will say, “That was just my beginning. Now, in this incarnation, I have got such a great spiritual Master and I have such sincere inspiration and aspiration! I must go forward, I must go forward!”</p>
<p>If you can take the right attitude, then knowledge of reincarnation and your past incarnations can be of tremendous help. But if you take the wrong attitude, if you feel doomed to disappointment because you were an ordinary person or even a thief, it will only discourage you.</p>
<p>We have to be brave to know about our past incarnations. If our past was bad, then we shall go forward right from today. And if our past was good, then we shall march forward at top speed.</p>
<p>The message of one of the prayers I offered this morning was, “By Your infinite Grace, I am paving my progress-road by sprinting, not by walking or running.” You can see how this message applies to the question of reincarnation. With Grace we sprint and sprint, no matter what we were or what we did in the past. Let us not be curious to see what we ate in the past. If we ate spicy food yesterday and it gave us trouble, then we will simply say, “I am not going to eat spicy food again. From now on I will eat fruit and other nice food.” In this way we will go forward, always forward, without thinking about the past.</p>
<p>So, some spiritual Masters say that to talk about reincarnation is simply a waste of time, while others say that, if it inspires you to go forward, you can know about your past incarnations. I belong to both categories. My philosophy is that if you want to know, if you feel you have to know, then go forward from your previous standard. If you were good, then become a better person. If you were bad, then become a good person right from this very moment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Devotion</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Devotion" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We enjoy Indian sweets and many other sweets. Each individual will have some sweets that he likes best and feels are most delicious. But devotion is infinitely, infinitely sweeter than the sweetest sweet that has ever been made by any human being, because devotion is made of God’s ever-transcending Breath. Like us, God has breath, but His Breath is always transcending, transcending, transcending. Our human devotion is made of God’s own ever-transcending Breath. Therefore, it has to be sweeter, infinitely, infinitely sweeter than any man-made sweets.</p>
<p>When you have true devotion, you will feel what true sweetness is in your life. Otherwise, without devotion, nobody will be able to imagine real sweetness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Speed</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Speed" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>From aspiration we get speed. From dedication we get speed. From manifestation we get speed. Aspiration we have to maintain. Dedication we have to maintain. Surrender we have to maintain. We must aspire, we must dedicate ourselves and again, we must manifest God’s Light. But along with aspiration, there should be surrender. Along with dedication, there should be surrender. Along with manifestation, there should be surrender. If unconditional surrender is available in our aspiration, in our dedication and in our manifestation, then we will definitely get the fastest speed.</p>
<p>You are aspiring. There should be surrender in your aspiration. You are dedicating yourself. There should be surrender in your dedication. You are manifesting God’s Light. There should be surrender in your manifestation. If there is surrender in your aspiration, dedication and manifestation, then your speed will be faster than the fastest.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Faith</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Faith" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Faith is spirituality’s spine, spirituality’s backbone. If the spine is not in good condition, then the body is useless. Similarly, if one does not have faith in one’s Master or in oneself, then that person’s spirituality is bound to be a complete failure. Again, if one has faith in one’s Master and in one’s own spirituality, then that person will be stronger than the strongest in the spiritual life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">God-realisation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="God-realisation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>If God-realisation is the object of our curiosity, it is useless. If it is a whim, it is useless. If it is a hope, then we shall accept it in our inner life. But if it is a promise to God and to ourselves, then we must take it as our living breath. Without breathing we cannot live. Similarly, if we take God-realisation as a most solemn promise to God and to ourselves, then God-realisation is an inevitable reality both for the seeker and for the Master.</p>
<p>So, we have to see if God-realisation is a matter of curiosity, a whim, a hope or a promise. If it is a promise, then it is absolutely inevitable, and it is the real fulfilment of life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Concentration</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Concentration" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When you concentrate, whether you are in your mind or in your heart or in your entire being, think of the whole world as smaller than the smallest. Just feel that the entire world is tinier than the tiniest. Then your mind will not act like a vagabond or a stray dog. If you take the world as something very vast, then your concentration can never, never be effective. But if you take the entire world as a tiny thing, absolutely as small as your fingertip, then your concentration will be most powerful.</p>
<p>For concentration, everything has to be smaller than the smallest. Otherwise, our eyes will be roaming from this side to that side and our concentration will go away. We will not be able to focus; we will not be able to penetrate the object of our concentration. If you are lifting weights, whether it is 90 pounds, 100 pounds, 120 pounds or 200 pounds, do not think of the size of the weight. Just take the whole object that you are lifting as absolutely smaller than the smallest. Whenever you concentrate on something, you have to feel that that particular thing is very, very tiny. On the strength of our imagination, we make the object of our concentration extremely small.</p>
<p>For meditation, it is just the opposite. We have to imagine something as large as possible. On the strength of our imagination, we meditate on something vast. Meditation is vastness, while concentration has to be focused on the tinier than the tiniest object to be successful.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Poise</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Poise" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once you have God-realisation, at that time your highest and best quality is poise. When disturbing, discouraging and disheartening things happen, outwardly they do bother me, absolutely as if I were an ordinary person. As a matter of fact, I am more profoundly affected than anybody else, because I am one with the entire world, so I am fully responsible for what is happening. When anybody does anything wrong, on the strength of my oneness with that person, I may become very upset and angry; I may be full of anxiety and worries. But in the inner world, I am not at all affected. Worries and anxieties may be ruling the outer world but, for a God-realised person, poise is ruling the inner world.</p>
<p>Once we have oneness with God’s Divinity, whether that Divinity is manifested or yet un manifested on earth, we shall definitely have boundless poise. We know that although today the creation is moving the wrong way, eventually it will move in the right direction. It is like a child playing football. This side and that side the child is running, but the mother knows that, after playing for a few hours, the child will come back home.</p>
<p>Poise is the real home of a spiritual Master. Outwardly he experiences the anxieties and worries of the whole world because of his identification with the world. Then again, he knows that he has a home where there is perfect peace, infinite peace, and that home is his poise.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Experience</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Experience" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Some people have countless experiences before they realise God. Again, others have very, very few — perhaps twenty or thirty experiences. In one way, people who get hundreds of experiences can be proud of their experiences. But God decides who will have hundreds of experiences before God-realisation, and who will get only ten or twelve experiences. In both cases it entirely depends on God’s Will. We cannot say that the one who had few experiences had the shortest road. No! The road is the same, but God did not want one individual to have to eat so much on the way. During a 26-mile marathon, some people drink perhaps four or five times, but poor me! God alone knows, countless times I drink! Yet the destination is the same. Some drink after each mile, while others drink every five or six miles. We are drinking water at various stations, but our destination is the same. When you get many experiences, it is like drinking water at every water station.</p>
<p>Everything depends on God’s Will for the seeker. God knows who needs more experiences and who needs fewer experiences to arrive at the goal. The only important thing is that, if you have a very high experience, you should always keep that experience in mind. When your consciousness descends, when you are suffering from physical, vital, mental, emotional and other kinds of problems, at that time think of your highest experience. That particular experience will be your saviour.</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda received so many higher than the highest experiences before he realised God. At times, he forgot his experiences, but when he remembered them, he used to imagine, imagine, imagine that on such and such a day at the foot of a particular tree he had the highest experience. Then, on the strength of his imagination, he used to get back that highest experience. Staying in the same place for a few hours, he would make his imagination as real as the experience itself. First he forgot the experience that he had had ten years earlier. Then he remembered the experience, but he wanted to go back to his previous height to achieve the experience once again, and he definitely went there. First he climbed up to a certain height. Then he stayed there, at that particular height. There he made his experience absolutely as real as it had been five or ten years before.</p>
<p>At times you may be doomed to disappointment. Let us say that everything is going wrong. Your consciousness has absolutely touched the abysmal abyss. Just remember that five or ten years ago you had the highest experience. Now use all your imagination to go back to the height of that experience. Then make the experience as living, as real, as possible. Your imagination is not false! Swami Vivekananda did that very thing. Just go to your highest height of ten or fifteen years ago and imagine one particular experience. You do not need ten experiences; take one experience as your highest. Then, when your consciousness is at the lowest point, you will be able to go back to your highest. You can say to yourself, “I was there,” and then you can return to that height.</p>
<p>Like that, imagine, and then go up, up, up to reach your highest. I always say that imagination has a reality of its own. It has its own world. It is not a false experience; it is real. You need a ladder to climb up, and that ladder is your imagination. When you first climbed to that height, you needed a ladder. That ladder you have thrown away, but you can bring back another ladder, which is imagination. Then you can go up once again.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Oneness</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Oneness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Oneness has to become fulness. Oneness has to become complete and perfect, and that perfection comes only from expansion, expansion, expansion. The imagination of the mind will try to get joy by saying, “I am one with the whole world.” But the mind’s oneness is all theoretical. The heart will say, “Am I one with my own body, first of all? Have I established my oneness with my big toe, with my defective knee, with my back pain?” I have to know if my oneness with my whole body is perfect. If any part of my body is dislocated or defective, have I established my oneness with that part?</p>
<p>Many times, if something is bothering us, we do not establish our oneness with that thing. We establish our oneness only with goodness. It is so easy for me to appreciate my biceps and triceps. When I look at some other part of my body, I do not get that same joy. But I must also get joy from the places where I am weak. If I see a very strong person, I get joy. Again, if I notice somebody who is weaker than the weakest, I may not get joy. But oneness has to be universal, because God created both the strong man and the weak man. I have to be one with the strength of the strongest man, and again, I have to be one with the man who is weaker than the weakest.</p>
<p>Oneness has to spread. We have to have oneness with the little flower and with the big tree. As soon as we see a flower or fruit, it is so easy for us to have the feeling of oneness, but we may totally ignore the huge tree. We look at the flower or fruit and we are satisfied; we do not pay any attention to the tree. But who produced this little flower and fruit? It was the tree. Again, who produced the tree? It was God Himself. Some human beings have achieved so many things. But who created those human beings? Again, it was God. By expanding our feeling of oneness with the creation, we can reach God.</p>

<p>If there is anything in us that is going to make God truly happy and truly proud of us, then it is our discipline. In our daily life-activities if we have discipline, then we are bound to get a most powerful Smile from God. If we are disciplined during the entire day, then in the evening when we meditate and imagine God, we will feel and see God’s brightest and most powerful Smile. A life of discipline God takes as our greatest achievement.</p>

<p>If we want to see the Beauty of God’s Face, the Divinity of God’s Face, the Immortality of God’s Face, if we want to see God’s Face in His own universe, then we shall have to entirely depend on God’s Grace. Our capacity comes only from God’s Grace.</p>
<p>We separate our capacity from God’s Grace. We say, “I practise; that is why I am able to lift heavy weights.” But God will say, “Who gave you that readiness, willingness and eagerness to get up early in the morning and lift weights?”</p>
<p>God’s Grace always comes first. God’s Grace is inside everything, but we do not believe it. When we achieve something on the physical plane, we give credit to our own physical activities. But who gave us the inspiration, who gave us the readiness, willingness and eagerness to achieve that thing? It was God who gave us His Grace.</p>
<p>God’s Grace is always responsible for our success, for our progress, for our perfection and for our satisfaction.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Surrender</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Surrender" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>You do not know where God is. You do not know who God is. You do not know where your soul is or what it looks like. You do not even know what your heart is. But you can imagine the spiritual heart, and you can surrender to the heart. You can surrender to something tinier than the tiniest.</p>
<p>Let us say that your youngest brother is very, very cute, extremely cute. Whatever he is doing, you are enjoying. While he is playing with sand or pebbles or marbles, you are getting joy because you have surrendered to him. You are so strong, and his strength is nothing in comparison. But your whole life you are surrendering to this little child, because he is giving you boundless joy. You are getting such joy while he is throwing, playing and moving around.</p>
<p>Now, God you do not know. Your soul you do not know, and your heart you do not know, but you have to feel that inside your heart there is something or someone very cute. You can allow yourself to surrender even to the whims, let us say, of the little child who is always playing, playing, playing inside your heart. If you can surrender all your will to this little child, you will get tremendous joy.</p>
<p>It is very easy to surrender when you love someone. Even on the ordinary vital plane, how many sacrifices a boyfriend and girlfriend will make for each other! But in your case, you are surrendering to something sweet, something divine, something immortal. By surrendering to something sweet, something divine, something immortal, what are you losing?</p>
<p>Always the mind thinks that it knows better. The human mind will never say that somebody else can be better. The human mind will always say, “I am the best.” But that mind has to say, “No, there is something sweeter, something more beautiful, something more perfect than I am, and that is the heart.” Always think of yourself as the heart. Do not think of your mind. If you feel, “I am the heart,” there is nothing wrong in it. Let people think you are crazy. If you say to yourself, “I am the heart, I am the heart, I am the heart,” all the divine qualities of your heart will come forward.</p>
<p>In India they say, <em>“Brahmosmi</em> — I am the Brahman, I am Lord Shiva.” Yes, we may be full of imperfections, but we can say, “I am Lord Shiva, I am Lord Shiva,” when we do japa. We can repeat that mantra. In your case you can repeat, “Surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender.” Let this be your japa: “Unconditional surrender, surrender to my Guru, surrender to God, surrender to my soul.” If you do japa like this, easily the beauty, the fragrance, the capacity and the divinity of surrender you will be able to get. But always remember that surrender is in the heart, not in the mind. The mind never surrenders. Even if it surrenders for one day, for ten days it will revolt. Why do you need the mind when you have something else which is far superior? If you are identified with the heart, once the heart surrenders, it is very difficult to take that surrender away from the heart. So the best thing is always to remain in the heart and repeat the mantra: “Surrender, surrender, surrender.”</p>

<p>Each time you give yourself, you have to feel that you are becoming closer and closer and closer to God. Each time you perform an act of self-giving, you have to feel that you have come one step closer to God, without fail.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Optimism</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Optimism" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Optimism keeps the seeker alive in God’s Heart. Something more: God also remains alive if there is optimism in the seeker’s heart. If there is optimism, there is hope. Optimism means the positive aspect of life. Optimism is always positive, positive, positive. If we have optimism, then God is alive inside our heart. And if God has optimism, which He has, then we are alive in God’s Heart. Optimism keeps both God and the seeker alive in each other’s hearts.</p>
