<p>Once I went alone to visit Eric’s parents in Pittsburgh. While coming back at night in the bus, I was only watching the moon for the entire journey. It took three and a half hours or even more. There were no other passengers. The bus driver was driving and I did not want to talk to him. I was only meditating and meditating on the moon.</p>

<p>As you know, I came to America in April 1964. Around September or October of that year, a very good friend of mine, an excellent well-wisher, was extremely anxious to help me. His name was John Kelly. His way of helping me was to get me a degree from the New School. He said to me, “Nobody will appreciate you, nobody will acknowledge you unless you get a degree from the New School. In the New School you can specialise in any subject, even giving lectures. I shall meet with the expenses for your course, so that you can get a degree.”</p>
<p>For a few days I could not comply with his request, then finally I agreed. He took me to the New School on the day of registration. A middle-aged woman was sitting at the desk and there was a long queue. There were 40 people ahead of me. I stood there in the queue for about 10 or 15 minutes. Then I lost all my patience. I said, “God has given me His degree. I do not need any earthly degree. It is too much, too much!”</p>
<p>My friend John Kelly felt sincerely sorry for me. I said, “I am not going to get a degree. I do not need it.” This friend of mine used to work in the fire department. His heart was very big, vaster than the vastest. Afterwards he went to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and spent five or six years. Now he has passed away.</p>

<p>In 1964 I went into a store in Greenwich Village. It was a ten-cent store—they said everything was ten cents. I was so happy because I only had two dollars with me. I selected a few things and then I went to pay. They said I owed three dollars.</p>
<p>I said, “What is this? Everything is supposed to be ten cents!”</p>
<p>Then they showed me that on the sign there was an arrow pointing up, just after it said ten cents.</p>
<p>Last month, I went to Greenwich Village to see a doctor for my leg and I looked for that famous ten-cent store. But it is no longer there.</p>

<p>Many times at the Indian Consulate I wore suits and jackets that did not fit me at all because somebody used to give me his old clothes. His name was Arthur Gregor. He was a senior editor at Macmillan Publishing Company and a friend of Samie and Eric. He was much taller than I was and almost twice as large, so his clothes were much too big for me. But necessity knows no law. I did not have money to buy winter jackets or proper suits and it was so cold. He was so nice to me. He had another Guru, but he had such admiration and respect for me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Arthur&#039;s spiritual mother</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Arthur&#039;s spiritual mother" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This is a funny story. Arthur Gregor had a South Indian Guru whose name was unfamiliar to me. This Guru had been a police officer. Then he gave up police life, prayed, meditated and became a spiritual Master. Arthur used to tell me about his Guru’s compassion, this and that. Sometimes I used to tell him things about his Guru. Once I told him that his Guru had a sailing boat. He said, “How do you know?”</p>
<p>“Your Guru is showing me,” I replied, “and I can see him inside the boat with one of your spiritual sisters.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is Sushila,” said Arthur. Then he became my great admirer because his Guru did have a sailing boat and a few times he and his spiritual brothers and sisters went out in the boat.</p>
<p>Arthur used to come quite often to my friends’ place. His apartment was very close by, only two apartments away from ours. We lived at 43 Greenwich Avenue and he was at 45 Greenwich Avenue. From time to time, he also invited Samie, Eric and me to come to his place and meditate. Samie and Eric were his good friends.</p>
<p>One evening, we were all meditating at his place. It was on the occasion of his Guru’s birthday. He said his Guru liked to meditate in darkness and so there was no proper light. His apartment was all dark. All of a sudden, with my third eye, I saw a middle-aged lady standing behind Arthur and blessing him while he was meditating. She was blessing him with so much affection. She was very short and thin. The lady told me that she was Arthur’s spiritual mother.</p>
<p>When the meditation was over, I said to Arthur, “I saw something! Somebody was standing behind you and blessing you. She said she is your spiritual mother. I can even tell you her name! Her name is Nirupama. You never, never told me that your Guru was married!”</p>
<p>I told Arthur the name of the lady and it was absolutely correct. It was his Guru’s wife. He was so astonished. He asked me, “How do you know this?” My friends were also asking me the same question. Their admiration for me went very high because I showed this kind of magic.</p>
<p>After that Arthur started giving me very nice jackets. He was also a poet. He had printed two or three books and once he read out his poems at the Guggenheim Museum. He was so nice to me.</p>
<p>Arthur Gregor was very closely connected with the Indian Ambassador to the UN, Rikhi Jaipal. When I drew the painting dedicated to UNICEF in 1979, Ambassador Jaipal presented it with utmost respect on behalf of the Government of India. It was his wife, Sushila, whom I saw in the sailing boat.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Reading out my poems in a fancy restaurant</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Reading out my poems in a fancy restaurant" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day an old Russian gentleman came to the Consulate and asked if we knew of any Indian poets. He happened to be a poet and he wanted to discuss literary subjects. My colleagues knew that I wrote poems and so they introduced him to me. We became friends.</p>
<p>The gentleman’s name was Mr. Gruber. Once he invited me to read out my poems at a restaurant in Manhattan. The name of the restaurant was Cavanti. The restaurant was very fancy but the patrons were behaving in a very undivine way. They were drinking and drinking. While they were drinking, we were supposed to read out our poems.</p>
<p>Mr. Gruber read out several of his poems and then he told me to stand up and read something. I read out two or three of my poems and then I said, “I am leaving this place! I am not going to stay.”</p>
<p>That was my first and last experience reading out in a restaurant. It was so noisy! Sometimes two or three poets stood up at once. They were ready to read out their poems at the same time.</p>

<p>The following day, a lady invited the two of us to come to her place in the evening to hear her poems. She was a very nice lady, very compassionate, but I did not want to go. I did not want to go where people would be drinking and smoking.</p>
<p>So Mr. Gruber telephoned the lady and asked her, “Will there be drinking or smoking during the reading?”</p>
<p>The lady said that drinking and smoking would not be allowed and so we decided to go. The lady read out eight or ten of her own poems She was very aristocratic and I enjoyed listening to her poems.</p>
<p>Then she requested me to read out some of my poems. But on this occasion, I deliberately did not bring any of my writings. I did not want to risk another unfortunate experience.</p>

<p>“My father?” he said, “Hitler was so compassionate to my father. He took care of my father.”</p>
<p>In this way I came to learn that his father had been killed in the war.</p>

<p><em>Bholanath: One time Guru lost a tooth. It was a lateral tooth in his upper jaw. I was training to be a dental technician, so I said that I would try to make him a new tooth if we could get an impression. I took Guru to a dentist to get an impression, but this dentist did not want to do it. According to him our procedure was not strictly correct. Anyway, I took Guru to the apartment of another friend of mine who made the impression, and then I set about making the tooth. I had never made a tooth before and quite a few people helped me and gave advice. Eventually Guru was fitted with this tooth.</em></p>

<p>The first printer that I used in America was named Mr. Custer. He was Jewish and his shop was on New Utrecht Avenue, just opposite the apartment building where I lived. He was the one who printed the very first issue of AUM Magazine in 1965. After that he printed many, many issues.</p>
<p>Both of us were under the impression that the other one was deaf. How we used to shout and scream at each other at the top of our voice! We were not arguing, but we felt that if we did not scream at each other while standing face to face, then we could not hear each other. We always used to discuss politics. I used to speak in favour of America. He used to speak in favour of China. He was Jewish, but he was so fond of China. What wonderful arguments we had! But, we liked each other so much. We were such good friends. He was always very, very nice to me.</p>
<p>After practically sixteen years, he came to one of my concerts in Manhattan. After the concert, he came up to me. I looked at him, and he looked at me. Finally, I said, “Are you Mr. Custer?”</p>
<p>He said, “Are you Mr. Ghose? Are you Chinmoy? What shall I call you now? Shall I call you Ghose or Chinmoy?”</p>
<p>I said, “No, now my name is Sri Chinmoy. Have you forgotten?”</p>
<p>Then he started saying that he knew one day I would be great.</p>

<p>Four or five years ago, Sanatan was in that part of Brooklyn looking for something and he happened to go into that printing shop. A young man was working there. He was Mr. Custer’s son. When Sanatan told him my name, he said, “I remember him.”</p>
<p>Sanatan came back and told me that he had found my first printer. I could not believe it. After so many years! Sanatan took me there to see the place. It was exactly the same, and across the street the flower shop was still there.</p>
<p>I went inside the printing shop and immediately the son recognised me. His father had by that time passed away. I said to the son, “Now that I have seen you, I want to print one of my books here.”</p>
<p>He said, “Yes, of course. I know how much my father loved you. I will do the job at a very cheap price.”</p>
<p>I said, “Ask any price. I remember your father so well. He had such affection for me.”</p>
<p>So he printed one book.</p>

<p>In those days, elderly women were so kind to me. One old lady from the Bronx became my grandmother. She wanted to go to India. She came to apply for her visa and saw me there. Then she came to the Consulate many times. She used to bring yoghurt for me to eat. Once or twice she scolded me for not eating her food. She was short, but she used to grab me by the shoulder when she came to see me. She took me to the Bronx two or three times to eat her food. At that time she was around seventy years of age. She used to eat meat, fish and all that. I said, “I cannot eat these things.” So she always kept some yoghurt for me.</p>
<p>Afterwards, what happened to her? Where did she go? She went out of my life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Going to Viet Nam</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Going to Viet Nam" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I came out of the subway on my way to the Consulate, a half a block away there was a huge tree. Every day I used to stop at that tree and pray for two minutes. In my prayer, I used to go all the way to Viet Nam to protect a young boy who was the son of one of my disciples. I had given her the name Durga. Her original name was Irene Silver.</p>
<p>One day Durga had come to me crying. She said, “My son Neil has gone to Viet Nam and I am not getting any letter from him. I am so worried. Every day soldiers are being killed.”</p>
<p>I consoled her and said, “Do not worry. I am sure he is safe.” She thought that I was offering her ordinary human consolation. But every day I used to meditate and pray to the Supreme to send His Protection to Viet Nam.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the mother did not believe me because she did not receive any letter from her son. I told her that the government would have informed her if her son had died. Finally I said, “All right, you will get a letter.”</p>
<p>One evening in Viet Nam, her son was sitting in a chair, quite relaxed. All of a sudden, somebody appeared before him. I said to him, “Your mother is worrying. Please write a letter to her. I am your mother’s spiritual Master.”</p>
<p>Not long afterwards, his mother received a letter from him. He wrote, “Mother, an Indian gentleman came up to me and said he is your spiritual Master. He looked at me and asked me to write you a letter and tell you not to worry.”</p>
<p>She showed me the letter when she came to the Centre. Can you believe it? Where is New York and where is Viet Nam? For eight or nine months I used to lean against that particular tree and pray before I went to work. And God did listen to my prayers. Her son came back from Viet Nam perfectly all right.</p>
<p>One day Durga invited me to her apartment to meet her son. I went with X. This boy did not care for spirituality, so he stayed upstairs. She was begging him to come down, but he did not want to. Finally, he condescended to come down.</p>
<p>As soon as he saw me, he was so startled because he recognised that I was the Indian man he had seen in Viet Nam. I also looked at him for two or three minutes. Then I said, “Ah, you are German. I can see you are German.” Suddenly he grabbed my hand and took me upstairs to his room. His room was flooded with German souvenirs and pictures of great German leaders. In his last incarnation he had been German.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these experiences never change anybody’s nature. Nature changes only through prayer and meditation. Some years later I heard that this same young man was in jail in California for beating up his girlfriend.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My fleeting smile</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My fleeting smile" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I lived on 84th Street in Manhattan, the landlady became my disciple. One day she begged me to give a short interview to a friend of hers. The interview had not been arranged beforehand. She phoned me up and said, “On your way to the Consulate, come and speak to my friend for a few minutes.”</p>
<p>I was already running late, so I said that in the evening I could give this man an interview. But he told my landlady that he just wanted to shake hands with me.</p>
<p>I lived on the fourth floor. In those days I used to go upstairs running and come downstairs running. As usual, I came running down from the fourth floor and I passed by my landlady’s apartment. Her friend was there and I smiled at him. It was a matter of two seconds. Then I continued running out of the building because I was already so late for work.</p>
<p>In the evening, when I came back, I asked my landlady if her friend was waiting for me. She said, “No, your smile was enough. His problem was solved. He left ten dollars for you.”</p>
<p>My smile took away all his suffering.</p>
