<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day try to feel that inside your heart there is a very beautiful garden. It is your own garden, nobody else's. If you have a garden, then you will definitely want to increase the beauty, purity and divinity of that garden. If you have two plants, then you will try to find another plant from somewhere else. How? In the material world it would be on the strength of your money-power. But here in your heart-garden, it is on the strength of your concern, love, feeling of oneness and utmost humility. Here, another plant means another seeker. You have to say to each new seeker-plant, "I will serve you, I will serve the Supreme inside you."</p>
<p>Very often we are not getting others to join the spiritual life for one particular reason: we feel that we know too much. We feel that we have so much light to give them. That feeling is the downfall of our life. You know better than that person, true. But if you want to be a better spiritual seeker, if you want to make real progress, then you have to bring forward more humility. Otherwise, if you think that you have made all the progress that you need to make and now you can teach the whole world, then you are making a mistake.</p>
<p>If we can sincerely feel that God is giving us the supreme opportunity to serve Him inside each seeker, that is the best approach. We should be eager to serve God inside others, but so often we forget our purpose. We feel that since we have been following the spiritual path for so many years, that since we have read so many books, we know everything. But we know nothing.</p>
<p>If we take a humble approach, we will say, "The Supreme has given me the golden opportunity to serve Him inside others." If you approach others with humility, then it becomes very easy. If you go and touch somebody's feet with humility, then he will have some compassion for you. He will ask, "What do you need from me?"</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people are born in a particular country who do not have any connection with that country. They come out of curiosity, as a complete stranger. It is like travelling to some other country out of curiosity to see what it looks like. But some people come to a particular country to elevate the consciousness of that country or to do something really great and good for the country. They come because of their previous connection with the country. Again, the Supreme may send them directly to do something great for the development of that country.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes when we are working on manifestation, I have an idea which feels inwardly totally right to me and somebody else says it is not so good. Then I feel insecure and I do not want to hurt the other person.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes when we are working on manifestation, I have an idea which feels inwardly totally right to me and somebody else says it is not so good. Then I feel insecure and I do not want to hurt the other person." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Suppose you have a sister who is not praying and meditating. She is leading an ordinary, unaspiring life. You are awakened; you have entered into the spiritual life and you are praying to God for light, peace and bliss. Just because your sister is not aspiring or she is not doing the right thing, will you give up doing the right thing? Will you say, "How can I drink divine Nectar when my sister is eating mud, clay and sand?" Of course not. You will continue doing the right thing and one day you will try to inspire her to also enter into the spiritual life.</p>
<p>In your case, you are the Centre leader. If you are absolutely sure that you have the right plan, then whom are you hurting? You are not hurting the person, you are only increasing your own ignorance if you do the wrong thing. Again, you have to know whether it is your ego that is speaking or not. Your ego may tell you, "I am the Centre leader. Therefore, my idea has to be the right one." If this is the case, just discard your ego. But if your sincere awakening is telling you that your idea is absolutely right, then if you do not do the right thing because it may hurt someone, you are only feeding your ignorance. You have to see if you are dealing with your ego or whether you are fully conscious of your inner feeling of the right thing to do.</p>
<p>This applies to anyone, not only to the Centre leaders. If you have the inner conviction that you are doing the right thing, then who becomes the loser if you do not do it? If you receive the light, but you do not use the light properly, if you hesitate, then not only you, but the whole Centre becomes the loser.</p>

Should different emotions only be expressed inwardly to you or to the Supreme?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If they are good feelings, it is always best to express them inwardly. Otherwise, there is no end to outer expression. All kinds of sweet feelings, good feelings, it is always better to express inwardly, with utmost devotion, to the Supreme. When you try to express them outwardly, when you take the help of language and try to write them down, immediately the mind tries to come forward. The mind tries to decorate the experience with some words. The heart is simpler than the simplest, but the mind will try to use bombastic words, thinking that it will be able to convince the Supreme of your love, devotion and surrender. When you start writing, instead of giving a flower, the mind will try to bring the garden itself. Do I need the garden or do I need the most beautiful rose?</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not receive it; the Supreme receives everything. When you inwardly offer your good feelings or your bad feelings, they go to Him. Whenever any disciple does anything good or bad, it goes to the Supreme in me. If it is something really important, my inner beings will definitely tell me. Otherwise, the Supreme Himself will tell me. Anything that is of real inner value, spiritual value, will never be kept hidden from me. But sometimes what our mind thinks is something very significant, most important, the Supreme does not take as significant at all. These things I do not have to know. But anything that is significant in the Eye of the Supreme will always be known by me or by my inner beings.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If they come back, that means you have not offered them to the Supreme with utmost devotion, sincerity, intensity and faithfulness. If you are offering your bad qualities with only one or two of your good qualities, then that bad quality comes back again and again. If you offer your bad qualities with <em>all</em> your good qualities, then they do not come back.</p>

<h2>Question: How can we work more harmoniously in enterprises or in manifestation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To keep harmony when you are dealing with other individuals, do not use your justice-light. Forget about justice! There is no justice on earth. Only think of wisdom-light. Always be as humble as possible. Even if you feel that others are idiots, use absolute humility — if necessary, forced humility. Force yourself to be at the other person's feet, not on the other person's head. Let them increase their stupidity. Let their ego-balloon become large, larger and largest. One day it will burst. True, by becoming humble, you are pumping them up. But at least you are not increasing the disharmony. It is not something that you have to do all your life. For one or two months or a few years you will do it. Then you will see that eventually his ego-balloon will burst and he will be on the same level as you are. Otherwise, without humility, there is no way we can have harmony.</p>
