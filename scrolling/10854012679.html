<h2>Question: It seems the Christ never meditated but all of a sudden became very high. Is this true?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. The Christ definitely meditated. What do we know about the past? The Christ stayed on earth for thirty-three years and even so there is a gap of about ten or twelve years where history does not know what he did. During this time he was in India and other places, and he definitely meditated.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the broadest sense, the Christ was undoubtedly a poet, a painter and an athlete. He was a poet, for his utterances are all poetic, visionary and revolutionary. Each of the Christ's works is a seer-vision of the Father Supreme. He was also a painter. His mother was a painter, whether the world believes it or not; she was an excellent painter. She painted as we ordinary painters do. But the Christ was a divine painter. He painted the suffering of human life and the delight of the divine life, in and through his own life.</p>
<p>He was an athlete. He ran the fastest in thirty-three years. In the short span of his life, he completed his course according to the Vision-Dispensation of His Father Supreme. Again, he was a supreme athlete. He braved the buffets of human life and offered his oneness to the suffering and aspiring mankind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are some sincere Gurus and some insincere Gurus. The sincere Gurus have been inwardly commanded and guided by God to come and serve Him in the West. But the insincere ones have come to the West to show off and make money so they can go back to India and lead a most comfortable life. So deception is there.</p>
<p>Insincere Masters say, "Give me thousands of dollars and I will give you realisation." You give them the money and they leave with it. Then where is your realisation? If God-realisation could be achieved by money, then all rich men would immediately realise God. Just for a bundle of dollars, you could get your realisation! But it is not like that. For God-realisation you must cry and cry and cry. Insincere Gurus exploit you and tell you that they will be able to give you God-realisation overnight. They say that they have made it very easy. But is it possible? It takes us twenty years to get our Master's degree, just for ordinary knowledge. And for God-realisation, which is infinitely more difficult, it takes far longer.</p>

Is it true that this Yoga can hasten the evolution of a positive mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not only that Yoga, but many Yogas can expedite spiritual evolution. Our Yoga, which embodies love, devotion and surrender, we call the sunlit path. On the strength of my own highest realisation, I can say that this Yoga leads the aspirant towards the goal faster than any other. I have not followed all the other Yogas but I know them on the strength of my realisation. When one is realised, one can see how many years or how many centuries others took in order to come to Self-realisation. I feel that our path, which is the path of absolute surrender, is the quickest. To be very frank with you, there is no other Yoga which is as simple and, at the same time, as profound as the Yoga of surrender. In this Yoga the finite loses its own existence and immediately becomes one with the Infinite. This is not the surrender of a beggar to a king. In true surrender the finite feels that it has the capacity and potentiality to enter into the Highest, which is its very own.</p>
<p>Since you are my disciples and you are in my boat, please read my writings as much as possible and study and live our Yoga. In that way you will not be confused and you will not enter into any kind of competition with other paths.</p>
<p>I have read the book <em>Autobiography of a Yogi</em> by Paramahansa Yogananda. I know him very, very well. In the spiritual world I know his Master, and his Master's Master and his Master, Babaji. But I wish to tell you that <em>Kriya Yoga</em> is not meant for you since you have accepted our Yoga. If you know thoroughly what I represent here on earth and what my teachings are, your progress will be the swiftest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Kali is one of the four aspects of the Supreme Mother. She is the Mother of power, the Mother of compassion and the Mother of speed. She wants her devotees to run the fastest. Those who want to please her should be extremely sincere, because on the one hand she is compassionate, but on the other hand she is very strict. Other Mother aspects of the Supreme, like Mahalakshmi, are also compassionate; but they do not care for the same kind of speed. Mother Kali wants the fastest speed. She will not tolerate anything impure or undivine. She wants her devotees to be totally pure immediately. One has to be extremely pure, sincere and heroic in order to be her chosen instrument. She is not for the weak; she is only for the strong. She cares only for the strong who are ready to fight against ignorance.</p>
<p>Very often when we see Kali on the vital plane, we are disturbed or frightened. She is killing many undivine forces, so she looks serious and ferocious. But on the inner plane she is full of compassion. On the outer plane she may look dark or black, but on the inner plane she is a very beautiful, golden colour.</p>
<p>In India each family has a presiding deity. Mother Kali happens to be my family's deity, so she has special blessings for my entire family. There are also many other families who have Kali as their presiding deity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Kali is showing her power aspect so that unaspiring humanity will not wallow in the pleasures of ignorance. On the physical, vital, and mental plane she shows her supreme power, for there is no other way for human ignorance to open to light. Her power itself is compassion, but also she has to inject fear. Otherwise, the ignorance of humanity will never come forward for illumination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Mother Kali is the consort of Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva is the silent aspect of the Transcendental Reality, and Mother Kali is the dynamic aspect of the Transcendental Reality. Truth is complete when it is both dynamic and silent. Truth is complete when the dynamic aspect and the silent aspect function together.</p>
<p>In the Upanishads it says: "That is far and at the same time, that is near. That moves and that moves not. That is within and that is without. It moves and it moves not." When Kali is performing her role, reality is moving. When Shiva is performing, reality is silent. When they perform together, that moves and that moves not. With our human consciousness, when we try to see the Truth, it is far, very far. But with our divine consciousness, when we try to see the Truth, it is all near; it is right in front of our nose.</p>
<p>"That is within and that is without." These conflicting terms cease when our inner consciousness is fully awakened. If something is within, then that very thing also has to be without. If there is a seed, then there will be a tree. If there is a tree, there also is a seed. If the Truth is already there within, then the Truth has to be manifested sooner or later outside.</p>
<p>Mother Kali is the dynamic aspect of the Transcendental Truth and Lord Shiva is the silent aspect of the highest Transcendental Truth. They fulfil the highest Supreme together, like the obverse and the reverse of the same coin. Shiva is silent and Kali is active and dynamic. If we see with our ordinary human eyes, then we say that they are separate. But with our inner eye if we see them, we see that they are together.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Agni is fire. Fire is aspiration. In Indian scriptures we have four Vedas and the Rig Veda is the most important. The first word of the Rig Veda is "Agni." So Agni is the fire-god or the god of aspiration. Without aspiration, you cannot make progress. Agni is the most important god for seekers. But when you aspire you do not necessarily have to worship the cosmic god Agni. Just aspire.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part III: Prayer and mandalas</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part III: Prayer and mandalas" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What is the relative importance of prayer?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For a genuine seeker who wants Peace, Light, Bliss and divine Power in infinite measure, prayer can never be as important as meditation. When we pray, most of the time we have the feeling of begging. "Oh God, give me this; do this for me." Automatically we feel that we are beggars and that somebody else will offer us his boons. A beggar goes and knocks at the door of anyone; whether he is a rich man or a poor man, he doesn't care. He just knocks and knocks in order to get the money. So when we pray, we are like beggars. We pray to God this side, that side, looking up, looking down and whatever. We don't know from which quarter or from which level God is going to fulfil our desires. We look up and cry, "God, give me, give me, give me!" There is a yawning gulf between His existence and our existence.</p>
<p>If we go deep within, we will see that it is a subtle or gross desire that prompts us to pray. It is for one drop, two drops or three drops of Compassion or Light or Peace that we are praying. Unfortunately, when we pray our whole attention is focused on a particular object or desire, and we feel that if we achieve the particular thing that we are crying for, then it is enough. So if prayer is fulfilled, then prayer stops. Through prayer, we hope that God will give us what we want, and then when God gives, when our prayer is answered, at that time we stop praying. For a few months or a few years we stop praying until desire again prompts us. Then again we pray.</p>
<p>But meditation is different. In meditation, we will stay at a particular divine region where we can all the time feel the expansion of our consciousness. The more we can feel the expansion of our consciousness, the clearer it becomes that Peace, Light and Bliss are growing inside our meditation. Meditation itself becomes the fertile soil where the bumper crop of Peace, Light and Bliss can grow. As there is no end to our aspiration, so also there is no end to our meditation. Here we are dealing with Eternity, Infinity and Immortality; so our progress is constant and, at the same time, unending.</p>
<p>When we meditate, we are in the sea of tranquility. At that time there is no one to pray to and God feels our need more than we can imagine. Always He is there; only we have to receive Him. When we meditate, God feels the need to fulfil Himself in and through us. So in the true spiritual life, there is no comparison between prayer and meditation. There are times when we will pray, but if we are a real seeker, if we really want to go to the ultimate Goal, then for most of us meditation is the highest rung in the ladder of spiritual evolution. Again, if we pray for the fulfilment God's Will, if we pray for His divine Victory in and through our lives, then this kind of prayer is very high, very powerful. Many of the great spiritual giants of the West realised God through this kind of prayer.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am not totally against the use of japa beads, but I am not too much in favour of them either. If some of you want to wear japa beads, it is my most sincere request that you keep them inside your shirt. Otherwise, this can create a wrong vibration within the Centre. Please do not display them. If you want to use them at all, please do so at home when you meditate. You can keep them in your room on your shrine.</p>
<p>I wish to tell you that japa is not necessary for our path. But if you wish to do japa, then please do it slowly and soulfully. The difficulty with japa is that while you are doing it, you pay all attention to the number. If you have decided to repeat "Supreme" a few hundred times, then you only count one, two, three and see when you can finish. So there is no value in it, no progress, nothing. In India and in America I have seen many, many people doing japa. Most of the time they go on like an express train: "Supreme," "Supreme," like they are fighting against time. But if you want to repeat the name of the Supreme most soulfully, then it will definitely increase your capacity for concentration, and deep, soulful meditation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your spiritual name is Savita. If you chant "Savita," you have to immediately think of your connection with the sun goddess, the creative source. Think of the creation; then think of the sun's rays. It is not actually thinking; it is imagination. Just try to bring forward in your mind's eye the idea that it is dawn and the sun is appearing. Imagine that you see the golden rays of the sun. Then put all the qualities right in front of you and develop them with your imagination.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Through meditation are you able to master or create any psychic powers?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Through meditation are you able to master or create any psychic powers?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, through meditation one can get psychic power. One is bound to get psychic power through meditation. But if you get psychic power, it may take you away from the spiritual life. Sometimes people get psychic power and then they don't want to pray anymore; they want to go help people. Then the ignorance of the people they try to help captures them and they go away from the spiritual path. So it is very dangerous. But after one realises God, then it is safe to start using psychic powers.</p>
<p>Psychic power does not necessarily help one in realising God. You can take psychic powers as beautiful trees, plants or fruits that you encounter during your spiritual journey. Somebody may walk along another road where there are no trees, no flowers, nothing to tempt him. When one gets psychic power, there is every possibility of being tempted by these powers. They will very often take the sincere seekers away from the goal. So it is better not to pay any attention to the psychic powers. Only pay attention to your inner cry, your aspiration. When it is time, God Himself will give you all the psychic powers. But right now what He wants you to do and what He wants all the seekers to do is to realise Him.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Guru, you said that from our meditation we have to face the outer world with the correct attitude. What sort of attitude is that?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You should always have the attitude of a divine hero. A divine hero is not an ordinary soldier who will strike and kill. No, he is a spiritual soldier who will fight for the divine manifestation here on earth, who will act for the sake of the Divine, the Supreme. If you are scared to death when a problem arises, then you cannot be a chosen instrument of the Divine, of the Supreme. Life has to be accepted. This acceptance does not mean mere enjoyment. No, acceptance has particular spiritual significance. There is a kind of meditation that feels that the world is unreal and barren. But I wish to say no, the world is most fertile. The world is not a dream; it is not a chimerical mist. This world of ours is the reality, but this reality is not yet manifested fully. It is our meditation, our inner life, our aspiration, that can hasten the process of divine manifestation in the form of reality. This world embodies divinity, but we deny even this simple truth. What we have to do first is to feel the embodiment of the ultimate Truth in this world of ours, and then to reveal and manifest that ultimate Truth with our dynamic meditation, conscious aspiration and sincere dedication.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If I pray for my own salvation, does that mean that I am ignoring the salvation of humanity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If I pray for my own salvation, does that mean that I am ignoring the salvation of humanity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you pray to God, how can you be indifferent? You may say that you are looking only for your own salvation and not caring about others. But I tell you, the very fact that you are looking for your own salvation means that others will be saved. The day you realise God, you will be doing a great favour for Mother Earth, for one less person will be caught by ignorance.</p>
<p>Vivekananda used to say that if one person stood on top of the Himalayas and offered his good will to God, then he was also offering his highest to humanity. You are a representative of Mother Earth. As others have imperfections, you also have imperfections. But you are trying to reach the most Beautiful, the Highest, the Absolute. While you are meditating, while your highest and most purified will is trying to reach the Highest, on the outer plane you might not be looking from side to side to this fellow or that fellow, but on the inner plane you are one with them. You will see that the day you get illumination, there will be others who will also get some of your illumination. Others will come to you precisely because you have got illumination. If you become good, if you achieve some peace or light, then there is one less person who is in ignorance. Then, when others observe you, they are so surprised. At one moment you look so ordinary, just like them; but the next moment they see something in your face.</p>
<p>So if you have got some love for God and pray to God, don't think that you are caring only for yourself. You are caring for yourself, but you are also caring for God. First you realise God, but that is not the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>When you realise God and see His Kindness, his Affection, His Love, His Compassion, then your realisation will immediately be followed by manifestation. Automatically the concern you have for your own manifestation also becomes your concern for mankind.</p>
<p>So, if anybody thinks that if he is praying to God, then he is not caring for other people, then he is mistaken. If he is praying to God, he is automatically spreading his inner consciousness, like a bird spreading its wings. If you go to the foot of the tree, you will see that God is the root. If you water the tree, then the creation-tree will grow the way the divine Law wants it to. So, the concern you show for the root of the tree, for God, will feed all the branches which will survive and live according to God's Perfection.</p>
