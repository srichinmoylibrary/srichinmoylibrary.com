  <h2 id="page-title">The accident</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The accident" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Around 3:20 this morning I was running on Main Street, coming back from Flushing Meadow Park. Suddenly I saw a blue car and a beige car have an accident. It was only fifty or sixty metres away from me. In the blue car were a black man and a white man, and in the beige car was a white man. Both the cars were badly damaged, but strangely enough, nobody was injured.</p>
<p>The two men in the blue car came out and started finding fault with the white man. Only one word which they used was civilised: 'stupid'. The rest were beyond my vocabulary. Such a foul tongue they had.</p>
<p>The white man said that his daughter was in the hospital, so he did not know what he was doing. The others said, "Before your daughter dies, do you want us to die?" and all kinds of rubbish things.</p>
<p>For ten minutes it went on. I was sympathising with the man from the beige car, because of his daughter, and I was also sympathising with the other two because their car was badly damaged. Fortunately, I was quite safe because I was sixty metres away.</p>
<p>I was thinking how they could not get along with one or two in a car, and now you have to have three persons in the car during the transit strike. Let us see what happens.</p>

<p>This morning, around five o'clock, I was running near the corner of our street. Somebody drove up to the corner, stopped and started honking. I knew that he wanted someone to come out of the building, so I paid no attention to him. I was running and running, practising short stride and long stride.</p>
<p>At one point he came out of the car. He was a very nice black gentleman. Finally I saw a lady come out of the building. He was telling me he would like me to teach his son how to run.</p>
<p>I was smiling and laughing, and telling him that I am the wrong person to teach his son.</p>
<p>He said, "No, your stride is pretty good."</p>
<p>Occasionally I take long strides and fool people.</p>

<p>This morning I was running up 150th Street, doing hill work. All of a sudden, a nice young man who had been running up the hill behind me started running with me. When I started walking, he started walking. When I began taking measurements with my feet, he began taking measurements with his feet. Then I did speed work, and he also did speed work.</p>
<p>This was going on, going on; he was doing everything that I was doing. I thought, "What kind of crazy fellow is he?"</p>
<p>One of my disciples spoke to him afterwards, and the man asked him when I was going to have the next public meditation. That means he was not a madman after all.</p>

<p>A young man ran nearby very fast and screamed, "Sri Chinmoy, Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>I did not recognise him and my road crew did not recognise him. But since the man recognised me, that means I am greater than he is.</p>

<p>I started running in the Long Island Marathon at seventeen and a half miles. I was feeling sad and miserable because I had so much energy. People around me were so tired, and I felt so guilty because I was deceiving those people. There was a small hill, and I was going up so easily, because I had just started.Everybody else was dying. Of course, they did not know that I was only running a few miles with some of my disciples to inspire them.</p>

<p>I wanted to run with Shephali and Amy. For two miles, I kept coming up behind them. At least eighteen times I did it, but I always remained two steps behind. They didn't see me at all. Like that, it went on. They were so blind! Sometimes they took water and poured it over their heads, and I was only two metres behind them. But still they didn't see me!</p>
<p>So many times I went five metres ahead of them and turned around. Shephali came, but Amy did not come. After twenty-three or twenty-four miles, one was on my right side and the other was on my left side. Then I saw that Jane was helping them, so I knew they were all right.</p>
<p>You should have seen Shephali's face — it showed so much pain!</p>

<p>At one point during the Long Island Marathon, I was walking towards the runners for about half a mile. They were yelling, "Hey, Sri Chinmoy!" and "Sri" and "Master." It went on like this and didn't stop for the entire half a mile.</p>
<p>Then, three strong black men stopped running and captured me. One put his arm around my head. He was perspiring like anything. The other said, "How are you doing, Sri Chinmoy?" They said that they never saw me, so now they were getting a chance to see me.</p>

<p>A husband and wife were watching. The husband said, "Look! Sri Chinmoy and his T-shirt."</p>
<p>The wife looked at Shephali, who was wearing our Centre T-shirt, and at me, and asked, "Which one is Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>Shephali and I were very near them at the time, but Shephali didn't hear.</p>
