<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is true. Millions of people can defeat me in running, but I wonder if millions of people will defeat me in weightlifting, specially among those of my age. If I invite Americans over 60 who live in this vicinity, even from Briarwood, to lift 100 pounds with each arm, I do not think there will be anybody to come forward and do it. Nobody will lift 100 pounds with each arm, and for me 100 pounds is easy. Here I am doing something which is quite extraordinary for my age. Again, there are some things I have done that are considered extraordinary irrespective of age. Last year at my weightlifting anniversary and also the year before, Mahasamrat Bill Pearl was saying to forget about my age. He was asking people of any age to come up and try to do it. He and a few others, like Jim Smith, Mike Katz and so on, have done weightlifting and bodybuilding all their lives. They know how difficult it is. In this weightlifting field I have done something unique, not only in terms of age, but also by showing my capacity in various types of lifts — the double-arm lift, the standing calf raise, the elephant lift and so on.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not feel strong. I entirely depend upon the Grace of God. I am happy when I am able to walk. If I can walk nicely, I get tremendous joy. Otherwise, every second I am limping, limping.</p>
<p>It is my spirituality that is helping me in my weightlifting, and it is also helping others who are appreciating what I am doing. In ordinary life, people look at magazines and see bodybuilders, weightlifters and so on. As soon as people see the body development, they get joy. But when they hear about some of the activities of that person in the outer life — whether that individual uses drugs or takes bribes, this and that — their joy immediately goes away. In most cases, spirituality is not in the background of those who are competing.</p>
<p>In my case, when people see my muscle-power, they know that I have not taken any drugs. I do not have big, bulging muscles. Or you can say, my meditation is my drug. A number of people in this field take drugs. They have to adopt foul means in order to win. These foul means are so dangerous. After fifteen or twenty years, they may develop some disease.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Student: Which group of athletes has the better consciousness — bodybuilders or runners?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Student:&lt;/em&gt; Which group of athletes has the better consciousness — bodybuilders or runners?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For me, runners in general have a better consciousness. Many, many runners do not take drugs. There are some runners who do take drugs, true, but there are so many ordinary runners who do not take anything. They know they are not going to be another Frank Shorter or Bill Rodgers, so they do not take drugs. Once they start doing well, they may start, who knows. But in the case of bodybuilders, even ordinary bodybuilders when they start want to become another Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bill Pearl. So right from the beginning they start taking drugs.</p>
<p>Runners deal with freshness, freshness of the mind. While they are running, nature is helping them. Every day, early in the morning or in the evening, runners go out to practise in the street or at a track. When you run, it is just you and Mother Nature. From the sky, light is flowing. Here, there, you get so much inspiration. Everything helps you to achieve your goal.</p>
<p>But with bodybuilding, it is a different matter. First, the bodybuilders may be depending on a drug that they are taking secretly. Then, when they go to a gym to train, they have to deal with the vibration there. When you are running, it is you and your shoes. They are your property, so it is your own vibration they are carrying. You do not have to worry. But, unfortunately, people do not realise that when they go to a gym they take on the karma of others who are using the machines. If the person using a particular machine before you is an impossible, unbearable character, where will the vibration go? Do you think that while he is touching the material object, his vibration does not enter into the metal plates, the bar and so on? It does, it does. Then that same vibration enters into you. When you came to the gym, you were filled with good thoughts, uplifting thoughts. Then, on your way back home, you wonder why all kinds of undivine thoughts are attacking you. Why, why? Where did they come from? It all came from the gym.</p>
<p>That is why I feel that training outside is far better than indoor training. If the weather is very bad, what can you do? But for me, indoor training is the second choice.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Student: For people who do not like running or have some kind of injury, is it better to work out with weights than not to do anything?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Student:&lt;/em&gt; For people who do not like running or have some kind of injury, is it better to work out with weights than not to do anything?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly! It is very important to do something. Perhaps you are unable to walk or run. But what is wrong with your lungs or your arms? There are bound to be some other parts of your body that are still functioning well. So you can develop those parts. You may be limited by your injury, but in that limited world you can do something.</p>
<p>Look at the wheelchair athletes who do the New York City Marathon. I get such joy when I see them. I have such pride in them. In spite of their limitations, they are going on for twenty-six miles. Each metre is such hardship for them. Although their capacity is very limited, they are giving joy to themselves and to the spectators. They are challenging impossibility.</p>
<p>When you run, it is just you and your own body, but when you are doing lifting, it is not just a question of you and your body. You are trying to increase your body strength, plus you are fighting against inconscient metal plates. You are not inconscient, but the plates are inconscient. There is no light there. You have to inject light into them by praying to God to help you lift up this heavy weight.</p>
<p>So there is a great difference between running and weightlifting. In running, whatever your standard is, good or bad, you know. But in weightlifting, you have to challenge something — these iron plates. You have to keep them under control.</p>
<p>Number-wise, there is a tremendous difference between those who practise running and those who practise weightlifting. If you go to a marathon, there may be 20,000 people. But if you go to any weightlifting or bodybuilding competition, there will not be 20,000 participants. So you can see people's love for running.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Student: A lot of runners do weightlifting to enhance their running, specially elite runners.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Student:&lt;/em&gt; A lot of runners do weightlifting to enhance their running, specially elite runners." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> True, but do they lift up 100-pound dumbbells?</p>
<p><em>Student:</em> They probably just train with lower weights to develop a certain degree of strength.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, this is something that athletes have done for the last fifteen years or so. It is a modern discovery. Before that, the theory was that if you had big muscles, your speed would go away. In my youth, I would not do weightlifting because I was afraid that my speed would decrease.</p>
<p>When I first saw one of our boys do the high jump, I was so shocked. In India I had never seen the style that he used. I first started with the scissor style, which is older than the oldest. Then I did eastern cut and western roll. But I had never before seen the flop. I could not believe that someone could go over the bar backwards.</p>
<p><em>Student:</em> You cannot do the flop with a sand pit or sawdust pit. You need a big foam mat. So there has been progress in the equipment also.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In those days the pole vault sandpit, the high jump sandpit and the long jump sandpit were all of the same level, only they were at different places on the sportsground. We did not have this kind of foam mattress. When I did the pole vault, I had to drop from Heaven onto the hard sand. Now, the way high jumpers land on their backs, if they used our old-fashioned sandpits, they would have to be carried to a hospital!</p>
<p>To come back to the point, as soon as we think of running, we imagine someone running towards the goal. When we think of a goal, speed spontaneously comes into our mind. Whenever we say the word 'goal’, our human mind immediately thinks of a journey, whether by boat or plane or car or even by walking. But weightlifting does not give us the feeling of a journey. True, our goal may be to increase the weight that we are lifting from 50 pounds to 100 pounds, but we are not going anywhere physically. With our mind we have created a certain goal, but the goal is inside. There is no forward movement.</p>
<p>When you are running, you are going forward towards your goal. You are starting at one point and your destination is somewhere else. But weightlifting does not give that image immediately. You are only increasing the weight. Your mind has created a goal, but you are at the same spot.</p>
<p>Life itself is a journey and that journey has a goal. We are running along Eternity's Road towards tomorrow's golden Sunrise.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I feel that bodybuilders give a better vibration than weightlifters when you look at them. In the case of bodybuilders, their mind is focusing on a more subtle subject. They may be lifting heavy weights, but still they can think of delicate things, things that are very subtle.</p>
<p>Weightlifters by nature are not like that. They are dealing with heavy, heavy weights. You can say it is gross matter. They just grab the weight. They do not care how they look.</p>
<p>Bodybuilders care so much for the perfection of the body. They may take drugs or they may not take drugs, but they take their body as their temple. They are concentrating all the time to make the body look nice, symmetrical and so on. Do weightlifters do this? As long as they can lift heavy weights, it is enough. Do they care how they look? Bodybuilders can deal with subtle reality if they want to, but most weightlifters will find it difficult.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, after weightlifting I can enter into my highest meditation. Even while I am weightlifting, I can do that. Once one reaches the Highest, at that time he can transform heaviness into lightness.</p>
<p>In the case of ordinary people, if something is heavy, it is heavy. If something is light, it is light. Their concept is fixed. In my case, it is not like that. Even when I am lifting heavy weights, my mind can deal with subtle things. In my inner world, I may be composing, I may be singing, I may be writing poems.</p>
<p>I am not the world's best musician, but I have come to a certain standard. At least ten instruments I play well. In the art-world, I have drawn so many beautiful birds. Similarly, thousands of poems I have written. These are delicate things. Again, I am the same person who is lifting very heavy weights. Even when I lift heavy weights, my consciousness is dealing with very light things.</p>
<p>Many years ago a journalist came to our meditation session at the United Nations to interview me for a weightlifting magazine. I was playing some musical instruments. When he saw my muscles, he left the auditorium! He could not believe that this fellow could lift up 200 pounds with one arm! So I cannot be compared with other weightlifters because my life is totally different. This moment I am meditating, next moment I can deal with gross matter. Let other weightlifters try to write a few poems, a few delicate lines, or play a few instruments. They will break the instruments before they touch them!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Student: Who will ultimately appreciate your feats more — weightlifters or bodybuilders?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Student:&lt;/em&gt; Who will ultimately appreciate your feats more — weightlifters or bodybuilders?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Bodybuilders know how difficult it is to lift heavy weights. Although their goal is not to lift very heavy weights, at the same time they know how much they struggle when they try to lift them.</p>
<p>Again, it is not a question of whether bodybuilders or weightlifters will appreciate these things more. It is only the heart of the person that matters. If a weightlifter has a good heart, he will appreciate them. We have to enter into each field with our heart. One person may be a singer, another may be a weightlifter. If the singer lives in his heart, he will appreciate the weightlifter also because he is shining in another field. Similarly, the weightlifter will appreciate the singer.</p>
<p>If we have a good heart, we will appreciate others. If we have a bad heart, we will criticise them or we will say, "If I had practised, I could have defeated that person. I could have become another Carl Lewis." With 'if' we challenge the achievements of others. We say, "If I had had the opportunity, I could have done the same." That is how we start blaming God right from the beginning. Why did God give the opportunity to Bill Rodgers to become the world's fastest marathoner? Why did God allow Sir Edmund Hillary to climb up Mount Everest? Ask God. Find fault with God. But I tell you, even if God had given us the opportunity, we would not have valued it.</p>
<p>So many people come into the family of a great musician and yet they do not play music. So many people come into the family of a great runner, but they are not running. They do not value what their parents are doing. You see so many cases where the parents are great in a particular field, but the children do not follow in the footsteps of their parents. Opportunity came their way, but they did not value it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Student: Instead of using aggressive qualities, if weightlifters try to use a divine approach, could weightlifting become a positive avenue for progress?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Student:&lt;/em&gt; Instead of using aggressive qualities, if weightlifters try to use a divine approach, could weightlifting become a positive avenue for progress?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly! Why only weightlifting? In any field, if divine methods, proper methods, are used, then one can make unimaginable progress.</p>
<p>In India many, many years ago, there was a great wrestler. He defeated all his opponents. One day he entered into the Ganges to take his bath. A sadhu happened to be swimming at that spot. The sadhu was very thin, almost emaciated, and he was wearing a loincloth. He was swimming to and fro and not bothering anybody.</p>
<p>The wrestler had a mischievous nature. He started splashing the sadhu with water and making fun of him. The sadhu had not done anything to annoy him, but the wrestler was just doing it to prove his superior physical strength.</p>
<p>The sadhu said to him, "Now stop!" Suddenly the wrestler could not move his hands at all, the way my cousin could not move her leg when I showed her my occult power. The wrestler's hands were raised out of the water because he was in the process of splashing the sadhu. He was stuck in that position, with his hands up — exactly the way people put their hands up when the police ask them to surrender. He literally had to surrender to the sadhu. In terms of physical strength, with two fingers he could have grabbed the sadhu and thrown him onto the bank of the river, but he was no match for the sadhu's occult and spiritual strength.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, the wrestler was able to move his arms again. He came out of the water, touched the feet of the sadhu and said, "I want to become your disciple." The sadhu accepted him and the wrestler began to lead a spiritual life. He surrendered to this thinner than the thinnest man and he made so much spiritual progress. By that time, the wrestler had many students and they all became the sadhu's disciples.</p>
<p>At the ashram where I grew up, one of my friends was the strongest wrestler. He could throw me into the air easily. One day he wanted me to show him my occult power. So I showed him five cents' worth of occult power from my third eye. He fell down on the ground. Then he ran to the head of the physical education department and began screaming, "That rascal wanted to kill me!"</p>
<p>The head asked, "How? Did he have a gun? Did he have a knife?"</p>
<p>"No," said my friend.</p>
<p>"Then how could he kill you?" asked the head. "You are such a strong fellow!"</p>
<p>"With his eyes!" replied my friend. Then everybody laughed and laughed at him.</p>
<p>That is how I lost a real friend and a great admirer. His name was Krishna. He was absolutely the strongest person in the Ashram. Nobody could come near him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Student: Guru, would you prefer to watch a bodybuilding contest or an Olympic weightlifting contest? Which one gives you more real joy?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Student:&lt;/em&gt; Guru, would you prefer to watch a bodybuilding contest or an Olympic weightlifting contest? Which one gives you more real joy?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I definitely prefer watching the bodybuilders because there is a kind of art inside. If I see Frank Zane's body, it is like watching a Greek god. There is so much art inside his body. When I look at him, I see a river flowing through him with so much life-energy, beauty, charm and strength. How sincerely I am admiring and admiring him! It is art. His whole body — the muscles and everything — is like artwork. He looks like an artist has made a beautiful sketch of a human being.</p>
<p>Bodybuilders give joy with their muscles. They may take all kinds of drugs, but they are so careful about how they look. Inside the bodybuilders you can see some charm, but inside the weightlifters I do not see any charm.</p>
<p>If there is a bodybuilding contest, I will stay there and watch, although I do not know which body is good. I am in no way an expert. I may like one person and the judges will give him zero. But I dislike weightlifting.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Do not look at the bodybuilders' muscles. Look at their face, specially at their eyes. Immediately they will give a divine vibration. Do not look at their stomachs or quadriceps or anything. Just look from the neck up, at their eyes and face. As soon as you look at their eyes, bodybuilders will give a good vibration. But if you look at the eyes of weightlifters, immediately you will get another vibration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Look at their good hearts! When I lift up heavy weights, so many people who are not in the weightlifting world appreciate it. They could have said that weightlifting is silly, but because of their good hearts they are saying such nice things. If you have a good heart, you will value everything that is good even if you do not do it yourself. Good-hearted people will appreciate everyone who is trying to offer something to the world. Unfortunately, many people feel that what they are doing is the most important thing and everything else is useless. Why should it be like that?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Student: Sometimes I think I should be stronger so that I can hand the heavy weights to you.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Student:&lt;/em&gt; Sometimes I think I should be stronger so that I can hand the heavy weights to you." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Then do it. Who is asking you not to be strong? I see that those who are bringing me weights are getting such a good workout, although they are not thinking of getting strong. People who help me are doing it lovingly and devotedly. Such patience they have! Sometimes they have to count five hundred lifts for each arm.</p>
<p>As a rule, I do not like it when two people lift a dumbbell together and hand it to me. It is like my famous story about pouring milk into the king's pond. One person will think, "If I do not put milk, no harm. Somebody else will put milk. Let me just add water." Then the next person says the same thing and so on until the pond is filled only with water. Similarly, one person is thinking, "If I am not concentrating wholeheartedly, the other fellow will do it." But the other fellow will think the same thing. Whereas, when you are doing it alone, you are fully responsible. Nowadays, when I am lying down, I use the automatic machine. Here I am safe. If I cannot lift the weight, it will not fall down and hurt me. I have done 120 pounds with each arm on the machine. Otherwise, I like to do 110 pounds with each arm on a regular basis.</p>
