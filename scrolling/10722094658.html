<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Light is the power of the Supreme that illumines and transforms ignorance. Light is the capacity of the Supreme that transforms darkness into illumination-light. Anything that transforms our existence is Light. Light, you can say, is the life-breath of the Supreme. Each colour of light has a special meaning. Blue Light is Infinity, vastness; white Light is purity. Green Light is freshness, life-energy, new life. Like that, each colour has a significance.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you see Light as energy, you are absolutely correct. Light has tremendous energising power. When Light is not actively operating, it is the silent truth, the silent Brahman. But when Light operates in the form of energy, as you say, then it is the dynamic truth, the dynamic Brahman.</p>
<p>When you meditate, Light is operating in and through you. The Light which you get during your meditation is not only for your use but for others' use as well. When you receive Light, if you feel that you can use it at your sweet will, this is the wrong attitude. God gives us Light and He uses this Light in and through us for others. It is true that sometimes we misuse Light. We misuse Light when we want to possess the world for our own sake. But if we want to accept the world for God's sake, then we will never misuse Light. If we really want to accept the world for God's use, then at that time we don't try to possess the world. Consciously we jump into the sea of silence and activity. God gives us the opportunity or God Himself acts as the opportunity in the form of Light so that we can enter into the wide world. At that time, we do not possess anything, we just exercise our feeling of oneness.</p>
<p>If you want to help humanity — or rather, serve the Supreme in humanity — then from now on please try to have the feeling of oneness. Oneness will make you feel that there is only one reality and that is the soul. Only the feeling of oneness can cure the ills of humanity. Unless you have the feeling of oneness, you can never use Light properly and God can never use His Light in and through you.</p>

I was wondering if the Light I see is real or imaginary." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If it is real Light, if it is pure, divine Light, then rest assured that your mind cannot doubt what you are seeing. The mind does not have the capacity to doubt divine Light while you are seeing it. If you are doubting it while seeing it, that means it is not the real Light that you are seeing. The effulgence of Light is such that it will not allow any mental suspicion or doubt to enter in. You cannot doubt while seeing Light if it is absolutely the purest Light of the divine Consciousness. When the real Light, divine Light, supreme Light appears, at that time the mind is obliterated; it does not function at all. The mind cannot exist when the divine Light comes. The entire being becomes all soul, all heart, all oneness.</p>
<p>The mind <em>does</em> have the capacity to doubt divine Light afterwards. First you see the Light and at that time the mind is divine. Then, after twelve hours or even five minutes, the mind will gather strength and try to throw suspicion into your experience of Light. When your consciousness descends, when the Light goes away from your physical awareness, at that time you can doubt the Light that you saw. If right now God stands before you, you are not going to doubt Him. But the moment God disappears from your outer vision, you can doubt God.</p>
<p>Because of your oneness with your body, you don't doubt your eyes, you don't doubt your nose. You know that you are part and parcel of your body and that your body is part and parcel of your life; so you don't doubt. Similarly, divine Light is your real existence. How can you deny or doubt your own existence? But after the experience is over, when you do not feel the Light as your own, at that time the mind may throw suspicion and doubt into you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It has happened many, many times, thousands of times. The psychic consciousness is receiving Peace, Light and Bliss from above in abundant measure, whereas the physical consciousness is not powerful enough or large enough to hold it. So, what happens? Eventually the physical revolts and we suffer. That is why I tell the disciples, "Don't push, don't pull." Spirituality is a matter of accepting and transforming. We accept our life as it is; then we try to transform it. But we do not do it by hook or by crook. The divine means is through aspiration.</p>
<p>If we pull beyond our capacity, we will break. If a child wants to carry something very heavy, beyond his capacity, he will suffer. Slow and steady wins the race. Here capacity is receptivity. If we develop great receptivity, then no matter how high our spiritual height or how much we bring down from above, we will be able to assimilate it. If the container is very large, we don't have to worry. So when we aspire to climb up to the highest height, we have to aspire for expansion. Not only beginners, but also highly developed seekers have suffered from deplorable experiences. The physical revolts when it is not large enough to hold the Peace, Light and Power that the psychic brings down. So there should be a perfect harmony between the physical capacity and the heart's capacity.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Aspiration and God's Hour</h2>

<p>When you speak of God's Hour, you have to know that it is the divine moment when God wants you to realise Him and to manifest Him here on earth. How can you harmonise God's Hour and your own aspiration? You will do your part. That is to say, you will play your own role most soulfully. You will meditate most soulfully. Every day before your meditation, you have to aim at a particular goal, and this particular goal is the highest Height, the transcendental Height that you are trying to reach. You can call it the Golden Shore of the Beyond. When the meditation is over, still you have not reached the Highest. Your intention or your soulful will was to reach the Highest, but still you have not reached it. If you feel sorry, if you feel miserable, then I wish to say that you will never be able to reach your goal.</p>
<p>Feel that there is a specific hour, a golden hour, when you are meant to reach your goal. God's Hour is not at your disposal; it belongs to God. At His sweet Will He will offer it to you, but you have every right to imagine that it is here in today's meditation. When today's meditation is over and God's Hour has not struck, do not feel miserable. Tomorrow again during your meditation you have every right to hope for God's Hour.</p>
<p>God's Hour is like a lotus. It blossoms petal by petal. There is a lotus deep within you, but it blooms only one petal at a time. When all the petals have bloomed, then it is a fully blossomed lotus. Like that, God's Hour is in our aspiration. You cannot separate God's Hour from your own aspiration. When your aspiration reaches the Highest, the acme of Perfection, then automatically the lotus which we call God's Hour blossoms fully.</p>
<p>My only request to you is not to try to push or pull. God has asked you to aspire, so you aspire. Then it is up to God to give you divine / victory. It is up to Him to fulfil your aspiration. Every day make your resolution: "This is what I am going to achieve." You are not trying to aggrandise or feed your ego. But you have to feel that if you can achieve your goal, if you can reach your destination, then only you will become a conscious instrument of the Supreme. Now, we are all instruments of the Supreme; all human beings are instruments of the Supreme. But most of us are unconscious instruments. We do not know that we are instruments; we think that we are the doer. But when we enter into the spiritual life, we come to feel that we are not the doer; somebody else is the doer and that somebody else is the Inner Pilot, the Supreme. Right now, just because you have your own individuality and personality, you have every right to feel that you are praying and you are meditating. Then a day will come when you will feel that it is not you who are praying and meditating; it is somebody else and that is the Supreme in you.</p>
<p>Everything depends on the goals you set. Today you may want God-realisation, but again tomorrow you may feel miserable, thinking that if you realise God, then you will not be able to enjoy the world. Early in the morning you may cry for Light, Peace and Bliss in infinite measure. You tell God that you can't exist without Him. But in the afternoon you may become a total stranger to your own aspiration. You may feel that if you realise God, then God will not allow you to enjoy teeming imperfections, vital life and all that. At that time, do you really want God or do you want the emotional life? Early in the morning God's Hour is fast approaching you but in the evening God's Hour becomes a far cry. The human difficulty is that in the morning you want something and in a few hours' time you want something else. So how can God's Hour call you? At every moment, aspire, aspire. In your aspiration, God's Hour is bound to strike.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Meditation and sincerity</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Meditation and sincerity" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Concentration, meditation and contemplation entirely depend on our inner cry. When a child is hungry, really hungry, he cries. He may be on the first floor and his mother on the third floor, but when the mother hears his cry she comes down immediately to feed the child.</p>
<p>Let us take concentration as an inner hunger. If we are really hungry, then our Father Supreme will come running no matter where we are crying. If we have intensity and sincerity in our cry, then I tell you that we can learn concentration in a few days' time. Otherwise, it can take years and years. And then, when will we have time to learn meditation and contemplation, which are more advanced subjects? There are people who have spent forty years learning how to concentrate. They have not developed an inner cry. It is like a good student and a bad student. A bad student will fail and fail and fail, whereas a good student will every year go on to a higher class.</p>
<p>Again, God-realisation is not like drinking water; it is not like instant coffee, something that you will get immediately. No, it takes time. If somebody says that he will be able to make you realise God overnight, then do not take him seriously. You have been to school, to college and university. It has taken you twenty years to get your Master's degree, which is based on outer knowledge. God-realisation, which is infinitely more important and more significant, naturally will take many more years. In no way do I want to discourage you. Only I wish to say that if your hunger is sincere and if you are desperately in need of God, then if you need the power of concentration, I assure you that God will give you the power of concentration.</p>
<p>There is also something practical you can do to strengthen your concentration-power. Please feel that inside your mind there is a room and naturally there is also a door. Stand either inside the room or outside the room, just in front of the door, and wait there to see who is coming. As soon as you see that some people are coming — "people" here means thoughts — you just keep the door closed. In the beginning, in order to become strong, you do not allow anybody in. Otherwise, while you are allowing friends to come in, your enemies may also come in and then you will be totally lost. But there comes a time when you become inwardly strong and you are in a position only to let your friends come in. At that time you will allow your friends in and let the enemies remain outside.</p>
<p>Good thoughts are your friends. Thoughts about self-sacrifice and loving God are good thoughts. So when these good thoughts want to enter into your room, you just leave the door open. But as soon as you see bad thoughts like fear, doubt, jealousy, frustration, depression and so on, you will keep the door closed.</p>
<p>If we practice concentration and meditation regularly, then we are bound to succeed. If we are really sincere, then we will reach the goal. But our difficulty is that we are sincere for one day or for one week and then we feel that spirituality is not meant for us. We want to realise God overnight. If we can't get our God-realisation overnight, then we think, "All right, let me pray for one week, one month, one year. After one year, if I don't realise God, I will give up." We feel that the spiritual life is not meant for us; it is only for others. It is like turning on the stove. If you turn the handle just a little and then stop, there will be no flame. You have to turn the handle to a certain spot and only then the flame will appear. But you move the handle only a little and then you think, "There will be no flame, so the best thing is to bring the handle back or to leave it where it is." This is what happens. People go one step and then they feel that God is not there. But God is standing at the end of two steps. If we don't go to where He is, then how are we going to see Him?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part IV — Hartford television interview</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part IV — Hartford television interview" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p>
On 8 May 1974 Sri Chinmoy was interviewed on a Hartford, Connecticut television show. This is a transcript of the interview.</p>
<h2><em>First interviewer:</em> I've heard about meditation, but I really don't know too much about it. This morning our guest is Sri Chinmoy, who is an expert in the area of meditation. He has lectured at many universities and written several books on the subject, and he also conducts twice-weekly meditations at the United Nations. It's nice to have you here this morning, Sri Chinmoy.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am so happy to be here.</p>
<p><em>First interviewer:</em> I think my first question is that I want to know more about meditation. Is it a mental exercise or is it like self-hypnosis? Is it an alternative to religion? Do people meditate instead of going to church?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation is not a mental exercise, it is not self-hypnosis and it is not a form of religion. Meditation is an inner study for self-discovery. We meditate in order to empty our mind and in order to empty our heart. When we empty our mind we receive God the Peace. When we empty our heart we receive God the Love. Peace and Love are the two most important things in our life.</p>
<p><em>First interviewer:</em> I think a lot of people are going to be wondering how you go about meditating. How do you do it? I think the results you are talking about sound good, but most of us don't really know how to meditate.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to meditate for a few seconds. Then I shall explain how to meditate. [Sri Chinmoy meditates for a moment.] You just observed as I meditated for a couple of seconds. While I was meditating, I felt Peace and Delight all through my body. It was like a stream of Peace, Light and Delight flowing from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet.</p>
<p><em>Second interviewer:</em> How would you describe what you saw in your mind's eye? Were you seeing some sort of a landscape scene?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Actually I was not seeing anything. I was growing into something, and that something was flowing Peace, Light and Bliss. I was becoming part and parcel of it.</p>
<p><em>First interviewer:</em> Do you have to actually clear your mind of everything?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, you have to clear your mind and not allow any thought whatsoever to enter into the mind. If a thought does enter into the mind, then we cannot grow into the divine Reality.</p>
<p><em>First interviewer:</em> But I think that's really hard for people, because particularly in everyday life, there are so many things that are acting upon you. How do you go about actually clearing the mind and not thinking about something you have to do that day or a problem you have?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation should be a regular practice. We study regularly in order to pass our examination or achieve something. If we practise daily, it is quite possible to meditate well. But to start with, we should read a few spiritual books to inspire ourselves and go to a spiritual Master who can increase our aspiration. We should try to live a regular, self-disciplined life.</p>
<p><em>First interviewer:</em> So one can actually go to a class to learn?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes.</p>

What can you learn from reading a book about how to empty your mind and heart? How would the readings inspire you to be able to do this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you read a spiritual book, it will mention techniques for emptying your mind and illumining your mind. But as regards physical exercises, I feel they are not absolutely necessary. These preliminary exercises help us to a certain extent, but they are not indispensable. When we sit and make our mind calm, quiet and tranquil, we feel that we are in a position to have a free access to our inner reality. When we have a free access to our inner reality, we hear the Message of God. God is constantly speaking to us. He is trying to guide us all the time, but it is we who do not hear His Message.</p>
<p><em>Second interviewer:</em> When we are getting ready to meditate, doesn't the environment have to be just right? Do you have to be in a quiet place alone or can you do it with a bunch of people around?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on your capacity. In the beginning it is impossible to meditate when there are people around who are making noise or who are not aspiring. But there comes a time when you become an expert in meditation. Then, no matter what is happening around you, you will not be affected at all.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Second interviewer: We are talking with the distinguished authority on Yoga and meditation, Sri Chinmoy. Sir, what about the housewife who is at home with three screaming children in the morning or most of the day? Or the business executive who is just running from here to there for appointments all day long? How can they sit down and take a few moments to meditate? How can you get them to calm down from their daily activities?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Second interviewer:&lt;/em&gt; We are talking with the distinguished authority on Yoga and meditation, Sri Chinmoy.

How can you get them to calm down from their daily activities?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Housewives and business executives can easily meditate, provided they know what is most important in life and provided they are willing to do the first thing first. Early in the morning before they enter into the hustle and bustle of life, if they offer a few seconds to God, then they can easily meditate. God is for everyone. He is not the sole monopoly of one individual who is ready to aspire all the time. Just because God is omnipresent, He is in everybody. God is not denied to a housewife or a business executive; only they have to feel a conscious necessity for God.</p>
<p><em>Second interviewer:</em> In the midst of daily life, how is a housewife going to sit down and take time out? Is there some simple thing she can do to relieve the tension?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, while she is talking to her children, while she is trying to discipline their life, if she can feel the presence of the living God inside them, then there will be a spontaneous flow of divine love from her. And at that time her children will feel that their mother has something special to offer. So when she consciously observes God or feels the presence of God, she will be in a position to deal with her children in a divine way; and that is her meditation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the individual teacher. I have no idea what others do. In my case, I always say that my fee is aspiration or an inner cry, plus regularity.</p>
<p>I have been teaching meditation for the last seven or eight years, and we have about forty-five meditation Centres all over the world. If one has an inner cry and at the same time is willing to come to the Centre regularly and devotedly, then he has paid his fees.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we meditate well, then we feel peace inside ourselves. We feel that all the time there is illumining guidance within ourselves or a beckoning hand which is all the time leading us towards our destination, which is satisfaction-life.</p>
<p><em>First interviewer:</em> So meditation can also decrease blood pressure and do other things?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> These things can be done by the Will of God. When we meditate, we identify ourselves consciously with God's adamantine Will. So if we are in need of something, then naturally our God, who is all Love and all Compassion, will do the needful within us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this world we feel that everything is contagious. If we can increase the number of people who are in the world of love and peace, then naturally we will be able to inspire and influence others. You are a good soul. If you work with a bad human being, then your inner good qualities will try to inspire that person. When we see a saint, immediately we feel the good qualities of the saint coming forward in ourselves and inspiring us. So if you have peace and love, then either today or tomorrow your peace and love will spread, because the very nature of peace is to spread and the very nature of love is to spread.</p>

<p><em>First interviewer:</em> Thank you very much for coming today, Sri Chinmoy. I think people will now want to at least try meditation and see if it works for themselves.</p>
