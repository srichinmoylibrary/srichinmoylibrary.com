<p>The other night, Sudhir, Scott, Casey, Peter and I ran fourteen miles. After four or five miles I said, "You go ahead and clear the snow."</p>
<p>Scott and Casey are "excellent" runners, so it was Sudhir and Peter who went ahead. After one hundred metres, Peter could not keep up with Sudhir, so like a gentleman he started running with Scott, Casey and me.</p>
<p>After five miles Casey was tired; he didn't want to run anymore. While I was barking at him to keep running, I entered into a puddle. For five or six steps, it was so cold. Such agony!</p>
<p>Then we went on and completed seven miles. Casey said, "How can we get back?" I said, "We will take a taxi," but in the back of my mind I knew we would run back — another seven miles.</p>
<p>Scott is wise. He saw a diner and he said he was wondering if they had hot chocolate. Secretly he was hoping I would say to stop.</p>
<p>We turned back. Only Scott, Casey and Sudhir were still with me. Casey was behind us. All of a sudden he got inspiration and he wanted to go ahead. I started barking at him, "Either be at least fifty metres ahead, or stay behind." While barking at him, again I entered into the same puddle which I had run through going the other way.</p>
<p>Sudhir was very nice, always running far ahead of us. After two or three miles, I saw Casey and Sudhir putting on their jackets. They had taken them off on the way and left them by the side of the street. Luckily, people didn't care for their jackets, so Casey and Sudhir got them on the way back.</p>

<p>When I was little, my mother used to give me money if I had eaten my food. If Madhuri takes most delicious things to Radha and tells her it will give her more strength, then Radha will become bigger than Madhuri. Then Madhuri can defeat her. If Madhuri feeds her, Radha will become three times as fat as her mother. Then it will be easy for Madhuri to defeat her.</p>
<p>During the New York Marathon, Radha saw me twenty times. Her stride was useless, but she had such determination to go ahead of me. She was absolutely grinding her teeth, and she did defeat me.</p>

<p>Yesterday, while running by the canal in Honolulu, I saw S the Great first among the girls.</p>
<p>S is a great runner. She went ahead of me. Madhuri and Annette were right behind her by the canal, but I didn't see them.</p>
<p>Before I greeted S, I looked at the time. It was four minutes to six. I said, "How can she do this? She is not allowed to run alone until after six o'clock."</p>
<p>Then, ten metres behind, I saw the other two I said, "All right."</p>

<p>I am so proud of myself. An old man was running about fifty metres ahead of me. I said, "I have to prove I am a good runner." Then I went far ahead of him.</p>
<p>After each minute I looked behind to see if he was catching up to me. But no, he was getting even farther behind. When I reached the end of the canal, he was still staggering.</p>
<p>I said, "At least I have one good competitor."</p>

<p>Yesterday, while running near my hotel in Hawaii, I got lost for about fifteen minutes. Then again today, I got lost for about twenty minutes. But now I won't make a mistake. I know the name of the street well. If I can remember the name of my sister Lily, then I will remember the street name. Previously, I tried to remember where my hotel was by the small house with two trees in front. But then I saw that four or five houses had two trees in the front yard.</p>

<p>I think people run on alternate days. The day before yesterday, many people ran. Then again today, there were many people. Some disciples run so fast.</p>
<p>One lady looked from a distance like Ila. She really looked like Ila and I was about to call, "Ila!" But then I saw it was somebody else.</p>

<p>I wonder if some people are clever like me. When they see I am coming, they go fast. That's what I do when I see some people. I don't want them to see that I am running so slowly, so when I come near them — about thirty metres away — I increase my speed. I keep this speed for about twenty metres after I pass them. Then, when I think they are out of sight, I slow down.</p>

<p>Today, my bad luck started right from early in the morning. I have two pairs of running shoes, but they were all inside the car. So I was running in my tennis shoes. My tennis shoes are heavy. They kept striking the ground while I was running, hurting me like anything.</p>
<p>I ran five and a half miles. Then I said, "Why run anymore?" Then I walked two miles.</p>

<p>I looked at Ranjana to say that I was facing him, but he didn't know it was me. Ranjana was whispering to Lavanya about it, but the man still didn't recognise me. He must have been reading someone's T-shirt.</p>
