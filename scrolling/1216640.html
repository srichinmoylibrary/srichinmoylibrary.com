<p>I pray. I pray because I am hungry. I have an inner hunger for my Lord's Compassion-Flood and Satisfaction-Sea.</p>
<p>My prayer is a two-way conversation between my heart's soulful cry and my Lord's blessingful Smile.</p>
<p>My prayer is at once my assurance and my confidence. I assure my body, my vital and my mind that they are of the Supreme and for the Supreme. I offer confidence to those who are sailing in the same boat and heading towards the selfsame destined Goal as I, and yet are wanting in confidence.</p>
<p>Each day I renew my prayer. That means that each day I intensify and strengthen my commitment to my Beloved Supreme. It is my commitment, my sole commitment, to please Him in His own way constantly, unreservedly and unconditionally.</p>
<p>I pray to my Lord Supreme that I will be conscious that His Existence is constantly with me. I pray to my Lord Supreme that I will be constantly, consciously with Him. I feel that when He is with me, I am partial perfect, but when I am with Him, I am totally perfect.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, out of His infinite Bounty, has already chosen me to be His devoted and surrendered instrument. Now it is I who have to choose Him as my Eternity's only Pilot Supreme. It is I who have to make the supreme decision of choosing Him all the time on the strength of my inner cry. When I choose God unconditionally and when I remain with God constantly, at that time I am completely perfect.</p>
<p>My life is a combination of unanswered prayers and unoffered prayers. When my prayers are not fulfilled, I am not sad. At that time sorrow does not torture me, for I know that my unanswered prayers are blessings in disguise. It is my unoffered prayers that pain me constantly. My unoffered prayers take me far, farther farthest from God's Justice-Light and Compassion-Height, while my unanswered prayers are always helping me far beyond my imagination. The divine seeker and the divine lover in me teach my unconscious body, my uncontrolled vital and my unillumined mind that my unanswered prayers are blessings in disguise, for my Beloved Supreme knows what is best for me always.</p>
<p>My prayers are my Lord's Compassion-cultivation and my own satisfaction-harvest. I pray, I pray.</p>

<p>We pray and we meditate.</p>
<p>We pray for our protection. We meditate on God's Perfection.</p>
<p>We pray to become divinely great and supremely good. We meditate to realise who we eternally are.</p>
<p>We pray so that we can see the beauty and the divinity of the higher worlds. We meditate so that we can receive invitations from the inner worlds.</p>
<p>When we pray, our Father-Friend lovingly feeds us. When we meditate, we soulfully feed our Father-Friend.</p>
<p>When we pray, our pure hunger itself is our striking success. When we meditate, our sure satisfaction itself is our illumining progress.</p>
<p>Our soulful prayer makes us our Lord's choice instruments. Our fruitful meditation makes us our Lord's Vision-Voice.</p>
<p>Our heart's prayer-cry serves the divine in us. Our life's meditation-smile awakens and enlightens the human in us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The desiring man, the aspiring man and the self-giving man</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The desiring man, the aspiring man and the self-giving man" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The desiring man tells me that human life is full of difficulties. The aspiring man tells me that human life is full of opportunities. The self-giving man tells me that human life is God's constant Vision-Manifestation.</p>
<p>Each difficulty discourages and delays our success-life. Each opportunity encourages and expedites our progress-life. Each Vision-Manifestation of God helps us march faster toward our destined Goal.</p>
<p>Life is love, love is oneness, oneness is perfection and perfection is satisfaction.</p>
<p>Human life fails; divine life succeeds.</p>
<p>Human love binds; divine love liberates.</p>
<p>Human oneness is a rope of sand; divine oneness is at once birthless and deathless.</p>
<p>Human perfection disappears in the twinkling of an eye; divine perfection constantly transcends its own heights.</p>
<p>Human satisfaction is the fulfilment of our desire-life; divine satisfaction is the fulfilment of ourselves in and through the fulfilment of our Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Human satisfaction says, "My will must cover the length and breadth of the world." Divine satisfaction says, "Let Thy Will be done.</p>
<p>Human satisfaction is necessary as long as we care for the animal in us, the hungry wolf in us. Divine satisfaction is necessary only when we care for God for God's sake.</p>
<p>We start our journey with the desire-life. The desire-life helps to free us from the world of sloth, inertia and ignorance. Then we come to the aspiration-life. The aspiration-life helps us to reach higher goals, higher ideals and higher realisations. The self-giving life constantly makes us feel that we are of the One and for the One. Him to please in His own way is our sole choice.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Liberation</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Liberation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Liberation is the freedom from limitation and suffocation. Liberation is the transcendence of the body-consciousness. The body consciousness is the "I-ness" song, the song that says, "I have and I am." Liberation is the embodiment of Eternity's poise and Immortality's voice. Eternity is God's Silence-Vision. Immortality is God's Sound-Manifestation. Poise is the God-Beauty in man. Voice is the man-duty for God.</p>
<p>A liberated man is he who has smashed the shackles of birth and death. Birth is a painful cry. Death is a fruitless sigh. A liberated man is he who does not suffer from self-created ignorance. Ignorance is the unreal in us. The unreal is the source of all our teeming maladies. But our own birthless and deathless aspiration-ascent is the panacea for all these maladies.</p>
<p>Aspiration is Heaven-power. Heaven-power continuously sings and dances with enlightenment. Desire is earth-strength. Earth-strength is afraid of enlightenment. Enlightenment is not a boon; it is not even a gift. Enlightenment is a supremely fulfilling unfoldment from deep within.</p>
<p>Illumination, liberation and realisation. These three are inseparable friends. These are the rungs in our aspiration-ladder, which reaches the highest Absolute. Illumination conquers darkness. Liberation conquers ignorance. Realisation transforms both darkness and ignorance so that we can become a perfect instrument which is used by the Absolute Supreme in His own way.</p>

<p>Concentration is an art. Meditation is an art. Concentration is a challenging art. Meditation is an illumining art. Concentration reveals power. Meditation reveals peace. Concentration helps us expedite our spiritual journey. Meditation helps us reach our ultimate Goal.</p>
<p>When we concentrate, we concentrate on the finite in the infinite. We concentrate on a drop in the vast ocean. When we meditate, we meditate on the Infinite inside the finite. We meditate on the blue-vast sea inside the tiny drop. We concentrate to silence the world of outer noise. We meditate to hear the world of inner voice.</p>
<p>When we concentrate, we feel that the world around us offers us tremendous obstacles. Therefore, we are apt to reject the outer world. When we meditate, we accept everything. The world around us and the world within us both remain at our disposal. Only we transform all that has to be transformed in the outer world and in the inner world. It is in the process of transformation that we derive satisfaction.</p>
<p>Concentration carries the message of conquest. Right after conquest we get happiness. Meditation gives us happiness amidst the battles of life. It gives us happiness both in success and in failure, in victory and in defeat. The message of meditation carries us far beyond the domain of success and failure, victory and defeat. Meditation makes us feel that success is an experience and that failure is also an experience. These experiences ultimately lead us to the selfsame goal: satisfaction in our oneness-life with our Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Concentration reminds us of God the Omnipotent. Meditation reminds us of God the Omnipresent. When we concentrate, Infinity in its power aspect appears before us. When we meditate, Eternity in its tranquility aspect appears before us.</p>
<p>God created the world with His Meditation and in His Meditation. But in the process of involution, evolution, inner revolution and outer resolution, He uses concentration. God the Creator awakens us, inspires us and aspires in and through us with His Meditation-Light. God the creation is around us and for us with His Concentration-Power.</p>
<p>Concentration tells us, "Run, run fast, faster, fastest in order to reach the Goal." Meditation tells us, "The Goal is not in front of you. It is not remote from you. The Goal is within you. Dive deep within. To your wide surprise, you will not only see the Goal within you, but you will see yourself as the ultimate Goal. You the seeker, you the aspiration and you the realisation are one and identical."</p>
<p>We concentrate, we meditate.</p>

<p>We shall wait. We shall be perfect strangers to teeming worries and anxieties. We shall find our roots anchored in God's Patience-Light.</p>
<p>We shall wait. We shall wait for our Beloved Supreme to whisper, "Come in, My sweet children." We shall wait for our gratitude-heart to respond, "Beloved Supreme, we are all Yours. To please You in Your own way is the birth, the continuation and the ever-transcending, ever-fulfilling experience of our soul's journey."</p>

<p>We shall not wait. If we wait, we shall lose. If we lose, we shall weep. Who wants to weep? Nobody. We wish only to smile at our Beloved Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>We shall not wait. If we wait, we shall fail. If we fail, we shall die. Who wants to die? Nobody. We want only to live on earth to spread the Light of our Beloved Supreme. We want to live on earth to manifest Him in His own way.</p>
<p>To wait is to make friends with empty hours, empty days, empty months and empty years. To wait is to miss God's Perfection-Freedom-Train which is bound for the ever-increasing Satisfaction-Station.</p>
<p>If we do not wait, our life's inspiration and our heart's aspiration will make us see the Face of our Creator. Our Creator needs no future; He has and He is the eternal Now.</p>
<p>If we do not wait, our Beloved Lord, the Author of all Good, will make us His choice instruments by transforming our life within and without totally, Him to manifest in His own way. We shall be His perfect channels of revealing Light and fulfilling Delight.</p>
<p>If we do not wait, in the inner world revolution will be our name; in the inner world, evolution will be our name; and in our own world, satisfaction will be our name.</p>
<p>We shall not wait. We shall start praying and meditating. We shall pray continuously. We shall meditate continuously. If we continuously pray, one day at God's choice Hour, we shall grow into God's transcendental Height. If we continuously meditate, one day at God's choice Hour, we shall grow into God's universal Light.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Progress</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Progress" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God's universal Push awakens us. God's transcendental Pull liberates us.</p>
<p>We worship God because we think that He is far, very far. We love God because we feel that He is near, very near.</p>
<p>Sincerity we need; purity we need. With our sincerity we strengthen our aspiration-heart. With our purity we enlighten our dedication-life.</p>
<p>In our life of aspiration, in our life of dedication, we wish to make fast, faster and fastest progress. How do we achieve this goal? We achieve it on the strength of our faithfulness, cheerfulness and soulfulness. Faithfulness we need in our physical consciousness. Cheerfulness we need in our vital consciousness. Soulfulness we need in our psychic consciousness.</p>
<p>We all wish to make progress, continuous and constant. How is it that we do not make satisfactory progress? We do not make satisfactory progress precisely because we live in the world of complaints. We complain and, because we complain, we do not make any progress. Because we do not love God, we complain, and because we complain, we do not love God. And because we think of the world too much, we make no progress.</p>
<p>There are two lives: the aspiration-life and the desire-life. We started our journey with the desire-life. Then we gave up the desire-life and entered into the aspiration-life. At God's choice Hour, we shall enter into the realisation-life, where satisfaction will be ours within and without.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Gratitude-Heart</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Gratitude-Heart" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Pure is our aspiration-plant. Purer is our dedication-flower. Purest is our gratitude-heart. Sweet is our soulful smile. Sweeter is our inner cry. Sweetest is our gratitude-heart. Gratitude is pure happiness. Happiness is sure perfection. Perfection is complete satisfaction both in man's world and in God's world.</p>
<p>Our gratitude-heart ceaselessly receives blessingful love, soulful concern and fruitful oneness from above. Our gratitude-heart feels that its very existence on earth is an unconditional act of God's Grace. Our gratitude-heart knows that its acts are for God and for God alone.</p>
<p>In this world we are apt not to value anything or anyone, but our gratitude-heart always values everything in God's creation. It values God the Creator and God the creation. It values God's Compassion and it values God the Compassion. It also values God's Justice-Light and God the Justice-Light, for it knows that God, our Beloved Supreme, is always the Author of all Good.</p>
<p>Our gratitude-heart never fails God. It carries with it flaming aspiration, the burning inner cry and a constant self-giving reality. At every moment God pleases our gratitude-heart with His boundless Concern, Compassion and all-loving Oneness.</p>
<p>We aspire for the Infinite, the Eternal and the Immortal. The seeker in us constantly is trying to transcend himself on the strength of his aspiration-cry and dedication-smile. Our seeker-heart's experience-life, realisation-life and God-fulfilling manifestation-life are clearly read in the Face of our Beloved Supreme. Our own autobiography is clearly read in God's own Face. We offer Him our gratitude-heart and He gives us His constant Assurance that He has chosen us to be His choice instruments, Him to fulfil in His own way here on earth and there in Heaven.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Choice</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Choice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Who is called? Who is not called? He who needs is called. He who does not need is not called. Who needs? The seeker-lover in us needs. Who fulfils our need? The Beloved Supreme, the eternal Liberator, fulfils our need and responds to our inner cry.</p>
<p>What does the seeker in us need? He needs God-Truth, God-Light and God Delight. God-Truth awakens him, God Light illumines him and God-Delight fulfils him. God-Truth he hears. God-Light he sees. God-Delight he feels.</p>
<p>There are two worlds: the desire-world and the aspiration-world. In the desire-world our supreme choices are division and self-assertion. In the aspiration-world, our supreme choices are God-discovery and self-mastery. A sincere seeker, in the process of discovering and uncovering, realises his birthless and deathless inseparable oneness with his Source.</p>
<p>The seeker in us constantly needs God's boundless Compassion-Rain and God's Satisfaction-Reign. God the Beloved Supreme constantly needs from the seeker in us our aspiration-plane and dedication-train.</p>
<p>He who chooses the Absolute Supreme has already been chosen by the infinite and unconditional Bounty of the Supreme. The seeker's soul, the seeker's heart and the seeker's very existence on earth, have already been chosen by the Absolute Supreme to be his faithful, devoted and unconditional instruments for His divine Manifestation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The seeker&#039;s duty</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The seeker&#039;s duty" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The seeker's duty is complete non-co-operation with the desire-world. The seeker's duty is constant co-operation with the aspiration-world.</p>
<p>The seeker at times gets success from the desire-world, but to his wide surprise he eventually sees that inside his desire, what looms large is frustration. Desire itself is a dissatisfied hunger; when this hunger is fulfilled, it only increases.</p>
<p>In the aspiration-world when the seeker makes progress, he sees that in his progress itself there is satisfaction, abiding satisfaction. The aspiration-world and progress go together; progress and satisfaction go together.</p>
<p>The human duty is to love, serve and become the height of truth. The divine duty is to sing the song of oneness, to dance the dance of perfection and to live the life of fulness. The human duty is to discover God-Reality within and without. The divine duty is to uncover God-Beauty here, there and all-where.</p>
<p>Not to feed the doubting mind is the supreme duty of the seeker. To feed the loving and aspiring heart is the supreme duty of the seeker. To live in the soul and for the soul is the supreme duty of the seeker.</p>
<p>The seeker's duty is to have inner courage. This courage is an act of inner faith. Faith is an act of self-giving love, and love is an act of God-becoming life. The seeker's ultimate duty is to offer his soulful cry from the inmost recesses of his heart. When the seeker offers God his soulful cry from the inmost recesses of his heart, at that time God, out of His infinite Bounty, tells the seeker that He also has a Duty of His own. And that Duty is to grant the seeker, His chosen instrument, a blessingful and fruitful Smile.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Let us try to empty the mind</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Let us try to empty the mind" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We shall now try to empty the mind. Indeed, this is the most difficult task, but we shall do it. Our mind has made friends with teeming thoughts. These thoughts are unhealthy, uncomely, unaspiring and undivine. The moment our aspiration-heart eliminates one thought, to its wide surprise another thought immediately crops up. It seems that we are forced to play an endless game.</p>
<p>But there is also another game, and that game is the will-power-game. We have inherited that game from our Father, the Lord Supreme. When we play that game we transform our thought-world into the will-power-world.</p>
<p>Where do we get this will-power? We get this will-power from our heart's calmness-sea. From where do we acquire this calmness-sea? We acquire it from our soul's freedom-sun and oneness-sky.</p>
<p>A man of will-power braves all the storms and tempests of life. He knows that he is not the earth-bound body but the Heaven-free soul. His body is not earth-bound; his life is not earth-bound. He also knows that he is not his nature's slave, but a supremely chosen instrument of his Inner Pilot, his Beloved Supreme. What he truly has and what he truly is, is aspiration-flame, and this aspiration-flame makes him feel that he is always Heaven-free. He is in the world, true; but he is not of the world. At the same time, he knows that he is <em>for</em> the world, for the world's transformation and for God's manifestation in and through the world. He is always for this world.</p>
<p>Let us try to empty the mind. In our mind's emptiness will loom large Infinity's Peace, Eternity's Light and Immortality's Delight. Let us try to empty the mind.</p>

<p>"Lord, reform Thy world, beginning with me." This is a prayer of a Chinese Christian, which President Roosevelt quoted at a press conference in 1941.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, I know. I know that my nature's transformation is the answer to the world's transformation.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, I know. I know that my heart's purity and my life's humility comprise my soul's magnanimity.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, I know. I know that my love of You is my journey. I know that my surrender to You is my destination.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, I know. I know that in my desire-world I am the abyss of nothingness. I know that in my aspiration-world I am the sea of fulness.</p>
<p>Yesterday, my Lord, I came to You proudly and haughtily. Today, my Lord, I have come to You devotedly and unreservedly. Tomorrow, my Lord, I shall come to You soulfully and unconditionally.</p>
<p>Lord, my lord, when I speak to the world about You, it is not my personal opinion. It is the revelation of my sweet oneness-relation with You.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, do make me see and feel that my heart's perfection-cry has to be continued and transcended.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, do make me see and feel that my life's satisfaction-smile has to be renewed daily and pursued.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Silence</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Silence" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Silence is the greatness of the human mind. Silence is the goodness of the divine heart. Silence is the selflessness of the perfect soul.</p>
<p>Silence loves God's inner Beauty. Silence reveals God's inner Duty. God's inner Beauty awakens the human seeker in us. God's inner Duty fulfils the divine lover in us.</p>
<p>Silence is the God-Song. This Song is an ever-transcending experience. Silence is the God-Music. This Music is an ever-illumining realisation.</p>
<p>There are two realities: sound-reality and silence-reality. Sound-reality is self-reliance. Silence-reality is God-reliance. Sound-reality is self-declaration and self-admiration. Silence-reality is God-adoration. Sound-reality is the declaration of our human autocracy and supremacy. Silence-reality is our constant self-transformation in God's Compassion-Heart.</p>
<p>A man of silence has a free access to God's personal properties. These properties are Eternity, Infinity and Immortality. In the soul of Eternity, man the seeker learns from God. In the heart of Infinity, man the seeker speaks to God. In the life of Immortality, man the seeker becomes another God.</p>
