  <h2 id="page-title">The King&#039;s admirers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The King&#039;s admirers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I went to a bookstore today on Sutphin Boulevard, near Jamaica Avenue. Next to the bookstore is my most favourite Italian restaurant. For years I used to walk down there and bring pizza back to my house for any disciples who were working there. The owner's name is Mark. Always the people in that restaurant are so nice to me!</p>
<p>When I went into the bookstore today, a black man was reading Muhammad Ali's book, I Am King. In this book Ali did not say he was "the greatest." He said, "I am the King."</p>
<p>The man was very nice. He was showing such interest in the book. He said, "Would you like to buy this book?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am, like you, a great admirer of Muhammad Ali."</p>
<p>He said, "You are a great admirer of his?"</p>
<p>I said, "I have had quite a few interviews with him."</p>
<p>He couldn't believe his ears. He said, "Oh, you have met the King? You talked to him?"</p>
<p>I said, "I have talked with him for hours."</p>
<p>I took the man's name and address and said that I would send him the brochures with our interviews.</p>
<p>The man had with him a cage with a rabbit inside. The shopkeeper wouldn't let him bring it inside the bookstore.</p>

<p>After I finished talking to the black man, I bought a few books. The price came to five dollars and forty cents. Before I paid the man at the counter, I was talking to him for a while. I asked him if he was the new owner. He said, "Yes, I am."</p>
<p>So I said, "Good luck!" I said many other nice things to him also.</p>
<p>Then, when I reached into my pocket, I saw that I had a five dollar bill, plus a quarter, a dime and four pennies. I said to him, "I have here five dollars and thirty-nine cents. If you do not want to accept it, I will give you a twenty dollar bill."</p>
<p>He grabbed the twenty dollar bill. He wanted to have the twenty, instead of five thirty-nine. Then when he was about to give me the change, he said, "Not worth it!" He returned the twenty, and took my five thirty-nine.</p>
<p>I said, "Fine!"</p>
<p>I should one day give him a hundred books free. His spiritual section is nothing - all rubbish novels.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went with X and Y to get a machine. In the store, X saw on the owner's desk two small paintings on a card. X is a great art-lover. He brought the card to me and said, "Look, Guru, your paintings!" He was positive, a hundred per cent sure. I was ninety-five per cent certain that it was my painting. But when we turned the card over, there was somebody else's name on it. I looked at it and said, "How can it be?" YS also felt it was my painting, but somebody else's name was written on the card.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Buying the post</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Buying the post" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Last week I went to a candy store and bought the Post. It was not the <em>Enquirer</em> so luckily I was saved! My disciples always tell me I should not be seen buying the Enquirer, although reading it always amuses me. As I was buying the paper, a man with a moustache and beard asked me, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I smiled at him.</p>
<p>He continued, "Are you really? I have come to your meditations at PS 86 on Parsons Boulevard."</p>
<p>I was carrying a bag over my shoulder, so he said "Now you are carrying a bag."</p>
<p>I said, "Now you see the difference from the way I am at meditation."</p>
<p>He said, "No difference!"</p>
<p>While I was paying for the newspaper, he was telling the shopkeeper, "He is Sri Chinmoy."</p>
<p>When I was coming out of the store, he was still gazing at me.</p>

<p>The other day I was in a store shopping for something for A. A very, very fat lady came into the same store to buy something for herself. The lady had her hand on a garment when she saw me. She kept her hand on the garment and started looking at me with such awe. Then she said, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>So I smiled at her. Then the owner started asking her, "Who is he?"</p>
<p>I have been at that clothing store on Jamaica Avenue at least sixty or seventy times, but the owner thinks that I am an ordinary person. After talking to the lady, the owner realised that I am an "important person." So that's how I became an important person overnight!</p>

<p>I went to Dan Lurie's exercise store with Dhanu to buy some exercise equipment. A black gentleman came up to me, practically with folded hands, and asked with such respect, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He was so excited. He was telling his six or seven-year-old daughter, "That is Sri Chinmoy! That is Guru Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>His daughter felt shy, so she stayed in one corner of the store while I was taking exercise on an exercise machine. After ten minutes she came over to watch me. Then she wouldn't move. She was standing so near me, looking and looking at my eyes for ten minutes, with her eyes wide open. Dhanu couldn't figure out why she wouldn't move.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A mentor</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A mentor" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Yesterday I went to an old bookstore and bought <em>Mystics as a Force for Change</em> by Sisir Kumar Ghose. He is a Bengali who lives in Shanti Niketan. He happens to be a very close friend of mine, plus one of my great mentors. He is extremely fond of me, and I am extremely fond of him.</p>
<p>I know him so well. He has been going to the ashram for the last thirty years. We used to walk along the shores of the Bay of Bengal together in the evening. Eighteen years ago he came to America to give lectures at Mississippi University. Some nice pictures of us together were taken while he was here. He brought me a beautiful small statue of Lord Buddha and other gifts. I remember them - especially a peculiar ballpoint from Shanti Niketan.</p>
<p>For most of the articles in the book that I bought, I had served as his messenger boy. During that time I was unofficial sub-editor of <em>Mother India</em>, and I used to take his articles to the editor. Also, I made arrangements for him to have an interview with <em>Mother India</em>.</p>
<p>I was so delighted and excited to see the book. It was $2.95. So I bought it and started reading it. I truly admire Sisir Kumar Ghose. He was such a nice, kind mentor. I am really grateful to him. My immediate offering of gratitude to this supremely noble soul can only be felt and never be described. Many, many things one day I will tell about him.</p>
<p>But after I had bought his book the funniest thing happened. That same afternoon I received a letter from Vidagdha saying that Sisir Kumar Ghose of Shanti Niketan had been one of the examiners of her doctoral thesis on my poetry. Melbourne University had submitted her thesis to various places, but the professors didn't want to examine it because they didn't know anything about the subject. Finally, Sisir Ghose accepted. He is head of the English section of the university at Shanti Niketan. According to him, Vidagdha should have also said something about my Bengali poems.</p>

<p>I was at a fruit stand on 147th Street, beyond Jamaica Avenue. The Japanese girl there said to me "Hi! I have not seen you for a long time."</p>
<p>I said, "I have also not seen you for a long time."</p>
<p>Then I got seven or eight items. I came to her and she added it up on the cash register. It came to $13. I said, "It is wrong. Are you sure?"</p>
<p>She said, "Do you think I am overcharging you'"</p>
<p>I said, "No, it seems to me that you have not charged me for all the items."</p>
<p>Then she took the receipt out of the cash register and checked each item to show me that it was all right. I was wrong.</p>
<p>Then she said, "You are such a nice man!"</p>

<p>I said, "Why?"</p>
<p>He said, "You look exactly like him."</p>
<p>Then he looked at me again and dropped his bag of plantain chips and said, "Sri Chinmoy! Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>He told me, "Two or three years ago I went to one of your meetings in Manhattan. There I saw you meditating." He couldn't believe that I would be shopping in a grocery store. He came from the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>He was so excited. He told his friend, "Sri Chinmoy is in my store! Sri Chinmoy is in my store!"</p>

<p>Another day I was looking at wristwatches. On that day I was carrying two heavy bags.</p>
<p>Baoul was waiting for me in the car at a particular place. I could see him, but he didn't see me, so I had to carry the bags myself.</p>
<p>A man came up to me and asked, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He said, "I came to one of your Wednesday meetings. It was so powerful." Then he started telling me all about his Guru while I was standing holding the heavy bags.</p>
<p>He said, "I was initiated by my Guru. Now he has passed away."</p>
<p>I said, "Your Guru has left successors. You should follow his successors."</p>
<p>He said, "My Guru taught me Kundalini Yoga. But I don't get anything from his successors."</p>
<p>I said, "I don't teach Kundalini Yoga."</p>
<p>He said, "Do you think you could take me faster?"</p>
<p>I said, "You have been initiated by your Guru. Now he is the one to take you."</p>
<p>For ten minutes I talked to him, all the time holding my heavy bags. Finally I said, "Your Guru is the right Guru for you."</p>
<p>Then I carried the bags to Baoul's car.</p>

<p>I went to a bookstore yesterday. First I was reading religious books and then I got inspired to read some jokes. So I went to another shelf that had joke books. I was the only customer, so the owner was watching me. He said, "What are you doing? This moment you are reading religious books, and the next moment jokes!"</p>
<p>I told him, "When I want to get joy in this world I read joke books, and when I want to get joy in the inner world I read spiritual books."</p>
<p>So he said, "Are you a philosopher?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>Then I continued reading the joke books.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Twelve donuts</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Twelve donuts" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>After I left the bookstore, I went to a donut store and ordered a dozen. I could not tell whether the person behind the counter was a man or a woman. The voice was like a man's, but the hair and everything was like a woman's.</p>
<p>When I asked for a dozen, he or she couldn't understand me. So I said, "Twelve."</p>
<p>Then the worker started putting the donuts in a brown paper bag. Another worker came over and said, "No, put them in a box." So he started putting them in a box.</p>
<p>Then a young Puerto Rican woman came and said, "Twelve? Do you know how much they cost? Fifty cents each!"</p>
<p>I looked at them and said, "I have the money."</p>
<p>They were warning me that it was so expensive, as if I couldn't buy twelve donuts. This store changes hands quite often. Six months ago when I went there to buy five or six donuts, the owner gave me three or four extra for free. Always when I used to go there he would pat me on the shoulder and say, "You're a nice man." Now he is no longer there.</p>
