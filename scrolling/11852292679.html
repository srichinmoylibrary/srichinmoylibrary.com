  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do good and evil really exist?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do good and evil really exist?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the highest spiritual point of view there is no such thing as evil. But in the field of manifestation, the experiences that we get in our day-to-day life can be described as good or evil. On earth there is good and evil, but in the highest and deepest world of the spirit, there is no such thing. Good and evil do exist for us when we are in ordinary earthbound consciousness. But when we go beyond duality, beyond knowledge and ignorance, beyond this so-called truth and falsehood, we also go beyond good and evil.</p>
<p>The ultimate Truth is beyond the mental conception. Good and evil are located in the front of the mind. When you go beyond the mind, at that time you see that this good and evil are not the ultimate Truth. What is good for me may be bad for somebody else. What is evil for one person may not be evil for somebody else. The poison of the snake is very bad for us, but for the snake it is not.</p>
<p>Again, from the philosophical point of view, what some people call evil or sin, we think of as ignorance — the constant play of <em>Maya</em> or illusion. He who is caught in this play is different from the liberated soul who is freed from this illusion of reality. It is by meditation that we can free ourselves from ignorance, from illusion, and transform our human nature into the divine nature.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How important is patience in the spiritual life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How important is patience in the spiritual life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Patience is of paramount importance. We have to have infinite patience. We want to reach the Highest sooner than at once, but we cannot reach it by hook or by crook. We are crying for Infinity and Eternity, as a child cries for candy or milk. The eternal Child in us is crying, but we have to have infinite patience. Sri Ramakrishna used to cry every day to the Supreme Goddess Kali: “O Mother, come! Come and stand in front of me.” When the day had passed and the Mother had not come to him, he felt that the following day he would have to pray and meditate with more inner intensity.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we must try our hardest to see our Beloved Supreme right in front of us; on the other hand, we have to feel that we are in the process of eternal Time, and that we must have infinite patience. If we have infinite patience, then the finite earthbound time expands itself into the eternal Time, or the infinite Time enters into the finite time.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One thing that bothers them is earth’s ungratefulness; but worse than that is earth’s non-acceptance. Ungratefulness they expect; this is the earth-consciousness. No matter what you do, people are ungrateful. But what happens is that today someone is ungrateful and then tomorrow also he will not accept the light. Each time light is offered, earth rejects it. So what is the Master going to do? But if someone shows gratitude, then his strength increases, his receptivity increases, his capacity increases.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we pray or meditate we can increase our faith. Faith is like a muscle. If we take exercise, we develop our muscles. Inner faith also can be expanded. There are many who enter into the spiritual life out of curiosity. They have very little faith. But they go on, continue, continue. Then later on, they feel within themselves deeper faith, greater faith, more fulfilling faith. So, when one sticks to the spiritual path, one is bound to acquire more faith.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now you do have power, love and peace. But the power that you have is not pure power; it is vital power, aggressive power. You want to dominate others; you want to lord it over them. Then, if you want to show your love, you have to know that it is not pure love that you have. It is just the possessive human love, which is constant frustration, There is no real feeling of oneness in it. And if you want to offer peace to somebody, you have to know that this peace which you have is incomplete. Human peace is just a compromise; but that is no peace at all. Or sometimes when you are totally tired and exhausted, your mind makes you feel that you are peaceful. So you do have these qualities — power, love and peace — but not at the highest level. Power itself is not bad, peace, real peace, is not bad; love is not bad. But human power, human peace, human love — these are bad.</p>
<p>What you have to do is make a choice as to which one of these three you like best. Then, the quality that gives you the most joy you have to try to transform into its divine aspect. If power gives you joy, then try to enter into divine power. Concentrate and meditate on the omnipotent Power of God. You will see that when you get that omnipotent Power, you will not use it to destroy: you will only use it to love humanity, to kindle the flame of aspiration in humanity, to awaken humanity so that it can run towards the Goal. If peace gives you most joy, then try to concentrate on divine Peace; or if love gives you joy, try to enter into divine Love. In this way you will eventually reach your goal.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am not an authority on hypnotism. What I am qualified to talk about is spirituality and Yoga. In Yoga, when you are meditating, you are dealing with consciousness. But when you are hypnotised, you are not conscious. In Yoga you are aspiring; there is an inner mounting flame inside you that wants to climb high, higher, highest to reach the goal of realisation and perfection. In meditation, nobody is forcing you to realise the highest Truth. It is your inner cry that is compelling you to realise the Highest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you meditate in the heart, you acquire the capacity to identify yourself with anything you want. But if you meditate in the mind, you don’t identify; you try to enter into something. Now, if you want to enter into somebody else’s house to get what that person has, either you have to have tremendous force and break down the door, or you have to constantly plead with the owner of the house to open the door. When you plead, you feel that you are a stranger and the owner of the house feels that you are a stranger. Then he might think, “Oh, a stranger wants to come into my house.” But if you use the heart, immediately the heart’s qualities of softness, sweetness, love and purity come to the fore, and then the owner of the house will immediately let you in. When the owner of the house sees that you are all heart, immediately his heart will become one with yours. He will feel your oneness with him and he will say, “All right, what do you want from my house? If you need peace, then take it. If you need light, then take it.”</p>
<p>If you enter into the house with your mind, you will see some delicious fruit and immediately try to grab it. Then, when you get it you are satisfied. But you will not have the capacity to eat all the fruit. But if you use the heart, immediately you will identify yourself with everything in the house and call all the fruit your very own. Again, if you use the mind, you will try to make a selection. You will say, “This piece of fruit is better, this one is worse.” But if you enter into the house with your heart, you will feel that everything there is yours and become one with all the fruit. The heart centre is the centre of becoming. First you identify with the Truth, and then, on the strength of your identification, you become the Truth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Science is the expansion of the physical mind; spirituality deals with what is beyond the mind, with intuition. The domain of science is practicality. On the material plane science calls spirituality a dreamer and spirituality calls science a rascal. But on the highest plane spirituality and science are brothers. Spirituality says to science, “Brother, I need you. You are God’s Body; God is your body. You are God the Body.” And science says to spirituality, “You are God’s Soul; God is your soul. You are God the Soul.” The body needs the soul for realisation and the soul needs the body for manifestation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Peace is something spontaneous; it is something that unites us. Peace is something that we have to spread. But unless and until we have peace deep within us, we can never hope to have peace in the outer world. There are two wars: the inner and the outer. The inner war is the war that our inner being or our soul fights against limitations, ignorance, doubt and death. The outer war is the war that man fights against man, that nation fights against nation. These outer wars will come to an end only if the inner war stops first; that is to say, when in the inner world the inner being or soul conquers ignorance, fear, doubt and death. Then in the outer world there will be no necessity to wage war. We fight because deep inside us there is disharmony, there is fear, there is anxiety and worry. When deep inside us there is peace, joy, plenitude and fulfilment, we shall not wage war. Both the inner war and the outer war are bound to end in the process of human evolution.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We create H-bombs with our ignorance and with the limited freedom that God has given to us. God does not create everything for us; we have received a little freedom from Him. He has given us the freedom to come here and meditate, or to stay home and sleep. But we are using our freedom for a divine purpose, to meditate.</p>
<p>Right now we are not inseparably one with God’s Will. We usually do not know what God’s Will is and, on the very rare occasions when we do know, we may still not act according to His Will. This is what has happened with the H-bomb.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What is actually happening is that you are not properly concentrating and meditating on the heart. If you concentrate on the top of the head, it will cause confusion and numbness. But if you concentrate on the heart, no matter how much power descends you will be able to hold it. At that time you will feel the loving presence of the Supreme in your heart, and no matter how much Light and Power you get from above, you will be perfectly able to hold it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How does one bring the Spirit into his everyday life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How does one bring the Spirit into his everyday life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Early in the morning when the day dawns, one has to feel that God comes first in his life. For a few minutes he has to invoke the Presence of God. The Presence of God is always inside us, but if one feels that God is somewhere else, in the highest Heaven, then that person has to invoke His Presence. Again, if one feels that God is already within him but He is so deep that the seeker is unable to feel His Presence, then that particular seeker must pray to God to come to the fore. So either he has to bring God into his living consciousness through invocation or he has to bring God’s Presence to the fore.</p>
<p>Then, when he feels God’s Presence during his meditation, when he feels God’s infinite Power and infinite Light, at that time he feels that his life is secure. Suppose a friend visits you for a few minutes and then leaves. Even when he leaves, still his presence remains — the memory of how he talked and smiled. Similarly, God’s Presence for ten or fifteen minutes will remain with you during the whole day amidst your multifarious activities. Your reminiscences about a friend remain for many months, many years. Similarly, the memory of God’s Presence — even for a few minutes — remains in you for hours, days, months, years. If you meditate every day and feel God’s Presence for just ten minutes, that is more than enough for you to have peace of mind, joy, bliss, amidst the hustle and bustle of life. If you remember how you felt during meditation in the morning, then that is enough for you to be protected by God during the whole day.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You do not have to know any names. In the light of the plane itself you see the reality. If you read sacred books, you will get all the names of the higher and lower planes. Here you are using your mental power and with your eyes you are seeing what is written. But when you go to these planes, you do not use the mind. In this case you see everything with the power of your vision. As soon as you have the power of vision and you see the light, the light itself conveys what plane of existence you are on. So you do not have to know the name; and even if you know it, it does not help because the language that is written in the book is not found written in the same way in the actual plane of consciousness. There it only tells through light.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the beginning God was One, but He wanted to be many. God is like a tree. If the tree has no branches, it has no beauty. The tree looks beautiful only if it has many branches, leaves and fruit. Otherwise, if you see a tree that has only the trunk, you won’t appreciate it. God is the tree with all its branches and leaves. Again, God is also the root. The tree cannot live without the root. God is the root, and from the root the life energy goes to the rest of the tree.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we blend our Spirit with our physical being?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we blend our Spirit with our physical being?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This can be done and is being done every day by those who follow the path of Yoga and spiritual discipline. Yoga means union, conscious union with God. We are one with the Spirit, but right now we are not aware of it. We can be aware of it only when we consciously practise spirituality, and for that we need aspiration. When we desire, we bind ourselves; when we aspire, we free ourselves. If we start desiring one thing today, we will desire more tomorrow, and perhaps even more by the end of the week. In this way, many desires come, and there can be nothing but temporary satisfaction.</p>
<p>But if we care for the infinite Truth, infinite Bliss, infinite Light, then we have to enter into the path of aspiration. When we are marching along the path of aspiration, our Spirit will automatically blend with our physical being and the physical being will devotedly listen to the dictates of the Self. Then we will see that our inner and outer life have become totally one. At that time one complements the other; one fulfils the other. The inner life becomes the embodiment of the truth and the outer life becomes the manifestation of the truth.</p>
