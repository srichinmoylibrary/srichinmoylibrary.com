  <h2 id="page-title">Running in P.S. 86</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Running in P.S. 86" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This evening at nine o'clock I went to P.S. 86, and I jogged there for an hour. The witnesses were Databir, Nirvik and Kanan. We went to the large room, and by going from one side to another we found a course that was over three hundred metres long. I passed through the room where the disciples sit at functions and then entered into the big hall.</p>
<p>In this world people can be good or bad. The principal there says that I will be able to run there in the morning or evening for free, without having to rent the building. So he is proving to be a very good man.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Starting again</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Starting again" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The first day I started running again after being injured, I could only run one block. Then I would have to stop and walk. Yesterday I ran eight hundred metres, and then I walked a little. Today it was better. When you stop running, your stamina goes away totally. It is not like tennis, where you retain your ability to a certain extent. Also, tennis always gives such joy; even if you miss the ball, at least you are playing a game.</p>
<p>Many years ago the Supreme gave me the capacity to run, but He didn't give me enough time. I was acting like a slave to so many people — every day serving five masters at my various jobs in the ashram. What could I do? I just didn't have time to practise running, although I had the capacity. Of course, now I have eight or nine hundred masters to please!</p>
<p>In addition to the disciples, I have two more masters: my two dogs, Sona and Kanu. For the last two weeks my little three-month-old Kanu has been blessing me so that I get no peace at night. He just cries and cries. When I finally bring him upstairs, he is so restless. He won't stay in one place for more than two minutes. Sometimes around seven o'clock he rests a little, but usually until eight-thirty in the morning when the disciples come to work, I am a perfect slave to my little dog.</p>

<p>When I was running this morning, I passed by a very fat man about my age waiting for the bus. He was wearing a heavy coat and scarf. God knows how long he had been waiting, and I felt sorry for him.</p>
<p>I was making loud noises while I was running, huffing and puffing. The fat man said to me, "How old are you?"</p>
<p>I said, "Fifty."</p>
<p>"You are running like a hundred-year-old man," he said.</p>
<p>After I covered thirty metres more, a thought entered into my mind: "Let me invite him to run with me." But this was all in the mental world, not in the practical world, and I kept on running.</p>

<p>X and I are two rivals. God is not satisfied with punishing me alone; He has to punish X also. I can't run; God has blessed me. Now I see that X can't run either. Usually one rival wins. In our case God has demolished both of us. For the last few weeks neither one of us has been running.</p>

<p>In our marathon today I was watching Sarita run. I thought, "If you have will power and strength, who cares about extra body weight?" She has tremendous strength from practising for five or six years. Five or six years ago she would sometimes faint when she ran. Now she is so strong!</p>
<p>Sarita and Snigdha were running together. Sarita looked like a mountain and Snigdha looked like a Lilliputian next to her.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The dangers of the sauna</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The dangers of the sauna" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Last week a very famous boxer fainted after coming out of a sauna. Last year Vinaya's "sauna" almost made me faint on the street.</p>
<p>Vinaya's car-sauna is hotter than the hottest. It can kill the strongest man on earth. On that day we drove about ten miles in his car-sauna along my running course on Union Turnpike. After ten miles I got out. When I opened the door and stepped out onto somebody's lawn, I almost fainted. I told him that the owners wouldn't appreciate it if I fainted on the lawn, and I got back into the car.</p>
<p>Once I entered the car, I asked him to drive as fast as possible back to my house and not to worry about the police. On Union Turnpike we were going seventy, seventy-five, eighty miles per hour. I am a fool and he is a fool. We didn't think of lowering the heat or opening the windows. We just went on driving as fast as possible. He said, "Guru, before I joined the path, I did this kind of thing. Now you are asking me again to drive eighty-five miles per hour." He was so delighted to go back to his old life!</p>
<p>When we reached my house, some boys had to carry me out of the car onto the lawn. One was massaging my head, one my feet. They put ice all over my body, and there were two fans. I couldn't recognise anyone, and I couldn't even get up.</p>
<p>My next door neighbour Mrs. Chino came out of her house in a panic. She said that she didn't want to lose me. "I recently lost my husband and I don't want to lose you," she said.</p>
<p>Finally the boys took me upstairs. I closed the door — only to have a more serious attack. I couldn't keep my eyes open.</p>
<p>I always used to advocate that Amita and others ride in Vinaya's sauna. Amita says she enjoys it like anything. But for me, Vinaya puts it on the hottest. He wants to show off — to show me how powerful his sauna is. Before I enter into the car, he runs the motor for ten or fifteen minutes. When he shows off and when I show off, where do we stand?</p>
<p>You may ask why my inner beings didn't warn me that this would happen. They could have, but they knew I was not going to die, and they wanted to give me an experience. This suffering that I went through was necessary; otherwise, I would not have learned the needed lesson and taken the message seriously. Now this message I am giving to an my disciples.</p>
<p>The sauna can be very dangerous if you try to lose five or six pounds all at once. The sauna should be used only for ten or fifteen minutes — not for an hour or two. Eat less and run more: this is the only cure for weight problems. The only answer is to run and then to not eat, to not eat and then to run. In my case I also put weights on my legs and get very good exercise when I walk.</p>
<p>Those who say they don't eat and still gain weight have to pray to the goddess of air: "Please don't come near me." As the Indians traditionally pray to Saturn, "Saturn, please don't come near me," they have to pray to the air goddess or the wind god, "Please don't come near me, because if you come, I gain weight."</p>
<p>Recently I took some pills which Dhananjaya bought in Mexico. If you take these Mexican pills, you may lose nine pounds but you get unbearable cramps. The other day I took them, only to die. When I got the cramps, I screamed from upstairs for help. Baoul and Databir were outside. They heard me calling, but because of the birds' screaming, nobody in the house could hear me. Now Dhanu has installed a buzzer system in the house so that I can be heard from upstairs. It rings in every room of the house.</p>
<p>The Mexican pills were not as dangerous as the sauna, but they were still quite dangerous. From now on I have decided, "No pills, no sauna!"</p>

<p>I am just starting to run again, but still I cherish wishful thinking! Before I start running, I am hoping to run my fastest. Then, after 400 metres, I stop. I can't run even one mile! For 400 metres I walk and for 400 metres I run. Then 800 metres I walk and 800 I run.</p>
<p>Today I ran three miles. For the first two miles I walked for 400 metres and I ran for 400 metres. This is what happens when you don't practise for a month. In Puerto Rico I had a tooth problem and a very high fever, so I couldn't run. So many other things as well have prevented me from training.</p>

<p>Today we went to run five miles in the marathon held in Eisenhower Park. It was all confusion! The police car made a wrong turn, so the first ten runners who were following it had to run a half mile more.</p>
<p>The course was five loops, so it was very confusing. Pahar and Nirvik could not follow the signs. After running five miles, we ran 400 or 500 metres extra!</p>
<p>Cahit Yeter was running, and he was very happy to see me. Among the disciples, Christopher ran for twelve or thirteen miles. Trishul was exhausted because he had already run two other races recently. This was his third race in three weeks.</p>
<p>Ketan was with us in the back seat while we were driving. Databir kept asking Ketan for directions, and Ketan immediately gave readymade answers.</p>
<p>There were about thirty disciples, mostly Canadians, who went to see our performance and cheer us while we ran.</p>

<p>When I had covered only 500 metres, a young boy smiled at me and said to me, "How is your business going on?" Now, what is my business?</p>
<p>Later, a young man offered me a can of beer. I smiled at him. He said afterwards to the people in the car that there was much protein in beer.</p>

<p>Once a seeker was misusing his occult power by showing light, so Sri Ramakrishna took away the light. Ramakrishna did the man a big favour. But Abhipsa was not misusing his light, so I didn't take it away.</p>

<p>I do so much hill work! Today I did two miles in this area, and then I went to Yonkers and ran another two and a half miles. In Yonkers there are frightening hills.</p>
<p>Dhanu was driving, and Databir, Ila and Nirvik were in the car. They are all witnesses.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The blind runner</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The blind runner" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This afternoon I went to Yonkers to run. The marks for the Westchester Half-Marathon have now become nearly invisible, so Dhanu couldn't follow the proper course while driving near me in his car. I saw the marks, but I had more faith in him than in myself, so I followed the car.</p>
<p>After half a mile, I realised that he had made a wrong turn. Then we retraced our steps until we came to a particular side street. I remembered from our previous training runs that it was the correct street, so I was looking over my shoulder at the car and signalling for Dhanu to come. He was ahead of me forty or fifty metres. While I was still looking backwards, I started running in the street.</p>
<p>Two young boys were passing by-one was running and the other was cycling. The boy who was cycling went right onto the sidewalk to avoid me and said to the other boy, "Can't you see this blind man? He is looking in one direction and running in the other direction."</p>
<p>The other boy said, "He can't do a thing." He didn't listen to the other one and kept running on the street.</p>
