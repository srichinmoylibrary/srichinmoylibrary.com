  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why is there such a big difference between the capacities of various human beings?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why is there such a big difference between the capacities of various human beings?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In a garden, why should there be only one type of plant? Why should there be only roses? A rose garden is beautiful, true. But there are hundreds of plants producing hundreds of flowers — some big, some small, some white, some red, and so forth. All of them give us joy in their own way.</p>
<p>Suppose you are the most beautiful person on earth and somebody else is the most powerful person. You are beauty incarnate and he is power incarnate. Human nature is such that both of you are not satisfied. You will think that power is more important than beauty and he will think that beauty is more important than power.</p>
<p>Then God says to you, "I gave you beauty. Now try to create more beauty in your heart, in your mind, in your vital, in your body." To the other person, God will say, "I gave you power. Now you can have more power in your heart, in your mind — everywhere."</p>
<p>God wants you to be a rose, and God wants him to be a lotus. Then each of you can spread your unique fragrance. But you are not satisfied with what you have. You want to grab what he has, and he wants to grab what you have. Your dissatisfaction is the gap that divides you. Human life is always the story of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>At times it may happen that God may give us more capacities in different fields. In your hunger for power, you cry and cry to God. Eventually, He may say, "All right, let me give him a little power. If I give him a little power, then he will work better for Me." And to the one who is crying for beauty, if it is God's Will, God may say, "Let me give him a little beauty. Perhaps he will do better work for Me."</p>
<p>Then God says, "If I give them both a little more compassion, a little more light, then each one will be able to do more." God started with one capacity, but if He wants to give you more capacities in different fields, then you will be able to inspire more people on earth. The more capacities you have in different fields, the more opportunity you are getting, from the spiritual point of view, to serve people.</p>
<p>If you go to a very big garden, you will see there all kinds of flowers. How do you know which flower is going to conquer your heart, the big ones or the small ones? All are needed.</p>
<p>Similarly, all the notes in the musical scale are needed, but I happen to like 6½ the most. That note gives me much more joy than 4½ or 5½. Those notes are also needed to go up to 6½, but as soon as I hear 6½, my heart absolutely melts. When I go up to 8 and then come down to 6½, how soulfully I can sing there! Whereas, if I come down to 4½, I find that it is a dry note. But again, all the notes are needed, all the three octaves are needed. If I press only 6½, what kind of melody will it be? So I use all the notes, but when I come to my most favourite one, I get the utmost joy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Should a disciple bring his bad qualities forward when he is in front of you?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Should a disciple bring his bad qualities forward when he is in front of you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely. Once a disciple went to his Master and said, "The whole day I have been praying and meditating. My mind is pure, my vital is pure, everything is pure. I feel that if I can continue like this for a few months, I will realise God. But, alas, when I come before you, all my bad qualities, all the lower forces in my nature, come to the fore and I am exposed. In a fleeting second, I see how horrible I am. During the day I was not hiding from you. I was only praying to you to give me purity. And I feel that you <em>did</em> give me purity. So why do these forces have to come forward?" The poor disciple was so miserable.</p>
<p>Then the spiritual Master said to him, "Have you come to me to hide something or have you come to me to give me what you have and to take from me what I am? Do not hide, my son. You think you are free from those forces because the whole day you have been so pure, so happy. But now you come to me and you see that it is not true. You have not conquered them. Who is going to help you? Am I your examiner that I will give you zero? Or am I the one who loves you at every moment? I am your compassionate Guru; I am the one to help you. If you feel that I am the one to help you with these impure thoughts, then why do you have to worry? But you have to give them to me. Unfortunately, now you are hiding them, holding them. You are wondering what I will think of you. You are afraid that I will take you as the worst possible creature. Your Master only thinks badly of you when you want to hide these things."</p>
<p>So this was the spiritual Master's answer. During the day, when the disciple was praying and meditating, these forces were hiding. But when the disciple was in front of the Master, that is the time these forces were trying to make his life miserable. They were trying to make the disciple feel that the Master was thinking low of him. What kinds of rogues these hostile forces are!</p>
<p>It is the Master's bounden duty to be of service to the Supreme inside the particular seeker. They will work together. But a third party, the hostile force, wants to come and separate them and make the disciple feel how horrible he is so that he will become disgusted with his spiritual life and say, "O Master, I have prayed and meditated for so many years and still you have not cured this problem. I have not made any progress. Why then do I need you, Master?" This is how they want to break the relationship between the Master and the disciple.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Spiritual Masters come to transform the world. Do the wrong forces in the world at large deliberately challenge a spiritual Master?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Spiritual Masters come to transform the world. Do the wrong forces in the world at large deliberately challenge a spiritual Master?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual Master represents light, while these wrong forces represent darkness. The spiritual Master has come into the world to change the nature of darkness. So from the point of view of these wrong forces, the spiritual Master is an enemy.</p>
<p>Ignorance is saying, "I am fast asleep. I am enjoying my life as it is." A spiritual Master will say to ignorance, "You can see the light, but you are ignoring it." Then ignorance says to the spiritual Master, "You stay with light. My darkness is my light."</p>
<p>Idle people do not do anything, but they are seeing in their idleness, in their laziness, their light. In that way, they are satisfied. Spiritual Masters are sent by God, they are commissioned by the Highest. God tells them, "You go and awaken the sleeping humanity." So spiritual Masters try to transform untold lives with their love, affection and light.</p>
<p>Ignorance forces feel that if they can come and attack and conquer the spiritual Master, then they will be able to enjoy their rest. If they can destroy the spiritual Master, then they will be able to continue their supremacy. The spiritual Master, on his part, believes that if he can transform ignorance, then it will be for the betterment of the whole world. This is the difference. The spiritual Master cares for the good of the world, whereas ignorance cares only for its own supremacy.</p>

I am curious as to what you are doing at this time." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not need to tap my third eye in order to open it up! No, it is not like that. I am not playing tabla on my forehead! I place my will-power there and immediately my third eye opens up. But sometimes if I have to enter with my physical body into the gross physical world — not the vital world or the psychic world — in order to do something, then I do it. I am going from the physical to the physical. Again, if I massage my third eye all of a sudden, those who are around me will be more attentive. They will think, "O my God, Guru is doing something serious inwardly," which is true. Then they will be more alert. They will try to be more careful or conscious. That also helps me. Otherwise, they will be talking and moving around.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can you turn off all your inner vision faculties and just see the world as we mere mortals see it? Or do you constantly see all these other layers all at once?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can you turn off all your inner vision faculties and just see the world as we mere mortals see it? Or do you constantly see all these other layers all at once?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spiritual Masters can see them all at once. It is like what you call bleachers. The first, second, third, fourth rows and so on are all at different heights. If you want to cover them all at once, you can. Again, if those who are in the fourth row are more receptive, then the Master has to pay more attention to them.</p>
<p>Usually I am doing more than one thing at a time. Even when I am on stage during my concerts, I go from one plane to another. I am going up, up, up. If I see that one particular plane is more receptive, then when I am coming down, I go there. I hold my consciousness at that place for a few seconds so that I can give more. Sometimes two planes will offer so much receptivity. They do not have to be on the physical plane. My subtle consciousness has gone much higher than the level you are on when you are seated on the chair. At that time, I will not see even an iota of darkness because I am embodying the light and I am seeing this light reflected all around, like in a mirror. When I am in my highest, absolutely no world darkness can enter into me or be near me.</p>
<p>Then I try to be of service to the audience. I am bringing down light and here somebody will be receptive and twenty metres further away somebody else will be receptive. You cannot say that all the people in one area will be receptive — no, no, no. One will be receptive and five or six will be in a very unaspiring consciousness. The ones who are sincere and aspiring will definitely feel something. For those two or three minutes when I stand up before we start and again after I finish the concert, I try to give so much, so much, specially to people who are praying and meditating sincerely from the beginning to the end. They receive so much.</p>
<p>Then the question is, "How do you know they receive? How do you know that you are getting any result from your concerts?" Spiritual Masters know these things occultly. I know that the inspiration, joy and love that I pour into so many human beings lasts. The audience members start to value their own spirituality. They do not have to value the light they felt in me, no. They value, plus they create and develop, their own inner hunger to pray to God, to meditate on God. For two weeks or three months or even much longer they try to become a good person. Previously perhaps it was out of the question for them to pray to God. They had their own life, smoking, drinking and so forth. But when they attend the concert, they get a kind of fresh inspiration. That inspiration or light that has entered into them takes positive action. After some time, they may again return to their former lives, but they get an opportunity to become a better, more divine person. So that is the help that we give to them.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do you suffer when the disciples inwardly offer you their thoughts and problems?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do you suffer when the disciples inwardly offer you their thoughts and problems?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the disciples offer me their doubts, fears, worries, anxieties, lower vital thoughts and so forth, I am very happy because I can play the role of the ocean. You are the drops. You may feel, "I am such an ugly, filthy drop." But I represent the ocean. I can absorb all your thoughts and problems. The struggle starts when you try to hold onto those thoughts.</p>
<p>Some people want to prove how pure they are. When they do not offer me their thoughts, it becomes much harder for me. When they give them to me, it becomes my responsibility because I am the ocean. But if the drops want to hold onto those thoughts, then it becomes more difficult.</p>
<p>Let us take the example of children. Some children do not want to take a shower or bath. When the hour comes, they hide from their parents. If they come near the parents, they are afraid the parents will say, "You are so dirty!" Eventually the parents force them to take a bath or shower and they do it very reluctantly. Then the children do get some joy. But the fact is that they get much more joy if they take a bath themselves than if the parents force them. Sometimes they want to do what is good, but they do not want to be dictated to. In their mind they have decided they will do the right thing, but the moment the parents ask them, they revolt. The egos of the children come forward. They do not want the parents to get the credit. So if they can do it on their own, they get much more joy than when they are forced to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Here also, a spiritual Master can compel the wrong forces in somebody to come forward. He can just grab the wrong forces and take them, but then you will not get the same joy. If you do something on your own, you will get much more joy.</p>
<p>Tagore wrote one very nice poem in which Mother Earth says to God, "God, You can do everything in the twinkling of an eye. You can sow the seed and let it germinate. Then it will become a huge plant, a tree."</p>
<p>God replies, "Yes, I can do everything. But if you garden, if you dig for a few hours and then put a little seed in the ground and watch it germinate in the course of time, then you will be able to tell the whole world, 'Look! I worked so hard. Now I have got the results.'"</p>
<p>Personal effort gives us tremendous joy. Parents can force the children to do the right thing, but children will get much more joy if they do it on their own. Otherwise, there is every possibility that they will revolt.</p>
<p>If somebody gives you a mango, you get so much joy. But if you know how to climb up the tree and pluck the mango yourself, you are bound to get infinitely more joy. When you do something personally, you get more joy always.</p>
<p>If you can get up on your own at six o'clock in the morning to pray and meditate, you will be so happy. But if your parents have to push you or your friends have to wake you up, yes, you will meditate, but you will not get the same joy because you were helped by a third party. Sometimes you may even become annoyed. On the one hand, you want to get up but, on the other hand, you do not want others to interfere.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, when you give your wrong thoughts to the spiritual Master on your own, it is much easier for him to help you transform them. When you hold back, he is compelled to act like a parent who is forcing the children to do the right thing, but you do not get the same joy.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are on the verge of realising God! <em>[laughter]</em> Actually it can be both. It can be intuition, or it can mean that at that point you have come to my wavelength. That level may not be my highest, but whichever level I was on, your consciousness was there so you were able to see what was happening. Had you been one level higher or lower, you could not have seen.</p>
<p>In a broad sense, you can say these things are intuition, but I prefer to say that your consciousness was at that time elevated to a particular plane. On a practical level, a real level, it is the level of consciousness. It is where I have put my consciousness that I want to operate on. Your consciousness happened to be there. So it is the same wavelength. That is why you were able to see.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, at that time you have to feel that I am not doing it. At that time, your consciousness, your heart, were extremely receptive. When you are receptive, then one of my beings will try to show you something that I am going to do on the physical plane in the immediate future. Your receptivity has touched my heart, so my heart is trying to give you a kind of reward. In a particular way, I am doing something new, something special for you. But I have to give credit to your receptivity to start with. If you were not receptive, I could not have taken you to that level. It is a very, very good experience.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you want an immediate result, at that time it is the right thing to do to pray to God, "Save me, save me, save me! Protect me!" But on a regular basis, it is better to offer the prayer, "O Supreme, do give me Your Light, give me Your Love, Your Peace, Your Delight." The regular way will remain permanently. If you pray for these divine qualities regularly, then doubt will not remain inside you, insecurity will not be there, darkness will not be there.</p>
<p>Once you get a sudden attack, it is an emergency. Then it is absolutely necessary to say, "Help me, help me! Save me, save me!" That is the only way to get immediate relief. But on a daily basis, if you pray to the Supreme for His Protection, Love, Joy and so forth, you will be cured.</p>
<p>So one way will cure you, slowly and steadily, and the other way will save you, sooner than at once. Then again, you can have the same problem in the future, whereas if you are cured, the problem will not be repeated.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a matter of identification. Your identification with me is now transferred to your customers. If you did not keep your identification with me directly, you could not have read their minds. Your connection with me was established before you were able to read their minds. If it is cut, the link is snapped, then you will not be able to read their minds or their hearts. Because your connection is established with the source, then easily you can read their minds.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When you see us, if we have doubt or insecurity or any wrong forces or good forces, is it a matter of seeing something in our aura or are you seeing our thoughts or are you seeing the actual forces in us? How is it that you read our consciousness?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When you see us, if we have doubt or insecurity or any wrong forces or good forces, is it a matter of seeing something in our aura or are you seeing our thoughts or are you seeing the actual forces in us? How is it that you read our consciousness?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To start with, I am not reading, I am not reading. I am not eager, I am not even curious to know what is happening inside your mind. That I do on very, very rare occasions. In general, I will not. Most of the time what happens is that the flower inside you is trying to show me, "Look, now I am no longer blooming, I am blossomed. This petal is fully blossomed, that petal is fully blossomed." Five or six different petals you are showing me. I am the seer, I am witnessing, but in no way am I trying to force you to show me or am I curious to know what you have inside you.</p>
<p>When a child has something, at that time the father does not say, "Can you show me what you have?" No, the child is so eager to show the father that he comes running, "Look! I have this, I have this." In the same way, when my spiritual children have something very beautiful inside them, they are eager to show me. But I am not begging them, "Tell me what you have or what you are doing or what you have in your mind." No. But you are coming like a little child to show the spiritual father, "Look, look, I have such beautiful things to show you." Then I will appreciate them. After I have appreciated them, I will say, "I am so happy that you are satisfied, but again, in a few days or a few months or a few years, you will have much more beautiful things."</p>
<p>So, on my part, I am in no way eager or anxious to know what is happening inside you. When we come to a certain height, we are not eager to know what is happening in somebody's brain. Disciples can be eager to know what is inside the spiritual Master's mind, whether he is thinking of them or not, but he is not eager to know in that way. The spiritual Master's attitude is, "If you have something, then you can come and show me." Then, as I said before, you get the joy because on your own you have come to show the Master what you have. Your eagerness has to compel the Master. He is not going to say, "Show me if you have something inside you worth watching or worth having." I am not going to examine anybody's thoughts. It is the disciple's bounden duty to give and take. Whatever you are, whatever you have, you give me, and whatever you want to take, take, take, take. I am ready.</p>
<p>This is called openness of the heart, openness of life. When you are open, then you increase the receptivity of your inner vessel. When the father sees the child running towards him with a dime, the father is overjoyed. The child could have gone and bought something from the street, but instead he came running to his dearest, to his father, to show what he has. Then the father says, "My child is so happy with a dime. I want to increase his joy. I will give him a dollar."</p>
<p>Always if you give what you have and what you are, even if it is a drop, then when the Master gives, he gives much more. When the little child came running to the father early in the morning to show him what he had, the father was so pleased because he saw that he was the child's dearest. We do not go to our enemy to show what we have.</p>
<p>So that is the answer to your question. If I have to spend time on what is happening in this person's mind or that person's mind, then I am only wasting my time. Again, if the disciple wants to know, not out of sheer mental curiosity but out of oneness, what is happening inside the spiritual Master, then there is a way. With your love, devotion and surrender, you can enter into the Master's heart. Then definitely you will see and feel what is inside his heart, what is inside his consciousness. Out of curiosity, if you want to see, you will get nothing. But out of oneness-necessity if you want, at that time necessity will compel you to bring your love, devotion and surrender to the fore.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Preserve silence, silence, silence</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Preserve silence, silence, silence" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Silence prevails. Sound ultimately fails. I shall tell you a funny story. Some of you perhaps have heard it, but most of you have not. This story happened when I was eight or nine years old. Because of the second World War, nobody knew what would happen next. So my brother Chitta went to the market and bought rice and dhal and other things in a very large quantity. He and I were standing at a particular place in the market. We were not selling anything. Only we were standing there.</p>
<p>My brother was reciting passages from the <em>Upanishads</em>, sacred mantras. I heard these mantras many, many times when I was a small child, but at that time I did not pay much attention because I was restlessness incarnate. Only four or five years later, when I was in the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, my restlessness completely disappeared and I was the one to recite them loudly thousands of times, sometimes millions of times.</p>
<p>Anyway, my brother was reciting most soulfully. All on a sudden, a middle-aged man came up to us and he started screaming at my brother, "Your father borrowed money from me, and he has passed away. Now who is going to give me the money back? You! You have to give me the money."</p>
<p>This man happened to be the manager of a circus. Why would my father borrow money from the manager of a circus? My brother did not pay any attention to the man and his shouting became loud, louder, loudest. He was almost ready to strike my brother. I was getting so annoyed that I was about to do something. But then the man suddenly left. I continued pumping my football with a pump. Then I was ready to go.</p>
<p>In ten or twelve minutes' time, the man came back. Once again, my brother did not pay any attention to him. On his part, there was only silence, silence. The man came and fell flat at my brother's feet. This time he was not shouting but crying. Why? My brother did not have to return any money. It was this man who had borrowed money from my father! He thought my brother would ask him for the money, but my brother was not even aware of it. My brother knew nothing about it. When the man saw the saintly qualities of my brother, his conscience came to the fore. Then he had to come back and beg for forgiveness. He said, "I was the one to borrow money from your father. But I do not have any means to return the money."</p>
<p>My brother again remained silent. He did not say a word. Then the man went away. He knew that my brother was not paying any attention to him.</p>
<p>So here you can see how silence acts. As much as you can, try to preserve silence, silence, silence. In the beginning, the barking dogs disturb us so much. But when we have poise, inner poise, the barking dogs surrender. Quite often we are advised by our Inner Pilot that when people bite us ruthlessly, we cannot come down to their level to bite them. There should be some difference between a dog biting and a man biting. The very nature of a dog is to bark and bite. But, after some time, the dogs stop biting because their ego starts operating. It is beneath their dignity to bark when the man is not responding.</p>
<p>I have said many times how we can know whether it is a friend or an enemy who is knocking at the door. The friend will knock a few times, and the friend will think, "He is doing something important. Otherwise, he would have definitely opened the door for me. He has such love for me, I have such love for him." Then the friend will wait patiently.</p>
<p>The enemy will knock hard for a few minutes. Then the enemy's ego will come to the fore and he will say, "It is beneath my dignity to knock at his door. Who needs him? I will have nothing to do with him."</p>
<p>So the enemy disappears, but the friend stays because the friend knows there is something important going on inside. That is why you are not opening the door.</p>
<p>A fly sits on your hand and you brush it away. Then it comes back and again you brush it away. Twenty or thirty times it returns. Then you decide that you want to compose a beautiful song or you want to write something. You cannot pay attention to those flies. What happens? You see that the flies have all disappeared. Why? It is their inborn ego. You are not paying any attention to them, so why do they have to stay?</p>
<p>Enemies always try to draw attention by hook or by crook. When you ignore, ignore, ignore, these enemies disappear. They go and knock at somebody else's door. When you pay attention to them, it only creates more problems.</p>
<p>So silence is the answer. That is also the theme of my famous story, <em>Silence Liberates.</em></p>

<p>There was a time when my ignorance-ocean thought that mantras could be written only in Sanskrit. Ignorance vast was my name. Then, when I read and studied Sri Aurobindo's <em>Savitri</em>, wisdom dawned on me. I came to realise that mantras can be created in English as well. My wisdom increased when I read the lines of some well-known English poets. To my great surprise and joy, English poets have definitely created mantras. About other languages, forgive me, I do not speak those languages, so I have no right to say. I am sure that other languages also have offered mantras.</p>
<p>Now I know that mantras are not the sole monopoly of Sanskrit or the sole monopoly of English. They can be the most divine wealth of each and every language.</p>
<p>Our Lord Beloved Absolute Supreme, out of His infinite Bounty, has created thousands of soul-stirring, heart-elevating and life-awakening mantras, incantations, in English, in and through your Master.</p>

<h2>These birds are a new creation, the creation that will sing the song of Immortality in the life of mortality</h2>

<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme, my life is fast approaching my 62nd birthday. Today I am offering 62,000 soul-birds from the depths of my gratitude-heart to You, to You, my Lord Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Each bird embodies a prayerful and soulful heartbeat of my earthly existence. May all the birds that I have offered to You fly in the Sky of Your ever-expanding Compassion for the progress of humanity. Humanity's progress entirely depends on peace, and this peace is Your unconditional boon to mankind.</p>
<p>My Lord, like the birds, may all human beings sleeplessly and breathlessly fly in Your Compassion, Protection and Perfection-flooded Sky.</p>
<p>To each of you who has worked on this project, I am giving my heart of gratitude. God alone knows whether I will draw more or not, but the joy that these 62,000 birds have given me will remain deathless in my heart. How self-givingly you have helped me in exhibiting these 62,000 drawings! These birds are all flying, flying in the boundless sky of freedom and peace. My Lord Beloved Supreme will shower you all with His boundless Love, boundless Joy and boundless Pride. As a matter of fact, He is already doing it.</p>
<p>These birds are a new creation, the creation that will sing the song of Immortality in the life of mortality. Each bird that we see flying in the sky around us is the self-giving Heartbeat of our Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>Right now my spirituality-world is not giving joy to the entire aspiring mankind. But my art-world, specially my birds, will be able to give joy to each and every human being on earth. Whether or not you believe in the existence of these soul-birds, whether or not you believe these souls are direct representatives of God, these birds will be able to make each and every human being happy — consciously happy, illuminingly happy and fulfillingly happy. These bird-drawings will be able to give joy to each and every human being.</p>
<p>Even in the case of my disciples, from time to time some of you do not get joy from reading my books. But, I assure you, these birds and my other paintings will give you joy any hour of the day or night. The joy, the ecstasy, the delight which they have and they are have a free access to your heart of aspiration and your life of dedication. If at times your aspiration goes down, no harm. These birds will bring your aspiration back to the fore.</p>
<p>I do hope in this lifetime of mine or yours that one day all the birds can be preserved or at least exhibited either in a museum or in a special big hall. It will be a memorable contribution to the world at large from me and from my disciples all over the world.</p>
<p>I have created these birds with my inspiration, and these birds are creating me with their aspiration. I know it and I want all of you to know it and feel it. I want all of you to grow into the beauty, divinity and immortality of these birds that are direct representatives and genuine embodiments of the Immortal Divine within us.</p>

<p>In silence you will say only two words while you are meditating: 'Supreme' and <em>Jharna-Kala</em>. Please feel that you are bringing down the highest Blessings from our Lord Beloved Supreme into the soul, into the heart and into the life of Jharna-Kala.</p>
<p>We have completed 70,000 birds. I have given them the name: <em>My Heart's Seventy Thousand Soul-Bird-Flights.</em> While looking at the birds, please feel that you yourself are a bird; you are your soul-bird flying in the Sky of infinite Freedom, infinite Light, infinite Peace and infinite Bliss. The soul is the only reality. Everything else is false.</p>
<p>When I complete 100,000 birds, by your grace, we shall give a banquet. We shall celebrate the birthdays of 100,000 birds.</p>
<p>Every bird gives me tremendous joy. In a few seconds I draw it, and immediately I get joy, for a new creation has come to serve God, who is our Lord Supreme. When you look at them, think that these birds have come down all the way from Heaven to be of service to our Lord Supreme. This will help you to imagine your own soul, which is Immortality's representative on earth, and to feel that your own soul has also come from Heaven to serve your Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>The more you think of your soul, the more progress you will be able to make here on earth. This is the supreme secret: the more you think of your soul, the faster you can make progress. And these birds embody the soul-consciousness in full measure.</p>
