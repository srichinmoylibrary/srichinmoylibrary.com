<p><em>(Shaivya tomes to the cremation ground. At the gate of the cremation ground a longbearded chandala, a most ugly-looking fiend, blocks her way.)</em></p>
<p>CHANDALA: Stop here! Have you brought rice? Have you brought cloth? Have you brought money?</p>
<p>SHAIVYA: Alas, I have no rice, I have no cloth, I have no money.</p>
<p>CHANDALA: What? How dare you then enter the cremation ground? Where is your husband? Where is the boy’s father?</p>
<p>SHAIVYA: My husband <em>(bitterly weeping and sobbing)</em> was once a great man. I don’t know where he is now. I work as a slave in the kitchen of a rich man. I asked the master of the family to give me some rice, cloth and money before I came here, but he refused. He said to me brutally, “I can’t give you rice, cloth and money. I can’t give you all that. Never. I feed you. I feed two big bellies. Is that not enough?” So I am helpless! I came here with nothing.</p>
<p>CHANDALA: I understand all that. I fully sympathise with you. But how can I perform my job without my fee? If I do it free, my master will be furious. I have to listen to my master. It is my bounden duty to please my master. I have to give him everything that I get from this cremation ground. I have no choice.</p>
<p>SHAIVYA: O Harish Chandra, where are you? Our beloved son Rohitashwa is now with God. Here I am left alone, utterly helpless, with his body. O Harish Chandra, O my beloved, where are you?</p>
<p><em>(The chandala, hearing his name, falls down on the ground and loses consciousness. Shaivya stoops to help him. A few minutes later he regains consciousness and takes his son in his arms.)</em></p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: Shaivya, forgive this lower-than-lowest creature. Your Harish Chandra is here. Shaivya, my Shaivya, you are the citadel of strength. You are the lighthouse of purity.</p>
<p>SHAIVYA: You! You! My husband! My beloved! Our lost son brings his parents back. Our lost son reunites his parents!</p>
<p><em>(Harish Chandra’s master and Vishwamitra appear.)</em></p>
<p>CHANDALA: Harish Chandra, leave your son on the ground. Listen to me. <em>(Harish Chandra places his son most carefully on the ground.)</em> Harish Chandra, your past experiences are past indeed! All your tests are over. Victory dawns on you. I am Yamaraj, the King of Death. Vishwamitra and I have tested your sincerity, your love of truth and your sacrifice. Victory, eternal Victory transcendental Victory, dawns today on your devoted head and surrendered heart.</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: Alas, the third member of our family is no more with us. Our dearest son Rohitashwa fails to share our joy. Our lives without him will be filled with excruciating pangs, utterly meaningless and fruitless.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Where is your child?</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: There he is lying, O mighty sage.</p>
<p><em>(Vishwamitra sprinkles a few drops of sacred water over the dead body of Rohitashwa. Rohitashwa immediately jumps up and clasps his mother.)</em></p>
<p>ROHITASHWA: Mother, Mother, where were your Where was I?</p>
<p><em>(The King embraces his son with his heart’s boundless love and pride. The three bow to Vishwamitra. The parents kiss the dust of his feet. Vishwamitra garlands the King, the Queen and the Prince.)</em></p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Harish Chandra, I shall cherish your life of sacrifice. The entire world shall praise your Kingdom of Heaven. Forever and forever your heart the world will treasure. I am giving you back your palace and your Kingdom. Your faith in yourself and Truth’s faith in you will march together along the road of Immortality. You will transmit the message of truth on the inner waves of the heart.</p>
<p>You are God’s Love. You are God’s Joy. You are God’s Pride. You are God’s All.</p>
<p><em>(Harish Chandra and Shaivya kneel down before the sage. Shaivya sings.)</em></p>
<p>God then was Love So nice and fine. God then was mine Below, above.</p>
<p>God now is Light Delight, Delight. My All, my All God now is Light.</p>

<p>AYODADHOMMYA: What have you eaten, my son, for breakfast and lunch? Have you had a decent meal?</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: Oh, while the cows were grazing, I went out for some time and begged a little food from door to door. That is what I ate, Father.</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: Unthinkable! You didn’t have my permission! You didn’t ask me whether you could go out to beg food from others while the cows were grazing. You must not do that. That is not right.</p>

<p>AYODADHOMMYA: So, today you have done a fine job. I am sure that today you didn’t go out for food. But strangely enough, you seem quite strong despite not having eaten today. Have you not eaten anything?</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: O Master, I drank some milk.</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: Milk? From the cows? Is that milk meant for you to drink?</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: Oh no, Master. What actually happened is this. When the calves had finished drinking their milk, I drank the very little milk that remained m the udders of the cows.</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: That is unfair, unfair! That milk is not meant for you, even if it is left. It is meant for the calves if they want to come back again. The very little that was left, they could have drunk. Unthinkable! I never expected you to behave that way! All right, I forgive you. But don’t do it anymore!</p>

<p>AYODADHOMMYA: Froth?</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: After they have drunk the milk from their mothers, there remains a kind of froth around their mouths. So I drank that.</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: Unthinkable! How could you do that? When those little, innocent creatures have some milk around their mouths, gradually they lick it off. How could you drink it? Unthinkable! I have never seen a boy like you, always disobedient. Every day you drink or eat something without my knowledge or per mission. You must not do that. You must not drink any more milk or froth, and you must not go from door to door to collect food. You must not do any of that.</p>

<p><em>(Early the next morning Upamanyu, as usual, goes to the grazing ground with the cows.)</em></p>
<p>UPAMANYU: Today I am very hungry and very thirsty. For the last two days I have eaten almost nothing. In the evening I get food at Master’s place, but that is very scanty. Previously, Master’s wife used to give me a delicious meal three times a day, and I used to eat voraciously. Now I do not have breakfast or lunch at all, so the food I get in the evening is not enough. I do not know what is wrong with me or what is wrong with them that I am not allowed to eat my three meals a day. I am so hungry! What can I eat? Ah, I shall eat some leaves, just to fill my stomach.</p>
<p><em>(He goes to a tree and eats some leaves. Slowly, his eyesight begins to fail. Evening sets in and the cows begin to go home without their master. Upamanyu cannot see, but he tries to follow them anyway. On the way he falls into a dry well, and he cannot get out.)</em></p>

<p><em>(It is dark outside. The cows have returned without Upamanyu. Ayodadhommya goes out to look for his disciple.)</em></p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: Upamanyu, Upamanyu!</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: I am here, Master!</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: Where are you?</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: I don’t know where I am, but I am here!</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: Ah, you are in a well! What is wrong with you? What have you eaten today?</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: I have not eaten anything.</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: Nothing?</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: No food, Master. Only a few leaves from a tree. Now I can’t see, I have no eyesight. While I was coming back home I fell into this well, and now I cannot get out.</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA <em>(shocked)</em>: Upamanyu, again? Have you disobeyed me again? You have not asked permission from me to eat leaves. You have undoubtedly eaten leaves from the arka tree, and these leaves destroy the eyesight. Now you have lost your sight. What can I do? Disobedience, always disobedience. At first you begged food from door to door. Then you drank milk from the udders of the cows. Then you licked froth from the mouths of the innocent little calves. And now you have eaten leaves. You have to pay the penalty. I cannot help you.</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: Well, Master, if you do not help me, I shall have to remain here. But I shall pray to you. I shall pray to you for forgiveness. I have eaten these arka leaves, and now I have become blind. It is my own fault, so let me remain blind; but I shall pray to God to give you someone who will be able to take your cows to the pasture every day and bring them back.</p>
<p><em>(Ayodadhommya helps Upamanyu out of the well.)</em></p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: Just because of your disobedience you are now suffering. I did not want you to eat anything. The first time I scolded you, you should have understood me and taken me seriously. You should not have eaten anything at all. Every time you ate, I kept telling you, “Unthinkable,” “Unpardonable,” and you should have learned. You should have understood that my intention was for you not to eat anything without my permission.</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: Master, I ate practically nothing. I drank practically nothing.</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: But you did eat; you did drink.</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: Yes, Master. Forgive me, Master. I shall not do it anymore.</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: But you are of no use to me now. You have failed me. You are blind. You cannot help me in anything. And it is all because of your disobedience. Outwardly I told you that you must not eat anything, and inwardly I also told you. You did not understand my inner message and you did not obey my outer message. If you had not eaten for a few days, you would not have died. But look at your disobedience. All right, Upamanyu, I forgive you, but I cannot give you your sight back. Pray to the Ashwinikumar, the divine doctors. Invoke their presence. If they are pleased with you, they will come and cure your eyes.</p>

<p><em>(With folded hands Upamanyu invokes the presence of the Ashwinikumar most sincerely and devotedly. The Ashwinikumar enter.)</em></p>
<p>ASHWINIKUMAR: Upamanyu, you are praying to us and we have come to you. Tell us, what can we do for you?</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: I have lost my vision by disobeying my Master. Please cure me.</p>
<p>ASHWINIKUMAR: That’s easy. Just eat this pill.</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: No, no, I can’t.</p>
<p>ASHWINIKUMAR: Why? What is wrong with this pill?</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: I have to get permission from my Master. Without his permission, I can’t eat anything.</p>
<p>ASHWINIKUMAR: You fool, your Master is so unkind, so cruel! He himself did not give you anything to eat. He did not allow you to beg food from others. He did not allow you to drink the scanty milk from the udders of the cows. He did not allow you to lick the froth from the mouths of the calves. And now you have to get permission from your Master to take this pill! What kind of Master is he? Stone-hearted, cruel, brutal! You are a fool! You don’t need that kind of Master.</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: Oh, please do not speak ill of my Master. He knows what is best for me. I am so grateful that you have come here, but I can’t eat your pill right now.</p>
<p>ASHWINIKUMAR: Then why did you invoke us?</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: I invoked you to ask you to come here and cure me.</p>
<p>ASHWINIKUMAR: Well, that is what we have come or. We have come to cure you, but you will not let us.</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: But you are giving me something to eat. If you do not give me anything to eat, but just cure my eyes, I shall be most grateful.</p>
<p>ASHWINIKUMAR: No, you have to take the medicine. When one is a patient, he has to eat or drink the medicine prescribed by the doctor. This is our medicine. If you don’t take our medicine, how are you going to be cured, you fool?</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: That is true, that is true. But how can I eat anything without my Master’s permission? You see, I have eaten other things without his permission, and this is my fate: I have become blind because of my disobedience. Now if I disobey him again, who knows what worse things may happen?</p>
<p>ASHWINIKUMAR: But your Master did ask you to meditate on us, to invoke us.</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: Yes, he did.</p>
<p>ASHWINIKUMAR: That means he wanted us to cure you. Now it is up to us to cure you in our way. We are doctors; we have to give you medicine.</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: That is true, that is true. But I can’t take your pills without his permission. I won’t disobey my Master any more.</p>
<p>ASHWINIKUMAR <em>(pleased)</em>: Now you have shown what real obedience is. We are most proud of you. Upamanyu, we will give you back your sight.</p>
<p><em>(He gets back his sight.)</em></p>
<p>UPAMANYIU: I am most grateful to you. I am most grateful to you. <em>(He bows to them.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Exit Upamanyu, running)</em></p>

<p><em>(The home of Ayodadhommya. Upamanyu enters running.)</em></p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: So they came, the Ashwinikumar came and gave you your vision back.</p>
<p>UPAMANYU: Yes, Master.</p>
<p>AYODADHOMMYA: Upamanyu, I have tested your patience, your self-control. Today you passed your examination. You have shown the world what patience is. You have shown the world what self-control is. You have shown the world how one should please one’s Master. One should please one’s Master the way the Master wants to be pleased. Finally, you have pleased <em>me</em> the way I wanted to be pleased. I wanted you to have nothing to eat without my permission. You came to that point. You didn’t even take medicine from the doctors whom I had suggested. You didn’t take so much as a pill from them! There you showed your unconditional obedience to me. I am most proud of you. Today marks the end of your studies. Go home. With my blessing, you will lead a prosperous life, a spiritual life. An inner life of illumination and an outer life of perfection I offer to you. Today I give you oneness with me and all my wisdom, which is Perfection.</p>
