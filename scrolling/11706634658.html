  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What can beginners do about all the thoughts that come during meditation? How long does it take to overcome that?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What can beginners do about all the thoughts that come during meditation? How long does it take to overcome that?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It all depends on how much will-power we have. Some people have tremendous determination and a very strong will, while others do not. Again, determination is not enough. We also have to be able to accept God's Will cheerfully. Right now, let us say, your meditation is disturbed by uncomely thoughts. Perhaps God has decided that in six months or ten months He will bless you with a mind flooded with peace. In that case, you will be extremely happy and grateful. And if it takes longer than that, you should be happy and grateful that He is still inspiring you to meditate faithfully every day.</p>
<p>This does not mean that until God's Hour has struck for you, you will be idle or inactive. It is wrong to pray for just two minutes or five minutes and then give up if you see that your mind is still full of thoughts or if you see that restlessness is in your mind, in your vital and in your physical existence. It is also wrong to expect your mind to become calm and quiet just because you have meditated for two or three minutes.</p>
<p>What can we do about thoughts on a practical level? Let us take thoughts as individuals and take the mind as a room that we live in and own. We have to bolt the door to our mind-room from the inside and not allow anybody whatsoever to enter. We will not only keep out our enemies, which are bad thoughts, but also our friends, the good thoughts. We are determined to enjoy only silence, complete silence.</p>
<p>A few moments later, let us say, a thought begins knocking at our door. We can exercise our compassion or we can exercise our wisdom. Wisdom reminds us that we have made a solemn promise to ourselves that we would not allow anybody to enter into our mind-room. But if we start using compassion, we may say, "Who knows who is coming? Perhaps it is a very good friend of mine." Then, naturally, we will open the door. Alas, the moment we open the door, we may let in an undivine thought. In a fleeting second this undivine thought can steal away all the good feelings that we had been cherishing for the past fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>
<p>So it is best not to open the door under any circumstances. Then, after some time, all the bad thoughts will leave us of their own accord. If the thoughts are undivine, they will have all undivine qualities. They will not have the patience to wait for us to open the door. After waiting outside for a few minutes, these thoughts will say, "It is beneath our dignity to keep on waiting here. If he does not want to see us, we will knock at somebody else's door and bother somebody else."</p>
<p>If it is a good thought, a real and genuine friend of ours, this thought will say, "Oh, perhaps my friend is very busy or doing something special. Otherwise, definitely he would have opened the door. I shall continue to wait patiently." We are forcing that good thought to wait outside for fifteen or thirty minutes. After we have observed our peaceful silence for half an hour or so, we will say, "Now let us see who has come to the door." At that time we will find only our very dear friends waiting for us. These friends are our divine, energising and fulfilling thoughts.</p>
<p>In this way, if we can keep our mind completely silent for fifteen minutes or half an hour, then the dark, unaspiring forces will not be there at the end of our meditation to enter into us. This is how we can have only good thoughts from our meditation. First, we have to block the mind completely and allow no thoughts whatsoever to enter into us. Then, after we have gone deep within and entered into the sea of peace, when we open our mind's door we will find waiting for us only good, divine thoughts.</p>

 <p>
SCA 233-241. Sri Chinmoy was interviewed by an independent film-maker on 28 August 1993 in Chicago in connection with his participation in the World Parliament of Religions. These are excerpts from that interview.</p>
<h2>Question: What do you feel is the significance of this Chicago Parliament of Religions, which may be the largest gathering of the world's religions ever to be held?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual significance of this Parliament, according to my aspiring heart, is interdependence. The one and the many have to realise their interdependence. Just as the tree and its branches, leaves, flowers and fruits are interdependent, so we are all interdependent. Here many religions are meeting together to sing the oneness-heart-song.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I strongly feel that today's centenary of the Parliament of Religions is taking place precisely because of Vivekananda. He was the dreamer, the lover and the possessor of a truly universal spirit. People came to the original Parliament of Religions from various religions and various cultures. In most cases they came to preach or speak about their respective religious beliefs. But Vivekananda came as a lover of humanity to sing the song of a oneness-world-home. He did not come here to propagate the views of his Hindu religion. He came to propagate the one religion that is known as Man. He spoke of the individual man who is evolving into the universal man and consciously accepting the world as his own, very own. Vivekananda was at once an ancient silence-heart and a modern dynamism-life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> According to my inner conviction, spirituality is not something theoretical; it is something practical. Who can be more practical than God Himself? He created the world to give Himself joy and fulfilment. Spirituality is definitely practical; likewise, prayer and meditation are definitely practical. For prayer and meditation to be effective, we need only one thing: the indomitable, heroic spirit that can conquer the pride of impossibility.</p>

The melody and the harmony of music are not only giving joy to mankind but are also helping mankind to reach the highest state of consciousness, which is filled with peace, love, joy and fulfilment.</p>
