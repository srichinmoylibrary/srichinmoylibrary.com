  <h2 id="page-title">God and the human Guru</h2><span property="dc:title" content="God and the human Guru" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The human Guru is only an instrument of the Supreme. I always say that I am not the Guru: the real Guru, the only Guru, the supreme Guru is the Supreme Himself. I am a representative of the Supreme for those who call themselves my disciples. Since those who call themselves my disciples want to reach the Supreme through me, they have to be in my spiritual boat. There are some disciples in my boat who have no faith, no belief in me. They are constantly doubting me and constantly separating me from the Supreme. That is to say, they feel that my boat has nothing to do with the Supreme's Will or the Supreme's Consciousness. But there comes a time when a disciple is fully ripe and lives in his highest consciousness all the time. Then he sees that there is no difference between his Guru and the Supreme.</p>
<p>When I tell my disciples to meditate on my transcendental picture, I take full responsibility for what I say. That is to say, the Supreme is in that picture. But the physical body that you are seeing, you may judge or suspect. You see that I am five feet eight inches tall and so many other things you see in my physical being. But inside the physical is the real spiritual existence, where my total oneness, conscious oneness, complete oneness with the Supreme operates. The disciple's capacity to realise this oneness depends on his achievement in the field of aspiration; it depends on how far or how deeply he has realised me. Somebody will take me as a spiritual Master; somebody else will take me as a philosopher and a third person will take me as a poet. All these things in the outer life can be seen. But if anybody here has ever gone really deep within and entered into me or entered into the Supreme, then he sees that in my deepest consciousness I am totally one with the Supreme. There can be no difference.</p>
<p>Some Gurus in India tell their disciples to pray to them. In India, automatically the disciples feel that their Guru can never be separated from God, so they pray to their Guru. They feel that it is easier and more effective to pray to the Guru than to God. Sri Ramakrishna used to say that God is like a cow. Milk is there in the cow; but if I press the tail or the leg or the nose, I don't get the milk. I get the milk only when I press the udder of the cow. Similarly, God is everywhere in this world. In this wooden plank God exists, but if I break the plank, God is not going to appear. So the representative of God, the Guru is the udder and from there we get the milk. Milk means Compassion, Light, Peace and Bliss.</p>
<p>Your Guru is your spiritual leader, your guide, your real pilot. He is dealing with divine Consciousness, infinite Consciousness, Infinity and Eternity. If you really want Infinity and Eternity, then you have to know that the easiest and most effective way to go to the Supreme is through the Guru, because in this way you can approach the Supreme on the physical plane as well as the inner plane. Even the outer senses are satisfied and you can get an immediate response on that level. If you think of the Supreme, it is all very vague. How many of you really have any conception of the Supreme, even in the mental world? Either He is a human being or He is infinite Consciousness or Energy; these things you may imagine. But you know who I am. You have talked with me so many times; you have meditated with me so many times and many, many times through my eyes you have seen the Light of the Supreme, the Power of the Supreme.</p>
<p>There is one more thing I wish to say. Sometimes when I speak, it may seem that I am repeating the same idea over and over. But I wish to tell you that even if I speak beyond your expectation, I will not say a word beyond your necessity. The Divine in me is constantly flowing through me. Even if I repeat some word six times, eight times, twenty times, there is a special purpose in it. When I say something once, I see that the mind may respond to what I say and the mind may try to listen to it. The second time I say something, I see that the vital is going to listen to it. The third time, the physical consciousness is going to listen. So when I repeat a word, please do not feel that I am repeating each sentence because I do not have more wisdom or more light. I do have an incessant flow in my inner life and outer life, but I feel it is necessary to repeat for the disciples' sake.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Entering into the Master&#039;s highest consciousness</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Entering into the Master&#039;s highest consciousness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My simple request to you is that every day for five minutes you will kindly concentrate on the daily meditation and then, either when you are depressed or when you are in a good mood during the day, you can try to concentrate on the thoughts that you have read in the morning. It will help you in your inner life as well as in your outer life. If you don't want to memorise it, if you don't want to sit for that extra examination, no harm; you don't have to do it. But I wish you to read the daily meditation and concentrate on it and get the utmost from it.</p>
<p>I wish to tell you that one of the most effective ways of entering into my highest consciousness is to read my spiritual writings. You do not have to read about my subway experiences: what kind of difficulties I had to go through and all that. But when you read my spiritual writings, I can assure you that immediately you enter into my consciousness. My spiritual writings are surcharged with my own consciousness. I cannot separate my realisation from my writings. So if you want to grow in your Guru's realisation, every day read these meditations and also read my writings for half an hour.</p>
<p>If you read my writings every day, I wish to tell you that you will get a deeper knowledge, a deeper vision, a deeper reality. Then you will see how you are progressing in your own inner life. My writings are not like a newspaper that you read in the subway and then throw away. My writings are something most significant for the disciples. Each time you read my writings soulfully and devotedly, I assure you that the next time you read you will be blessed or endowed with something more significant, more fulfilling.</p>
<p>It is difficult to meditate twenty-four hours a day, but it is absolutely possible to read my writings for half an hour and to do an hour of meditation daily. Twenty-four hours a day God has given you. If you don't have the time to meditate for one hour at a stretch, or if you are not able to meditate for an hour at a stretch, then I wish you to meditate fifteen minutes at a time. Do it early in the morning; then at noon, if it is possible. If it is not possible, then forget about it and try to meditate when you come back home from your job. That will be the second time. Then you can meditate again after two or three hours. The fourth time you can meditate just before you go to sleep. You can even do it while you are in bed, but you have to be in a seated position and not lying down. So these four times easily you can meditate during the day.</p>
<p>Again, when I say that you have to meditate for an hour, this does not mean that you have to look at your watch and all the time count the minutes. No! If you feel that you are not able to meditate properly for an hour, then I wish you to remain in your meditative mood for as long as possible. But if you are trying for two hours and you are not able to actually meditate even for ten minutes, then the best thing is to leave meditation at that time because the mind has become agitated and it will be difficult for you to calm the mind.</p>
<p>But you must not feel sorry or depressed. If you feel depressed that today's meditation did not come out all right, that depression will not help you in the least. That depression will only pull you back. You have tried your best; now you have to offer the results to the Supreme. You tried and you failed; but if you can offer your failure at the Feet of the Supreme, then you will get the same benefit that you would have got if you had had a good meditation. If you give only good things to God and keep the bad things, then you will see that the strength of what we call the bad things will not allow you to go to God with what you have and what you are. Two things you can get from meditation: either success or failure. If you can give both to God with the deepest joy, then your part is over.</p>
<p>Please forgive me. I am not scolding you at all. Only I am telling you what you can do with your meditation. The time has come for us to be absolutely sincere in what we say and do. Here we are all grownups. What has compelled us to accept the spiritual life is our inner urge to think of God and realise God. It is the divinity in us that is pulling us or pushing us to realise God. When each morning comes, I know that all of you try sincerely and devotedly. Again, I know that all of you can become more sincere and more alert in your day-to-day life. I want each student and disciple of mine to realise God in this life. But if you cannot do it, I shall cry with you, I shall shed bitter tears. I don't want to tell you people that one day I will leave the body and that you will have to stay on earth and go through hundreds of incarnations. I do not want to say that kind of thing. No, I say here and now that you can realise God, and when I say here and now I really mean it. I have the capacity and I have the assurance from above, but I need the readiness from you people. I do not want to eat all the fruit all by myself. I really love you people. I really want to give you the fruit. No parents will be happy if they see that their children are denied the fruit.</p>
<p>But again, the children have to be crying for the fruit, begging for the fruit. Otherwise, as Sri Ramakrishna used to say, "If I give you sweet things, sugar, then your stomach will become upset." When I give you a little experience, inner experience, believe me, you are unbalanced. I have seen some of you really lose your heads when I bring down and give a little inner aspiration or higher experience. You have to feel at that time that this inner experience is nothing in relation to your self-realisation.</p>
<p>So from now on, I wish all of you to devote more time to prayer and meditation. But, at the same time, this meditation should be filled with absolute sincerity and aspiration. It should not be done for the sake of counting the hours. You can meditate for eight hours, ten hours, twelve hours; but if all the time you are thinking of your friends and relatives, that kind of meditation will not help you at all.</p>
<p>By this time, here at this Centre, I wish to tell you that I would have got more than 150 new disciples if I had accepted everyone who applied over the last two months. You don't know how mercilessly I have rejected in cases when I saw that they had no real aspiration. I do not want this place to have black sheep. Each person here should feel the divine necessity and divine prestige of this place. Each person has some responsibility for realising God. I feel that those who are already here should stay to get the utmost from their aspiration and inner life. Let us not cry for numbers. Let us cry only for realisation. And for that I am ready, I am really ready to help you, guide you and grant you this Goal of goals.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Meditating at a fixed hour</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Meditating at a fixed hour" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>It is of paramount importance to have a fixed time for your meditation. Even a child will cry for his mother's milk at a particular hour, at a fixed time. You work in a store. When you go to your store, if you always open the door at nine o'clock, then others will have confidence that they can come at nine o'clock and you will really be open. Everything has its own hour. The inner being, the Inner Pilot, the Supreme, always observes. He expects that a particular hour is His time. If you stick to this hour, then the Supreme has confidence in you. The Supreme says, "At this hour he is not loitering around; he is doing his meditation." There has to be regularity plus punctuality. Regularity helps a lot. But if you want to get the utmost from regularity, then there should also be punctuality.</p>
<p>In the ordinary life, if you eat twenty-four hours a day, you will become extremely fat and die. In the spiritual world it is not like that. While you are meditating, you are eating Light. The more you eat, the more capacity you get. Once you learn how to meditate well, you start taking more and more inner food: Peace, Light and Bliss. In the ordinary life, you may increase your capacity for a few days or for a month or two. Then there comes a time when, although you still have the eagerness to eat, you don't have the capacity. After taking ten pieces of bread, you are eager to take more, but you don't have the capacity; your stomach won't hold more. In the spiritual life it is not like that, because you are dealing with infinity.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to meditate at six-thirty. This is your hour. Then, if you get up at seven, what will happen? Your own lethargy, your idleness, will ruin all your possibilities. On the one hand, your lethargy acts like an enemy and does not allow you to get up at the same hour every day. On the other hand, it justifies itself. It secretly enters into your subconscious mind and justifies itself. It will say, "Oh, I came home from meditation late; that is why I could not get up." Or it will say, "For the last six days I got up every day at six-thirty. God is all kindness; so for today He will forgive me." There are so many ways that you can justify getting up late. If you say, "I came home late," it is true. But that doesn't mean that you won't do the first thing first. The first thing is meditation; the first thing is God. If you meditate at six-thirty, at your usual hour, then your second thing will be your breakfast or your reading, or mixing with friends and all that.</p>
<p>If you do not keep moving toward your goal, then you are lost. At that time, the hostile forces, the undivine forces, will say, "Oh, he is a useless fellow. I know that he does not have the perseverance, the inner need to reach the goal. So let me give him a little liberty. He will just go one step ahead and then tomorrow he will come back." When an insincere seeker wants to go forward, the hostile forces say, "We know your capacity. It is all only self-deception and pretence. It is all relaxation. A backwards march you will do." If a sincere seeker is not regular, if he is not punctual, then he is doomed. Because of his sincerity, he runs very fast and the hostile forces think, "Since he is sincere, he will very soon reach the goal." So if a sincere seeker takes rest after running a short way, the hostile forces will say, "Oh, we must be more careful. Today he is taking rest, but tomorrow he will try to cover a great length. The best thing is to pull him back and make him start his journey again."</p>
<p>Once you start your journey, if you stop at one place and think, "Today I am tired, but tomorrow again I will start from here and go on," you have to know that ignorance is more alert than your own aspiration. When you started justifying your lethargy by saying, "I did not get up this morning because I worked so hard yesterday," already your ignorance was operating.</p>
<p>Regularity can tell you that God is there, but still He is far away. Punctuality will tell you that you are approaching God, no matter how far away He is. Regularity will tell you that the goal is there. But if you are punctual, immediately a kind of dynamism, a kind of movement is there. Regularly you are meditating, true. But when there is punctuality, at that time it is like a motor in action. The motor is your regularity, because you know that at any time you can drive. But when you turn the key and start the motor, that is your punctuality. There the action has already started. With regularity you get only a vague idea that you will do it. But when punctuality starts, you actually do it.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2><em>Question:</em> Suppose you are so tired that you can't meditate, but if you slept longer and meditated an hour later, you could meditate. Which is better?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The thing is that you have to know how often you do it. If you say that every week you are doing it, this is not good. But once in a blue moon it is all right. It is like in school; you study for months, and then you get a holiday. All right. But if every day you want to take a holiday, then how will you make progress? If you say that for months you have meditated at a particular hour and one morning you are tired, all right. But if every day you go to school at a different hour, then how can the teacher be pleased?</p>
<p>In your case also, I wish to say that regularity is necessary and punctuality is even more necessary. Always try to be punctual.</p>
<p>That gives inner assurance to your life. But every day if you change the hour, then you do not have enough inner strength.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No harm. Why don't you put cold water on your eyes?</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> I take a shower, but still I fall asleep after about five minutes.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why don't you pinch yourself as hard as possible and feel that your roommate is pinching you? Then you will say, "Stop, stop, stop, stop!" When you are falling asleep, pinch yourself as hard as possible, and think that somebody else is pinching you. While you are pinching, it is actually your consciousness that is pinching your unconsciousness. But, at that time, you have to feel that a third person is doing the pinching.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why do you want to meditate for half an hour or two hours? Why can't you meditate properly just for ten minutes? If you say, "Oh, I only have to meditate for ten minutes," already you will have some joy. When the child is supposed to read for an hour, if the mother says, "All right, my child, today you only have to read for ten minutes," already the child is happy. Lethargy, sleep and all these things come because interest is lacking. If interest is there, sincere interest, there will be no sleep. When a student wants to be first in school, when he has a real, sincere interest, then he studies. But some students say, "All right, if we pass the examination that is more than enough." In that way they go on without any energetic drive.</p>
<p>So what you should do is always try to be energetic. How? If you feel that you can't meditate for half an hour, no harm. Meditate for ten minutes. Then you will feel, Oh, only ten minutes. Easily I can do that." If your goal is very limited, then you will give it all your energy. If it is two hours, oh God! You feel that to keep running at the same speed is impossible. But if it is ten minutes, anybody can meditate for ten minutes. So, first you relax yourself with the idea that the goal is within reach. If you have to run twenty miles, then you are scared to death. But if you see that the goal is within sight, then you say, "Oh, I am <em>seeing</em> it. Let me run."</p>

Why is that?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There can be many reasons. When you tried to meditate in front of your shrine, perhaps you needed or wanted more sleep. Or perhaps you had not yet assimilated the peace or the light that the previous evening had given you. When the evening sets in, there is a kind of inner peace that comes. But you may not have assimilated it. Again, some wrong forces may have entered into you during your sleep.</p>
<p>But you did absolutely the right thing when you meditated later. It is like taking starts. If your speed increases right after you start, at that time you try to run the race. But if your speed does not increase, then later you try again. As long as you can get your meditation during the day, it is all right. If you could have started your journey properly, then the forty-five minutes you spent at your shrine would have left you totally satisfied. But since you could not meditate then, the best thing was to do it later, which you did.</p>

I feel that my work at the restaurant is a meditation." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you feel that your work is meditation itself, there is nothing wrong with that. Meditation means consciousness, conscious oneness with the Inner Pilot, the Source. If you can feel your oneness while you are serving or dealing with the customers, if you feel that your consciousness is high, then certainly that is meditation. If you feel that it is not possible for you to set aside an hour or half an hour, then it is perfectly all right. But if it is not possible for you to enter into your highest or deepest while working, then you have to set aside time for meditation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are meditating properly you will get joy, inner joy. It is not a self-complacent feeling, but a spontaneous inner joy. Nobody has given you good news, nobody has brought you any gift, nobody has appreciated or admired you, nobody has done anything for you. But you are getting inner joy, an inner feeling of delight. If this happens, then easily you can know that you are meditating properly.</p>
<p>If it is a real meditation, a sublime meditation, then you are bound to feel peace within and without. But if it is mental hallucination, you will feel that peace is within and restlessness is without. You are yearning for Peace, Light and Bliss, but outwardly you feel a volcanic turbulence. But if it is a soulful meditation, you will feel inner joy; you will feel your eternal existence. You are of Eternity and for Eternity. This conception of your own eternal reality you cannot get from mental hallucination.</p>
<p>Everything depends on your sincerity. All sincere efforts will eventually be crowned with success. You are aiming at the highest Reality, but are you sincere? It is your sincerity that ultimately determines your success and progress. If a seeker has conscious and constant sincerity, then he is bound to have a most soulful, sublime meditation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation is like running along a path. We see whether we are actually running, whether we are going ahead, ahead. But if we start comparing, then today we will compare and tomorrow we will compete. This is not the right way, so we don't make any comparison. Only we see whether we are still running.</p>
<p>In the ordinary life, if we have started doing something and do not do it regularly, then we can stop where we are. In the spiritual life, it is not like that. If we stop running, ignorance pulls us back to our starting point. Ignorance is like a powerful magnet that pulls us back again.</p>
<p>The disciples have to meditate regularly, devotedly and powerfully; and while they are doing this, they observe their progress. But they don't make it a point to see how long they meditated yesterday or how intense their meditation was. Only the mind will be involved in comparing, and we don't encourage the mind to calculate. Calculation is not the thing; only self-giving is of paramount importance. We are trying to offer our whole existence to God. Meditation means self-offering. And when we have self-offering, we do not make any comparisons.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is your wish to have always most delicious food. But sometimes the food is not so good. If you want to get always very delicious food, you need to have access to an expert cook. I am your spiritual cook and you can easily have access to this cook. How? Through gratitude, the gratitude that is inside the heart, not inside the mind.</p>
<p>I always say that the past is dust. But sometimes, just for a fleeting second, you can remember that once upon a time you were on the same footing as your friends and neighbours. Now look at the difference between you. It is like day and night. They may be rich on the material plane, but on the spiritual plane they are poverty-stricken, bankrupt. So when you see the difference, automatically a spring of gratitude will well up inside you. If you can have a drop of gratitude, inside that gratitude you will find a new creation. A tiny grain of gratitude means a world of new creation. The seed has to be sown; then it starts germinating and grows into a plant. So, when you are not getting a good meditation, the best thing is to think of what you were and what you are going to become. Once upon a time you could not even crawl; now you are running in the spiritual life. See the difference, and then you are bound to have gratitude. To whom? To the Supreme, for He is the Doer. It is He who has inspired you and acted in and through you. He has inspired you and He has given you the fruit of your action, so naturally your gratitude comes to the fore.</p>

Why must it be like that?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The joy that you get right after you have a good meditation, a sublime meditation, is of greatest importance. You need that joy. But you are making a mistake if you feel that your spiritual life has to be like the movement of a pendulum. Some people have very high experiences and then they have a dry period. But I wish to say that it is not inevitable. A few spiritual Masters have not gone through dry periods at all. Once they got inner experiences, they got delight and, on the strength of their delight, they continued getting deeper experiences. Once you get joy, please try to assimilate it and continue. Walk along the spiritual path continuously with joy and delight. When you are experiencing a higher truth and inner light, you get an inner poise and that gives you inner happiness. And with this happiness you can continue to make progress.</p>
<p>After you have assimilated this joy, you may experience a kind of hunger, a real hunger, as if you had not eaten for ages. But this is extremely good. It is not the hunger of a greedy person but the hunger of an eternal seeker. You have assimilated, and then you have new, very intense hunger. But that is not desolation. It is a good experience.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day you have to dig for some time, and then you become tired. So tomorrow again you dig. Every day you dig and every day you make a little progress. Then one day you get water. Inwardly also, if you want to reach Nectar, then you have to dig regularly. Here the digging apparatus is aspiration. The higher you go, the deeper you go. Aspiration is like a magnet. You go up and that magnet pulls you inward.</p>
<p>Three times a day you eat, so you can meditate at least three times a day also. And if you spend an hour for lunch, an hour for dinner, you can also spend an hour each time for meditation. This is what you feel. But you have to know that meditation is not like eating. If your mind is running all the time, you can spend hours and hours meditating, but you will make no progress. If you spend one hour trying to meditate, during that hour perhaps five minutes you can meditate well. But if you make up your mind that you will meditate only for five minutes, but meditate well, it does not happen. If you say, "I am selecting five minutes, and as soon as I enter into meditation, I will have a most sublime meditation," then usually this does not happen, especially not for the beginners.</p>
<p>So what all of you should try to do is this. If you are ready to meditate fifteen minutes, try to keep one hour aside. During that one hour, forty-five minutes you will spend only for preparation or for roaming in the world of fantasy. That is not the ideal thing, but that may be necessary if you are to have fifteen minutes of good meditation. But if you feel that you don't need forty-five minutes extra, that is very good. If you feel, "Once I start, I can run. I don't have to take a few preliminary starts," that is excellent. So, if it is necessary, you will take a few starts; and if it is not necessary, just from the beginning you shall cover the hundred-metre distance. You don't have to waste forty-five minutes in order to meditate for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a very high experience. In some cases, the soul can come out of the body. In some cases, the soul comes to the fore to such an extent that the physical consciousness either totally leaves or becomes transformed, pushed aside, or totally illumined by the soul's light.</p>
