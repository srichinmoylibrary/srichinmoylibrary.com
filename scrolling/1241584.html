  <h2 id="page-title">Why I buy pets</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Why I buy pets" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>People may say that I am wasting my time and money when I buy animals and birds. But pets help people to bring forward their own affection. Every time I look at my birds, my chinchillas, my monkeys or my dogs, they bring forward extra love, affection and concern from me.</p>
<p>When I pour affection into a bird, this affection flows into the Universal Consciousness. Anything that I offer in the form of love, affection and concern, the whole universe receives.</p>
<p>So even though I go below the human level with my affection, it also touches the human level. Then it enters into my spiritual children. In this way, if I can spread more affection, I feel more fulfilled.</p>
<p>Also, when I buy a bird, I see so many things. The bird in the cage reminds me of how the soul is encaged in this human body. I see how my soul suffers, how your souls suffer; I see how our souls want to fly in the divine consciousness-sky.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Why I keep animals</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Why I keep animals" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When we were celebrating Madhuri’s birthday, she asked me why I give animals such importance. I told her that it is because they give me joy. It is like playing with a top or a new toy.</p>
<p>I see how restless the monkeys are! My monkey Madhu is restlessness incarnate, but it gives me such joy to watch him.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I used to have animals at home — dogs, birds, monkeys. Now I am bringing back my old habits. These are not bad habits; old habits can also be good.</p>
<p>Everything has an inner reason. The main reason I keep animals is because they give me tremendous joy. Also I feel that these innocent beings need my special attention. Every day I hear the birds and look at the monkeys and various other animals — the guinea pigs, gerbils and so on. Every day I do it.</p>
<p>I really feel sad when one of the birds falls sick or when the monkeys and other animals do not do well.</p>
<p>Animals have restlessness and cuteness and, at the same time, sweetness and fondness. All these qualities go together.</p>

<p>I bought a cute, little bird, but it just flew away into the kitchen. First it flew this side and that side for ten minutes, then it vanished. Databir and Ashrita tried so hard to find it, but it was not to be found. Inside the kitchen, it just disappeared!</p>
<p>I saw it enter into one cupboard. Databir and Ashrita opened up the cupboard, but it was not there. They think the bird flew out of the house.</p>

<p>For the past few days, every time I opened the front door, a particular cat would try to enter into my house. A fight was going on between that cat and me.</p>
<p>Cats are much less evolved than lions. Lions have developed good and noble qualities. House cats cry for constant affection, and by pouring and pouring affection into a cat, you can change its nature. But, in general, lions are much more evolved.</p>
<p>So many of the disciples have had lion incarnations. We started with Dulal!</p>

<p>God created the animals. Different people will be fond of different animals. Some you will like; others somebody else will like. Otherwise, there would be no fun for us in the animal world. It is better if there is some specialty!</p>
<p>There are many animals which I do not have, but it is not that they are hopeless or useless. No, no! Only I cannot have all the animals at my house.</p>
<p>Next week I shall invite the disciples to come to my house to see the animals and birds. Their cages will all be decorated.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Hide-and-seek</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Hide-and-seek" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The other day I was walking in my room. All of a sudden, I felt something touching my right foot. I looked down and what did I see? The chinchilla! I was so thrilled and, at the same time, a little bit worried for two reasons: how had it come upstairs and how would I catch it?</p>
<p>One girl was working downstairs in the kitchen. So I called for her to come upstairs immediately. She came up and I asked her, “How did it come upstairs?”</p>
<p>She answered, “Oh, Guru, the chinchillas have come upstairs many times.”</p>
<p>I said, “They jump up and are so cute. But how do they manage to come?”</p>
<p>She said, “They come!”</p>
<p>In the meantime, the chinchilla was jumping here and there in my room. Then it started hiding under my bed.</p>
<p>I said, “Now it will be a great struggle to catch this one.”</p>
<p>She said, “Let us try.”</p>
<p>Then she tried to catch the chinchilla. I am not familiar with catching them, so I only tried to get it to go to her side. I did not know how to catch it; I only knew how to shout! Since I was trying not to catch it, naturally it came to my side.</p>
<p>I placed my hand near it with the hope that it would not let me touch it. Outwardly I put out my hand. Inwardly I prayed that it would not come and touch me. God listened to my prayer, and it ran to her side. In this way, it went on for five or ten minutes.</p>
<p>I was totally amused, but she was rather discouraged that the chinchilla would not allow itself to be caught. Then I gave her a special message. I said, “This is what God is doing with us: playing hide-and-seek. When we do not pay attention to Him, He comes to us. But when we seek Him and are about to catch Him, He hides from us.</p>
<p>“So this chinchilla is teaching us the same game. When we do not pay attention to it, it will come near us and touch our feet and be around us. And then, when we are dying to catch it, it just disappears. In this way God’s Cosmic Game is being played with us by the chinchilla.</p>
<p>“When we are about to see God, at that time God goes away. And when we do not pay any attention to our spiritual life, when we do not think of God, at that time all good thoughts, beautiful thoughts, pure thoughts, will come to us. The day that someone does not want to meditate, when that person wants to enjoy ignorance, on that very day he gets tremendous inspiration to lead a spiritual life. But the day when he is dying to lead a spiritual life, on that day all wrong thoughts, wrong forces, may try to capture him.”</p>
<p>That is what the chinchilla was teaching us.</p>

<p>I will say, “No, I cannot go higher!”</p>
<p>Then he will tell me that he will give the pet to me at my price provided I keep it in a very large cage. He says he will come to my house the following week to see if I have provided a large cage for it. Otherwise, he says he will take it back.</p>
<p>Usually he brags about his monkeys and I brag about my monkeys. Once he sold us some flying squirrels.</p>

But if I get tired of sitting with my legs crossed and make just a little movement, immediately Kanu jumps up. He is so tired that he can hardly open his eyes, but he will not allow me to go anywhere!</p>
<p>Two or three times I kept him with me on the bed while I was meditating, but he fell off. I heard the sound, and I felt absolutely miserable.</p>
<p>Then I decided to keep my feet on the floor when I meditated. Kanu sleeps on the floor next to them. But whenever I lift my feet onto the bed, he jumps up and starts crying because he is not seeing my legs any more. Then, when I put my feet down and he sees my legs again, he goes hack to sleep.</p>
<p>If Koka the bird makes noise, Kanu will not pay any attention. But if I write something on a piece of paper with a ballpoint, immediately he opens his eyes because he is afraid I am leaving. And if I move or make any noise, right away he starts jumping and crying.</p>
