<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is mainly a question of my mental preparation, my mental attitude, towards the weights. To start with, I do stretching exercises for 40 or 50 minutes. Sometimes I may take up to an hour. Then I do repetitions with a 10-pound dumbbell and then with 20 pounds. From 20 immediately I go to 300, 310 and 320 — like that. So it is not a gradual progression. I just use my prayer, my meditation and my surrender-life to God’s Will. I pray and meditate and, at the same time, I surrender the results to God’s Will. This is what I do.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I take exercise for each part of the body: arms, legs, back and whatever muscles are required to keep the body fit. I do at least 20 different exercises daily for my upper and lower body. Then I come here every morning to do calf raises and play tennis. If there is time in the afternoon, I play tennis again. At least three hours I spend on weightlifting and bodybuilding. Running is now out of the question because of my knee, but if I am able to jog some days, then I feel really happy.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In my life running is unparalleled; it has no second. Weightlifting was never my forte. Right from my early years I disliked bodybuilding and weightlifting. I was a sprinter and decathlete, and I did not care for weightlifting at all. It was something foreign to me. But last year I started weightlifting because of an inner command. I always listen to the dictates of my Inner Pilot, and my Inner Pilot asked me to enter into weightlifting. That is the main reason, the inner reason, why I took up weightlifting.</p>
<p>The outer reason, one can say, was severe knee pain, which prevented me from running. So I have to do something to keep my body fit. But the inner reason is because my Inner Pilot, my God, has commanded me to lift. For that reason I do it cheerfully. But if I am asked to make a comparison between running and weightlifting, running will always remain my most favourite sport.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, even now I do not really enjoy it. Only my surrender to my Inner Pilot compels me to do it. But I do it obediently and even cheerfully, and definitely I do it devotedly. As I said, I pray and meditate. As soon as I pray and meditate, I become a devoted instrument of God, and then automatically I become cheerful.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do feel there are countless people on earth who do not believe in the inner power, the inner life. They feel that the outer strength and the outer life are everything. I do not agree with them. There is an inner life; there is spirit, and my ability to lift these heavy weights proves that it can work in matter as well.</p>
<p>We have to bring to the fore our inner capacities and inner power with our prayer and meditation. Standing against us is ignorance. But if our outer determination and our inner aspiration can go together, that means that two friends of ours are fighting against one enemy in our life’s tug-of-war, so we are bound to win. There are professional bodybuilders and weightlifters who have also come to the conclusion that there is something called the spirit, inner power, and it helps them considerably in their bodybuilding and weightlifting. These things are like friends. If I have an extra friend, I will take help from that friend.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Weightlifting goes side by side with this work. Everything that inspires a human being to be a better citizen of the world is good and divine. As a poet, if I can write inspirational poems, then definitely they will serve humanity’s aspiration. As an artist, if I can draw something beautiful and soulful, then again it serves and inspires mankind. As a singer and composer, it is the same. No matter what I do, if there is aspiration behind it, then that aspiration enters into mankind as inspiration. When I am composing or performing or doing anything else, the capacity of my aspiration will eventually enter into human beings as inspiration, and they will derive much benefit from it.</p>
<p>The things that I am doing are not my sole monopoly. Everybody can try them and everybody, if they are sincere and dedicated, will reach their goal. When I do weightlifting, I pray and meditate. When I compose songs, I pray and meditate. It is the prayer and meditation in each and every activity of mine that is helping me and others. But this aspiration-life is for all. Everybody wants to succeed. Everybody wants to achieve personal goals in his inner life or his outer life. Everybody wants to be a better person, to make progress, to go beyond. And the best and fastest way to do these things is to use prayer and meditation along with the outer things that are required to achieve the goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When you were practising to lift 303 pounds, how did you maintain your enthusiasm in spite of failing so many times?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When you were practising to lift 303 pounds, how did you maintain your enthusiasm in spite of failing so many times?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I failed 213 times. So many times I failed and failed. But now I am trying to do 320 pounds. God knows how many days it will take. What I did yesterday was a personal record. But all the time I am competing with myself. This also is what I teach my students to do. Always compete with yourself; do not compete with anybody else. It is stupidity on our part to compete with others. If I think that I am the best boxer, immediately I will turn around and see a Muhammad Ali there. In any field, if anybody claims to be the best, I tell you, he is a fool, because sooner than at once somebody else will come up out of the blue and defeat him. But if we compete only with ourselves, we will remain not only the present but also the future champion.</p>
<p>Today I have lifted 300 pounds. Tomorrow if I can do 310, then who is defeating me? I am defeating myself. So here there is no defeat; there is only progress, and progress is what we want. Success we cannot depend on, because somebody will always come along and make our success pale into insignificance. When we live in the success-world, sooner than at once we are doomed to frustration. But when we live in the progress-world, always there is tremendous joy. This joy comes not only from transcending one’s capacities but from the effort itself. Say I have set my goal at 300 pounds, and I cannot do it. The very fact that I have been devotedly practising and practising gives me joy, and the tenacity or perseverance that I am showing is itself progress. Anything that we do devotedly and soulfully helps us make progress.</p>
<p>So always we have to compete with ourselves in every field. If I have teeming doubts, then I will pray and meditate to minimise and decrease my doubts, and that will be my progress. If I have 10 desires — I want a Cadillac, three houses and so forth — then I will reduce my desires to nine, then eight and like that, finally, to one or no desires. This is how we can have peace of mind. If we have wisdom, we will try to minimise our earthly necessities and increase our Heavenly necessities. With our prayer-life and meditation-life we will try to become a better person by minimising our uncomely qualities like jealousy, insecurity and impurity. But if we have an iota of purity or an iota of love, then we will try to increase it. Positive qualities we shall try to increase and negative qualities we shall decrease and diminish. This is our philosophy.</p>
<p>In order to do that, we have to accept the world and live in the world. Here on earth each of us has to become a good person. If we can become a good person on earth and leave behind us our good qualities, then the whole world will make progress as we go farther and deeper and higher. In this way, each individual has the capacity to offer something for the betterment of the world.</p>

If I establish my oneness totally with you, then on the strength of my oneness, whatever gives you joy definitely gives me joy.

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If you want to use your weightlifting as an inspiration, why not use a more conventional type of lift that is more recognizable to the general public?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If you want to use your weightlifting as an inspiration, why not use a more conventional type of lift that is more recognizable to the general public?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What you are asking is an excellent question. Why do I not do something conventional so that everybody can accept or reject it? There are two reasons. The outer reason is this: we have to go forward with new ideas. Why should I only follow the old system? Every day science is making new discoveries. If we go on reading the same old book, although it may be a good book, an excellent book, it becomes boring. So if somebody finds a new book, written in a different style, with different ideas, then everybody is delighted.</p>
<p>In a garden there are many beautiful roses, and you have been seeing these roses all your life in that particular garden. Now if you add some totally new flowers, will they in any way take away the beauty of the garden? It may no longer be a conventional rose garden, but the new flowers will only add to the beauty of the garden. Roses are extremely beautiful, and we appreciate their beauty and fragrance. But if other flowers also can be added, then we appreciate them also.</p>
<p>If a tree has many branches instead of only one or two, and if these branches are of different sizes and shapes, then each one will offer new interest and new beauty. So this is the outer reason why I do the lifts that I do.</p>
<p>The inner reason is that if I want to please somebody in my life more than anything else, if I want to please that person at every moment consciously, soulfully and unconditionally, then I will do it. The person that I want to please is my Inner Pilot, my Beloved Supreme. My Inner Pilot wants me to do it this way, so I am doing it happily, cheerfully and unconditionally. But if He changes His Mind, if He wants me to do it in the conventional way, then I will do that. The inner reason is the main reason why I do these kinds of lifts. But if you are looking for outer justification, it is because if you have more than just roses in a garden, it only adds to the beauty of the garden and in no way diminishes the beauty and fragrance of the roses. Something new is always interesting and charming.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am not discouraged because anything that is great, anything that is enduring, anything that is going to last forever, takes time to come about. We sow the seed and gradually it germinates. After some time it becomes a tiny plant, then a sapling and finally a huge banyan tree. It takes such a long time for a seed to grow into a giant banyan tree, but that tree is something really remarkable, and it lasts for a long time. If just yesterday I sowed the seed, and today I look for the plant, then I will be doomed to disappointment. Everything takes time. I am in kindergarten, but my goal is to get a Master’s Degree or Ph.D. Why should I be discouraged if I cannot achieve my goal overnight?</p>
<p>The peace movement has been going on for a long time. But in terms of its success or progress, it is nowhere near the goal. Humanity’s search for peace has been going on for millennia, whereas our own peace movement has just begun. As long as we know that we are walking along the road and have not given up, then we know that eventually we are bound to reach our destination. So I am not discouraged. I will be discouraged the day I give up offering my peace concerts or peace prayers and meditations at the United Nations and elsewhere. If I give up, only then do I really fail. But while walking along the road, although the destination is far, far, far away, the very fact that I am trying and struggling gives me satisfaction.</p>
<p>As long as I am still on the road, even though I am only walking or crawling, one day I will be inspired to jog, the next day I will be inspired to run faster and the third day I will be inspired to sprint. If I do not have the capacity to run or sprint, then I will crawl. But if I give up and turn around and say, “This road is not meant for me; the world is never going to be peaceful,” then real disappointment will come into my life. If I stop my prayer-life or service-life, that is when I will be truly disappointed.</p>
<p>The success of our peace movement is up to the world. Today the world is not receptive, but perhaps tomorrow it will be. Every day we are not in a cheerful consciousness; every day we do not see the sun. But we cannot say that there is no sun. The sun eventually does appear.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can an athlete establish peace inside himself to give him strength?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can an athlete establish peace inside himself to give him strength?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> An athlete can have the same kind of peace as a seeker who is consciously praying and meditating for world peace. An athlete can have peace on the strength of his oneness. Before he starts his competition, he can just take a fleeting second to feel: “No matter who is first, I will be equally happy, for whoever wins is my brother or sister. If I did not run or jump, there would be no competition, so that person could not be a winner. Again, if I win, it is only because others have also run and jumped.”</p>
<p>Now, if I have won the race, then naturally I will be happy. But when I look around and see that my friend or my brother, who has not done well, is unhappy, at that time do I get real happiness? I am being extolled to the skies because I have won, but my brother who has lost is doomed to disappointment. I sincerely love my brother, so how can I be happy? How can I have peace?</p>
<p>I will only have happiness if I can identify myself with his failure-life, if I can enter into his heart and feel the same sadness, suffering and shock that he is experiencing. I have already identified myself with my success-life, and I am very proud and happy. Now, if I can immediately enter into my friend’s sadness and be implicitly one with his suffering, then I will be really happy. At that time my victory will give me joy and my sincere identification with the other person’s defeat will also give me joy. This joy and happiness, you can say, is peace. Because of my victory I am getting happiness, which is peace, and also on the strength of my oneness with my friend’s loss I am getting peace.</p>
<p>Then I will offer my achievement to the Source, who has given me the capacity to win, and I will offer my friend’s sadness and failure-life equally to the One who alone can give victory and defeat. If an athlete can offer up the results to God, then no matter whether he is first or last he will be cheerful. This cheerfulness, along with his oneness with the winner’s or loser’s life, will definitely give him peace of mind.</p>
<p>This applies not only to athletics but to everything that we do on earth. Oneness, oneness, oneness! If we think of oneness before we do something, if we can maintain this feeling of oneness while we are acting and also at the end of our action, then there will always be peace. From the beginning to the end, we have to sing the song of oneness.</p>
<p>Let us say we are running in a marathon. There are thousands of other people going to the same destination. Bill Rodgers will run; I will also run. Bill Rodgers will be first and I will be last. But if I have established oneness with the other runners, then I will be equally happy because they are all part and parcel of my life. Then again, if Bill Rodgers has established his oneness with me and I come first, then he will get the greatest joy. He will not feel miserable that one part of him has reached the goal before another part. No!</p>
<p>Without oneness, no matter what we do, we are unhappy. Even when we are successful, the joy we get does not last. Immediately somebody will bring the news that another person has done better, or doubt will enter into our mind and we will feel that tomorrow somebody will defeat us. At that time imaginary unhappiness we bring into our lives. How can one have peace when he is all the time thinking that his achievement is not the best, or that somebody else will do better? But if we have established our oneness not only with the past and the present but also with the future, then we are bound to have peace all the time. If somebody does something better than we do, we feel that that person is only an extension of our own lives. Yesterday I did something with one name and form, and tomorrow, under the name of somebody else, I will do the same or better.</p>
<p>Krishna, Buddha, Christ and others are spiritual Masters. They came into the world at different times, yet they are all one. Only they have different names and forms. With ordinary people also, when somebody does something great, he doesn’t have to worry that tomorrow his capacity will be eclipsed. No, tomorrow again it will be he, with a new name and form, who will accomplish something better than what he did today. In oneness there is always peace.</p>
<p>Yesterday I could lift 40 pounds, today I am lifting 60 and tomorrow I will do 70. I know that I am the same person who is doing the lifting, so I am not unhappy each time my previous record is surpassed. But if division starts, then I will be in trouble. There is always so much division even in our own being — especially between the mind and the heart and between the body and the vital. When I lift something, if there is division, immediately my mind will try to take the credit. Then the vital will say, “No, it was my determination,” and try to take the credit. The body will say, “Who lifted it up?” The heart will say, “It was I, part of my existence.” And the soul will say, “You know, if I don’t remain inside the body, all the rest of you are dead — heart, vital, mind and body.” So every part of me will want to take the credit for my success.</p>
<p>But because there is oneness, the soul is not telling the mind, vital and body, “Because of me you have won.” The body is not telling the other members of my life, “No, because of me you have won.” The body knows that if the vital does not offer determination, I cannot succeed. Again, the vital knows that if the mind is not properly controlled, I will not be able to lift. My soul, heart, mind, vital and body could have revolted, but they did not, because I have already established my oneness with them. Each one separately could have fought against each other, but they are not fighting because we have established oneness. So we have to always feel oneness the way the body, vital, mind, heart and soul of an individual feel oneness with one another and work together to reach the goal. In this way we are bound to have peace.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Would you have any message for coaches who are training athletes?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Would you have any message for coaches who are training athletes?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My simple message that I can offer to coaches is to have a childlike heart, a oneness-heart with their students. They should try to feel constant oneness not only with their students’ outer needs but also with their inner needs. Most coaches help their students outwardly, but inwardly they are unable to help. But if they pray and meditate along with their students while the students are performing, they can help their students considerably. Coaches should practise the prayer-life and meditation-life and also encourage their students to do the same. On the outer plane they have wisdom; they know much more than their students. But if they do not take help from their own inner resources and also help their students on the inner plane, then their students may not or cannot develop to their greatest potential. Coaches should dive deep within and bring to the fore their own inspiration, aspiration, dedication, determination and will-power and offer these capacities to their students. In that way the students and the coaches will work together in their inner lives of aspiration and their outer lives of dedication, and the success they have will be tremendous and will last forever.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the strength of my prayer and meditation I try to enter into the material consciousness and become part and parcel of the weights that I lift. When I deal with matter, I try to become inseparably one with it. So when I lift up the weights, I feel that my life-breath has entered into the metal plates and that from the metal this life-breath has entered back into me. This is how I try to establish my oneness with the weights. In this way I feel life in the weights and the weights feel life in me. Otherwise, if I just touch them, they do not reciprocate, and we do not offer our life-breath to each other.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ours is the philosophy of self-transcendence. Based on this philosophy, every day I am trying to become a better instrument of God. So in my case there is no such thing as an ultimate goal. As soon as I reach a goal, I know that my Inner Pilot will not allow me to stop. He will always want me to continue. As long as He grants me inspiration, aspiration and dedication, I will continue most faithfully attaining new goals.</p>
