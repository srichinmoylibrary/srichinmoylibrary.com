<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Today you have received a great honour from your Master. The deeper within you go, the clearer will be the significance of this honour.</p>
<p>You are divine soldiers, supremely divine warriors, both in the inner world and in the outer world. If you discharge your divine duties soulfully, divinely and unconditionally, your Master will consider you his real divine instruments.</p>
<p>Unlike other soldiers, you will show your strength in an unprecedented way. You will show your capacity through politeness, softness, courtesy, humility and patience. Haughtiness, arrogance, restlessness, autocracy and the feeling of supremacy will never be allowed.</p>
<p>Your Master protects you from the inner intruders — fear, doubt, jealousy and other undivine forces, and in the outer world you will try to protect your Master from the outer intruders.</p>
<p>Here you have the golden opportunity to be of service to me. The significance, the value, the honour of today's achievement you will realise as the years pass by.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: How may spiritual qualities such as patience and identification with Eternity be manifested in a dynamic fashion?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spiritual qualities such as patience and identification with Eternity can be manifested in a dynamic fashion provided we can see in them at least an iota of dynamism. Usually we don't think of patience as a great virtue. We take it as an unavoidable weakness. But no, patience is Eternity's strength in disguise. And usually we think of identification as a feminine aspect of reality, which cares for identification in order to make up for its limitation. But if we can think of identification as the revelation of the fulfilled aspiration for oneness, then we are bound to see in it tremendous dynamism.</p>
<p>Usually dynamism is closely connected with the masculine aspect of reality; at least that is what the human mind tells us. Therefore, be clever and think of patience and identification as something strong, powerful and challenging. Then you are bound to see and feel the dynamic aspect of reality in both patience and identification.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, the joy of oneness is always the highest joy in the spiritual life. Needless to say, this is the joy of inseparable oneness based on the divine lover's unconditional surrender and the Supreme Beloved's blessingful Smile on each and every plane of His Existence-Reality.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You do not have to create and then intensify your desire to meditate. Just try to recollect one of the sweet experiences that you have had over the years during your meditation. Bring the experience to the fore and then try to live inside the sweetness, soulfulness and fruitfulness of that experience. If you can do this, automatically you will be in a higher state of consciousness. Reaching a higher state of consciousness is undoubtedly a more fulfilling way of meditation.</p>

If that is the case, what actually happens when you tell us things in dreams that are either contrary to what you say outwardly or are very unlike your usual compassionate nature?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is absolutely true. The hostile forces cannot take my form. In your dreams, if you see me telling you things that are contrary to what you usually hear from me in the outer world, it indicates that there is another way to deal with human beings besides compassion. Justice-light does not necessarily mean the negation of Compassion-light. There are two ways to reach the goal. When the easier way badly fails, we usually adopt the more difficult way. If the dedication and aspiration of the seeker is constant, then he can take the easy way to the goal. Otherwise, the seeker must undergo so-called difficult experiences. But in either cast the goal is the same.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you receive it devotedly, it becomes blessingful prasad. At that time you allow me to sow the seed of love, joy, light and delight. Then, when you eat it, the seed grows into a sapling. It becomes our mutual satisfaction — you as the seeker and I as the Master. When you digest and assimilate it, it becomes the sapling, becomes a tree and bears fruit in your consciousness. Then it becomes the perfect satisfaction of both the Master and the disciple.</p>
<p>The moment you receive the prasad, feel that you are at the beginning of the blessingful road. The moment you eat, try to feel that you have started walking along the road. First you were blessed with the road, then you were blessed with the inspiration and aspiration to walk along the road. Once you have digested and assimilated the prasad, try to feel that the goal is won, that you have arrived at the shore of your own illumined and fulfilled reality. So you can put it into three categories: first, the blessingful road is placed before you, then you are walking along the road and finally you have reached your destination. So in three different stages you get the complete message of the prasad.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dear Amal, you are asking everybody's question. You voice forth everybody's inner message. Now, in order to become anchored in your purity-heart, you can do two things. First try to keep a flower all the time with you and imagine that this flower is your heart's best friend. While looking at the flower. say to yourself, "How I wish my heart were as pure as this flower." That is one way.</p>
<p>The other way is to utter the word 'purity' most soulfully, even spelling it letter by letter. Then try to imagine that there is a hole right on top of your head and that purity, in a column of light from above, is descending into your system through your spine. When this purity-light reaches the base of your spine try to see and appreciate its descent. If you sincerely appreciate or admire something, it means that in the heart of your heart you want to possess or achieve that thing. So if you really want purity, then your sincere and soulful appreciation is bound to create new purity inside your heart, and there you can forever live.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As human beings have more than one language, so also do plants and flowers have more than one language. We speak in different languages to communicate with the rest of the world. Plants and flowers also use different languages to communicate among themselves. They have also a special way to communicate with mankind. Plants usually communicate with man's longing for height. Flowers usually communicate with man's longing for beauty. Mankind, too, communicates with the plants and flowers. Mankind usually communicates with their aspiration-capacity and dedication-divinity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the ordinary human world, as soon as you see someone you say, "How are you? Are you all right?" There is no feeling in it. It is only a habit which you have learned from your great-great-grandfathers. History has handed down to us this unrealistic if not heartless form of expression, which shows no soulful oneness with the rest of the world. But when I ask you people, "How are you?" it is not that kind of superficial greeting. Most of the time it means that I see you have some serious problems. Sometimes after I am totally successful, I ask, "How are you?" in order to get a kind of confirmation from you. Sometimes, even if I have not yet achieved success, while I am in the process of fighting against the wrong forces I try to hear from you if you are aware of them.</p>
<p>Sometimes I ask you, "How are you?" when I see a wave of undivine forces attacking you people. Here I don't expect you to be aware of those forces, but while I am asking, I am strengthening your physical, vital, mind and heart. Then, with that added strength in every part of your being, you can fight against the forces that may be attacking you in the form of fear, doubt, anxiety, worry, frustration and a sense of unworthiness. At that time, if your soul is strong enough to convince the mind, vital and body of the necessity of receiving more light, abundant light, infinite light from me, then I achieve greater success and the seeker in you achieves unimaginable progress.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. You should always feel that you are one of my attendants not only while you are doing selfless service but also while you are doing something that is not directly related to selfless service. A disciple must always feel that he is an attendant of the Master no matter where he is or where the Master is.</p>
<p>There are two ways-the inner attendant's way and the outer attendant's way. The outer attendant's way is practically "out of sight, out of mind." The inner attendant's way is constant, unconditional self-giving, which is the only way to see the growing fulness and glowing fruitfulness of God the Creator and God the Creation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God calls you always with the name that you have: Sanatan. But He has different messages for you at different times of the day. In the morning He asks you to wake up. At noon He asks you to look up. In the afternoon He asks you to look around. In the evening He asks you to dive deep within. And at night He asks you to watch your obedience-life grow and glow inside your self-expanding gratitude-heart.</p>
