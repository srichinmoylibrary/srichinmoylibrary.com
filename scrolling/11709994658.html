  <h2 id="page-title">Question: The past is dust, but sometimes when I try to do the right thing, my friends keep reminding me of past mistakes. They say they are doing it out of concern.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: The past is dust, but sometimes when I try to do the right thing, my friends keep reminding me of past mistakes. They say they are doing it out of concern." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not out of concern! I am telling you to go forward, not backward. Now you are trying to lead a divine life, but they want to go back to your animal life to trace what you did wrong there. Looking backward is dangerous and destructive. Only the sweet things from the past should you remember. At the age of five, if your mother or father showed you tremendous affection, that you should try to remember. Anything that is sweet and affectionate, try to remember.</p>
<p>Again, you have to know that your mother’s sweetness and affection are not enough for you now. Only when you get affection and smiles from the Supreme is it enough. Again, the little affection that you got from your physical parents — which is nothing, nothing, nothing in comparison to the affection of the Supreme — can remind you of the Supreme’s affection. So it is good to remember those sweet experiences.</p>
<p>But do not try to remember how many mistakes you made in the past or how many unfortunate things you have done. If you are trying desperately to forget these things and if others are reminding you of them out of so-called concern, just tell them to mind their own business. Tell them, “My life is for God. My life is for the Supreme. My life is for my Guru. My life is not for you. It is none of your concern. You take care of your own life.”</p>
<p>I am begging my disciples to deal with their own problems and not to indulge in reminding others of their problems. People who remind you of your past blunders are not your real friends. In most cases, these people have committed more blunders than you have. So let them deal with their blunders. Let them look into their own minds and hearts. They will see what their minds and even their hearts are like. So do not think of them. Only think of the Supreme.</p>
<p>I always say that the past is dust. When I was a lion in my animal incarnation, God knows how many of God’s innocent creatures I devoured. Shall I now think of that and say, “O God, O God, forgive me, forgive me”? God says, “I have already forgiven you. But the moment you think of your past animal incarnations, I withdraw My Forgiveness.” It is the same with the mistakes that we have made in our human incarnations. The moment we cherish and treasure our undivine life of twenty or forty or fifty years ago, our consciousness immediately falls down again to that level. God says, “Only go forward, go forward!”</p>
<p>If you have to think of anything from the past, then think of the times that you had your highest meditations. While you were meditating, you imagined that you were on top of the snow-capped Himalayas, where there was only white snow. Everything was purity-flooded and you were there meditating. Right in front of you was Lord Shiva, who has a close connection with you. If you imagine that kind of thing, it is not mental hallucination; you <em>do</em> have a connection with our Lord Shiva.</p>
<p>So many well-wishers you have. But if you leave the path today — which is something I do not want and you do not want — those so-called well-wishers inwardly will dance with joy. They will say, “Unlike us, she was not meant for the spiritual life.” Their human mind of division will come forward and they will feel happy that only they are meant for the spiritual life. Human friendship is like that. Human concern is all false. Most of the time, others’ concern for us and our concern for others is nothing but a joke.</p>
<p>Many people get malicious pleasure when their so-called dear ones jump out of the spiritual boat and enter again into the quagmire of the ignorance-world. ‘Malicious’ is the right word! Outwardly they will say, “Oh, I am miserable that he or she has left the path.” But ninety out of a hundred do not feel any real sympathy. Even if those unfortunate ones are members of their own family — a father or mother or sister or wife or husband — still they are happy when they leave the boat. Such separativity human beings enjoy! Do I not know anything about the inner world? I see what kind of roguish nature people can have. Human nature is always division, division, division: “I am better, I am better, I am better. That is why I am still on the path.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What are the main reasons why new disciples leave after a short while?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What are the main reasons why new disciples leave after a short while?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They have to see something and feel something inside the older disciples. If I enter into a garden and I see that the garden is really beautiful, most beautiful, then I will spend time there. But if I see that the garden is not beautiful at all, then I will go to look for another garden. This is the main reason why new disciples leave our path.</p>
<p>Again, it may happen that they are not fully ready for this garden. When they see the beauty, fragrance and divinity of the garden, they may say, “O my God, my vital life! What will happen? What will my boyfriend think or what will my girlfriend think? What will my parents think?” Those ideas may come.</p>
<p>When I look at the pictures of seekers and accept them as disciples, I feel there are many, many extremely good seekers. I see that they are definitely meant for our path, but then they leave. So for that I have to blame the disciples. When they look at the old disciples, these new ones say, “Oh, after staying for ten years, fifteen years or twenty years, if they look like this, then I do not need that kind of spiritual life!” A few really remarkable seekers we have lost like that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when most of the disciples who have been with us for many, many years meditate, there is no sincere cry. It is only routine work. Regularly you can do routine work or you can do it haphazardly, but it is almost always done unwillingly and reluctantly. If you do your prayer and meditation unwillingly, reluctantly, how will you get the same result as those who are doing it prayerfully, soulfully and self-givingly?</p>
<p>So there are two groups of disciples who leave. One group feels you are too good, and the other group thinks that if this is what you have received after twenty years or twenty-five years, then it is not worth striving for.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there any significance in that Mother Teresa and Princess Diana died at nearly the same time?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there any significance in that Mother Teresa and Princess Diana died at nearly the same time?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For two world figures, Mother Teresa and Princess Diana, to go away in one year! Mother Teresa was fully blossomed, but she could have remained here on earth a few more years fully blossomed. And for Princess Diana to be snatched away in the prime of her life — what a tragedy! She was blooming; she did not start blossoming even. Then before she started blossoming properly, death snatched her away.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa rightly deserves rest. She has worked so hard, so hard, so hard for the Saviour Christ here on earth. Meanwhile, Princess Diana wants to come back to this earth plane. Such a difficult task, such a difficult task! But the Supreme showers extraordinary favour on her. For ordinary souls, there is a minimum of six years before they take incarnation again. Extraordinary souls — spiritual Masters or highly, highly developed souls — can stay in the soul’s world for a long time or you can say indefinitely. But again, if it is God’s Will, the Will of the Omnipotent, no matter how great a human being may be, spiritually or otherwise, God can send that person back to earth with a new name and form in a month or two. Then once again that soul has to enter into the world of ignorance and start leading a spiritual life for many, many years. As it stands, high, higher, highest souls do not take incarnation in such rapid succession. That is to say, they do not come back in six years or ten years.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part VI</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part VI" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p>
SCA 563-566. On 11 November 1998 at Tweed Airport in New Haven, Connecticut, Sri Chinmoy lifted a fully fueled twin-engine Beechcraft plane using a modified standing calf-raise machine. The weight of the plane, the fuel and the lifting apparatus was 13,040 lbs. After the lift, Sri Chinmoy was interviewed by a reporter from the <em>New Haven Register</em>.</p>
<h2>Reporter: You lifted heavy things like planes and elephants many years ago. What made you resume it again now?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wanted to see if age has anything to do with physical fitness. I have found that it is our human mind that creates the problem. If we can go beyond the mind by challenging the mind, then the physical body obeys us. But the mind makes us feel that we are very old.</p>
<p>Now I am 67 years old. The moment I use my heart, I feel that I am 20 years old. So I try to use my heart when I do these kinds of weightlifting feats. When I use my heart, I feel oneness with the aeroplane. Everything helps me and everybody helps me when I use my oneness. Whereas if I stayed in the mind, I would not be able to lift heavy weights at all.</p>
<p>The human mind is full of division at each and every level. Our mind appreciates our right hand more than our left hand, for example, even though they are both part and parcel of our body. Since the right hand is stronger than the left, our mind prefers our right hand.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Elephants are totally different from planes! As soon as you see the elephant standing in front of you, you get frightened because it is so huge. The one that I lifted was over 8,000 pounds, and when it was standing on the lifting platform it was only a few feet away from me. When I lift an elephant, for some reason I feel that I need more strength.</p>
<p>When I lift planes, I get a feeling of lightness from the plane itself. Plus I get a kind of inner thrill or joy because I fly in planes.</p>
<p><em>Reporter:</em> Yes, it is hard to think of an elephant as light!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind immediately makes us feel that the elephant is such a solid object. How will it be possible to lift it? So I do not use my mind at all; I use my heart and try to establish my oneness with the elephant.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Strangely enough, even though the plane is so large and heavy, it has a kind of charm. That charm takes away the weight of the plane. I feel that I am flying with the plane. When we think of an elephant, on the other hand, a kind of unfettered fear enters into us. So everything depends on our inner feeling.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I lift these heavy weights to inspire people. Inspiration is joy. You are so kind to come and watch my lift in this bad weather. Perhaps you will mention it in your newspaper or it may come out on your local television station. In this way, we are trying to spread our inspiration.</p>
<p>When we, as human beings, are inspired, we do many good things for ourselves and also for the betterment of the world. If we are not inspired, then we will have nothing to offer to the world. We may even try to destroy ourselves or others. Inspiration can bring us so much happiness and, if we are happy, then we will also get peace. Inside happiness abides peace. If we are happy, then we will not quarrel and fight with others. We will not find fault with them. If you are happy, you will be kind to me and I will be kind to someone else, and from there it will spread. So this happiness comes from inspiration. That is my simple philosophy.</p>
