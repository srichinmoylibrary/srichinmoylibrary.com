  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Our path is the path of love, devotion, and surrender. Can there be oneness with each of these qualities, or does real oneness come only in surrender?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Our path is the path of love, devotion, and surrender. Can there be oneness with each of these qualities, or does real oneness come only in surrender?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is like this. Stand in front of a tree, preferably at night, and look at the tree's foliage, its leaves and branches. Try gradually to feel that you are the tree — you are the branches, you are the leaves and you are the roots. Each portion of this real tree is yours. This is the outer tree.</p>
<p>Then you have to imagine for a couple of minutes that you have a tree inside you. This tree has only three branches. The name of these three branches are love, devotion and surrender You will sit on the branch that is called love, and there you will try to feel that you and God are absolutely one.</p>
<p>Then you will sit on the branch called devotion. While sitting on the devotion branch you have to feel not only that God and you are one, but that there is a tremendous intimate concern and feeling of inseparable oneness between you and God. God devotes His infinite Light to the fulfilment of the aspirant and the aspirant devotes his utmost capacity, whatever capacity he has, to the fulfilment of God's Will. On the branch of devotion your oneness is thickened and intensified.</p>
<p>Next comes the branch of surrender. When you sit on the branch of surrender, you have to feel that the oneness that was on the love branch, and the intimacy that you felt on the branch of devotion came to you only on the strength of your implicit surrender to God's Will. You had aspiration to become one with God, but it was not your aspiration that made you one with Him. Inside your aspiration you had surrendering light. Your aspiration was not to get something by hook or by crook, by foul means. Inside your aspiration was surrendering light: "God, I am aspiring, but I have surrendered to You and it is up to You to fulfil my aspiration or leave me where I am." This was your prayer. When you sit on the branch of surrender, you have to feel that your oneness on the love branch and your intimate oneness on the devotion branch came because of the implicit, unconditional surrender that you had inside your flaming, climbing aspiration.</p>
<p>Who has silence? He who is firmly established. When a man can feel that he has an inner tree which is firmly rooted in his inner being; then naturally his outer life is founded on something very solid, which is deep inside his inner being. In his case, the higher silence is bound to permeate his outer being.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. The role of dynamic silence is to fulfil the Will of God in humanity. But what God's Will is, we learn only from inner silence, static silence. Once we know the Will of God then it is our divine duty to dedicate ourselves to the service of mankind.</p>
<p>Some people only want to meditate. They do not want to give anything to the world. This is selfishness. Again, there are some who want to give but do not want to meditate. This is foolishness. If we do not meditate, if we do not possess something, then how are we going to give? There are many people on earth who are ready to give, but what do they have? There are some people who have acquired something and do not want to give it. They are acting like misers. They are afraid that the moment they try to give their wealth to the ignorant world, the world will misunderstand them or misuse them. But we have to play our part. First we have to achieve, then we have to offer. In this way we can please God and fulfil mankind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Prayer, meditation, concentration, contemplation are the inner silence. The outer silence is dedication, service, action. Dedicate yourself, fulfil the Will of God, but only after knowing the Will of God. We can know the Will of God only by practising inner silence. Otherwise, if we try to help mankind in our own way, we think that we are serving God but really we are just aggrandising our own ego. We say, "I have done this, I have done that." But the important thing is, "Was I inspired by God? Was I commissioned by God?" If our actions are not inspired by God, they are inspired by our ego. Then the service that we offer to the world will be full of darkness and imperfections.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I can do it. It is the easiest thing possible to see the soul and lift it up, because a real spiritual Master is he who has inseparable oneness with the Highest. On the strength of this oneness, he can have free access to anybody's soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does meditation include healing?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does meditation include healing?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation includes everything. In meditation we enlarge our consciousness until it includes everything in the universe. There is nothing we cannot achieve through meditation. Each individual has the capacity to heal if a person knows how to concentrate and meditate, and especially how to concentrate on physical ailments. There is no ailment in God's creation that he won't be able to cure. But we have to know if it is God's Will for us to heal someone. Otherwise, we may act like the hostile forces who want to break the rules of the divine Game.</p>
<p>There is a difference between healing that is done by an ordinary healer and healing done by a realised soul. The ordinary healer has learned some techniques for removing an illness from someone, but after some time he himself may become the victim of the diseases he heals in others. Why? Because he doesn't know where to throw the diseases after he has taken them away. If we take healing as a profession, if we just pray and think good thoughts for a few minutes and then go and cure someone, then we are acting against the divine Force, the divine Law. It is in our deepest meditation that we come to know what we should do and what we should not do. If the Supreme asks us to heal someone, at that time He gives us the power, and when He gives us the power, we are not responsible. The result immediately belongs to Him. But if we are responsible, we may be caught by the result of our own action. This is the difference between acting with the help of our meditation and acting out of our own so-called human compassion.</p>
<p>A realised soul only heals when God asks him to do so. He knows that in the cosmic Play of his Father, the Supreme, everything that happens is a necessary experience. He only intervenes when the Supreme asks him to. And when he heals someone's illness, he knows that he can throw the illness into the ocean, into his infinite Father who has commanded him to take it. He has no responsibility because he is an instrument of the Supreme. The ordinary healer thinks he is being supremely compassionate in healing others of their diseases, but is this healer more compassionate than God? God knows what experiences people need. If He wants to cure them of their illnesses, He will give the right instrument of His the power to do it successfully. In most cases, the Supreme will not use an ordinary aspirant to do healing, because if he is a sincere aspirant, the Supreme wants him to have realisation first. That is the most important thing.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Through meditation is one able to create or master psychic powers?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Through meditation is one able to create or master psychic powers?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Through meditation it is possible to get psychic powers, but it depends on the soul whether an individual will actually get them. The soul may feel that once you get psychic powers they may take you away from the spiritual life. Sometimes an aspirant will acquire psychic powers and then not want to pray or meditate anymore. Instead, he will want to help people. Unfortunately, the ignorance of these people will capture and infect him and finally he may leave the spiritual path. So acquiring psychic powers may be dangerous.</p>
<p>But when one becomes perfect, when one realises God, if then one starts using psychic powers, it is safe. Psychic powers do not necessarily help one in realising God, but they may come to the seeker on the way to realisation. Psychic powers are like beautiful trees and plants or delicious fruits on the way to the Goal. If somebody walks along a road where there are no trees, no flowers, nothing, then he is not tempted to stop on his journey. Psychic powers will very often take sincere seekers away from the path. Once you have realised the Goal, the psychic powers are bound to come. So it is better not to pay any attention to the psychic powers now. Only pay attention to your aspiration and inner cry. When it is time, God Himself will give you all the psychic powers. But right now what He wants is for you to realise Him.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Devil will destroy you, but the real God, the compassionate God, will fulfil you. When you meditate, if you get inner Peace or inner Joy, then immediately you can feel that there is some Truth, some Light, that is compelling you to go faster, to move forward or upward or inward. But if you feel that it is not like that, then naturally some wrong forces, hostile forces, are entering into you. You must know that the spiritual life is not a life of imagination. It is something real, absolutely real.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can you tell the difference between true intuition and imagination?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can you tell the difference between true intuition and imagination?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you soulfully follow a spiritual path for a few months and if your prayer, your concentration, your meditation is intense, then you mill be able to feel the inner guidance within you. When you meditate early in the morning, your inner being will tell you what is going to happen, what others think of you. If you want to get proper intuition, or the intuitive faculty, then your aspiration has to be very, very sincere and intense. Otherwise, it will be all mental hallucination or imagination.</p>
<p>Try to feel that there is a burning flame inside you which is mounting up all the time. This flame is the flame of aspiration. You will see that in the process of mounting high, higher, highest, it is spreading its divine Light all around. And in this Light you are bound to develop a direct vision of Truth. You will see that the length and breadth of the world, your inner world, have been illumined. In darkness we don't see anything. Even if you place the most invaluable treasure right in front of me, I won't see it, because all is darkness. But if the flame of aspiration within me is rising towards the highest and spreading its Light all around, then I will get an immediate flash of intuition because in Light there is Reality. In Light there is constant Divinity. Divinity and Reality are at your disposal when you have the flame of aspiration within you. So try to feel the divine flame of aspiration within you. Then you will always get these flashes of intuition and you will not remain in the world of imagination. But again, if you just imagine something nice about God, don't worry at all. If you feel that God is all Compassion for you but you have not yet felt God's compassionate aspect, or if you feel that God is all Concern and Love for you but you have not yet felt God's divine Love and Concern, no harm. Today these qualities may be imagination to you but tomorrow you will feel them, because these are all realities. You have not felt them, but the spiritual Masters have felt them and realised them. In your mounting aspiration, intuition is bound to grow.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a very easy way to know. If you are actually entering into a higher plane, you will feel that your body is becoming very light. Although you don't have wings, you will feel that you can fly. In fact, when you have reached a very high world, you will actually see a bird inside you that can easily fly in the sky as real birds do.</p>
<p>When it is your imagination, you will get a very sweet feeling for a few minutes and then immediately dark or frustrating thoughts will come into you. You will say, "I studied so hard, but I did not do well in my examination," or "I worked so hard in the office today, but I could not please my boss." These negative forces in the form of frustration will immediately come in. Or doubt will enter and you may say, "How can I meditate so well? Yesterday I did so many wrong things; I told so many lies. How can God be pleased with me? How can I be having such a high meditation?" But if it is really a high meditation, you will feel that your whole existence, like a divine bird, is soaring up and flying. While you have this feeling, there is no sad thought, no negative thought, no frustrating thought, no doubt. It is all Joy, all Bliss, all Peace. You are flying in the skies of Delight.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do we know what plane of consciousness we are in during meditation? Is there a limit to the planes that we can reach?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do we know what plane of consciousness we are in during meditation? Is there a limit to the planes that we can reach?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can be aware of the planes of consciousness only when one is on the verge of realisation or when one is already realised. An ordinary aspirant will not be able to know in which plane of consciousness he abides during his meditation. He will be confused. He may be in a particular world or plane of consciousness, but he will not know what the actual plane of consciousness is.</p>
<p>There are seven higher worlds and seven lower worlds. A spiritual Master can easily be in all these fourteen worlds at the same time and see things that are happening in all the worlds.</p>
<p>An aspirant can also be in two, three, four or five worlds at a time, but he will not be able to know which worlds they are. Only someone who is advanced in the spiritual life, someone who is about to step onto the highest rung of the spiritual ladder, will be able to see easily in which plane of consciousness he stays during his meditation. For realised souls it is very easy.</p>
<p>There is no limit to the planes we can reach. Your spiritual Master can tell you which plane a particular experience has come from. If he tells you that particular experience comes from the vital world or the mental world, then you will be able to know in the future when you get a similar experience that it comes from that world.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When does a person know that he has control of the vital plane?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When does a person know that he has control of the vital plane?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now, 'vital' plane is a very vague term. If you use the word 'vital' in the emotional sense, then you are talking about emotions and passions. But there is also another vital which is called the spiritual vital or the dynamic, energising vital. This vital is surcharged with divine energy, divine power. When you ask how one individual can know that he has control over the vital, you are referring to the emotional plane or lower vital plane where there is pleasure, passion and so forth.</p>
<p>How can one know? One can know only when one sees through the eye of the soul. You may ask, "How am I to know where the eye of the soul is?" I wish to tell you that you can see with the eye of your soul when you concentrate or meditate. The best way is through meditation. During your meditation, try to feel that your whole body from the soles of your feet to the crown of your head has become one tiny ball and that this ball is at your command. You can pick it up and you can throw it. You should feel the lightness in your whole physical body. If you can have this kind of feeling about your body during your meditation, then easily you can have control over the emotional vital, since the emotional vital is inside the gross physical body. When the house is at your command, how can a tiny portion inside the house not be under your control? When you become this tiny ball, how do you see it? Not with your mind, not with your physical eyes, but with the Light inside you; and that Light is the eye of your soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I tell if my inner experiences are genuine or fake?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I tell if my inner experiences are genuine or fake?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only if you do not have a Master will this problem arise. If you have a Master, then he will immediately be able to tell you whether you are deceiving yourself or whether you are getting fruitful inner experiences. The Master can easily tell without the least possible doubt or hesitation.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Master, you can still solve this problem. If you are in doubt when you have an inner experience, then concentrate on the heart. If the experience is genuine then you will feel a subtle tingling sensation. If you feel as though an ant were climbing or crawling in your heart, then you will know that your experience is genuine.</p>
<p>When you have an inner experience, try to breathe as slowly and quietly as possible and feel that you are bringing purity into your system. Feel that purity is entering into you like a thread and it is revolving around your navel. It you feel that your spiritual heart is not willing to enter into your navel, then your experience is a mere hallucination. But if the heart gladly enters into the navel, then you can rest assured that your experience is not a hallucination at all; it is absolutely true and genuine.</p>
<p>Again, when you have an experience and you want to know its worth, try to feel for a couple of minutes whether you can grow into that experience or not. If you feel that you can grow into that experience, sooner or later, in an hour or two hours or a day or six months, then your experience is genuine. But if you feel that reality is something else and you can never grow into the experience, then that experience is not genuine.</p>
<p>When you have an experience, try to separate your outer life from your inner life. The outer life is a life of necessity and demands and requirements. The inner life is also a life of necessity, but it is God's necessity, not your necessity; God's requirements, not your demands or your requirements. Try to feel whether it is God's necessity that is operating in and through your experience and whether God needs you and wants to fulfil Himself in and through you. If you can grow into that kind of feeling or realisation, then your experience is genuine. But if you identify yourself consciously with your demands, then the experience is not true; it is just a hallucination.</p>
<p>Real experience comes only when you sincerely want and need the inner life and when God needs and wants the inner life in and through you. If you have come to that understanding, then all your experiences will be true; they have to be true.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When I have an experience, how do I know that my soul is working through the experience?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When I have an experience, how do I know that my soul is working through the experience?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, you have to see your soul a few times. If you see a person, then you can see what he is doing. Similarly, if you do see your soul, then you will be able to know whether your soul is acting through a particular experience. But you have not yet seen the soul even once in your life. Right now you are simply playing tricks with words. First you have to see and feel the soul. You have to see what kind of form it takes. The soul is not bound by any form. Our soul very often changes its form according to our development and growth. Please excuse me, I am not discouraging you. I am saying that when you see the soul, when you become one with the soul, then you can have the knowledge of the soul. This is not discouragement. If you see the soul and know the soul, then immediately you can get the soul's knowledge and truth. But your present consciousness is completely separated from the soul's knowledge. While you are in the dark, you are trying to find out about the soul, which is all light.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is your unconscious mind or subconscious mind. In the unconscious mind nothing is clear. Things seem to be clear to you but actually they are not at all clear. If you are entering into a dark room, you may think that everything is in order. But when someone else who has more light enters into the room, you see that it is all chaos and confusion and you are unable to pick out anything.</p>
