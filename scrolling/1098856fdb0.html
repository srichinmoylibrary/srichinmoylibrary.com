<p>The funniest thing was that a young girl, fatter than the fattest, used to sit on the threshold of this apartment building and she would not allow people to cross. I had to take three trains to come home from Manhattan at night and then absolutely plead with this girl to let me in. I was not the only one she did not allow to enter. And she did not even live in our building! How fat she was. Perhaps she had a disease. I never saw her eat anything but at home, God knows what she ate!</p>

<p>Our first Centre in New York started in Brooklyn on Hamilton Parkway. Our second Centre was in Manhattan. Outside the apartment building in Brooklyn, there was a big sign: CAR BODY REPAIR. So seekers that came to meditate, specially our Karuna who passed away recently, used to say, “Downstairs, body repair. Upstairs, soul repair!”</p>

<p>I bought a token and slipped it into the slot at one turnstile. However, in my unmindfulness, I was attempting to pass through an adjacent turnstile. Needless to say, my turnstile refused to move, but I failed to grasp the situation.</p>
<p>Suddenly a young man slapped me on the back in a comradely way saying, “Thank you!” and crossed through the turnstile in which my token had been deposited. Thus he escaped without paying for himself, and I was forced to buy another token. Unmindfulness exacted its retribution.</p>
<p>On another occasion almost the very same thing happened. Again I put my token into the slot of one turnstile and tried to pass through an adjacent turnstile. But this time an elderly man saw my difficulty. He put his own token in my turnstile, enabling me to cross, while he used my token to pass through his turnstile. This time unmindfulness called forth sympathy and genuine help.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Mad train versus God&#039;s Will</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Mad train versus God&#039;s Will" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>It was a local uptown train of the IRT line at 12:30 in the morning. Our train was meant to halt in normal fashion at every stop, but at 42nd Street, Times Square, we began what was to be our mad journey. The train flew on like a monster released from its controls and refused to stop. I was supposed to get off at 79th Street, but the train had its own plan. Each station was passed by at top speed, unheeded. Our train defeated even the express, which stops only at the main junctions. Ours refused to slow down, let alone stop, but continued on like a mad elephant.</p>
<p>The young boys and girls in the coach were in the seventh Heaven of delight, but the older people were frantic. They were being taken miles out of their way and there was no certainty that they would get trains in the reverse direction without great difficulty. Moreover, because of the wild speed, they felt an accident to be imminent. What if our train should meet its predecessor parked at a station?</p>
<p>Strangely enough, an old Bengali woman happened to be in our coach. I later found out that she came from Potia, Chittagong, East Bengal, only four miles from my birthplace. We were both in a runaway train in New York, only 13,000 miles from our native place. Imagine my surprise when I heard her cry out in our distinctive Chittagong dialect, “O Lord, O Lord, we are finished!”</p>
<p>I went to her and by way of a joke, I answered in the same vernacular, “God will not be satisfied with your life alone, but He wants ours as well.” When she heard her own dialect, tears of astonished delight came into her eyes and she could not help embracing me with motherly affection. I tried to soothe and reassure her, but her cries and tears did not cease. Nor did the panic-stricken cries of several other women in the coach.</p>
<p>At 130th Street the mad driver stopped his wild journey, only to be arrested by two policemen. Word had been sent by intersubway telephone from one station to another about the errant train. The police had been informed and had tried unsuccessfully to stop the driver at various places along the line. Curiously enough, the driver was not drunk. It seemed that an unseen force made him the instrument of that fateful journey in which he wanted to be free from all bondage and fly unhampered and dauntless into the bosom of the night.</p>
<p>On this trip, our invitation to death was compelled by a single individual, but God’s Grace willed otherwise and cancelled the rendezvous.</p>

<p>I was going to the apartment of my sister-disciple Kailash-ben, whose affection can only be felt and never described. I went to the 14th Street subway station and bought a token. I dropped it into the slot, but the turnstile did not move. Completely confused, I was about to go to the station master to buy another token, but he had already seen my difficulty. He came over to me.</p>
<p>“Did you put a token in?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I replied.</p>
<p>“Where do you come from?”</p>
<p>“India,” was my answer.</p>
<p>“India!” he exclaimed. “Indians cannot tell a lie. Had you been a youth from another country, I would not let you through. Those boys do not have a pennyworth of sincerity. But you Indians have yet to learn how to tell a lie.” Thereupon he allowed me to go through the turnstile.</p>
<p>On entering the train, I shed tears and thanked the Divine in him, for he had seen the India of the hoary past and had yet to learn about the India of today.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Two revolvers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Two revolvers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>On the evening of 15 August 1964, a brother-disciple, Joseph Heil, invited me to meditate at his house on the occasion of Sri Aurobindo’s birthday. Another disciple, Dr. Masha Karry, a skin specialist, was also present. She was all affection to us. We had a deep meditation and a long, serious talk, which lasted until 2:30 in the morning. As I was still unfamiliar with New York, Dr. Karry accompanied me to the 59th Street subway station and, leaving me at street level, she departed.</p>
<p>As soon as I descended the staircase, I saw two men ferociously aiming revolvers at the station master, who was forced to give them all the cash, bills and tokens. These he had to dump into a large, cloth bag at their terrifying command. Then the holdup men left the scene. The whole thing had taken only a few seconds. I was utterly stunned and shaken. The name of God seemed to come out of my mouth of its own accord at least a thousand times, starting from the moment I saw the revolvers.</p>
<p>An old lady of about seventy, an African-American man of the same age, and I were the only eye-witnesses. The woman burst into tears and sobbed frantically, but the man had nerves of steel. The station master, outraged and furious, immediately phoned the police and requested us to give evidence as witnesses. I told him I was fully prepared.</p>
<p>The African-American man said to the station master, “Why are you putting us into difficulty? We are not going to face such problems at this hour!”</p>
<p>“Go your way, then,” retorted the station master.</p>
<p>Then the African-American man asked me if I was an Indian and, when I replied in the affirmative, he simply pulled me through the door which led to the lower part of the station where the trains ran, for the tokens had all been grabbed in the holdup and we could not go through the turnstiles. The old woman, in spite of her sympathy for the station master, followed us. The old man forced me into a train and began rebuking me: “You Indians are so innocent. To help the station master at this hour is to invite trouble. The police will harass you and take you to the police station. These things happen because they do not keep police at the subway stations. Be wise and do not be innocent. Wisdom is more important than mere sincerity.”</p>
<p>While I did not entirely agree with his philosophy, I was deeply moved by his sincere concern for my protection.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Surrender not accepted</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Surrender not accepted" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We were upwards of seventy in a subway coach. Young girls were reading blood-and-thunder novels; lovers were sitting cheek to cheek; the train was running at top speed.</p>
<p>All of a sudden a young worker outside the train approached the tracks from an open construction area and threw himself down in front of the fast-approaching train, ready to surrender his life in suicide. But the driver refused to accept his offering. He violently applied the brakes. The resulting jerk was indescribable.</p>
<p>All of us in the coach were suddenly thrown on each other. The physical shock was almost as cruel as death itself. Some people were severely injured, especially those who were sitting. I fell on top of about thirty passengers who had already been thrown down. We were mercilessly and swiftly precipitated towards the end of the coach like stones in a gunny-sack. Perhaps an unseen force breathed for us while so many bodies became one.</p>
<p>The name ‘Kali’ left my mouth and entered my heart. I escaped entirely without injury, but I was ashamed of my poor left thumb which was bleeding a little. When the train resumed its journey and reached the next station, it was found that, besides those with serious injuries, many other passengers had fainted. They were all taken to the hospital. Some young boys, at this point, began turning somersaults and embracing each other out of a wild, nervous excitement.</p>
<p>Many painful injuries had to pay the price for saving one life. My Kali refused an unsolicited surrender.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A nightmare journey</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A nightmare journey" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I lived in Brooklyn, it took me forty-five minutes to reach the Indian Consulate in Manhattan. On 8 August 1965, I went as usual to the Fort Hamilton Parkway subway station and took my train.</p>
<p>We had only covered two stops when we heard a voice commanding us: “All out, all out!” We were all taken aback, but we emptied the train in no time. A sea of human bodies, utterly perplexed and not knowing which way to move, was milling heavily on the platform. There were thousands upon thousands of individuals pushing and struggling on the narrow platform, for each successive train was unloading hundreds more as it came to this spot.</p>
<p>The reason? It was very simple. A water main running through the subway tunnel had burst, flooding our particular line, the BMT. The trains could run no further than the place where we were now halted and discharged. Now the problem was to continue our journey in some way or other, to reach our destinations without further delay.</p>
<p>To get out of the subway station to the surface was itself an herculean task. It took us no less than forty-five minutes just to inch our way forward in the jam-packed crowd, painfully ascend the slow-moving staircase and finally reach the street level. Once we had completed this exhausting task and were able to breathe fresh air once more, we had to consider how to proceed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, buses had been provided to take us to another subway line, the IRT, from which we could reach Manhattan. This we managed without mishap, though the buses which transported us had probably never in their existence carried at one time so many crushed bodies! Our arrival at the IRT line was by no means the end of our troubles, for here too, the crowd was as thick as before. By the time I reached the Consulate, it had taken me three full hours instead of my usual forty-five minutes. My co-workers living in other parts of Brooklyn took one further precious hour to accomplish the ordeal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My Scottish father, my Indian son</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My Scottish father, my Indian son" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>During that same day at the Consulate, I was haunted by the apprehension about my return journey, and sure enough, my misgivings were justified. The return journey was a painful repetition of the morning’s nightmare. In the evening, at the Lexington Avenue and 59th Street station, my attention was drawn to a frail octogenarian. He drew forth all my sympathy with the spell of his pitiful look. He had completely lost his way and in this crowd he was quite helpless. I was not much more fortunate, by way of knowledge, than he, but my sympathy boldly surpassed my discretion. On learning where he was going, I caught him by the hand and led him into what I believed to be the correct train. We managed this only with great difficulty. By pushing and elbowing with my former athletic heart, I managed to procure a seat for this old man.</p>
<p>As he sat down, another aged man, looking at me, inquired of him, “Who is he?” The immediate reply was, “My son, my Indian son.” I was surprised at his affectionate words and delighted that he had guessed my nationality. Lo, his gratitude could not remain inactive. He started pushing along the seat, gradually and quietly, a fraction of an inch at a time. The young girl sitting beside him could make neither head nor tail of his odd manoeuvring. He continued his efforts for about twenty minutes, until he had acquired enough room for me to sit down beside him. Great indeed was his triumph as he bade me, in his Scottish brogue, to sit. “A true father,” my grateful heart voiced forth. “My Scottish father!”</p>

<p>Sometimes, on the weekend, I used to take the subway to my sister-disciple Kailash-ben’s place. Often she would invite several Indian friends to visit. I was able to go to her place without any difficulty. How was it, then, that every time I came back I used to get lost?</p>
<p>Kailash-ben lived in Manhattan. At that time, I also lived in Manhattan. The problem was that after a certain hour, some trains do not work. I would wait for the train thinking, “Since this train brought me here, it will definitely take me back to the station from where I started my journey.” I was absolutely sure that I was taking the correct train.</p>
<p>But I was so stupid! Instead of bringing me home, the train would take me somewhere else. When I told the other passengers my address and asked for help, they would ask me, “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Every time I would take the wrong train.</p>

<p>When I lived in Brooklyn on New Utrecht Avenue, I had to take three trains to get to work each day. Can you imagine? One train I took for only five blocks; then I had to change. The second train used to stop in Manhattan, but it did not go to Fifth Avenue, so I had to change again to go to the Consulate. But I was happy because I had so much time to meditate. I always used to sit at the side of the conductor. The last train left me on the other side of Central Park. Then in five minutes I used to come walking across the park to the Consulate.</p>
<p>In January 1966 there was a general transit strike for two weeks and I had to walk to work each day and home again in the evening. It was a very severe winter and there was snow everywhere.</p>

<p>Ida Patterson had such tremendous affection for me. She knew me in the Ashram, and in December 1965 she invited me to Minneapolis to give talks. I went there to spend a week. She lived on Dupont Avenue.</p>
<p>My first talk in Minneapolis was a fiasco! I was supposed to give a talk on reincarnation. Ida had promised me that many, many people would come. But nobody came. She was the only listener. I gave my talk to the walls.</p>
<p>I remembered that one of Sri Ramakrishna’s dearest disciples, Swami Brahmananda, once gave a talk and nobody came. He said that he was so happy because he got such receptivity. He said, “The walls did not argue with me. At other times when I give talks, people ask such rubbish questions.”</p>
<p>In my case also, I gave my talk. Ida sat by the door the entire time with the hope that somebody would come. But nobody came.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Attacked by hostile forces</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Attacked by hostile forces" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>While I was in Minneapolis, I stayed with Ida Patterson. She prepared a room downstairs for me to sleep in. She stayed upstairs. O God! She did not tell me that just ten or twelve days before, her husband had committed suicide in that room. Why did she not cancel my invitation?</p>
<p>As soon as I tried to go to sleep, the dissatisfied spirit of her husband came and then so many hostile forces came to attack me. They were attacking me because when somebody commits suicide, it is the greatest victory of the hostile forces. I said, “What is going on? Here the room is clean. What has happened?” Then I had to challenge those hostile forces.</p>
<p>In the morning, I said to my hostess, “What happened to your husband, Ida?” The spirit had told me that it was her husband. Then I told Ida what had taken place during the night and she started crying. Finally she confessed that her husband had committed suicide in that room. Perhaps she had been too embarrassed to tell me before. She did not imagine that I would be attacked by those hostile forces. Perhaps if it had been somebody else, nothing would have happened. But sometimes these undivine spirits come and attack spiritual people with the hope that they will get blessings from them. Their very nature is to attack, like mischievous monkeys.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">He believed in Light, not God</h2><span property="dc:title" content="He believed in Light, not God" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Ida had been married several times. On my second day in Minneapolis, her third husband came to see me. He was a great scientist. We argued and argued and, as usual, I was condemning his science. Meanwhile, he was also saying very nasty things about spirituality. We had become good friends and we were enjoying our debate. At one point, I was looking at him and then he said to me, “I do not believe in God, but I believe in Light, and when you meditate I see Light inside you.”</p>
<p>That is how our argument ended. His philosophy was like that of the Buddhists. They do not believe in God, but they do believe in Light.</p>
