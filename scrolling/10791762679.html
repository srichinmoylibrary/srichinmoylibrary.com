<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To some extent it is predetermined. Again we have God's Compassion, God's Love, to change our fate. As you sow, so you reap: this is one theory. Two young boys are playing. One has struck the other, so naturally he will be beaten by the one he has hurt. But if the first boy goes running to his father for protection, then the fellow he has hurt cannot strike him back. He is under the protection of somebody who has much more strength than the ordinary retributive justice. If you have made some mistake or done something wrong in your previous incarnation, the time will come for you to receive punishment. But before that, if you consciously feel that you have done something wrong, you can invoke the protection of the Supreme, the Almighty Father.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you go deep within, then you will see that it is God who is suffering, that it is God who is going through each experience. Now you feel separated from God. That is why you say, "I am suffering, my friends are suffering, my relatives are suffering." But when you have the capacity for universal oneness, you will feel that it is only God who is having this experience in and through you and everybody else. He Himself is the disease, He Himself is the remedy. You call it suffering, but in God's Eye it is an experience that He Himself is going through in the process of His own evolution.</p>

<h2><em>Question: How can a person be sure that he really has aspiration?</em></h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A person can be sure that he has aspiration by the mere fact that the question has entered into his life. You have aspiration. Otherwise you would not have come here. You would have become a perfect friend to desire. Whoever comes to a spiritual place or wants to see a spiritual Master most certainly has aspiration. Now you may say that some people have come here out of curiosity. But even in curiosity there is aspiration. Otherwise the person would say, "Who cares for spiritual life? It is all useless." But if a person has some curiosity, he will say, "Let me see what a spiritual man looks like and what others are doing." Curiosity is a kind of subtle eagerness, an unconscious eagerness to learn something, to do something, to grow into something. Curiosity is the precursor of aspiration. Here there are many, many people who are sincere, and one or two who are just curious. Now the many who are sincere will be able to inspire the curious people easily.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, you do have aspiration. But if you are conscious of your aspiration, if you are confident about it, then you will make better progress. If you are doubtful of its existence in your life, you will not be able to march like a hero. You <em>do</em> have aspiration, so you should try to run as fast as possible, like a deer. If you do not try, you will just plod along like an Indian bullock cart. We are all given the opportunity to walk slowly or to run the fastest. Please try to run.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When we find ourselves encountering difficulties in the spiritual life, is the best thing just to surrender to God&#039;s Will and leave it all up to Him?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question: When we find ourselves encountering difficulties in the spiritual life, is the best thing just to surrender to God&#039;s Will and leave it all up to Him?&lt;/em&gt;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on your own spiritual height, your own achievement. There are two types of seekers. One seeker is very idle, extremely idle. He has heard the idea of surrender to God's Will, so he will not lift a finger. "Let me surrender everything to God's Will and not do anything," he says. The other seeker will pray, meditate and devote his life dynamically to God. "I am offering the result of my aspiration to God," he says.</p>
<p>If one is sincere and really aspiring, he prays and meditates in a divine way, according to his capacity. He does what he can, and at the same time he watches all the situations, calamities and forces around him. He says, "I have done my part. Now it is up to God to free me from these undivine forces or unpleasant experiences." This is the best attitude. If we can go deep within every day during our meditation, we will become the observer, the witness, <em>Purusha.</em> But if we cannot go deep within every day in our meditation, the next best thing is to act like a hero. It is a kind of heroism when we offer the results of our actions to God. The result may take the form of defeat. But if we can gladly offer the result to God, we are a divine hero.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of us do not do that. We try a little, but when we see an enormous elephant in front of us, we give up. "It is simply useless," we say. And sometimes we blame God. Since we are encountering so many difficulties now that we have entered into the spiritual life, we think it would be better to return to the ordinary life. But at this point we are making a serious mistake. When we go deep within, we will realise that the difficulties we now are encountering did exist before. But at that time ignorance knew that we were absolutely at its mercy. Ignorance was our lord. We were fast asleep in the ignorance-room, so ignorance did not take the trouble to bother us much. Now that we are trying to come out of the sea of ignorance, ignorance is trying to pull us back. "Where are you going?" it demands. "You have to stay with me!" When we are conscious of the struggle, we are on our way out of the ignorance-room. The difficulties were there inside, but at that time we were totally unconscious of them. Now we are aware of them.</p>
<p>So if you can go deep within, please ask God to take care of you. Let your aspiration go high, higher, highest. But if you don't feel that you have very free access to God's Will, the best thing is to fight ignorance on the physical plane with your own eagerness and capacity. When wrong forces disturb you, you have to fight. If you surrender, many more wrong forces will attack you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the cause of ignorance?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question: What is the cause of ignorance?&lt;/em&gt;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The cause of ignorance is our fondness for limitations. Although we say we want to be vast, we get real pleasure in separating ourselves from others. We always have a sense of demarcation, partition. We speak about peace, universal peace, but every day it is 'I' and 'Mine.' "I am for myself and I do not need anybody. I want to stay with myself. I will have nothing to do with you. Don't bother me." Ignorance comes when we bind ourselves consciously. But when we expand ourselves and feel the universe itself as our home, when we feel that we are for all and of all, then there is no ignorance. Ignorance comes into the picture only when we limit and bind ourselves and feel that this limitation is our real satisfaction. If we can feel real satisfaction lies only in our self-expansion, then there is no ignorance.</p>

<h2><em>Question: Is there any reason for doubt?</em></h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no reason for doubt. The only thing is that we cherish doubt because we are in ignorance. A child eats mud and dirt. What is the reason? He gets pleasure; he feels it is nourishing food. But when he grows up he will never touch it. He knows that he has to eat proper food. Like the child, we doubt because we have not seen the face of Reality. Once we have seen the face of Reality, how can we doubt? When I look at my hand, how can I doubt my hand? I may doubt a thought, a judgement, a feeling inside me, but my hand, which I see and feel, how can I doubt? But unless and until we have the vision of Reality, we will be subject to doubt.</p>
<p>Again, there are some people who believe in others. They may not have seen the face of Reality, but they believe because they know someone else has seen it. If a child has faith in his elder brother, he will immediately believe what his elder brother tells him. And then, when he grows up, he will see for himself that it was true.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, you have to know that the act of doubting is useless. If you doubt yourself, you are consciously weakening your own possibilities and delaying your own progress. If you say, "I have done so many things wrong, I am not meant for the spiritual life. God does not care for me," then you are making a serious mistake. If you see that somebody is superior to you in the spiritual life, you should not become discouraged. Do not think that he was always superior to you. No! Once upon a time he was also a beginner like yourself. Everybody was a beginner. You do not get your Master's degree all at once. So the best thing is to allow yourself to grow inwardly, silently, with cheerfulness and patience.</p>
<p>When we doubt others, consciously or unconsciously we betray our own ignorance. When we see an elephant, if we doubt the elephant and say, "This is just a dog or a cat," the elephant is not going to lose anything. But we will be simply indulging in stupidity. Similarly, if we doubt God, then God will not lose even an iota of His Divinity. God will simply say that we are walking along the long road. There is a very short road and a very long road. If we walk along the path of doubt, the road is very long, arduous and, what is worse, it is constantly lengthening. There is no end to it. But when we follow the path of faith, not only do we run along an easy road, but every day the road shortens itself.</p>
<p>Inside us there is a white tablet of inner purity. The moment we doubt, we create a dark spot on it. If we persist, there comes a time when the whole tablet is covered with dark spots. But the moment we have faith, that tablet becomes clear and pure again, and we can write on it according to our soul's dictates. After we have written, then we can try to manifest the reality that we have seen, felt and realised in our inner life.</p>

<h2><em>Question: What is the difference between the inner teacher and the outer teacher?</em></h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The ordinary teacher, the outer teacher, very often imposes certain ideas on the students. Although this is the land of freedom, there are some preconceived ideas which teachers unfortunately thrust upon the minds of students. But the inner teacher will not impose anything; he will not thrust any ideas on his disciples. On the contrary, he will consciously and devotedly try to bring forward the seeker's own inner wisdom. The spiritual Master knows perfectly well that he is not the ultimate Truth. He is not the Guru. The only real Guru is the Supreme. The Master will tell the disciple that the disciple has everything. "You have the treasure, you have the box and you have the key. But unfortunately you have not used the key for a long time and you have misplaced it. You cannot get to your inner wealth. I have come here to show you where you have put the key and I will help you open the box. Then, once you get the treasure, it all belongs to you. Then my role is over. "</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why is it that so many Indian spiritual Masters come to America instead of trying to help the people in their own country, where there is so much poverty and hunger?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question: Why is it that so many Indian spiritual Masters come to America instead of trying to help the people in their own country, where there is so much poverty and hunger?&lt;/em&gt;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now, dear seeker, you have to know that a real spiritual man is not bound by any geographical or religious boundaries. Once you belong to God, you become universal. If you are a true seeker, you will feel that you are not an American or a Canadian or an Indian, but a citizen of the world. I am a spiritual man, and on the strength of my prayer and meditation I dare to say that I am a cosmopolitan. A spiritual Master is not bound by east or west or north or south; he will go wherever his Inner Pilot commands him. We are all spiritual brothers and sisters, and God is our common Father. If He wants a particular child of His to help His other children, then He will send the child to them.</p>
<p>If there is poverty and hunger in India, then certainly it is God's concern. And it is also God's concern if many people in the West are not living a spiritual life. Since it is God's concern, it is He who asks the spiritual Masters to come to the West. The same God sends Westerners who have scientific and material knowledge to the East.</p>
<p>To confine any human being to his native land is foolishness. It is the mind that creates this problem. The mind gets satisfaction only in separation, whereas the heart gets satisfaction in identification and oneness. If you can remain in the heart, then you will feel the joy of identification with the vast reality. At that time there is no 'I' or 'you,' but all 'we.'</p>

<h2><em>Question: How can we have more joy and less tension in our daily life?</em></h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can have more joy only in self-giving, not in demanding. When there is tension, it is because we want something to be done in our own way while others want it done in their way. Tension starts in the mind because we see light in one way and others see light in some other way. So there is no peace, no poise, only tension.</p>
<p>Tension also comes when we want to do something in the twinkling of an eye that takes two hours or two days to do. We have to know that God has not thought of it in that way. God wants us to take two hours or two days to achieve it. If we can keep God's Hour in our minds and not our own hour, we will get joy. Tension goes away from the seeker's mind when he knows the art of surrendering to God's will.</p>
<p>We must see that God operates not only in us but in others as well. God also operates in our so-called enemies. But these are not our real enemies. Our real enemies are our doubt, fear, anxiety and worry. When we do not cry to perfect others, but only try to perfect our own lives then we will have joy. Also, if we do not expect anything from anybody else but expect everything only from God, then we will get joy. If we can feel that we are not indispensable, that without us the world can go on perfectly well, then we will have joy. This is the way we can all get abundant joy in our spiritual life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Undoubtedly, it is a difficult task. But early in the morning, before you enter into the hustle and bustle of life, before you go to your office, you are given ample opportunity by God to meditate on your heart. When you meditate early in the morning, you gain something from God: Peace, Light and Bliss. Then, when you go to your office after you have meditated early in the morning, inside your heart you have to feel that you are carrying some spiritual dollars. There you keep your spiritual wealth safe and protected. Then, while you are in the office, and are involved in your multifarious daily activities, you are carrying this inner wealth with you. When you need peace of mind or poise, immediately try to think of the wealth that you have inside you. It is as if you have kept a candle burning inside your heart. The moment you bring the candle out, the darkness of the outer world around you is illumined.</p>
<p>You always have the capacity to bring something forward which you have earned from your morning meditation. When you work you get a salary. In the inner life your work is your meditation. When you pray and meditate you get your salary, which is light. You put it inside your heart and, then, when you need some peace or light or joy in your outer life, you can bring it out from deep within you to illumine you and save you in moments of crisis.</p>

<h2><em>Question: What dies?</em></h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ignorance in us dies. But if we see ignorance with our inner eye, inner vision, we see that ignorance does not actually die but becomes transformed into light. When we use our earthly knowledge, we see that something lives for a long time and then it dies. But when we use our intuition we see that everything is in the process of transformation, illumination and perfection.</p>
<p>In India we have the trinity of God in three aspects. They are Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva; the Creator, the Preserver and the Destroyer or Transformer. Some people use the term 'Destroyer,' but inner philosophy uses the term 'Transformer.' God has created the world and He wants to preserve it. Who wants to destroy his own children? The mother will not destroy her children. The mother will only try to transform them. If the children are naughty and mischievous, the mother will not throw them out of the house. The mother will say, "My child only needs illumination and perfection." There is a feeling of oneness that the mother has with her children.</p>
<p>Creator and creation are one. When someone creates something, immediately he identifies himself with the creation. God has created us. So He is not going to destroy us. He is only going to transform us. But when we feel separated from God, the Source, when we feel that He is the Creator and we are the Creation, then the problem arises. But if we go deep within, we see that there is nothing to be killed. That which needs transformation will naturally undergo transformation, that which needs illumination will undergo illumination and that which needs perfection will undergo perfection.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can we make as much spiritual progress living in the world and leading the life of a householder as we would living an ashram life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question: Can we make as much spiritual progress living in the world and leading the life of a householder as we would living an ashram life?&lt;/em&gt;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, it is not possible. Again, we have to know what kind of ashram life we are speaking of. One may live in an ashram, but at the same time think constantly of ordinary life — "That person has become a success and the world is appreciating him. This person everybody is extolling to the skies. But I am doing nothing but living in an ashram." This kind of thing is not real ashram life at all. If you live a proper ashram life, if you are constantly aspiring and have no outer bondage, then there is no one to come between you and God. If your whole life is given totally and unconditionally to God-realisation, if you are running towards the Goal all alone with only God in mind, naturally you will make the fastest progress, while someone who has family problems and has to deal all the time with the unaspiring world will naturally make slower progress.</p>
<p>But there is a way that the householder can make very fast progress. If the householder feels that he is looking after his near and dear ones, not because they are near and dear to him, but because the Living Presence of God is inside them, this is very good. If God comes into the picture all the time, then there will always be a soulful feeling towards the near and dear ones. It is the same thing with a student. If someone is studying to get world information or world knowledge which he feels is necessary, or if he is studying so he can get a good job, then that person will make no progress. But if the person studying feels that he has the capacity to receive and reveal God's Light only in a small quantity right now, but that the knowledge he is getting from books and the outer world is only a preparation for the inner knowledge, then this is the right attitude. Right now he is reading books written by others. But a day will come when he will be in a position to read his own book, which is already written inside his soul. Right now he does not have the capacity to read his inner book, but he feels that the inner life is leading him and guiding him in and through the outer knowledge. Today you have the capacity only to receive just a little of God's Light, through books. But tomorrow you will have a larger vessel and enter into the Ocean of God's Light.</p>
<p>If you have this divine attitude towards studies or towards your family, then you will make very fast progress. Then, if you are sincere and surrendered to God's Will, when the Hour strikes and God feels the necessity of your entering into ashram life, you will do so. If, in the beginning, you are not given the opportunity, do not feel that you are not meant for the spiritual life. Far from it! God knows His Will far better than you do. There are certain reasons why He wants you to go through the householder life or the student life — the life of outer responsibilities.</p>

<h2><em>Question: When you speak of someone seeking enlightenment, doesn't that imply that the person does not have it inside him? And how can one ever attain it by seeking it?</em></h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is like this: I had something, but I have misplaced it. Suppose I had something precious in my room. It was I who had it and I who misplaced it, and now it is I who am searching for it. It has always been mine, but I do not know where it is. But when I begin searching for it, I know that after some time I will find it. Through constant seeking I will get back my inner wealth, which is illumination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we came into the world we felt that temptation was more important than actual realisation. It is as though two coins were put in front of us. One was a counterfeit or false coin; the other was authentic. But the counterfeit coin was more charming on the outer plane than the real one. So we were attracted by the one that was outwardly charming, while we ignored the genuine one.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the ordinary life, on the superficial plane, we always feel that the unreal is more charming. Here on earth, if we can get something by hook or by crook, if we can achieve something in the twinkling of an eye, we are pleased. To discipline our lives for five minutes seems most difficult. Anything that is difficult for us we immediately shun; while that which is within our immediate reach we try to grasp. That is why we do not get the real. The real is always there, but to achieve it we have to work very hard. Nevertheless, we have to know that true satisfaction, abiding satisfaction, can come only from the attainment of the real.</p>
