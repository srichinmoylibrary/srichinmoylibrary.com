<p>Shivaram's younger brother used to work with me at the Indian Consulate in New York. With Shivaram I was always serious; we talked all about spirituality. But with his brother there was no spirituality — only jokes and mundane things. We were two jokers.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe he was the same person when I saw him yesterday at the Los Angeles airport. How much respect he showed me! He prostrated himself right at my feet.</p>
<p>All credit goes to Shivaram. He has changed his brother's attitude completely.</p>

<p>When I went to New Zealand, I received VIP treatment. An officer came onto the plane and escorted me through customs.</p>
<p>But in Victoria, Canada, I had such a deplorable experience. The lady working in customs said that fifteen years ago she had heard a talk I gave at the university in Seattle when she had been a student there. "I know everything about you," she said.</p>
<p>But unfortunately our peace mile she didn't understand. Our Peace Concert she didn't understand. She was harassing me like anything!</p>
<p>When it is a matter of service, I have rendered much, much more service to Canada than to New Zealand. So many times I have given talks and concerts there! So this is what happens: New Zealand was so kind to me and Canada was so bad. It was like night and day!</p>
<p>Not only I but also my Canadian students have done so much for the heart and soul of Canada. My Canadian students have really awakened and illumined the consciousness of Canada. Nobody will believe how much they have helped Canada spiritually.</p>

<p>During our stopover in Japan, an American and I were waiting on the same floor for the elevator. He pressed the down button and I also pressed it and moved away. After a little while the elevator stopped and somebody came out. Then I started to go in.</p>
<p>The American said, "No, this elevator is going up."</p>
<p>So he prevented me from making that mistake. Then we went down together.</p>
<p>In the lobby he bought a newspaper and I went into the shops. A few minutes later he and I were again in the elevator together, this time going up. Several others got out on the third, fourth and fifth floors, so that finally we were only two together going up to the seventh floor.</p>
<p>Then out of the blue he said, "What a privilege it is to be with you!"</p>
<p>I did not know him at all. Perhaps he had seen the disciples looking at me devotedly, or perhaps someone had spoken to him about me.</p>
<p>My life is filled with stories like this — good and bad. This one was very good.</p>

<p>In the Samudra Beach Hotel in Indonesia, Tanima and I got into the elevator together. As we went inside, all of a sudden the lights went out and the doors started to close.</p>
<p>Tanima understood what was happening and she forced the doors open before they could close. So we were able to escape. Otherwise, we would have been stuck in the elevator, and the electricity was off for a half hour or more.</p>
<p>So Tanima saved me!</p>

<p>Again, some disciples whose bodies are here have left their souls in America or Europe or Africa. They have brought their body here, but the soul is not functioning!</p>

<p>In Bukittinggi I took a horse and carriage to the market.</p>
<p>If you go one way, it takes only two minutes. But the driver was such a rogue; he took me all the way in the other direction so that it would take a long time. Still, he was very nice and I gave him 2,000 rp., so he was very satisfied.</p>
<p>After I did my shopping and was ready to go back, I saw that he was still there. There were ten or twelve other carriages in the market as well, but I went to him because he had been nice.</p>
<p>We came back to the hotel in three minutes. When I gave him 1,000 rp., he was grumbling and fumbling because the previous time, when he had brought me the long way, I had given him 2,000 rp. Later, everybody told me the price should have been only 1,000 rp.</p>

<p>Those who have seen Borobudur have really seen something. It is so beautiful and it has such spiritual grandeur! I also like Kamakura.</p>
<p>Borobudur is the Buddha in the process of blossoming. Kamakura is the Buddha who has already blossomed. Borobudur has simplicity in purity and purity in simplicity. Kamakura has silence in power and power in silence. Both are totally different.</p>

<p>Today we have been allowed to use the tennis court at the Bali Beach Hotel. Why? Because the ballboy is a Hindu!</p>
<p>At first when we asked if we could play, he said, "No can play. Last night, many, many rain!"</p>
<p>He told us that his name is Jana. He was very proud that he was a Hindu.</p>
<p>I said, "I am also a Hindu."</p>
<p>Then he was so moved. So he went to the higher authorities and got us permission to play on the court, even though it was still a little bit wet.</p>

<p>Of all the places I have visited in the last 15 or 16 years, Bali is undoubtedly the best. It has everything: sincerity, simplicity, purity, humility and peace. Is there any divine quality missing here?</p>
<p>Even outwardly it is so beautiful. You can see how beautiful the little cottages and villages are. They have such simplicity!</p>
<p>Bali has maintained most of its pristine purity. You don't even have to meditate here; nature will meditate on your behalf. Early in the morning if you walk around the villages, their divine qualities will enter into you and you will become a different person. Here in Bali, nature herself will accelerate your inner progress!</p>
<p>This place is Heaven on earth. If a businessman wants to make money here, he may have a problem. But in terms of consciousness, Bali is by far the best — both inwardly and outwardly. In many aspects it is even better than India. I am an Indian, but sincerity has to speak!</p>

<p>I said that it couldn't be a lassi, but she said it was. After ten minutes another girl came. She smiled and said that they had made a mistake.</p>
<p>Then they brought me a mango lassi. So I got two drinks. Because they made a mistake, they didn't want to charge me for both. But I became generous and said, "No, no! I will pay."</p>
