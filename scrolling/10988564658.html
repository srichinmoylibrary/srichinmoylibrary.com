  <h2 id="page-title">The big shot from India</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The big shot from India" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day we heard that a big shot was coming from India. His name was Surendra Mohan Ghosh. He was once President of the Calcutta Commission. In 1965 he held a very high post in the government. Gossip was going around: would the Consul General go to the airport to receive him, or was it Dhawan’s job? Neither the Consul General nor Dhawan felt confident about meeting him. One afternoon, Dhawan came to our section and I saw that he was a little bit depressed, so I asked Dhanda, “Why is Dhawan different today? He is not ferocious.”</p>
<p>Dhanda told me, “He is frightened. This evening he has to go and receive one of the seniormost Members of Parliament at the airport. His name is Surendra Mohan Ghosh.”</p>
<p>I laughed and told him, “I am the one to go and receive him. I know him so well!”</p>
<p>My colleagues knew that I never told lies. So my friend took me seriously and he went to Dhawan and said, “Ghose says he knows Surendra Mohan Ghosh well.”</p>
<p>Dhawan came to me. He was not shouting, but he was speaking very abruptly. He asked me, “Do you really know him? Are you sure? This is a very serious matter.”</p>
<p>I said, “Yes, Sir, I know him quite well. He helped me to get my passport and he has written nice things about me. I have had many conversations with him.”</p>
<p>It seemed that Dhawan went and told the Consul General, “Ghose says he knows Surendra Mohan Ghosh well.”</p>
<p>“Ghose?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Dhawan and he repeated what I had said. The Consul General agreed that I should go to the airport.</p>
<p>At five o’clock I went home, so I did not know about the Consul General’s decision.</p>
<p>That evening, I was having dinner with my sponsor Samie and Eric. Around nine o’clock, the telephone rang and Eric answered. He came and said to me, “Mr. Dhawan is calling you.”</p>
<p>“What have I done? What have I done?” I thought.</p>
<p>I picked up the telephone and Dhawan said, “Ghose, can you do me a favour? Do you really know him?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know him. He will be so happy to see me.”</p>
<p>He asked, “How do you know him?”</p>
<p>I told him, “He is extremely close to Nolini-da, the General Secretary of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, and I was Nolini-da’s secretary.”</p>
<p>“You!”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>“I am so relieved,” Dhawan said. Then he asked me what suit I would wear.</p>
<p>“I know him so well. He is like my elder brother. Do I have to wear a suit?”</p>
<p>Dhawan said, “All right.”</p>
<p>So I had to go to the airport. They sent me in the Consul General’s limousine with a driver. Surendra Mohan Ghosh was so thrilled to see me there. First I took him to his hotel, and then I took him to my friends’ place. When I brought him back to his hotel again, it was quite late at night.</p>
<p>When I finally arrived home, the telephone rang. I picked it up and a voice said, “Ghose!” It was Dhawan. He asked, “Has he come?”</p>
<p>I said, “Yes. I brought him to his hotel and then to my friends’ place.”</p>
<p>“Then tomorrow morning please bring him to the Consulate,” said Dhawan.</p>
<p>So I took him to see the Consul General the next day. I did not have to take him to see Dhawan because Dhawan was running behind us the whole time!</p>
<p>Look at what divine Grace can do! After that day, the story changed — all because I knew a big shot.</p>
<p>Mr. Mehrotra was very proud of me. Some big shots make complaints if they are not treated well when they visit the Indian Consulates, and this can create serious problems.</p>
<p>This big shot was so nice to me. In one of his letters to me in America, he wrote, “Nobody will work for world peace as much as you will.” Another time he said, “Many Indian Ambassadors have gone to the United Nations, but India’s true cultural ambassador is Chinmoy.”</p>
<p>When he read one of my books in English, The Mother of the Golden All, he quoted a very well-known verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the Grace of the Goddess Saraswati descends, The dumb become eloquent And the lame can scale mountains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he said, “Through Mother’s Grace, everything is possible.”</p>
<p>He was a disciple of Sri Aurobindo. He is the one who used to get interviews with Sri Aurobindo even after Sri Aurobindo stopped giving them. At that time, he was a Congress leader and Sri Aurobindo used to advise him. Even in those days, in 1945 or ’46, Sri Aurobindo was interested in knowing about Indian politics.</p>
<p>He was also our Nolini-da’s best friend. One day he was in Nolini-da’s room drinking tea with Nolini-da. I entered the room to get some papers. I was going out again very respectfully when Nolini-da asked me to stop. He introduced me and then said in English, “Chinmoy is my only authority on all my writings and everything about me.” By that time, I had translated hundreds of Nolini-da’s articles from Bengali into English.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Surendra Mohan Ghosh asked me to come to his place and he was so nice to me. He was one of those who helped me considerably to get my Indian passport when I was having so many difficulties.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">How could my husband die?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="How could my husband die?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day, near the end of office work, the accountant started to have a little pain. Later, he and another friend from the Consulate were waiting for the bus to go home. By then he was in such pain. So the friend took him to the hospital. Then the friend informed the accountant’s wife. This happened around 6:30 in the evening. In eight or ten hours’ time, he died. He had had a severe stroke.</p>
<p>The following morning, when we came to work, we heard the news. I was so shocked. The accountant was a Bengali and I had been to his place to eat. He used to live on Fifth Avenue, near Dulal’s place. He had two beautiful sons. And the day that he had the stroke, at two o’clock in the afternoon, I had taken the accounts book from our section to him.</p>
<p>I was at his cremation. Everybody from the Consulate came, even the Consul General. They were all consoling his wife. Everybody was crying and his wife was insane with grief. The Consul General was a man of tremendous dignity but he, too, was heartbroken.</p>
<p>I came back home with his wife in the bus. She was crying so bitterly. She said, “Do you think I have to believe in God now? You are a spiritual man. You talk about God. Tell me, how could my husband die?”</p>
<p>I was shedding tears. All her anger and frustration she was pouring into me. She was so mad at God.</p>
<p>The following day, the Consulate workers collected money to help her go back to India. I used to get $230 per month. But that month I kept only $30 for myself. I was very generous in those days!</p>

<p>The Consul General had three secretaries. The main one, an elderly man named Ganesh, joined our path and became my disciple. But one day when he came to the Centre to meditate, an elderly lady screamed like anything and fainted, creating a scene during the meditation. It was all pretense, to draw attention. Anyway, the Consul General’s secretary got frightened. Afterwards he saw me another two or three times on the street and offered me his most respectful pranams, although he stopped coming.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">I cannot recognise you</h2><span property="dc:title" content="I cannot recognise you" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The Consul General’s junior secretary was Mr. Ramanathan. He often gave talks on Hinduism and he used to invite me to go and listen.</p>
<p>In 1994, Dr. Jayaraman-ji, the Executive Director of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (USA), invited me to a special Indian cultural performance at Queens­borough Community College. He wanted to dedicate the performance to my mother for her centenary.</p>
<p>At the performance an Indian man came up to me and said, “Ghose, do you recognise me?”</p>
<p>“I do not recognise you,” I said.</p>
<p>“You cannot recognise me because you have become a big shot!” was his reply.</p>
<p>“Please tell me your name.”</p>
<p>“I am Ramanathan.”</p>
<p>O God, as soon as he said the name, I knew who he was. “From your name I can recognise you, but not from your face,” I told him. His face was completely changed. Old age has heavily descended upon him.</p>

<p>One Sunday I went to the Consulate. The Consulate was closed, but I was standing outside. All of a sudden, I saw the Consul General, S. K. Roy, coming out of the building. He did not pay any attention to me, but I saw that his face was very serious. I asked him, “Sir, what has happened? Will you be coming back?”</p>
<p>He said, “I have no idea.” Then he told me that his mother had passed away.</p>
<p>I meditated with him for a few minutes. Afterwards I wrote a poem about his mother and left it with Sher Singh, the gatekeeper. As it turned out, the Consul General did come back to the office later that afternoon, and he did get the poem.</p>
<p>The following day, when I arrived at work, whom did I see? The Consul General. For him to come to our section was really something! He stood at the door with a sorrowful face. As soon as he came, everybody stood up. When I stood up, he said, “Ghose!” Then he looked at me, showing such love and gratitude, all through his eyes.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Farewell to the Consul General</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Farewell to the Consul General" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When S. K. Roy went back to India, we had a farewell party. As usual, I wrote a poem. Those farewell parties I shall always remember. Everybody used to mix together, chat, sing—all the staff members as well as our bosses and their wives. Ambassador B. K. Nehru came from Washington for the Consul General’s farewell party. He was Pandit Nehru’s cousin.</p>
<p>S. K. Roy’s wife was a Muslim, although he was a Roman Catholic. She was thinner than the thinnest, and she was a very strict disciplinarian, but she liked me very much. God knows what her husband had said to her about me!</p>
<p><em>Mr. B. Ramamoorthy: I clearly remember that when Guru recited his poem for the Consul General, S. K. Roy, at the Consul General’s farewell party, tears were flowing from the Consul General’s eyes. Most of these government officials do not get tributes. They work silently behind the desk. That is why Guru’s poem meant so much to him.</em></p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My first camera</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My first camera" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This is the story of how I smashed my first camera into pieces. The caretaker at India House, B. R. Gupta, bought me a small camera. It was worth eight or ten dollars. I thought I would use it to take pictures at S. K. Roy’s farewell party. That evening, I took quite a few pictures and I was very happy.</p>
<p>The following day I got the film back, but nothing had come out. I was so disgusted. I said, “A camera is not meant for me. In India I knew it. These things are hostile forces!”</p>
<p>I came out of the building. I remember it was snowing. Then so powerfully I smashed the camera on the street. Afterwards I said, “I have to be a good person.” So I sat down and collected all the pieces. I broke the camera into pieces, so I had to pick them up.</p>
<p>That was my first and last experience in those days with a camera. Some years later, Sudha, the President of our Puerto Rican Centre, gave me a camera and that camera fortunately worked.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Diplomatic privileges</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Diplomatic privileges" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Mr. B. Ramamoorthy:</em></p>
<p><em>When S. K. Roy was Consul General, he allowed us certain diplomatic privileges, even though we were not diplomatic officials. We could send letters to India using Indian stamps. The letters would go in the diplomatic bag. We could also get champagne and cigarettes. But Guru never availed himself of any of these things.</em> <em>When S. K. Roy returned to India and Dr. S. Gupta became Consul General, he said, “No, you cannot have these privileges, especially since you are not government officials.” And so everything stopped and a lot of people were very upset.</em></p>
<p><em>But none of this bothered Guru because he had never used any of the privileges himself.</em></p>
<p>Mr. Ramamoorthy is correct. From this side I never sent mail to India in the diplomatic bag. But perhaps he does not know that I received hundreds of letters from my family at the Consulate. It was quite cheap for them, but it used to take time. The letters had Indian stamps. They used to go from Pondicherry to Delhi. From Delhi they came in the diplomatic bag. Any letter that you send to the Indian Consulate in New York from India has to go via Delhi.</p>
<p>Why else did I go back to the Consulate in the evenings and on weekends? Only because I was dying to get letters from my family. Sometimes the diplomatic bag used to come at night because that was when Air India came in. The following day, the letters would come to our section. But my expectation and greed could not wait. So in the evening I used to go there to check the mail. Even on Saturday, when the Consulate was closed, I used to go there with the hope of getting some mail. Sher Singh and I used to open up the bag only to see if there were any letters for us. And quite often I did get a letter. Then I would spend some time, read books from the library and chat with my friend.</p>
<p>I wanted the mail to come to the Consulate and not to my home address. It was cheaper for my family and also my home address was always changing, so I did not know if I would ever receive their letters.</p>
<p>But to my home address once on New Utrecht Avenue a telegram did come. That was when my dearest friend, Jyotish, died.</p>

<p>One of my colleagues, N. C. Acharya, knew of my love for music and he asked me to give a concert. That is how my concert at the Indian Cultural Centre came about. The person in charge of the Cultural Centre donated a hall for free and the date was fixed for 20 March 1966.</p>
<p>Quite a few hundred people came to the concert. For me to get over one hundred people in those days was really something. But they came and they appreciated my singing.</p>
<p>I sang ten devotional songs in Sanskrit and Bengali, and I gave a short commentary on each one.</p>

<p>Dr. Mishra also worked at India House. Then he started working at the United Nations.</p>
<p>In those days, on very rare occasions, Mr. Mehrotra would ask me to go to him for some reason. Dr. Mishra’s legs would be up on the table, and he would be enjoying a cigar. He would say, “Ghose, what do you want?”</p>
<p>His greeting was very nice! But everything changes. Three or four times he came to our meeting at the UN. Once I saw that somebody was waiting for me by the revolving door with his hands folded over his heart. I could not believe it was Dr. Mishra. And at India House he would only say, “What do you want?”</p>

<p>Dr. S. Gupta succeeded S. K. Roy as Consul General. After I left the Indian Consulate, I did not hear any news of him for many years. Then, when I was in Thailand in 1988, this same Dr. Gupta came to my hotel to pay his respects to me. He was the Consul General of India in Bangkok. By that time I had become a big shot!</p>

<p>When Mr. Mehrotra was transferred to Moscow as First Secretary in the Indian Embassy, he was succeeded by Alan Nazareth. Mr. Nazareth was very young, promising, dynamic and energetic.</p>
<p>He came when I was about to leave the Indian Consulate and so I only saw him for a short time. Strangely enough, our paths have crossed many times in the intervening years.</p>
<p>He and his wife came to our programme at the United Nations in 1987. Two years later, in December 1989, I happened to be in Cairo. Mr. Nazareth was then the Indian Ambassador to Egypt. He graciously attended our Peace Concert and gave a most moving introduction. Afterwards he invited me and some of my students to come to his residence. There we had a long conversation.</p>

<p>How the workers used to smoke! In our section, everybody used to smoke. Perhaps they could not get peace of mind without smoking. If everybody smokes, what can one person do?</p>
<p>One sectional boss was so nice. He did not smoke in front of the workers. He used to go outside and smoke. But others used to smoke, very graciously, like anything! Even the women secretaries smoked.</p>
<p>Smoking is such a horrible thing! If three persons are smoking, what can you do? You open up the window, turn on the fan—but nobody wants that. So you suffer and suffer and suffer. If at one point three workers are smoking—on your right they are smoking, on your left they are smoking—then what happens? You enjoy smoking! I suffered so much.</p>

<p>One day one of my friends at the Consulate invited me to go with him to watch horse racing. What an experience! First of all, we drove 60 or 70 miles an hour to get there. At one point the police stopped us. Then, on the way home, we had a flat tire. I finally arrived home around two o’clock in the morning. This happened in July or August 1964. I never went again. Once was more than enough!</p>

<p>The Consul for Information was my esteemed friend Nirmaljit Singh. He was a Sikh. He used to brag to me that Sikhism is better than Hinduism, and I used to brag that Hinduism is better than Sikhism. It was all in a funny, joking mood. Very affectionately we used to talk. We used to get pleasure by saying, “My religion is better than yours.” He knew that I did not mean it, and I knew that he did not mean it. Ananda Mohan also used to join in. They used to send for me to go to their section. Otherwise, how could a junior clerk dare to go and talk with a Consul?</p>
