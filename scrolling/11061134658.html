  <h2 id="page-title">Transported by ecstasy</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Transported by ecstasy" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>For the last three weeks I have wanted to be in a sweet consciousness while taking exercise and practising my weightlifting. Upstairs, while I am taking exercises for an hour and a half, sometimes I turn on Indian devotional songs dedicated to Mother Kali. When the music is too loud for me, I keep the tape recorder in another room. Then, when I come downstairs, I leave the tape recorder on deliberately. There also I hear a few songs and get tremendous joy. So soulfully the performers sing.</p>
<p>Usually I lift 10 pounds 50 times. But today, because I was listening to the music, I made two or three mistakes in counting. God knows when 50 was over. My left arm never aches after I do 50 repetitions, but this time it was aching like anything. So how was I counting? Only after 75 or 80 repetitions does my arm ache. So when I enjoy the singing, it is very dangerous!</p>
<p>After doing 10 pounds, I lift 30 and 40 pounds. I was on my fourth or fifth repetition lifting with a 40-pound weight and listening to the tape. How soulfully the singer was singing! I was so moved. Luckily, I didn’t drop the weight. I took my right hand and very gently put the weight down. If the singers are extremely soulful, you can become deeply absorbed in the music and drop everything. You people are great! You can listen to a tape while you run. But if I were to use some Bengali singing tapes, I wouldn’t be able to run at all because I would become so deeply absorbed in the music.</p>
<p>The singers’ souls have come to me many, many times. One singer, whose voice I like the best, committed suicide. All his songs were on Mother Kali. God knows who composed them. The songs were written by Tom, Dick and Harry — very simple devotional songs. In some songs, the poet is criticising Kali, asking, “Why are you so bad? Why are you not fulfilling my desires?” But all are full of devotion, full of purity.</p>
<p>For one week, I listened only to national songs, all about India. I liked them so much.</p>

<p>After I lifted 240 pounds, the disciples gave me a cake with three tiny blue candles. When I was looking at the first candle, I was having a conversation with my mother. When I was looking at the second candle, I was having a conversation with my father. Then, when I was looking at the third candle, I was having a conversation with Ahana, one of my departed sisters. There in Heaven I was talking with my father, my mother and my sister Ahana. Each one has a different opinion with regard to my weightlifting, and I was enjoying hearing their different opinions.</p>
<p>Ever since I was a child, I have always taken my mother’s side blindly. Whether she is right or not, who cares? So this time also I took her side. When the discussion ended, I blew out the candles.</p>

<p>Just two days before I did my first “human mountain” lift with Prakash, I was telling some of the disciples how Prakash reminds me of my own father as a young man. Then I said that Agraha reminds me of my brother Chitta — his face, the way he moves his hands, the way he walks — in every way.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Soul’s appointment</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Soul’s appointment" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Every morning around 2:00 a.m. I meditate on the souls of my disciples and those close to me in the inner world. The souls come individually or in groups of 50 to 100. Those souls that are extremely close to me have a fixed appointment time. Every morning they come at the same time. Bill Pearl’s soul is one of those. At 3:45 a.m. it comes to me.</p>
<p>His soul does not have to knock at my heart-door. It has a free access. Other times during the day also it comes, especially when I am lifting. But 3:45 a.m. is the sacred time that I have set aside for his soul.</p>

<p>Bill Pearl’s prana is so powerful. Let him just go to hospitals and stand near sick people. Then, instead of getting oxygen, the sick people should just touch a corner of his garment. So much life-energy they will get from him! In this way, they will immediately get better. Like that, from room to room he could go curing hundreds of people. All strong bodybuilders should go to hospitals and do this work.</p>

<p>So many times the hostile forces come to attack me at the very moment I am about to lift. A dog will start barking for no reason or a plane will be the culprit. This morning, just as I was about to lift 1300 pounds, two planes went over, one after the other. So much noise they made and how prolonged the sound was! But I always try to overcome these hostile forces and I never, never give in to them.</p>

Now, some very famous American weightlifters used to weigh more than 300 pounds. You can call each of them a G-I-A-N-T.

<p>Each morning when I come down the stairs to my weight room, I powerfully identify with the vibration of a particular disciple or a group of disciples. I collect the aspiring hearts of the disciples each day and, from that aspiration, I formulate the weightlifting message that I give. Sometimes it is the disciples’ souls actually speaking through me.</p>

<p>For a long time I was very particular in not allowing the disciples to listen to the prayers that I said each morning before attempting to lift 303 1/2 pounds. Even when replaying the video, I would deliberately turn down the volume and fast forward the tape at that point. When I eventually wanted a book to be printed containing all these prayers, many disciples expressed surprise that I was making them available after such a long time. Significantly, I decided to reveal my prayers after I had successfully lifted the 300-pound weight.</p>

<p>After I lifted 303 1/2 pounds, I sat on my blue chair in the meditation room to watch the video. Immediately Lord Krishna stood in front of me and garlanded me. The garland was all white and very, very long. Mother Kali stood beside me, smiling and dancing. She was so proud. Then they came and stood next to me and watched the video.</p>
<p>Later that night, at the celebration, some disciples also presented me with a long, white garland. It was very beautiful, but Krishna’s garland had been much longer.</p>

<p>So many times I tried to lift 300 pounds! It took me so long to lift the weight even a few inches. But once I was able to lift it half way, it took almost no time to get it to the highest point. That is why I always say the first part is the hardest.</p>

<p>The greatest joy comes always from attempting something. If we can have patience or stupidity enough to continue our attempts, then we are really something. The whole world will laugh at me, including my spiritual children, but I have put 313 pounds on one dumbbell and 410 on another. Yesterday I had a long comic conversation with the Supreme while trying to lift 410 pounds. We said such cute things. So yesterday I started!</p>
