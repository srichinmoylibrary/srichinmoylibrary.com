<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything depends on the standard of the particular society. If a certain society is more advanced, infinitely more advanced, than other societies — inwardly, outwardly and in every possible way — then we can safely say that the Supreme has a special set of laws for that society. These laws are composed of Self-giving Reality and Oneness-Divinity, and they seek to bring about perfection of the individual and the collective, both within and without. The higher the standard of a particular society, the greater is the satisfaction of the Supreme when that society fulfils its duties. The seeker in us must try to discover that kind of society here on earth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on the precedent. If a certain precedent is wanting in light, then it need not be followed; but if the precedent is illumining, then it should be followed. Again, in the march of evolution, we have to know that even an illumining precedent can become more illumined, more perfected. So the greatness of the past ought to be followed, provided it embodies spirituality and divinity in boundless measure. Otherwise, we are the children of new dawns, new promises and new fulfilments.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If someone suffers misfortune and seeks compensation through the law, then he is undoubtedly doing the right thing. Whether this will interfere with the working of his future karma or his past karma is of no consequence. If someone has been a victim of injustice, then he has every right to take shelter in the force of law. Otherwise, he will always remain a victim of the undivine forces.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it right for a lawyer to accept a case in which the client is definitely guilty and then try to save the client from going to jail?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it right for a lawyer to accept a case in which the client is definitely guilty and then try to save the client from going to jail?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If a lawyer accepts a particular case, then naturally his duty is to try to save the client, no matter how bad the client is. From the highest spiritual point of view, the guilty person is less illumined, infinitely less illumined, than the one who has not committed a crime. But here on earth, if a lawyer has to defend a client for his livelihood, then what can he do? This is the vocation that he has chosen, and if the physical does not eat, then it cannot stay on earth. So, for someone who does not care for the higher life or God-life, for someone who does not care for spirituality, if he feels it is necessary to defend undivine people in order to live, then he should do it. Then, after twenty or fifty years, light may enter into him and he will try to follow the path of truth.</p>
<p>Now, if someone is a seeker, then always he should try to follow the path of truth. If he adopts a wrong method just to make money, then he is making a serious mistake. If he is a seeker, then he has to be very careful. Again, he also has to eat. And in certain cases it may be necessary for him to defend a person whom he feels is guilty in order to maintain his physical existence. If this happens, then he has to do one thing. He has to pray to the Supreme for forgiveness, for illumination. You may say that it is a funny game if you do this, telling lies and then praying to God for forgiveness. Many times a lawyer will defend the right cause and always he will try to get a case where his client is innocent. But it may not be always possible for a lawyer to get a case where he is on the right side. Still, he has every right to pray and meditate. In order to support himself, he has done something wrong, he has entered into darkness. But God gives him the opportunity to return to light through his soulful prayer.</p>
<p>His soulful prayer for forgiveness can easily nullify the mistakes that he has committed by defending a wrong party.</p>
<p>There are some lawyers who don't mind mixing with falsehood. Their conscience is not awakened, and for them, telling lies is like drinking water. Again, there are some lawyers who will not take any case if they feel that their clients are guilty. They are spiritual seekers, seeker-lawyers, and they feel that is better to starve than to defend a guilty person. I have seen some lawyers in India who have not taken any cases because of this. They were starving, but they refused to accept a client who had committed a crime.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In God's case, His Law and His Compassion are one and the same. Our demanding vital will call something God's Law, whereas our aspiring heart calls that very thing God's Compassion. God's Compassion-Light and God's Justice-Might are the same. It all depends on who receives it. If it is the aspiring heart, then we call it God's Compassion-Light. But if it is the demanding vital, the constricting vital, then we call it God's adamantine Law.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If somebody is convicted of a crime and the law has punished him then he has already paid the penalty. The karmic law has already been satisfied. But if the punishment is more than he deserves, then God's Compassion will come forward, and the next time he is doing something good, God will expedite his progress. Again, if his punishment here on earth is not enough, then God's Justice will come to the fore and his progress may be delayed by the Cosmic Law.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can easily distinguish between morality and the Supreme's Will. When the mind tries to judge a particular situation after finding out the pros and the cons, that is morality speaking. Morality is always in the mind. But the Supreme's Will we hear in the innermost recesses of our heart and not in the mind proper. When we hear something in the mind, the intellectual mind or the doubting mind, it will immediately be contradicted. One moment the mind will say that this is good and the next moment the same mind will come and contradict it. When this happens, we know that morality is coming into play. Morality is very good. If it were not for morality, we would all have remained animals or we would all now go back to the animal kingdom. But infinitely higher than morality is the Will of the Supreme, and this we can know directly from the voice that we hear inside the very depth of our heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For the Supreme, there is no such thing as capital punishment. On the one hand, it is He who receives the punishment in and through His creations. He is infinitely kinder than any human being. On the other hand, it is always He who dispenses Justice-Light in particular cases, for there is no other way to bring about a better society. "As you sow, so you reap": the Supreme believes in this particular theory. If somebody has done something extremely bad, then he has to meet with the punishment which comes as a consequence of his actions. Cause and effect must go together.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In most cases there will be a right side and a wrong side. Or you can say that one party embodies an iota more truth or more light than the other party. But in some cases, both sides are equally wrong or equally right. So, at that time, the judge has to be extremely careful.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Man's law can best be used as an instrument of God's Justice when man's law surrenders to God's Justice. Man's law and God's Justice are two different things. Man's law will have the power of a dictator; always man's law makes us feel that it is superior to the reality in which we are living. But God's Justice does not do that. God's Justice is oneness based upon impartiality. Here it is not a question of superiority or inferiority, but only of oneness, inseparable, universal oneness. But in the case of man's law, it is always one inch higher than the life that we live, so there is a sense of separativity. If man's law wants to do the right thing and become a perfect instrument, then man's law has to act like God's Justice. It has to have inseparable oneness with the Reality that we are living, without being partial.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now, unfortunately the Cosmic Law and the human law have never been one. Only it is the bounden duty of the human law to see the light in the Cosmic Law.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the human law contradicts God's Will, at times God uses His Force in the inner world to change the law and at times He uses His immediate, most powerful Willpower to smash the power of the law. But it is done mostly in the inner world. Therefore, sometimes He finds it very difficult for His Will to take effect on the outer plane. But on rare occasions He uses His adamantine Willpower and corrects and perfects the outer law, the human law.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Many people have tried and are trying to change the consciousness of criminals by not putting them into jail. There are many methods that have been applied, but no method will be of any avail unless and until the spiritual method is fully applied. The spiritual method is prayer and meditation. If prayer and meditation can reign supreme on earth, then there will be no necessity for putting anybody in jail or taking any outer measure to correct or perfect anybody. Prayer and meditation are the most effective ways to put an end to all crimes.</p>
