  <h2 id="page-title">My symbolic lifting</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My symbolic lifting" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>After lifting 1,000 pounds with both arms I got the inspiration to go directly to 1,300 pounds. Today was my first attempt at lifting 1,300 pounds with both arms simultaneously — 650 in each arm. Before lifting, I announced, “Today will be my symbolic lifting. God alone knows how many years and months it will take me to actually lift the weight.”</p>
<p>For the first lift, I gave myself zero. But when I did the second lift, my third eye was telling me that my left arm went up a little. My human eyes were telling me that it is all foolishness.</p>
<p>Then, when it came to the third lift, definitely the push was coming. For the fourth lift, I turned on the camera and the result was very good. The fifth lift happened to be the best. I then did it two more times. The fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh lifts are all noticeable and visible. Today, on the very first day, it has gone practically as high as 1,000 pounds. So you can see, impossibility is not to be found in our aspiration-dedication-journey.</p>
<p>I did not take any stretching exercises or use any other machines beforehand. I said, “Since I depend entirely on the Supreme, why do I have to take stretching exercises?” Only I took a shower. This is how stupidity entered.</p>
<p>For me, it is nothing short of a miracle and again, there is no such thing as a miracle at the Feet of our Beloved Supreme. This is called Grace. From 900 to 1,000 pounds, it took four days. Then today I lifted 1,300 pounds on the very first day. On the 13th of April I will do it so that even the blind can see!</p>
<p>I never, never imagined that with this 300-pound increment I would be able to succeed on the very first day. So it is one hundred per cent due to the Grace of the Supreme. That is why after the lift I said, “Indeed, a mystic journey in the weightlifting world.”</p>

<p>It seems that something historical has taken place today. Only future generations will appreciate it. This morning, at 8:37, I embarked on this journey and at 8:56 I completed it. I said it would be a very, very, very long journey, but when the Compassion-flood descends from Above everything can take place in the twinkling of an eye. I never, never, never imagined that today I would be able to lift 1,300 pounds. That is why I used the term ‘mystic’. How can one increase by 300 pounds?</p>
<p>There is no such thing as impossibility when you entirely depend on the Will of God. But if you feel that you are the doer, then impossibility looms large.</p>

<p>Last night I decided to do my lifting after everybody had left my house. I started just after midnight with my cycling. Then I embarked on my 1,300 pounds. I lifted 1,300 pounds seven times and four of the lifts were to my satisfaction, specially the sixth lift.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the boys who adjust the automatic camera did me a favour. On the fourth lift, I turned the camera on, but as soon as I started to bend my knees and go down, the way I usually do before lifting, the camera started clicking. I turned it off and then I lifted. So my fourth lift was not recorded.</p>
<p>For the fifth lift, I turned on the camera once again. Very gently I lowered myself into my lifting position, so that the camera would not start clicking. This time it captured my lift very nicely.</p>
<p>I did the same thing for my sixth and seventh lifts. My seventh lift was very good, but alas the camera ran out of film before the last push.</p>
<p>I do hope the camera can be adjusted. It is difficult for me when I cannot bend my knees and hang the way I am used to before I start pushing.</p>

<p>Today I lifted my 1,300 pounds six times. This is the twelfth day. Whichever day I am doing it, I am successful. So in that way I am gaining confidence. But, for some reason, I am not getting motivation to lift it higher.</p>

<p>Today was my camera-disappointment day. One boy fixed the automatic camera, but he fixed it worse than before. I lifted my 1,300 pounds six times, but the camera ran out of film after the fourth lift. My fifth and sixth lifts are not there. Not only that, but while fixing the automatic camera he somehow knocked the video camera as well, so that I am not completely in the picture. My camera experiences never end.</p>

<p>Today Subarata’s soul came to watch my weightlifting. Her soul left the body at 6:33 p.m. on Wednesday, March 15th, while I was in the plane on my way home from Bulgaria. That is when her soul came to me to say its final farewell. Her physical body passed away at 1:00 p.m. the following day.</p>
<p>Since she left the body, she has been all the time with me, in my house, watching me play my musical instruments. Today, as I was about to lift, her soul came to the doorway and said, “May I come in?”</p>
<p>I told her, “Now you are in the soul’s world. You can go anywhere you want to.”</p>
<p>She was so happy and excited. Usually I say that someone is like a seven-year-old child. But, in her case, she was like a five-year-old child.</p>
<p>She said to me, “I am so happy to be alone with you, Guru. I have never been alone with you before.”</p>

<p>I was about to reach my cycle. I was in the middle of the doorway when Subarata’s soul begged me to allow her to give a special message to the disciples. So the prayer that I gave today is not actually my prayer. It is her warning to the disciples. The prayer is:</p>

<p>My Absolute Lord Supreme!<br /> It is a very rare privilege<br />     To feel and say<br /> That my Master is always right<br />     Not only for me,<br /> But also for the entire humanity.</p>

<p>From the soul’s world, she is saying, “For God’s sake, do not think that your Master is wrong. Do not criticise him.”</p>
<p>At least one person has to believe in me! Subarata’s love for me was absolutely sincere and genuine.</p>

<p>When I went to use my pulley machine, Subarata’s soul said to me, “You are so strong. You are the strongest man in the world!” I was pulling a certain weight.</p>
<p>I said to her, “You can try it if you like.”</p>
<p>She said, “How can I? I am not in the body.”</p>
<p>I said, “Definitely you can do it. Just try.”</p>
<p>So she tried it and she was able to do it easily. The soul is part of the omnipotent God, so the soul can easily accomplish things that we find so difficult on the physical plane.</p>

<p>Today, for the first time, I can feel that my 1,300 pounds are going straight up. While they are coming down, you can see that the dumbbells are rolling, but while going up, they are going straight, not slanting. If I can lift just a little higher, a quarter of an inch or a half an inch, then the television people will see it clearly.</p>

<p>Today my seated double-arm lift with 160 pounds on each side I have done the highest in this life. I did it twice. The second time, I could not believe what a sound it made. It went so high that it made a loud sound when it fell down again. On both sides, you can clearly see the gap when it goes up. I have never lifted 160 pounds so high. Paree was able to see it even without her glasses.</p>

<p>This is the fifth day that I have done the seated calf raise since we came back from the Christmas trip. The first time I went up to 800 pounds. Then, for four days, I did 1,000 pounds — which is my maximum. Now Bishwas has added more weights to my machine. Today I wanted to try 1,100 pounds. I went up to 1,000 pounds. You can see it on the video. Just focus your eyes below the white numbers and you will see it move. Then I went to 1,100 pounds. I did it three times. The first two times, it did not move but the third time I felt the vibration. I definitely felt a movement, but it did not go up.</p>

<p>My 1,300-pound two-arm lift today is absolutely the highest. When you compare the up and down photos, you can see how it closes the gap and touches the bar. Television people will gladly take it today. They are not blind. But I want to make it even higher.</p>
<p>Today I did it six times. The first three lifts were warming up. When I warm up, I have to see if my shoulders are in good condition, if my elbows are in good condition. Then I do my serious lifting. This time the fourth to the sixth lifts are all good, but the sixth lift is super-excellent. I have watched it at least ten times.</p>
<p>And today is India day. Both the Taj Mahal and Brindaban have joined our Peace-Blossom programme today. So God is telling us that He wants us to be dynamic. He does not want lethargy any more.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, my cycle speed has gone quite high. Three weeks ago it happened. I cannot imagine how. Today I was listening to organ music and I was going so fast. I said to Govinda, “Flatter me, but do not flatten me!”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The British have won</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The British have won" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The first magazine article has come out about my 1,300-lb. lift with both arms. My Bhavani has done this. A British jockey has won the race. Britain has defeated America. She has defeated Agraha and everybody.</p>
<p>It is an excellent article and the title also is very striking: “A Man of God-Strength.” The picture has come out very well.</p>
