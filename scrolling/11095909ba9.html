<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Socrates lived philosophy. Plato expressed philosophy. Aristotle combined the two.</p>
<p>Socrates tried to express the Truth in a very simple way. Sometimes he would speak for an hour to hammer home one idea. At other times, he could express the Truth in very few words. In Plato’s case, he went on and on. He brought his mind, his scholarship and everything to support his statements. If Plato had not come, then nobody would have known who Socrates was.</p>
<p>Aristotle was Plato’s disciple, but in some ways he surpassed his Guru. He was able to discover a few things directly. Where Plato’s mind was roaming and roaming, Aristotle expanded the mind and was able to perceive a higher Truth. That is why he got such unparalleled appreciation from Plato. Plato once said that if he placed his whole academy on one side and Aristotle on the other, Aristotle would win in terms of wisdom.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is your view of the Vedic philosophers versus the Western philosophers?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is your view of the Vedic philosophers versus the Western philosophers?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Vedic seers lived 7,000 years ago. They saw the Vedic vision when it was descending into the earth-consciousness. In their meditations, the Vedic seers climbed up to the topmost branch of the eternal life-tree. From there they had a direct vision of both the roots of the tree and the highest height of the tree. Their vision was all-encompassing.</p>
<p>In our case, if we look at the foot of the life-tree, we cannot see the top of the tree. We are bound by our limited vision. Again, if we look at the top of the tree, we cannot see the roots. But the Vedic seers were unique. While seeing the highest, they did not neglect the so-called lowest. They wanted both the height and the base to be intact. That is why they were able to become great philosophers even after reaching the sublime heights in their meditation.</p>
<p>Philosophy is one of the lower branches of the eternal life-tree. The Vedic seers were able to see the Vedic vision descending and descending until it touched the philosophy-branch. Then they expressed their vision in mantric utterances.</p>
<p>Here in the Western world, when philosophy started, the philosophers were building the basic foundation, but they did not value the foundation. They were getting joy if they could show something without a foundation. Eastern Vedic philosophy went high, higher, highest, but at the same time they valued the foundation. Western philosophy went in various directions, but unlike Eastern philosophy, it did not care for the all-encompassing vision that sees both the height and the base of the life-tree.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the main difference between a devotee and a philosopher?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the main difference between a devotee and a philosopher?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to answer this question by telling you a story. There was once a great philosopher who happened to see a very simple and innocent man in the street. This man was holding a copy of the Bhagavad Gita and he was shedding tears. His tears were dropping on the book.</p>
<p>The philosopher, who was also renowned as a scholar, asked the man, “What is the matter? Are you finding it difficult to understand this sacred book? Is that why you are shedding tears? Do not worry. I feel sorry for you, so I am prepared to spend some time and explain the meaning to you.”</p>
<p>The man said, “I am shedding tears not because I am unable to understand the meaning, but because whichever page I turn to, there I see Lord Krishna and Arjuna. I can see the chariot, I can see how Lord Krishna is advising Arjuna, I can see the battle raging. It is all so vivid for me. These tears are tears of joy.”</p>
<p>Then the great philosopher bowed his head and walked away. He had studied the Bhagavad Gita for years and years, but he had never had the vision of Lord Krishna. Yet this simple man, with his heart of love and devotion, was so close to Krishna’s heart that he was able to see Krishna vividly on every page. The philosopher had wanted to make this man understand the Gita. But the Gita is not something for us to understand; it is something for us to live. This story shows us that for a devotee the road is shorter than the shortest, whereas for philosophers and others it can be longer than the longest.</p>
