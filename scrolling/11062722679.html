<p>This morning, after I had done my 7,000-pound lift, the disciples came to view the weight. It was on display in my house. Chayanika gets second prize. When she saw how huge it was, she cried and cried. Chayanika is a showcase! But Pragati’s mother gets first prize. When she came, I could not believe how she was crying and crying. Some disciples came and laughed and laughed. The best was Dhananjaya.</p>

<p>One girl could not lift something in his gym. He asked her to meditate on my picture. Then, after she meditated, she was able to lift the weight. Some people who lift weights in his gym say my name: “Sri! Sri!”</p>

<p>Last Wednesday night, when I was playing the cello during our meditation, somebody came in the inner world to visit me. At that time, I had lifted 3,000 pounds with one arm, but I had not yet done my 7,000.</p>
<p>When I saw the soul right in front of me, I said, “I cannot recognise you. Please tell me who you are.”</p>
<p>He said, “I am Louis Cyr. You cannot recognise me?”</p>
<p>I am not familiar with his soul at all, but I have read about him and many pictures I have seen of him lifting. In his day, he was the strongest man in the world. I think he came from Montreal, Canada, and he was born more than one hundred years ago.</p>
<p>So I was playing my cello and Tanima’s group was singing. Louis Cyr’s soul came and stood right in front of me. Then he took off his weightlifting belt and placed it at my feet, saying he was no match for me.</p>
<p>I was not thinking of him at all. Believe me, I was not fishing for compliments about my lifting! I was only trying to play my music correctly on the cello. But the inner world has its own Hour.</p>

<p>How the coach of the Bulgarian weightlifting team came to hear about my 2,000-pound lift, God alone knows! I have been told that he is deeply impressed. Now he is in Finland and he is asking the disciples there all about me. He wants to print an article about it in their Bulgarian magazine. Mahasamrat and others have the utmost respect for the Bulgarian weightlifters.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Kundalini power and spiritual power</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Kundalini power and spiritual power" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There is one gym owner in San Francisco by the name of Tom. Every day he reads my Kundalini book and then he tries to open up his chakras. He does not realise that kundalini power is nothing compared to spiritual power. Kundalini power is a form of spiritual power, true, but kundalini power will pale into insignificance when spiritual power, universal power, is used. I have the capacity to use universal power. I can say from my own inner experience that kundalini power is like a big wave, whereas universal power is the ocean. Kundalini power is connected with universal power, but it is not the universal power.</p>
<p>Let us say that kundalini power is like my arm. My arm is connected to my whole body. I can use my arm by itself, but if I can use the rest of my body as well, then I will be able to do much more. Universal power is definitely stronger than the kundalini power.</p>
<p>That is one point. There is also the question of book-knowledge and inner experience. An almanac can tell you everything: when it will rain and so forth. Everything is listed there. But if you squeeze the book, there is no water inside. Similarly, you can read books on kundalini power, snake-power, but that does not mean you will get the results. Where are the chakras? They are in the subtle physical. Just by reading about them, they will not open up. You have to go deep within to discover them.</p>
<p>The best thing is to meditate on God. He is the Owner of the kundalini-garden. All the trees and flowers and plants in it belong to Him. If we please God, will He not open up the garden for us? And then, if we please Him more, will He not give us the most delicious fruit in the garden? But if we do not please Him, why should He open up the garden for us and give us the fruits and flowers?</p>
<p>Again, if God sees right from the beginning that you are pleasing Him only with the idea of receiving the fruits, He will see that you are such a clever fellow. Perhaps He may open up the door to the garden for you so that you can go inside and get the fruits. But a day will come when you want God alone and then how will you recognise Him? If He comes to you, you will not know that it was He who allowed you to go into the garden and you may tell Him to get out.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Tom’s transformation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Tom’s transformation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>If Tom’s transformation can take place, which it has, you people also can be transformed. The very first time I went to Tom’s gym, I said hello to him but he would not look at me. I was there for twenty minutes or half an hour. His assistant, Dan, liked me. Dan was showing me so many pieces of equipment. But Tom did not come near me and I did not have the heart to go near him.</p>
<p>Since then, how he has changed! He has become our best admirer. A few months ago, his team was in the national championships. A few days ago I told you the story how one girl was unable to lift a particular weight. So Tom told her to meditate on my picture for ten minutes. That was her ‘punishment’! So she meditated and then she came back and lifted the weight. For the last few years, the girls from his gym have won the world championships.</p>
<p>You say that my lifts are unbelievable, but I wish to say that Tom’s comments are more unbelievable than my performances. There is such a difference between my first experience with Tom and how nice he is now. Something clicked inside his heart, something touched his heart. When that special moment arrives, it is God’s Hour. Our famous song is “Dak eseche—Call has come.” When the Call comes, you will be able to run so fast. Tom’s life is the radiant example.</p>

<p>Jim Smith’s oldest son is studying to be an engineer. When he saw the picture of my 7,000-pound lift, he said to his father, “You want me to be an engineer and I am going to be a good engineer. Because of what I have studied, I find it difficult to believe this kind of thing. But since you are my father and you believe, definitely I am going to believe.” He is believing through the eyes of his father!</p>
<p>We have sent Jim Smith three copies of the picture of me lifting 7,000 pounds. One he has kept in his gym, one in his office and one at home. The funny thing is, people who do not believe it come back again and again to look at the picture. For those who believe it, seeing it once is enough.</p>
<p>When I lifted 2,000 pounds, Jim Smith had to fight with his colleagues to give me the certificate. Normally three persons are required to watch the lift. But he said that by seeing the picture, he knew that it was true. So he challenged his colleagues. Good people are on earth. That is why we can remain alive.</p>

<p>There is a great bodybuilder whose name is Clarence Bass. Every Friday, for three hours, he used to answer questions free of charge. You could call him on the telephone and he would answer. So a few times Databir called him and one of the other boys has also called a few times. Alas, when Clarence Bass began getting so many questions, he said he would charge. His free advice stopped!</p>

<p>This week I have begun playing the piano after I finish weightlifting. You can see on the video that I am still wearing my weightlifting shorts. Yesterday, after I had finished playing the piano, I immediately became my monkey-consciousness and showed my muscle power in my arms. I was at the end of my most powerful and soulful self-giving at the piano and then I adopted a weightlifting pose!</p>
<p>Yesterday was Mahasamrat’s wife’s birthday, so I want to send them the video. I have given his wife the spiritual name Bhavatarini.</p>

<p>In Paris recently one fellow saw a poster and he came to Haridas’ course. All of a sudden, he told the disciples that he had heard that an Indian living in America had lifted up a very heavy weight. He said, “This is what meditation can do.” He did not know that I was the Indian he had heard about. So the disciples showed him a picture of me lifting weights. This French man knew nothing about meditation, but he was inspired by my weightlifting feats to attend the course.</p>
<p>That means lifting up weights has made me known. Now music has to make me known. Weightlifting is one door, now we have to try another door. Spirituality can be approached through many, many doors.</p>

<p>Jim Smith is taking ten British weightlifters to Puerto Rico to compete in a competition. He is the leader of the British contingent. Ashrita and Agraha have assisted him in making all the travel arrangements, so $100 less each person is paying to the airlines.</p>

<p>For the last few months, I have given up heavy weightlifting. Then, just last month, on three separate days, I tried to lift up 155 pounds. My bodyweight is a little under 155. I am extremely pleased to tell you that I was able to lift up 155 pounds with one arm on all the three days quite easily—that means quite satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Although I have given up heavy weightlifting, the infinite Compassion of my Beloved Lord Supreme unconditionally remains in my heart of aspiration and in my life of dedication. So let us depend entirely and all the time on the unconditional Grace of our Beloved Supreme. Without His Grace, we can do nothing. Without His Grace, we are nothing and nothing and nothing. With His Grace unconditional, we are everything, more than everything, at every moment. We must remember that His Eternity’s unconditional and infinite Compassion is the only thing that we can claim to be our own, very own. Everything else and everybody else will fail us, but never our Beloved Lord Supreme and His infinite Compassion.</p>

<p>Today, while the singers were singing my song for Mahasamrat, his soul was right in front of me and in the inner world I placed on his head a most, most beautiful crown. Even the soul has a head! His soul is extremely beautiful and on the stage it was like a child, moving this side and that side. When I placed the beautiful crown on his head, he was unimaginably happy. His hands were cupped together and he was shedding such tears of delight. Then he disappeared. So this was my inner experience.</p>
<p>Now his soul has come and it is right near my elbow. His soul has a cute way of smiling, with a little bit of shyness. For a human being, I would say that he is blushing. The soul is very cute, amused and a little bit embarrassed because I am saying such nice things about it.</p>

<p>In New Zealand and Australia I visited two gyms. In Australia I lifted up my bodyweight on television for the very first time. It happened in Melbourne. My bodyweight was 155 pounds and the actual weight of the dumbbell was 161 pounds. They put it in kilos—the dumbbell was 73.5 kilos and my bodyweight was 70.5 kilos. They weighed me on their own machine. In the studio, I did ten pushups before I lifted. Then I forgot to put on my belt. After I lifted, I was looking for my belt, but it was somewhere else.</p>
<p>The television people were very nice. They were supposed to show it the same day, but something went wrong. Fortunately, they showed it the following day. I was then in Sydney. I had gone there to play the organ at the Sydney Opera House.</p>
<p>When I returned to Melbourne, I visited Gold’s gym to look at their equipment. As soon as I entered the building, I saw Mahasamrat’s pictures all over the gym. Then I found out that the owner was a great admirer of Mahasamrat. One of the workers at this gym is very strong. He has 19-inch arms and mine are not even 14 inches. He is about 30 years old. He said to me, “I want to take a picture with you.” Then he took off his jacket to show me his arms. I said, “I do not want to show my 14-inch arms!”</p>
<p>This young man and the owner of the gym had both watched me lift 161 pounds on television. When they saw the lift, the young man said, “No way!” He was so surprised that I could lift such a heavy weight. The young man told me that he would not be able to lift 155 pounds with one arm.</p>
<p>I took some exercise on the equipment at the gym and the young man was watching me with utmost respect, but he did not try himself.</p>
<p>In New Zealand and Australia, the people believed my 7,000-pound lift. Now we have over 100 magazines who believed it and have printed favourable articles and then perhaps three or four who did not believe it. What can you do?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A calf raise down under</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A calf raise down under" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I was in New Zealand, I visited a gym. I was in my Indian dhoti and I had just had my lunch. Not even twenty minutes had passed since I had eaten. The staff members at the gym were very kind to me and they showed me their equipment.</p>
<p>They had a calf raise machine that held 950 pounds maximum. They said that they knew of only two young men who could do 600 pounds, but they were not there. Hundreds of people go to that gym, but only two can do 600 pounds. So I decided to try.</p>
<p>First I did 600 pounds. The staff members were standing there watching, but they said they themselves did not dare to do it. Then I said, “Now put 950 pounds on the machine.”</p>
<p>So they added the extra weight. Meanwhile, one of the men went to get his camera. When he came back, I lifted the weight. I was showing off, using only my left leg to support it.</p>
<p>The man with the camera was lying down on the floor taking pictures. Then he had to go to the other side to take more pictures. He was moving so slowly and taking such a long time. Meanwhile, I was still holding up the weight.</p>
<p>Finally, the other man said to him, “It seems that your camera is heavier than Sri Chinmoy’s lift!”</p>
