 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Must one use the mind to manifest inner creativity?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. The thing is that it depends on the seeker, the instrument. If the instrument wants to manifest his mental capacity, he will do it. Again, if the instrument does not want to use the mind at all, if he wants to use the heart or if he wants to manifest in a psychic way, then he can do it without using the mind at all. In most, or in practically all of my writings, talks, paintings and poems, I don't use the mind. I use the heart and the soul. Again, if I want to use the mind while painting or while writing poems, who can prevent it?</p>
<p>Inspiration exists. It is just a question of bringing something from another world. Now, if I want to manifest that world here, I can use the mind, but the best thing is to use the heart. If I manifest on the strength of the heart, only then will it be appreciated. Otherwise, if I use the mind, it will be appreciated and admired for four months, five months or six months, and then people will find many things wrong with it. But if I use the heart, then there can be nothing wrong with it. Even if it is not perfect perfection on the outside, inside everything is perfect. So if you want you can use the mind to manifest inner creativity. Otherwise, you can do it without the mind.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do you know if your inner being or your mind is talking to you?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do you know if your inner being or your mind is talking to you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How do you know if it is your mind or the inner voice speaking? If the inner voice is speaking to you, then immediately you get tremendous joy. Suppose you have a desire and the inner voice tells you not to fulfil this desire. By listening to the inner voice you will get infinitely more joy than by fulfilling the desire. Whereas if you get the message from your mind, for a split second your will get joy or satisfaction. Then your mind itself will tell you that you have not done the right thing, that you are a fool, or that you could have asked for something better.</p>
<p>If the message is from your mind, even if the desire has been fulfilled, you will not be fulfilled. What you wanted you have received, but you will feel miserable and you will say, "Oh, God does not care for me; that's why He has given this to me. I wanted to have this particular thing and God has given it to me just because He wanted to get rid of me since I am bothering Him and nagging Him all the time. He has given it to me but He does not really care for me."</p>
<p>But if the inner voice has given the message, even if it says no to your desire, you will immediately say, "God is so kind to me. He has saved me. If that desire was fulfilled then I would have been doomed. Out of His infinite Bounty He has warned me and He has saved me. I am so grateful to Him." If the message is from your inner voice, you will feel great joy that the inner voice has taken the trouble to be your guide, that it has such concern for you. This is the way you can know whether it is the voice of the inner being or whether it is the mental voice talking to you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Don't try to convince the mind that spirituality is the only thing worth having. Only try to pay all attention to the heart. The mind will become jealous and it will run after you. Now you are running after the mind as if it were a mischievous child. You are telling it you don't want it. But, like a mother, you should ignore the mischievous child and go to some other child. Then the mischievous child will come running. If you go to the right person, the heart, which is simple, humble, sweet and polite, immediately the mind will come racing after you because the mind also wants attention. Then when the mind comes to you, you will illumine the mind with your soul's light. No matter how many times you tell a naughty boy not to do something, he won't listen. But when he sees that somebody else is getting attention by doing something else, then he will start listening.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know that the mind is a circle. Within that circle you can do many things, you can go many places. But you cannot go outside that circle, beyond the boundaries. These boundaries always remain the same. It is the same circle when you are four years old as it is when you are ninety. The heart is also a circle, but in the case of the heart the circle is constantly expanding and growing until it is infinite. In the heart there are no boundaries.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to feel that your thoughts are like food. In the kitchen you can either leave food on a counter and let it spoil, or you can put it into the refrigerator and preserve it. You can let your day's thoughts spoil in your mind after work, or you can put them away. After work you can either stay in the mind with your thoughts, or you can take the mind to the heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you care about your studies, you must try to get very good grades. If you get good marks that itself is a manifestation. When you secure good marks it will help you in the future expansion of our mission. You will be able to hold a better job and so forth. But if I have asked you to pay only a little attention to your studies and to devote yourself to manifestation, then it is a different matter.</p>
<p>You have left Puerto Rico and are in Florida in order to study. This is the time for you to study wholeheartedly. In your case, I advise you to do your studies first and inside your studies you must have a burning aspiration. You must convince yourself that you are studying not for the sake of study but for a higher purpose so that you will be able to serve us better. Do not spend all of your time praying and meditating or mixing with your brother and sister disciples to receive peace, light and bliss. That would be a mistake. Don't give up going to the Centre, but do not be involved with doing selfless service. The very purpose of study must not be neglected — first things first. Your studies, which are a form of aspiration, must be given first importance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can the academic life and the spiritual life go hand in hand?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can the academic life and the spiritual life go hand in hand?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please do not separate your academic life from your aspiring life. You have to feel that you are not studying to become a mental or an intellectual giant. No, you are studying to become good so that you can be of better service to mankind. If you are studying a particular subject in order to teach it to someone, then you will do it devotedly, with utmost love. On the other hand, if you are studying because you want to show others that you are far superior to them, then there will always be problems, because you will be at the top and they will be at the foot of the tree. If you are studying in order to become good, then if I am at the foot of the tree, you will also want to be at the foot of the tree. You will not feel that you are becoming an intellectual giant and your friends and acquaintances are all inferior to you. Goodness and good service are nothing but aspiration, pure aspiration. Goodness is always aspiration, but greatness is always mixed with the vital. The moment I use my heart of goodness, I see that everybody is divine, everybody is beautiful. You exist as well as I. But when I use my vital of greatness, there is no second person. Only I exist and nobody else. But in the end we have to realise that there is no "I," "you" or "we"; there is only God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When someone meditates properly, divinely and unconditionally, he is bound to feel peace of mind and he is bound to feel that he has a very large heart, where he can house the entire world. When someone meditates properly, he feels spontaneous joy. Sometimes he may not know where this joy is coming from, but it actually comes from his own meditation. When a person meditates whole-heartedly, from the depths of his heart, he feels that every moment is an opportunity to do something great, to feel something divine, to grow into something supreme, something transcendental.</p>
