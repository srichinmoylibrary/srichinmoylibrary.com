  <h2 id="page-title">Waiting at the airport</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Waiting at the airport" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My friend who was going to drive me to Madras Airport from Pondicherry advised me, "No matter when the flight is, you should be there five hours before."</p>
<p>I fully agreed with him. I said, "Otherwise, something may go wrong."</p>
<p>The plane was supposed to leave at 2:15 in the morning. He brought me to the airport at nine o'clock. I said, "Do not worry about me. I will read. I will buy some books."</p>
<p>I went to the counter and saw that the flight number was 401, instead of 101. The stupid thing is that they do not mention the destination, only the flight number. They should say it is Bombay. Then I went and bought eight or ten books: books of wisdom, books of proverbs and all kinds of things. I sat facing the counter, only fifteen or twenty metres away. People were coming and going.</p>
<p>Around 10:30, long before the scheduled time, I went to the counter and showed my ticket just to check. The man said, "Your ticket says 101. Can you not see this is 401?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, it is 401, and mine is 101."</p>
<p>The man said, "101 is a later flight."</p>
<p>I believed him.</p>

<p>I had ten or twelve books. I was reading them, but since they were so thick, I said, "Let me tear out the pages that I want."</p>
<p>Any place that was important, I ticked off, and then I tore out the pages that I had marked. The man who was sitting beside me asked, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>I said, "I have to go to America, so I do not wish to carry all these books. They are so heavy."</p>
<p>These were Chinese proverbs, a book of wisdom, a book of friendship and others. From each book I got perhaps four or five pages.</p>
<p>The man sitting next to me asked, "Can I take these books that you have discarded?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, by all means take them."</p>
<p>So the man took the books, while I kept only a few pages from each one.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Acting on wrong information</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Acting on wrong information" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Many passengers gathered for flight 401, which departed at eleven o'clock. Around 11:30 I went again to the counter. I said, "Now, tell me, when will the other plane arrive?"</p>
<p>The man said, "What are you saying? Flight 101 leaves from Bombay. Here it is 401."</p>
<p>I said, "Your colleague told me that flight 101 will be later. Now you are saying he was wrong."</p>
<p>The man said, "101 is from Bombay."</p>
<p>I said, "It said 401. Mine was reconfirmed as 101." I showed them the receipt even.</p>
<p>He said, "It is all over. At 11:00 the plane left for Bombay. From here it was 401. The flight number changes to 101 in Bombay."</p>
<p>Such wrong information was on my ticket. When my friend called British Airways from Pondicherry, they could have told him at that time. The airport officials were saying to blame British Airways because they issued the ticket.</p>
<p>I said, "Why should I blame British Airways? When I reconfirmed here, at this counter, why did you not check it? When I first showed you my ticket, why did you not tell me that 101 is from Bombay but from here it is 401, even though my ticket says 101?"</p>
<p>Who can deal with these people? They said, "You can go and speak to the duty manager." The duty manager was a fat lady. I told her everything, and she told me, "It is the fault of British Airways."</p>
<p>I said, "How can it be? I came to India on British Airways, but I am going back on Air India. When I showed my ticket here at the Air India counter, they told me my flight was later. They could have informed me at that time that flight 401 becomes 101."</p>
<p>The duty manager insisted, "No, it is not our fault."</p>
<p>I said, "Somebody has to take the blame. If it is not your fault, then when I came before, at that time why did the man say 101 was later, instead of saying it goes from Bombay?"</p>
<p>She maintained it was not their fault. I said, "What can I do now?"</p>
<p>She said, "Tomorrow morning there is another flight at 7:15 from Bombay to London, but you will miss it. By the time you arrive in Bombay, it will be gone. I can give you a direct flight from here to London. You have to be here tomorrow morning. It leaves at half past seven."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The departure tax</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The departure tax" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>O God, I had to wait another eight hours at the airport! From time to time, I would go and get tea to stay awake. One I drank was very strong. By this time my books were all finished. I said, "Let me buy two or three newspapers. Since the flight is at 7:30, I should be there at 4:30." Actually, I was already there, since I was reading and moving around right near the counter. I wanted to be first in line.</p>
<p>At 4:30, I was standing at the counter. Somebody else came around five o'clock. He was a friend of the ticket checker, so he went first. Then I needed to pay the airport departure tax. The man who was in charge of collecting the departure tax was fast asleep. Here I lost my first place. I was knocking and knocking. Finally, he opened up. When I went to pay, I found I did not have enough Indian currency. They needed three hundred rupees. I had only American hundred-dollar bills. The man said to me, "Are you crazy? Why do you want to give me so much money?"</p>
<p>I said, "I do not have enough rupees."</p>
<p>I searched and found a fifty-dollar bill, but fifty was also too much for him. I searched again and found a twenty-dollar bill. At last he gave me change. After paying my departure tax, I said, "Now I have to keep myself awake for God knows how long. Let me go out again to buy another tea."</p>
<p>This time, however, the tea man was fast asleep! I did not want to torture him. I waited until they announced the flight, and then I boarded the plane.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My London experience</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My London experience" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My 'direct' flight from Madras to London went to Kuwait, Cairo, Italy, France and so many places! Flying from London to Bombay took only eight and a half hours. This way it took ten or eleven hours.</p>
<p>When the plane finally arrived in London, the equipment was not functioning properly, so we had to come down from the plane using ordinary stairs, not a covered walkway. It was really raining hard. The workers had umbrellas, but for us there were no umbrellas. They said that if we wanted umbrellas, we would have to wait for a few minutes. Who wanted to wait? After such a long flight, nobody wanted to stay on board. The workers were saying to be very careful and to hold onto the rail.</p>
<p>In order to make my connection to New York, I had to go to Terminal 4. There I had to get a new boarding pass. Terminal 4 was quite far from the place where we had arrived. A few other passengers were with me. The officials said that within fifteen minutes a coach would come to take us to Terminal 4. The first coach we missed. Then we waited another fifteen or twenty minutes. I said, "What can we do?" There were three of us who wanted to make this connection and we had very little time. About half an hour later the coach came, and we three entered. We went to Terminal 4, which was quite far. By walking it would have been impossible, and it was raining.</p>
<p>People say that the British are very, very polite, but I think politeness is found in the dictionary only. Our waiting area was empty. When I went to the man who was supposed to take care of us, he said, "Just a minute," and he left. After five or ten minutes he had not returned. His jacket was still on the seat but he was not coming back.</p>
<p>I did not know how much time I had. Already my plane from India had been late. I could have only half an hour left at most before the flight left. I was so sad. I said, "Everywhere I will have this kind of fate."</p>
<p>On the other side, it said 'First Class.' The man who was taking care of first class said to me, "Now that there is no passenger here, you can come."</p>
<p>I went to him very thankfully. He said, "I can give you the boarding pass, but I am unable to give you the seat number."</p>
<p>I said, "It is only half an hour before the plane departs."</p>
<p>He said, "I am sorry, but I cannot give you a seat number. For a seat number you will have to go to gate number 10, and they will give it to you."</p>
<p>Gate 10 was quite far. I walked and walked and went to gate 10. Although it was clearly written gate 10, I saw that nobody was there. I said, "The plane will leave in half an hour, but nobody is here. How could it be? He definitely told me gate 10.</p>
<p>I suspected that something had gone wrong. Usually I never read the schedules on the television screen. This time I said, "Let me look for the British Airways plane that goes to New York." On the screen it said that the gate was number 4. I said, "I have been sent to gate 10. Now I have to go to gate 4, which is so far away. Here I am in trouble."</p>
<p>Luckily, an airport official arrived. I said to her, "I was sent to gate 10 and there is nobody here. Now the screen says it is gate 4."</p>
<p>The lady said, "Yes, we thought it would be 10, but it has changed."</p>
<p>I had to return to gate 4. I was forced to walk extremely fast. The whole way I was only cursing myself for believing these people who give me wrong directions.</p>
<p>At gate 4, almost everybody was on board. There were hardly three or four persons ahead of me. Both my knees were hurting.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Sitting in a cloud of smoke</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Sitting in a cloud of smoke" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I entered into the plane. I was so happy that at long last my problems were over. I showed my boarding pass to the steward. My seat number was 14B. This steward was so careless and callous. Instead of 14B, he pointed out to me 14E. I did not say anything. Perhaps he had his own reasons. I sat there. Soon afterwards, somebody came and told me that it was his seat number. He said, "Yours must be 14B."</p>
<p>I explained, "The steward asked me to sit here."</p>
<p>Then I took my bag and moved to 14B. I said, "Even here I have to get wrong information? This is too much."</p>
<p>I was seated on the aisle and next to me, on my left, was a very fat man, but there was plenty of space so it was no problem. Across the aisle, on my right, there were three seats. In the first was a businessman with lots of papers, and next to him was the young man who found that I had made a mistake.</p>
<p>The pilot made an announcement: "We shall deeply appreciate it if you do not smoke." When I was given my seat, I had no choice as to whether I was in a smoking or non-smoking area. At that time I did not care, as long as I was finally inside the plane. Now I discovered that smoking is allowed in executive class.</p>
<p>The pilot himself made the announcement requesting people not to smoke, although it was not forbidden. Then the man who was on my right side started smoking. The plane had not taken off yet. Luckily, the smoke was not coming towards me. Suddenly, the young man to the right of the businessman stood up and said to him, "The hell with you." The businessman smiled at him. Then the young man left and went to the economy section. He had bought a ticket for executive class, but he went to the economy section to find a non-smoking place. He did not come back.</p>
<p>I counted six cigarettes. One after the other the businessman was smoking, and he did not know how to stop. Still, the plane had not yet started. There was a very nice-looking man who was sitting next to the one who had left. This second innocent man also stood up to find a place in the economy section, but nothing was there. He was so miserable. He had to come back and sit near the big business executive.</p>
<p>I said to myself, "God has saved me." But God does not know how to save me. At intervals of fifteen or twenty minutes, the businessman would get the inspiration to turn towards me and blow his smoke in my direction. Usually he would blow his smoke on the right side, but sometimes he was relaxed and he would get the inspiration to smoke turning in the other direction. I was so disappointed. The man who sat on my left side became furious, but what could he do? Both of us were suffering like anything.</p>
<p>So many people were suffering because of this man who would not stop smoking. And this particular flight lasted seven hours and forty minutes.</p>

<p>At the airport in London, the stewardesses and their luggage had to be examined thoroughly, like us. The police came inside the plane to take one of the stewardesses back to airport security because she had not been examined. She said, "Yes, I will go, but I hate the person who examines us."</p>
<p>The police said, "Then come with us, and we will find somebody else."</p>
<p>So the police took this stewardess back into the terminal.</p>
