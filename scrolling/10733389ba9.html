<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If he is sincere, the older one Will be very humble because he knows how great his Father is in comparison to him. A spiritual Master is like a mother. The mother has more wisdom than the child, but she does not feel superior. She merely feels it is her bounden duty to offer her light to her son. The inner bond, the bond of oneness, is so strong that the mother never feels superior. Similarly, if the older brother is spiritual, if he is sincerely devoted to God, he will feel that it is his duty to teach others what someone else has taught him.</p>
<p>The feeling of superiority comes only when we are not spiritual. Then ego comes to the fore. But if we are spiritual, the first thing we try to do is surrender our individuality and become universal. When we become universal, the question of ego or superiority does not arise at all. I know something; so I am sharing it with you. If I have a fruit, I will get the greatest joy if I can share it with the members of my family. If I eat it all by myself, I will only be acting like a greedy fellow and I will not get the deepest satisfaction.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can manifest our spiritual aspiration in our daily conduct provided we try to see the divine in other people all the time. We know that all human beings have defects. But by just thinking of their weaknesses and shortcomings, we do not help them in any way. At the same time, when we look at the dark side of a human being, we immediately create some spots on the tablet of our own heart. When we are aspiring we should try to see only the good things, the divine things in our friends, relatives and neighbours. We should try to look at others and deal with others as we would like them to deal with us. This is the Golden Rule. But if we pay attention to the defects and shortcomings of others, then today we will see a few defects, tomorrow teeming defects and the day after tomorrow infinite defects in their nature. What benefit will anybody get from this? This is the wrong approach. The right approach is to see divinity in others. Today if we see an iota of divinity in an individual, tomorrow we will be able to see a little more and the day after tomorrow much more. Light, then more light, then abundant light, then infinite Light we want to see in ourselves and in others.</p>
<p>But we can do this only if we sincerely aspire and make ourselves feel that we are all players in God’s cosmic Game. We are all equally important. Today we are awakened and tomorrow others will also be awakened. If we are seekers and if we see somebody who is not aspiring, we will say, “No, his hour has not struck today; but his hour may strike tomorrow.” Knowing the fact that he will be awakened tomorrow, let us give him our love, our light and our feeling of oneness. If we can establish the feeling of oneness, then our problem is solved.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are only two ways: prayer and meditation. In meditation there are three stages: concentration, meditation and contemplation. Aspiration houses both prayer and meditation. If you have aspiration, that is the most important thing you need. This aspiration can be manifested in two different ways — either through your most soulful prayer or through concentration, meditation and contemplation. If you follow either path, you can reach your goal.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the true spiritual life the Christian way and the Indian way are the same. All ways to God-realisation are basically the same. If we have a pure heart and cry to feel the presence of God, that is the way. When we establish a pure heart, everything comes to us. How do we make ourselves pure? Through prayer or meditation — either by invoking Peace, Light and Bliss from above or by entering into the world of purity, beauty and luminosity. A pure heart can constantly feel the presence of God. Just because we do not have a pure heart, we do not feel the presence of God all the time. Once we feel the presence of God constantly, all our problems will be solved.</p>

<h2>Question: How can one discover one’s mantra?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one has a spiritual Master, then he should get the mantra from his Master directly. If he does not have a Master, then he has to go deep within in order to discover the best mantra for him. But in the meantime he can chant <em>AUM</em>. <em>AUM</em> is the mother of all mantras. Its divine power is very great.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has created for us His divine fulfilment. He wants satisfaction, divine satisfaction, from us; He wants manifestation and perfection in us and through us. If God’s Hour strikes for us and we do not play our role, then we will have to complete our task at some other time. It is part of God’s Vision that each and every soul will complete its allotted task, either today or tomorrow. If we miss our opportunity, God will say, “All right, you have missed this opportunity, but I will give you another opportunity.” Again and again He will give us opportunities. But if we constantly ignore them or misuse them, eventually He will use His supreme Authority and compel us to complete our allotted task.</p>

When your desires diminish, you have to know that you are making real progress and running toward your goal.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes! The human soul has to go through the seven planes of consciousness in order to arrive at the ultimate Freedom. The soul is like a bird that has to fly up from one branch to another until it reaches the highest branch. The human soul has to fly up through the seven planes of consciousness and then it has to descend again to distribute the fruits from these seven branches. First it ascends for realisation then it has to descend for manifestation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does the soul have a mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does the soul have a mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now we feel that the mind is our highest part. Occasionally the mind may ask us to do something and the body may revolt. The mind may ask us to go and watch a movie, but the body may say, “No, no! I am very tired. I want to take rest.” However, most of the time the body and the vital do listen to the mind. But the mind has tremendous limitations. It constantly makes mistakes. This moment the mind judges somebody and says that he is very good. The next moment the mind says that this same person is very bad. The third moment the mind will ask, “Was I right in judging this man at all?” The mind never comes to a final conclusion. It is always restless and vacillating, When it arrives at a truth it feels that perhaps this is not the truth, so it looks for some other truth.</p>
<p>The soul does not have a mind; nor does the soul need a mind. The soul is the direct representative of God and is in direct touch with Him. The soul is all Light. Its messages are carried through Light. Once we get the soul’s inner message, we can rest assured that this message has come from the Source. But when the mind gives us any message, on the way from the realm of Truth to the realm of mind, the message is totally ruined. Even when the message is true, the physical mind may not understand it or may distort it.</p>
<p>When we speak of the mind, it is the physical mind that we are referring to. This mind is compelled to work in the physical and for the physical right now. But there is also the illumined mind, which we develop through aspiration. There is a great difference between the physical mind and the illumined mind, overmind and supermind. Most people do not have these higher types of mind.</p>
<p>The physical mind is an insufficient, inadequate instrument for the divine manifestation. The soul, which is a divine instrument, does not need a mind. But the soul can and will transform and utilise the mind. It will transform the doubtful, suspicious mind into the illumined mind just as it transforms the aggressive vital into the dynamic vital and the lethargic body into the active body. Being the best member of the family, it will transform the other members and make them as perfect as it is.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Light, peace, delight, love, power, are all brothers and sisters in the Supreme’s family. Light does not allow us to do anything wrong because light knows that we all come from the same source. If we have light, then we will not quarrel and fight on the physical plane. Automatically we will have peace. We will have some inner satisfaction. If we are satisfied deep within ourselves, then we will not try to show our authority or impose our personality or individuality on others. We will not have to spread our personality-wings because our inner satisfaction is based on our universal oneness with everything and everyone else. Peace and light complement one another. When we have light, we see that inside light peace automatically grows. And when we have peace, we are bound to find light inside it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the seeker has a spiritual Master, the Master can easily tell him in the course of his spiritual studies what his soul came into the world to achieve or to manifest. If the seeker does not have a spiritual Master, then his aspiration must give him the answer. As his inner flame climbs up, it illumines the seeker’s ignorance. When ignorance is illumined, the seeker will be able to see, feel and know the mission of his soul. If he is without a Master, it will take a longer time for him to reach this inner knowledge, because he has to swim across the sea of ignorance all by himself. But if he has a Master, then the Master will offer him a boat, and once he is inside the boat, he is safe. The Master, like a pilot, will take him to the goal. Once the seeker knows what the Will of God is for him, immediately he can start working to achieve that thing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you meditate deep within, you can hear the soundless sound. Now I am chanting ‘AUM’. Because I am using my outer voice, you can hear it. But there is a way of chanting in silence. When we chant in this way, the sound reverberates in the inmost recesses of our heart. This sound is infinitely more powerful than the sound that I create with my voice. It is beyond your imagination. Your human ears will not hear this inner sound, but your inner ear will hear it.</p>
<p>To produce the outer sound, I have to use some physical force. But the inner sound, the <em>Anahata Nada</em>, does not need any help from anything or from anybody to be produced. It is self-creating. Silence itself holds that sound. Silence is God’s Dream and sound is God’s Reality. The Dream and the Reality always go together.</p>

<p>Early in 1974 Sri Chinmoy delivered a series of lectures at universities in Eastern Canada. The talks delivered were published under the title <em>My Maple Leaves</em>. The questions asked by Sri Chinmoy’s audiences after the lectures and the Master’s illumining answers are now being published in Volumes I and II of <em>Canada Aspires, Canada Receives, Canada Achieves</em>.</p>
