<p>In Acapulco we went to see a circus which I liked very much. If we had not had anything else to do that night, I would have stayed to see it again. That kind of circus gives me innocent joy. Some of the acts were daring; others were absolutely easy.</p>

<p>One morning I ran seven miles while it was still very dark. When it is dark, you forget about speed. You feel that as long as you continue running, it is enough. The first mile I did in nine minutes and the last was at an eight-thirty pace. Altogether I averaged only a nine-minute pace, so God knows how slowly I ran the other five miles. A nine-minute pace is very bad. Of course, I was not racing. But if it had not been dark, I would have taken off at least fifteen seconds per mile.</p>

<p>Later that day I wanted to buy a dress for Shubhra for her birthday. The price was a hundred and seventy pesos, so I gave the lady two hundred. As she was giving me my change, I was listening to her count. After twenty-four, she said, "Thirty." I hadn't watched her, but it sounded wrong to my ear, so in front of her I started counting the change. She had only given me twenty-five pesos.</p>

<p>I was standing on line to get my seat assignment on the plane to Puerto Rico. The ticket agent was taking care of the man in front of me. All of a sudden the ticket agent said to me in a very contemptuous way, "Are you going first class?"</p>
<p>I answered, "Yes. I am."</p>
<p>Then she said to me, "Smoking or non-smoking?" in the same nasty tone of voice.</p>
<p>I said, "Non-smoking." Then I said, "What is the matter with you so early in the morning?"</p>
<p>She said, "Man, my husband is in the hospital. I am worried!" She was white, not black, but she spoke like a black lady.</p>
<p>I said, "Just because you are worried, do you have to be so nasty?"</p>
<p>She said, "Send a prayer to him."</p>
<p>I said, "I have already sent one."</p>
<p>Then she put a sticker with my seat number on my ticket and gave it back to me.</p>

<p>Ashrita had put a big box of ERG with my luggage for Bansidhar to use in our marathon. When my luggage passed through the machine, the inspector said something to me half in English and half in Spanish.</p>
<p>I said, "Please tell me in English."</p>
<p>She said, "What is in this box?"</p>
<p>I said, "ERG."</p>
<p>She said, "ERG? What's that?"</p>
<p>I said, "You don't know what ERG is?"</p>
<p>She said, "No!"</p>
<p>I said, "Runners use ERG."</p>
<p>Then she said, "Wait." Four or five minutes I waited. Then I asked the inspector, "Have you sent for someone?"</p>
<p>She said, "No, I am waiting for someone to come."</p>
<p>A very fat old lady was passing through the line. She had overheard our conversation, and she got the point. She turned around and said to the inspector either "Honey!" or "Dummy!" Then she said, "My grandson lives on ERG. In the New York Marathon he did so well."</p>
<p>Then the inspector allowed me to go through the line. She told me to go in Spanish.</p>

<p>There were two ladies sitting near me on the plane. One was an old lady, a grandmother, and the other was her daughter, whose son had just died. The mother had her arm around the grandmother, and she was consoling her. They were both crying.</p>
<p>At one point the mother said, "I am his mother. Do you think I didn't love him?"The grandmother said, "Yes, you loved him, but I loved him much, much more than you did. Now keep quiet!"</p>
<p>So the mother kept quiet. In this way the mother was insulted by the grandmother.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Indian</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Indian" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The man who was sitting next to me on the plane had three newspapers: the New York Times, the Daily News and the Post. He was reading the Daily News and the other two papers were lying next to him. After an hour a lady came up to him and said, "Sir, hello. Can I borrow your New York Times? I see you are not reading it."</p>
<p>The man answered, "No, you can't!"</p>
<p>The lady said, "But you have three newspapers."</p>
<p>Again he said, "No, no!"</p>
<p>From his accent I could tell that he was an Indian. Previously I had noticed that he had dark skin, but I had been in my own world.</p>
<p>I turned to him and said, "Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>He said, "India." Then he asked me, "Where are you from?" I answered, "India."</p>
<p>I said I was from Bengal, and he told me he was from Bombay. I said, "You have three newspapers. You can't give her one?"</p>
<p>He said, "A few days ago I took an oath that I will never do anything for an American. I will not do any favours for any Americans. I hate them, I hate them!"</p>
<p>"Where are you living?" I asked.</p>
<p>"America," he said, "but that is between the government and me."</p>
<p>We were speaking in English since I didn't know Gujarati and he didn't know Bengali. Strangely enough, we also came back on the same flight. We saw each other before we entered into the plane. He was carrying a box that contained a wine bottle. This time he was in first class and I was in economy class.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Running the marathon</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Running the marathon" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I ran ten miles in our Sri Chinmoy Marathon in San Juan. Many of the runners recognised me. About a hundred people joined, but only two were women. There were national guardsmen in uniform helping out in the race, since we had only nine disciples there. We got a lot of help from the guards and other organisations. Everywhere people gave out water, ERG and time splits. The time splits were in Spanish. I would say, "Please tell me in English." Then they would tell me after I had already gone ten metres past them.</p>
<p>We had to do five and a half laps on the track before leaving the stadium. For the good runners they kept track of the laps. But for the runners like me, who cared? If we deceived anyone, it did not matter since we were not going to get any place. So they did not count our laps.</p>
<p>Even after one mile it was so hot! You just died! I ran five miles at an 8:43 pace. Then I started walking and running. I would run three hundred metres and walk thirty or forty because I had a lot of pain in my foot. In this way I completed ten miles with an average pace of 9:24. Then it started raining heavily.</p>
<p>The winner got cramps at twenty-four miles. Only with greatest difficulty he kept going and stood first. The second runner was only a hundred metres behind him. Both of them entered into the stadium at practically the same time. Last year's best time was 2:27, but this year the winner finished in 2:37 because of his cramps.</p>
<p>At the awards ceremony afterwards there was a large banquet. I would say one line thanking everyone, and Uttama would translate it into ten lines. Usually he translates exactly what I say, but on that day he was elaborating and elaborating.</p>
<p>The Director of the Montreal Marathon happened to be in Puerto Rico on that day, and he had signed up to run in the race. The Montreal Marathon is a very big race, with eight to ten thousand people. He had registered, but then on the day of the marathon, he got sick. He did come to the awards ceremony after the race, but I was in a terrible hurry to catch my plane. Otherwise, I would have spoken to him.</p>

<p>I got two birds in Puerto Rico and I wanted to bring them back to New York. The pet shop told me they were Quaker parrots.</p>
<p>Usually you need a certificate to bring birds into the United States. When I went to get the certificate, they told me it would take four or five days. So I couldn't get it.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the airport, the inspector opened my bag and saw the box with the birds in it. He told me, "I have to see the birds. If they are very small, I will allow you to take them. Otherwise, I will have to charge you. And if they are very rare, you will need special permission to take them."</p>
<p>I said, "Just yesterday I came here and today I am leaving. How could I get a certificate, since it takes four or five days?"</p>
<p>He asked, "Why did you come here?"</p>
<p>I said, "I came here to run the marathon."</p>
<p>He said, "What marathon?"</p>
<p>I said, "The Sri Chinmoy Marathon."</p>
<p>He said, "The marathon of Master Sri Chinmoy?" He did not know who I was. He just knew about the Sri Chinmoy Marathon from the radio and news papers.</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He said, "How did you do?"</p>
<p>I said, "I ran only ten miles."</p>
<p>He said, "Poor man," and he didn't even open the box with the birds. He just let me go through.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The stewardess</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The stewardess" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>On the plane I was sitting in the front row of seats near the wall where they show the movie. I had a bag with me which I put at my feet. The stewardess, a black lady, said, "You can't put it there. You have to put it in the cabinet."</p>
<p>Inside my bag was the box with the birds in it. If I didn't keep my bag open, I was afraid the birds might die. So as the stewardess was putting the bag into the closet I said, "I would like to open up the zipper on the bag. There is something in there."</p>
<p>She laughed and laughed at me. After fifteen minutes, when the plane was about to take off, she closed the cabinet and locked it. I was worried that perhaps there was not enough oxygen for the birds, but the seatbelt sign was on, so I stayed in my seat. Finally, after fifteen or twenty minutes the sign went off.</p>
<p>I went to the stewardess and said, "Please, I have some birds in the cabinet. Can I get them out?"</p>
<p>There was a sign on the cabinet that said while the plane is leaving the ground and while it is landing, the cabinet cannot be opened. But even though the plane was in the air, the stewardess said, "We are not authorised to open it."</p>
<p>Then I went to a steward, a black man, and I said, "Really, I don't want my birds to die."</p>
<p>He said, "We are not authorised to open the cabinet, but I will do it for you."</p>
<p>When he opened it, I immediately took out the box and put it in front of me. Then the stewardess came near me and called out to the steward, "Robert, how are your birds doing?"</p>
<p>She was bothering that fellow because he had helped me. So I looked at the stewardess and showed her a very disturbed face. Then she smiled at me and said, "What would you like to drink, sir?"</p>
<p>I said very abruptly, "Seven-up."</p>
<p>Then she brought it for me.</p>
<p>Beside me was a couple from Syracuse. The lady was so nice. She had heard my conversation with the stewardess and was cursing her. She said, "Some of these stewardesses have no feeling."</p>
<p>The husband asked me, "Do you think the birds are alive?"</p>
<p>I shook the box and said, "I think they are alive." The husband was so happy to hear that. The wife continued to curse the stewardess.</p>

<p>Before I left for Puerto Rico, my dentist said that my teeth were in "top shape." But while I was in Puerto Rico, I had such tooth pain! My gums were badly swollen and I had an abscess. So I had to take penicillin, this drug and that drug. What an experience!</p>
<p>I went to one dentist, a young man, who said to me, "I have seen you many times, not in this capacity, but in another capacity." He had seen me many times on television in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>The following day when I went back, he said, "It is a great pleasure to serve you. You are a man of insight." Then he said, "But I am sorry, I can't help you."</p>
<p>He refused to take money for the x-rays he had taken.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Canadian magician</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Canadian magician" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The day after we saw his performance, some other magicians who didn't claim to have occult power spoke against this man in an article in the newspaper. One of those who spoke against this Cuban magician was a magician from Toronto who happened to be in Puerto Rico at the same time. He could not bear the way the man we had seen was getting name and fame. So he invited the reporter from the "San Juan Star" to see his own performance. He told the reporter that he was a great magician and that he had even defeated Houdini by forty-five minutes in escaping from jail. He said that on one occasion Houdini had not even been able to escape from jail. Houdini had had all kinds of keys hidden away, but he could not open the lock. So he told the jail guard that something was wrong. The guard laughed and said, "The gate was not locked!"</p>
<p>This Canadian magician wanted to show his capacity. So first he took a spoon and broke it. Then another spoon appeared out of the blue. Next he took the spoon and started banging it on the table. Suddenly it became twelve spoons. Then the magician asked the reporter to give him a dollar bill and said he could turn it into a ten dollar bill. So the reporter gave him a dollar bid, and immediately he turned it into a ten dollar bill. Afterwards, a friend of the reporter came running to the Canadian magician with three dollar bills, hoping to get thirty dollars. He knocked and knocked on the magician's door, but the magician would not let him in.</p>

<p>In India we have a magician like Houdini. People hide a certain kind of mineral. Then they blindfold the magician, and he finds it-even if he has to walk three miles to the place where it is hidden. This is our occultism. He is considered to be as great as Houdini. His son has written a book about him.</p>
<p>Once a magician came to the ashram. He gave a ring to the Mother, and she was holding it. Then, in two seconds that same ring disappeared from her hand and appeared in his hand inside a handkerchief.</p>
<p>Next he showed us some ink. Then he threw the ink at the Mother and it turned into flowers. He said, "I don't want to ruin your clothes."</p>
<p>Then the magician threw a rope up into the air. It stayed in the air and he started climbing it. But that was not enough. In front of everybody he suddenly disappeared. Many people have written books about the Indian rope trick.</p>
<p>Another Indian trick is when they cover the magician's eyes and then place a coloured handkerchief in front of his face. They ask, "What colour is it?" and immediately the magician identifies the colour. These magicians are so tricky. When they do this trick, they stand on a small platform which has a hole in it. There is a tiny string which goes through the platform and is attached to one of the magicians feet. If the colour is red, the person with the string pubs two times; if it is green, three times. The magician says that he has occult power, but actuary someone is telling him what to say.</p>
<p>When I was six or seven years old, I tried some magic tricks. Even now I can still do a few tricks. One of the tricks that the Cuban magician did in Puerto Rico I showed to Bansidhar at the Centre the following day. He said, "How did you do it?" He couldn't believe the trick!</p>

<h2>The hundred-dollar room</h2>

<p>I stayed at the Princess Hotel. It was supposed to be quite elegant, but inside I saw only dirt and filth. Everything was broken and everything smelled. My room number was 226, but I had to press "3" in the elevator to go the second floor.</p>
<p>In that place everything went wrong. When I went to take a shower, in a few minutes the hot water became unbearably hot and there was no cold water. This was a one-hundred-dollar room. Forty dollars would have been more than enough!</p>
