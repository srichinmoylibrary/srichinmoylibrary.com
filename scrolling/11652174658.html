<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul is neither Eastern nor Western. But some souls take many of their incarnations in a particular part of the world and they absorb the vibration of this place. You live in a house. You are giving vibrations to the home and you may also receive a certain vibration from the home. When the soul enters into different states or countries, the mental, vital and physical vibrations enter into the soul. Then, either the soul has to illumine these vibrations or the soul is covered by the imperfections of the body, mind and vital in layer after layer.</p>
<p>If the soul takes quite a few more incarnations in the East, then it tends to be peace-loving. If the soul takes many incarnations in the West, then it tends to be dynamic. A Western soul is aware of its dynamism, vital dynamism, and it tries to manifest its reality through dynamism. An Eastern soul, which embodies a peace-loving heart, tries to offer its capacity primarily through peace.</p>
<p>Today there are quite a few sincere spiritual seekers in the West, quite a few. Many of them are Eastern souls. Here they are not getting proper spiritual nourishment and they are sad. Again, they know it is the Supreme who has planned it. Otherwise, they couldn’t have taken incarnation in the West. The soul can’t do anything without the sanction of the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In some cases, the Guru is predestined. In other cases, when the soul enters into the human incarnation, the soul selects a Guru.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul does not have to come to the Centre; the soul will get light no matter where it is. I feed the soul in the inner world. Your soul will get light directly from me. But your soul also has tremendous compassion for its little brothers and sisters, the vital and the mind. The soul says, “I have got so much. Now let them get something.” That is why the soul pleads with the brothers and sisters: “Accept light, accept light.” But the vital and the mind are always delaying. The soul is like a beggar: It is all the time pleading with your vital, with your mind, to listen.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, how can you know what was your soul’s promise to the Supreme before you came into the earth?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, how can you know what was your soul’s promise to the Supreme before you came into the earth?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can know your soul’s promise to the Supreme before you came in to the world only by constantly feeling that you are not the body, you are not the mind, you are not even the heart; you are only the soul. If you feel that you don’t have the physical, if you feel that you have and you are only the soul, den naturally the soul’s vision will come forward and immediately you will know your soul’s promise. The soul is always conscious of its promise, but the mind is not aware of it. But when the soul gets the opportunity to come to the fore, then the mind is convinced. When the mind and the heart identify themselves with the soul, then they feel that the soul’s promise is also their promise.</p>
<p>Right now you live in the body. So, all your problems are in the physical world: where you will stay, what you will eat, how you will mix with people. Just because you live in the physical consciousness, you have all physical problems. But if you live in the soul, then you will have the so-called problems of the soul. If I feel that I am a spiritual Master, then I have all the problems of disciples and Centres. But if I believe I am poet, then I will have very few problems. Some people will appreciate my poems and some people won’t appreciate them, but I won’t have to take any responsibility. But if I live in the soul, then the world becomes my problem.</p>
<p>The soul’s promise, its only promise, is to reveal, manifest and fulfil the Supreme at every moment in the Supreme’s own Way. To reveal and manifest God most perfectly on earth is the only promise that everybody’s soul makes. It makes this promise consciously and constantly. But according to one’s receptivity, according to the soul’s capacity, one reveals and manifests. So, remain in the soul and feel that you are the soul and without fail, you will know what your soul’s promise was, is and forever will be.</p>
<p>Again, you have to be wise. If you think that you can do all kinds of undivine things and then immediately escape by saying, “I am the soul, I am the soul,” then you are only deceiving yourself. If you are driving a taxi and turn on the meter so that the fare increases like anything, at that time you cannot say, “I am above this, I am the soul.” No, that is absurd. Right now you have only to keep in mind that you are a chosen instrument; all the disciples are chosen instruments. Right now you are praying to the Supreme to give you Light so that you can come out of ignorance. You can say that you are the soul, but if somebody screams at you, your soul-realisation will immediately go away. So, it is not enough for your mind to say, “I am the soul, I am the soul.” It is only when you have major experiences of the highest Height, and when they become constant in your day-to-day activities, that you can feel that you are truly the soul. Otherwise, if your life-reality is all ignorance, just because you have read in a book that all is the Brahman, you cannot say, “I am the Brahman. I am the highest Height.”</p>
<p>So, if it is not natural and spontaneous for you to feel that you are the soul, try to use your imagination. Then pray most sincerely, meditate most sincerely and devotedly, and try to make it something permanent in your life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The vital, when it is united with the soul, can have a mission. Otherwise, the vital does not have a mission of its own. When the vital surrenders to the soul and becomes one with the soul, then only does the mission of the soul become the mission of the vital. The body, the mind, the vital, and the body: they do not have an independent mission. There is only one mission, and that is the mission of the soul.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for many centuries the mind, the vital and the body do not listen to the soul. But a day comes when they are bound to listen. Then the mission of the soul becomes the mission of the vital, the mission of the physical and the mission of the mind.</p>
<p>As the body, vital and mind surrender to the soul, so also we as individuals have to surrender to the Supreme’s Will. Then the Mission of the Supreme becomes our mission. I say that I have my mission, you say that you have your mission, he says that he has his mission. But only on the strength of our absolute identification with the Supreme, in our selfless surrender, can we say that it is <em>our</em> mission.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To expect to feel the soul right now, at the very beginning, is like coming to school and expecting to get your Master’s degree overnight. The teacher will say, “You have not gone through primary school and high school, so how am I to give you your Master’s degree?”</p>
<p>To feel the presence of the soul you have to meditate for a couple of years. Right now, to feel the presence of the soul is not necessary. That which is of greatest importance for a beginner is aspiration. You want to arrive at your destination, but right now you don’t have the money to buy the ticket. The money here is aspiration. When you increase your aspiration, you can buy the ticket. I am not trying to throw cold water upon you. Only I wish to say that if you go slowly and steadily, then you shall win the race. Right now I don’t even know how to walk properly. If I don’t know how to walk properly, how can I expect to run very fast? I have to reach my goal; that is my ultimate aim. But right now my aim is to stand up and try to learn how to walk. Then, when I can walk, I will try to march; when I can march, I will try to run; when I can run, I will try to run the fastest. Only then shall I reach my goal.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Guru, what is the difference between the psychic being and the soul?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything has a soul, but the psychic being is only in human beings. It is not in animals or inanimate objects. The psychic being is like a flame that is kindled in a human being. But this does not happen in the first or second or third human incarnation. In some cases, it takes quite a few incarnations before the psychic being comes into existence. There are many seekers, even here with us, who still unfortunately do not have a psychic being, became they have not had many incarnations. Again, someone can have many incarnations, but if he does not aspire, in him the psychic flame will not be kindled. There is no hard and fast rule as to when the psychic being will come into existence. But we can safely say that in the human incarnation one day the psychic being will come into existence. It depends on the sincerity and intensity of the seeker’s inner cry. When the psychic being comes, first we feel it, then we see it and finally we grow into it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it the soul that realises God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it the soul that realises God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul has already realised God. It is a portion of God and it is eternally for God. It is only our body, vital, mind and heart that have not realised God. The soul knows who God is and where God is and what God is; but the human being only gets glimpses. The human being must practice spirituality and inner discipline and realise the Highest.</p>
<p>When the human in us realises the Highest, at that time there is no difference between us and God. At that time, the vital does not remain the vital, the body does not remain the body, the mind does not remain the mind. They become inseparably one and they embody, reveal and manifest the Highest. There is no difference between that illumined consciousness and the highest Reality itself. Right now we feel that our nearest thing is our nose or our eyes. But when we realise God, we see that God is nearer to us than our own eyes, than our own nose. But right now we don’t have the inner vision to see Him.</p>
<p>So, only the human being must realise God, but not the soul proper. The soul proper must manifest God to the world at large; that is why the soul has come into the world.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul is infinitely superior to the mind. The soul gradually illumines and perfects the mind and then the mind gets divine characteristics. When the inferior is transformed totally, then it becomes the same as the superior. When the body, vital and mind are transformed, at that time the physical does not remain asleep, the vital does not remain aggressive and the mind does not remain doubtful. In the beginning the son makes mistakes. Then, when the father offers his wisdom to the son, at that time the son becomes as wise as his father. But the son cannot make the father wise.</p>

He has liberated himself, but he is always afraid that at any moment he will be attacked again and his liberation will go away. He remembers how much suffering he went through before he got liberation. There is only a remote possibility that he will go back to ignorance, but he is afraid. But a realised soul has established inseparable oneness with God. For him, Heaven, hell, everything is the same. He knows that God will be there. Whether or not he can keep God, he knows that God will keep him, no matter how bad he is. Realised souls have established oneness. Realisation is oneness, whereas liberation is freedom from suffering.</p>
<p>So, liberated souls are far inferior to realised Yogis. They are liberated from ignorance, but they are not twenty-four hours a day inseparably one with the Highest. They won’t do anything undivine; they won’t again wallow in the pleasures of ignorance. But a realised Yogi is someone who has gone far, far beyond ignorance. And even if he enters into ignorance, he is not at all affected. He is above it.</p>
<p>A liberated soul cannot illumine another person. Another person can get inspiration and aspiration from a liberated soul, but that soul will not be able to grant realisation. Liberated souls can only give you inspiration so that you will work out your own liberation. Realised souls not only have their own realisation but they can have disciples to whom they are trying to give realisation. A liberated soul can be very pure, very saintly, but he won’t be able to transform even one bad person. He feels that bad people are truly bad, and he is afraid that these bad people will catch him and take him back to ignorance. But a realised person will say, “I see inside you the presence of God,” and he will go to stay with bad people in order to change them.</p>
<p>Liberated souls do not care for nature’s transformation. If a fully liberated soul does want nature’s transformation, God is bound to give it to him. Usually the liberated soul wants only to be freed from bondage and ignorance. But the realised soul, while realising, is being transformed. Again, there is a very great difference between a Yogi and an Avatar. When one becomes a Yogi, he is able to do everything, but not on a large scale. He will be able to have a boat and carry some passengers. But an Avatar is for the whole world; his boat is for the whole world.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A liberated soul will feel a kind of peace, light and bliss which nobody else sees and feels. He can get answers to questions from his soul, or from a most luminous human being. The only thing is that he won’t be able to do what a realised soul does. Realised souls are like darling children. No matter when the parents are invoked, even if they are doing something most important, the parents will come when they see their children. One smile from the children is enough. But liberated souls are like perfect gentlemen. They will wait an hour or two to see the parents and they will leave only when the parents say that there is no possibility of seeing them today. But a realised soul has free access. A really realised soul doesn’t have to meditate two hours before he can see God.</p>
<p>In the West they speak about salvation. Salvation is much inferior to liberation. Salvation means freedom from sin. But liberation is something more; liberation is freedom from ignorance, which is a much broader concept than just sin. Liberation is dealing with ignorance. And realisation is dealing all the time with the inner suns.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does a realised soul feel anger?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does a realised soul feel anger?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A realised soul may express so-called anger. But actually it is divine authority that he is exercising. If he does not exercise his divine authority, which may take the form of outer anger, then he won’t be able to accomplish the needful. So, as a last resort, if it is the Will of God, he expresses so-called anger. Our human mind will call it anger, but in reality it is Justice-Light from above.</p>
<p>But an ordinary liberated soul will not dare to show anger. He is afraid of anger, afraid of impurity, afraid of quite a few earthly shortcomings. For he knows that he has just come out of a particular room, which is unlit, and if he goes back there to transform it, then he may be caught. A liberated soul is afraid of his past. But a realised soul is like a soldier. Once he has come out of the unlit room, he knows that he has to go inside again to fight for illumination. He says, “I have come out. Now, others also want to come out. So let me help them, save them, bring them out so that they also can become realised.” Again, a truly liberated soul — a soul that is absolutely liberated, totally liberated — eventually becomes God-realised. So, a day will come when he will also go back into the unlit room to help manifest divinity on earth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In his animal incarnation he will not know. A portion of the Avatar’s consciousness will know, but his conscious mind will not know. And unless you know something with the mind, you cannot be aware of it consciously. But when the Avatar takes human incarnation, which is infinitely more developed than the animal life, then he will be able to know.</p>
