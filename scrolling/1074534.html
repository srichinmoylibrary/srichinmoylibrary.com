<p><em>Aspiration is the cry for a higher life, a more fulfilling life, a more divine life. In this volume of essays, the God-realised spiritual Master Sri Chinmoy offers illumining advice to aspirants for the ultimate Truth. These essays were composed between 1968 and 1974.</em></p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Aspiration-cry</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Aspiration-cry" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Aspiration is a cry within our heart. As a child cries, so also in the heart you will feel a cry. A child is within you, shedding tears. He is weeping because he wants to transcend himself. This is the mounting cry, the climbing cry inside our heart. When we are aware of this cry, we call it <em>aspiration</em>. And when our heart’s cry makes us feel that we are not what we should be and that we need something more, then we start meditation. When we aspire with our heart’s tears, we see that God is coming down to us, descending from above. It is just like two persons meeting: one is on the first floor and the other is on the third floor. So what do we do? We go up to the second floor and God comes down to the second floor. There we meet and fulfil each other.</p>
<p>The stairway to the second floor is created by our heart’s tears and cries. The heart is crying and yearning like a mounting flame burning upward. This flame of the heart wants to go up beyond the mind, so it is always rising. God comes down. He is descending with His Grace, like a river running downward. He is constantly flowing down. Ours is the flame which always burns upward; God’s Grace, like a stream, is coming down from the Source. To the second floor God descends and to the second floor I ascend. On my part, it is aspiration that has brought me to the meeting place; and on God’s part, it is His Grace. When aspiration and Grace meet together, we come to experience the divine fulfilment of union with God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Awakening</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Awakening" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Awakening is the beginning of the soul’s journey toward the ultimate Goal. At every moment the inner awakening has to be fed and nurtured by our constant aspiration. If aspiration is lacking, then our awakening will remain a mere mental concept and will not lead us far.</p>
<p>Now, we have also to be awakened to the truth that God-realisation is something natural, normal, practical and inevitable. When a seeker’s inner awakening makes him feel that God-realisation is not only natural and normal, but also inevitable, then the seeker can really possess his own awakening.</p>
<p>It is not the number of years that we have been following a spiritual path, but the intensity of our aspiration that counts. This aspiration of ours must be fed — not just continually, but continuously; not just daily, but every second of our life.</p>
<p>The world does not understand spiritual people; it badly misunderstands them. So do not listen to what the world says. Think only of what your spiritual Teacher says, what your soul says. Your Master and your soul always offer the same divine message. If you have true aspiration and genuine love for God, if you want to go far, farther, farthest, then embark on the inner path. Your soul’s inner awakening will compel your body, vital, mind and heart to follow you devotedly.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">How to know God</h2><span property="dc:title" content="How to know God" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We can know what God actually is only through aspiration, not through desire. By desiring day in and day out we will never be able to know what God is or what God looks like. By desiring, we are limiting ourselves. But God is limitless, boundless. Through our aspiration we transcend ourselves, we go beyond ourselves. When we go beyond ourselves, at that time we become what God is. So it is through aspiration that we know what God is and what He looks like.</p>
<p>There is no end to our desires. But there is only one aspiration and it goes up, up, up. It does not fluctuate like desire. The ultimate goal of aspiration is to go to the Beyond, the ever-transcending Beyond. And the ever-transcending Beyond is nothing other than God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Inspiration-journey, aspiration-goal</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Inspiration-journey, aspiration-goal" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Without inspiration we cannot do anything or achieve anything. If we want to write a beautiful poem, if we want to compose music, if we want to achieve anything whatsoever, inspiration is necessary. In the spiritual life, this inspiration we can get by reading sacred books written by real spiritual Masters. When inspiration has played its role, we have to enter into the world of aspiration. We have to try to live the wisdom of the books.</p>
<p>How can we get aspiration? We have to cry deep within ourselves with the feeling that we desperately need Light and Peace. Once we are consciously aspiring, if we have a friend who is a very advanced seeker, he may be able to give us some help.</p>
<p>But we have to learn the secrets of concentration, meditation and contemplation. If we are absolutely sincere in our life of aspiration, then we are bound to come in contact with a true spiritual Master who can really help us and guide us toward our realisation.</p>
<p>When a child cries, no matter where his mother is, the mother comes. She knows the child is hungry; he needs milk. In the spiritual life also, when we cry for Peace, Light and Bliss, immediately a spiritual Master will come. He will act like a mother. In India it is said, “When the <em>chela</em> is ready, the Master is bound to come.” So when we are ready, God is bound to come to us in the form of our Master, the one who is meant for us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Inspiration from fellow-seekers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Inspiration from fellow-seekers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Inspiration and aspiration you are bound to get from a spiritual Master. But you can also get these divine qualities from the disciples of a Master. If you look at some of the disciples, or if you just stay near them without looking at them, you get a very good vibration. When you get a good vibration, you are automatically being inspired to go deep within. When you go home you will meditate for at least five minutes, or while walking along the street you will meditate. This is the result of the inspiration that you have received from them.</p>
<p>If you are standing in front of a swimming pool and you see that nobody is in the swimming pool, you just remain standing there. Because of your lethargy you won’t jump in. Or perhaps you will be afraid that the water is not warm enough. But if you see that some people are already swimming, then you will have no fear of the water and you will immediately jump in and swim. At that time you will feel that your whole existence is swimming and you will get fresh life, fresh energy. Similarly, when you are with the disciples of a spiritual Master, you will see that some of them are really swimming in the sea of aspiration. Your physical mind may not be aware of it, but your heart is making you feel that some people are really swimming. Now it is up to you to enter the sea of aspiration and swim with them.</p>
<p>Inspiration is the first step. But with inspiration you can only go so far. You need aspiration in order to reach your goal. You have entered into the sea of aspiration, but now you notice that some people are going to the other shore of the sea. What is carrying them? It is aspiration. Once you have inspiration, you will then get within you a burning cry, a burning eagerness to see what is on the other shore. You feel that your real Goal is to get to the Golden Shore. Aspiration alone will carry you to your destination. When you are swimming across the ocean, that is your aspiration; and when you reach the shore, that is your realisation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Identification with the divine</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Identification with the divine" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One of India’s great spiritual Masters, Sri Ramakrishna, used to say that if one thinks, “I am a sinner, I have committed a sin,” then he will always be a sinner because he will always be earthbound. The positive approach is to say, “My Father is God; He has created me. I have to be consciously one with Him as He is one with me. I am one with the eternal Truth but I am not yet consciously aware of it.”</p>
<p>You have to reach your Goal with your aspiration, your inner cry, or with the assertion of your own inner will when you say, “I am God’s son.” Either you have to cry for the Goal or you have to feel that you already have the Goal within and you just have to become consciously one with it. There are two ways to reach the Goal. One way is to go to God like a beggar and cry, “Father, give me, give me, give me Your Wealth.” The other way is to feel that your Father is keeping everything inside you. He is keeping a box within you and inside the box is the treasure. The key is also within you. Now if you have a spiritual teacher as your guide, the teacher can show you where the key is, where the box is and how to open it. But if you don’t have a spiritual teacher as your guide and if you want to have an inner experience, a mystical experience, then you have to cry for this inner experience. This cry is the cry of aspiration; it is not like shedding tears when you do the wrong thing.</p>
<p>There is always some time between the planting of the seeds and the harvest. The planting of the seeds is nothing but aspiration and the harvest is nothing but realisation. Without aspiration, realisation can never dawn. Aspiration: what is it? It is both something that we already have and something that we are going to have. If we say that we have had aspiration for some time, then we are right because we live in the everlasting life. And if we say that we do not now have aspiration but we are going to have it, that means we are trying or crying to bring the inner urge of the heart to the fore. This also is correct. When we sit at the feet of Eternity, we realise that aspiration is bound to be followed by realisation. And when we make friends with eternal time, we come to realise that realisation was always there, hidden in our aspiration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The cry for divine consciousness</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The cry for divine consciousness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We can enter into the divine consciousness through our inner cry. This cry is not for name and fame. This cry is for our total, unconditional, unreserved oneness with the Inner Pilot.</p>
<p>Some people are totally oblivious of the Inner Pilot. Again, some know of the existence of the Inner Pilot but they do not want to have any connection or communion with the Inner Pilot. But a sincere seeker feels the necessity of constant communion with the Inner Pilot. He is not satisfied by just knowing of God’s existence inside him. He wants to be in God’s consciousness and commune with Him twenty-four hours a day. Then only will he be satisfied.</p>
<p>If you want to achieve liberation and enter into the divine consciousness from the human consciousness, then gratitude also plays a most significant role. When one is receiving something from God, his whole heart becomes a flower of gratitude. Then if the soul wants to use the eyes in order to express its gratitude through tears, it can do so. But usually we feel the divine gratitude inside our heart. There it grows like a tiny plant which eventually becomes a huge banyan tree. Every seeker can say to God, “O God, You have already given me so much, far beyond my imagination. You have given me sound health, You have given me a sound brain, You have given me the capacity to distinguish right from wrong, darkness from light.” God has already given to each individual being the capacity to see, know and feel what is good and what is bad. But only a seeker feels the necessity of praying to God for something else. He says: “O God, You have given me the capacity to see the difference between right and wrong. Now please give me the capacity to <em>do</em> the right thing. Mere knowing is not enough; mere feeling is not enough. I have to act; I have to do the right thing on earth.”</p>
<p>Constantly you have to cry deep within yourself. Then you will see that your human consciousness is bathing in the sea of the divine consciousness. You have to feel the necessity of the divine consciousness inside you and around you. And you have to know that the human consciousness, which you represent right now, is not the goal. If you are totally dissatisfied with the human consciousness, then you have moved one step forward toward your goal. If you feel that the human life has disappointed and deserted you and that the divine life alone can fulfil you, then only the divine consciousness can enter into you. And when the divine consciousness enters into you, then you will feel that this divine consciousness will not negate your human consciousness. On the contrary, it will transform the human consciousness. It does not reject; it does not cast aside anything human. It purifies and illumines the human consciousness and transforms it into its own divine consciousness.</p>

<p>Desire is that which binds us. It wants to possess and be possessed. When we desire, we cry for one hundred, two hundred, three hundred things. When we aspire, at that time we don’t want to possess and we don’t want to be possessed. Inside us there is something which is boundless, limitless, infinite. When we aspire, we want to enter into that very thing within us which is boundless. We want only to become part and parcel of Him who is infinite. So desire is something that is going to bind us, whereas aspiration is something that throws us consciously into the sea of infinity.</p>
<p>Aspiration and desire are two different things. We cannot satisfy our desires. We can only change the object of our desires.</p>
<p>Today I would like another car and tomorrow I would like another house. If I am frustrated, if I am not fulfilled in a particular desire, then tomorrow I will have some other desire. Desires are constantly being changed. One moment we think of our aspiration and the next moment we think of our desire. If we get an opportunity to fulfil ourselves through desire, we don’t hesitate. Again, when aspiration enters into us, we try to fulfil ourselves through aspiration. One time we take poison and the next time we take nectar. But we have to know that poison will destroy us, whereas nectar will fulfil us. Let us drink only the nectar of aspiration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The source of aspiration</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The source of aspiration" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We feel that aspiration is something we create. To some extent it is true. But at the same time we should feel that aspiration is something that is coming from above and lifting our human consciousness to the highest plane. Then we have to let this aspiration enter into us. We have to capture the aspiration-bird and allow the bird to carry us. Most of you have faith in your Master, but you do not have faith in your own seeking, your own search, your own aspiration. I wish to tell you, please try to have implicit faith in your aspiration. Feel that like your aspiration, this faith is also coming from the Supreme. Feel that the faith you are offering to yourself and to your Master is directly coming from the Supreme. Then there will be no problem in your life. Right now you feel that you are doing something, you are creating something in your spiritual life. But you have to feel instead that something is entering into you. You are receiving it and then claiming it as your very own. The father has money and he gives the money to his son. The son does not tell the world, “My father has given me this money.” He says it is his own money. With this money he buys things from a shop. He does not have to tell the shopkeeper who has given him the money; he just uses it as his own. Similarly, when aspiration comes from the Supreme, when He gives it to you for your use, then you will use it. And the more you use, the more you get. The moment you use your aspiration, the more aspiration will be supplied to you from above.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Inertia</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Inertia" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>If we cannot continue to aspire with the same love, the same devotion, the same surrender, then we will come down to the first rung of the spiritual ladder. We won’t go below the first rung if we have climbed up far enough, but we may go down to our starting point. At the starting rung we had inspiration. Then with aspiration we climbed up four or five rungs of the ladder out of the fifteen rungs that we have to climb. But if we don’t continue to climb, then naturally, like the law of gravity, the force of ignorance will pull us down. We cannot remain in one plane of consciousness for more than a second; either we go up or we come down. Through aspiration we go up or through lack of aspiration we come down; we cannot remain in the air motionless.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Unworthiness</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Unworthiness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The feeling of unworthiness is a serious mistake. In the spiritual life you should feel that while you are crying for God, at the same time God is crying for you. You are crying because you want to go to God and He is crying because He has not yet been fully manifested within you. God is in the process of manifestation, but His full manifestation has not yet taken place on earth. The world has not yet arrived at perfection. God wants His full manifestation and perfection to take place in each individual. He is crying because He has not yet been totally fulfilled in and through you. He feels that here on earth His true perfection must take place. He does not cry because you are unworthy of His Love and His Grace. No! He cries because He has not been able to complete His fulfilling journey in you and through you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Seek or find?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Seek or find?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Some people want the fruits of aspiration without practising the true spiritual life. Unfortunately these individuals are not aware of the fact that if they do not first become seekers, then the question of receiving a divine experience does not even come into existence. If we want to find the truth without following the path of seeking, then I wish to say that the truth surely will not come to us. If we want to become a finder without first playing the role of a seeker, then we may get something, but we will not derive the utmost joy from it. We may find the truth, but unfortunately we won’t be able to appreciate it at all. And if we cannot appreciate the absolute Truth, then our own inner joy is bound to diminish. If we do not properly seek the reality, then even if the reality comes and stands right in front of us, we will not take it as our very own.</p>
<p>We have to take one step at a time. When a child cries for a lost toy, he is seeking. Then when he finds it, he gets real joy, inner joy. In the spiritual life we soulfully search and cry for our lost divinity, which will really fulfil us. When we cry in this way, immediately we give proper value to the object of our search. So, please try to constantly play the role of a seeker. In the process of seeking you unravel and reveal your divinity.</p>
<p>Again, if we are not true seekers, then what will happen during our search for something which we are not inwardly ready to find? Unfortunately there is every possibility of our adopting foul means to achieve our ends. Without proper aspiration we may try to exercise our mind beyond its capacity. We may try to exercise our dynamic vital beyond its capacity and in that way we may become aggressive. While searching for the truth without genuine aspiration we may say, “I want it. By hook or by crook I will get it.” Unfortunately the use of foul means is the misuse of the God-given capacity within us. While we are seeking we should not be a victim to any kind of wrong thought. At that time we are praying, we are crying, we are meditating on something which is really sublime. We have to feel that we are dealing with the absolute Truth. The finite in us is trying to enter into the infinite with utmost purity, humility and sincerity. While we are seeking, our consciousness is being elevated. It is being heightened. It is running, it is flying toward the Highest. And while we are flying toward the Highest, automatically we will find Light, more Light, abundant Light and infinite Light. In the very process of seeking, we shall see and feel Peace, Light, Bliss and all other divine qualities. The infinite Truth is bound to come to us when we are sincere seekers.</p>
<p>Now, I wish to say that in your case you are not making a very great mistake if, at times, you feel that you don’t want to aspire but you want to 'find'. The very fact that you are really sincere in seeking the Truth will bring down God’s Grace. His Knowledge and His Wisdom will dawn on you to make you feel that the first step is seeking. And while seeking the Truth, you will see that the Truth is automatically found, automatically revealed.</p>
