<p>In an instrument store in Kyoto, I was looking at an expensive trumpet. The shopkeeper was laughing at me because I couldn't play it. Usually the Japanese don't laugh like that!</p>
<p>Then I went away and came back again. As soon as he saw me, the man started laughing again. I said, "I am going to get the sound." Finally I made some sound and he was so happy. Then I bought it.</p>

<p>I went into a video store in Queens. The owner was a Gujarati who had lived in Calcutta for many years. So we talked in Bengali about many, many things. Then I asked him if he had any Bengali films. He said, "Many, many!"</p>
<p>I said, "Please give me a spiritual one."</p>
<p>He gave me one about Lord Shiva's sacred place in the Himalayas. I believed him when he said it was in perfect Bengali, so I bought it.</p>
<p>When I watched the film, it was not in Bengali at all. It was in Hindi — and with a silly actor whom I do not like.</p>
<p>Vinaya went and got another one, but it was very undivine. And this was from the same man that I was talking to about spiritual things!</p>

<p>While driving from Dhaka to Chittagong, we stopped in the town where Chittagong's greatest poet was born. We went to a restaurant named Kakali, which means "the chirping of the birds."</p>
<p>The price of the meal came to 55 rupees. I didn't have a five-rupee or a Rupee note; I had only 50-rupee notes.</p>
<p>I said, "I have only 50-rupee notes. Here are two 50-rupee notes."</p>
<p>The man saw that I gave him 100 rupees. Then he went to the cashier, only five metres away, and brought me back a five-rupee note as change.</p>
<p>I was so surprised and shocked. I said, "I gave you 100 rupees. You should give me 45 rupees change."</p>
<p>He said, "No, you gave me sixty rupees, one fifty and one ten."</p>
<p>Then I told him in pure Bengali that I had given him 100.</p>

<p>In Calcutta I went to a restaurant and asked for a lassi. On the bill the waiter gave me, it said "5 Rs."</p>
<p>So I went to the owner and said, "Five rupees for one glass?"</p>
<p>The owner said "Who has given you this?"</p>
<p>I pointed to the waiter. The man said, "Oh, he cannot have been mistaken. He has been working here for 50 years."</p>
<p>In Bengali the words for 50 and 15 are very different, so definitely the man said 50 years.</p>
<p>Then I looked at the waiter and said, "Tell me how old you are."</p>
<p>The waiter said, "I am 21."</p>
<p>I said, "You are 21, but you have been working here for 50 years! You deserve five rupees."</p>
<p>As I was coming out of the restaurant, the owner called me and said, "Since I was mistaken, you have to give me only half the price." Then he gave me three rupees back.</p>

<p>At one place I wanted to buy three saris. They had their price and I had my own figure. They were asking for 300 rupees and I said, "130!"</p>
<p>They said that in their lifetime they had never sold any sari for 130 rupees.I said, "Then do it this time. You will remember it."</p>
<p>We were talking in Bengali. Then the old man I was talking to came down to 240. Inwardly I was hesitating a little, but outwardly, in my eyes, he could not see my hesitation. I said, "No, I don't want it!"</p>
<p>Finally, he said, "All right." Then one of his workers got mad at him for coming down so drastically. The other man said, "He is not the owner. I am the owner."Then the old man said, "No, I am the owner!"</p>
<p>At the time, I was thinking that maybe I would go up to 140 or 170. But when the giggling started, I decided I was not going to go up in price because their egos were fighting.</p>
<p>Finally I went to another store and began browsing. The old man from the first store came up to me and said, "I am the owner." I said, "What difference does it make if you can't sell the saris at the price we agreed on?"</p>
<p>He said, "No, I will be able to sell them to you at that price."</p>
<p>We went back to his store. I thought that the other man would be furious, but he said, "This fellow is telling me that he has agreed to sell you these saris for 130 rupees. So what can I do?"</p>
<p>So I got the saris for 130 rupees.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Sympathy defeats temptation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Sympathy defeats temptation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In Calcutta a young man about 20 years old was selling handkerchiefs on the street right behind our hotel. He said, "If you buy a dozen, I will give you one free."</p>
<p>I asked him, "If I buy five dozen, will you give me five free?" He said, "Of course." He was insulting me in Bengali as if I didn't know Bengali.</p>
<p>He counted out twelve and then started counting out the second dozen. I said, "I won't get one free?"</p>
<p>He said, "No, let me first count out five dozen."</p>
<p>After he had counted out the second dozen, he felt sorry for me and he added one extra to the pile.</p>
<p>I said, "Now you are supposed to give me two."</p>
<p>Again he said, "No, I will give them to you later."</p>
<p>After he had counted out five dozen, I said, "Now you have to give me four more."</p>
<p>He said, "No, I was just tempting you! I will give you only one extra."</p>
<p>I said, "Then I don't want any." He said, "No, you should feel sympathy for me because it took such a long time to count out five dozen."</p>
<p>So sympathy won over temptation, and I got only one extra.</p>

<p>This is a story about Calcutta deception. I went to a store to buy cloth to be made into trousers. I selected four or five materials and said, "Please give me two metres of each one."</p>
<p>Then I went browsing in the store. When I was ready to pay, I asked again if they had cut off two metres and they said that they had.</p>
<p>The following day when I took the material to a tailor in Pondicherry, he said, "How can I make trousers for you? This material is not even one metre 75 centimetres."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The friendly discount</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The friendly discount" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In Pondicherry I went to a sari store whose owner had been my classmate in the Ashram. We had studied together for five or six months.</p>
<p>He immediately recognised me when I came in. Then he started insulting his workers mercilessly so that he could show me who was the boss. He was insulting them without rhyme or reason!</p>
<p>Suddenly he got a phone call from his house about some emergency, and he went away on his motorbike.</p>
<p>After I finished shopping, the bill came to 1,100 rupees. My friend's assistant said, "Since you two are good friends, I am sure the boss will reduce the price. So do not fill in the amount on the cheque. Just take the material and tomorrow I will ask him what discount to give you."</p>
<p>I said to myself, "I didn't ask for a discount. He is such a nice fellow."The following day I was shopping in the same area, so I went into the store and asked the assistant if he had spoken to the boss.</p>
<p>He said, "My boss didn't come back to work. But you don't have to worry. He knows your brother Chitta so well." I said, "For God's sake, take the 1,100 rupees. Then I don't have to worry." But he insisted that I not fill in the amount on the cheque.</p>
<p>Two hours later, while still shopping in the area, I saw my friend on his motorbike. I shouted to him, "For God's sake, tell me the reduction on the things I have got from your store so that I can pay."</p>
<p>He said, "I already told them this morning."</p>
<p>When I got home, I said to my brother, "This fellow is such a liar. Now you have to go there."</p>
<p>So my brother went to the store with 1,100 rupees. When he saw that they were going to give me a reduction of only 23 rupees, he got mad. He said, "You keep your 23 rupees. We will not take any reduction at all."</p>
<p>There the story does not end. Afterwards, my brother said, "I tell you, you will definitely get the same saris much cheaper in other stores."</p>
<p>So I took one of the saris I had bought and found almost the identical sari for less than half the price at another store. At my friend's store I paid 89 rupees, and in this store it was only 43. I couldn't believe that I had bought so many saris from my friend for twice the amount that other stores were selling them for.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The rickshaw driver</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The rickshaw driver" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In Pondicherry, a rickshaw driver became my friend. He lived near our family's house, and each day he would take me around for an hour or two when I went shopping. I told him, "You have Mother's picture on your rickshaw, so you can't deceive me."</p>
<p>When I go out, usually I leave my bag with my passport and all my American money inside the house. On one particular day, a new maid was working in the house and my sister had to go somewhere. Since the lock on the safe is not satisfactory, she took out the bag and went looking for me. I said, "Since the lock is not good, let me take the bag with me while I go shopping."</p>
<p>So I went shopping for saris. Then I realised that I didn't have the bag with me. I had left it in the rickshaw!</p>
<p>The driver and I had agreed to meet at a Fred place. But, O God, when I came to that place, the rickshaw driver was nowhere to be found! I was looking this side and that side for him. Finally, I saw him sleeping on the front of the rickshaw, waiting in the shade about 70 or 80 metres away.</p>
<p>I asked him, "Where is my bag?" He answered, "It is on the seat in the back. You didn't take it with you."</p>
<p>Since he bad been fast asleep, somebody easily could have come and taken the bag out of the rickshaw, or out of curiosity the driver could have looked in the bag. But when I looked inside the bag, everything was just as I had left it.Rickshaw drivers get two rupees per hour, so I was supposed to give him three or four rupees. Instead I gave him a 50-rupee note. He couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>One day, while I was shopping in the Pondicherry market, an elderly lady placed her hand on my shoulder and said, "Hi, Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>O my God, I was so embarrassed. I didn't recognise her at all.</p>
<p>She was so surprised that I didn't recognise her. She said, "I am Coo-Coo's mother."</p>
<p>Coo-Coo is the nickname for Vinay Verma, the Deputy Ambassador of India to the United Nations. We were brought up together and for a year his mother had taught me English.</p>
<p>She said she was able to recognise me because Vinay Verma had sent her a picture taken of the two of us at our recent meeting in Queens. So she recognised me, but I could not recognise her.</p>
<p>Then she begged me to come to her house. I wanted to go, but as usual, five or ten people were at our house waiting for me. Always so many people come to our house when I am there. I have so many things to tell them and they have so many things to tell me-endless stories!</p>

<p>In Bombay I went to buy more handkerchiefs. While in the store, I told the shopkeeper about the man who tempted me with extra handkerchiefs in Calcutta.The Bombay shopkeeper used undivine words about the fellow in that story. Then he asked me where I came from. I said, "I am from Bengal, but I live in America."</p>
<p>He said, "My son lives in Manhattan."</p>
<p>I said, "Tell me your son's name. In Manhattan many people know me."</p>
<p>He said, "My son is not leading a good life, so I do not want to give you his name."</p>
<p>I said, "You can tell him about me."</p>
<p>He said, "You seem to be a very nice man. I don't want to tell you his name, and I don't want to tell him your name."</p>
<p>Then I bought the handkerchiefs from him. The price was cheaper than what I had paid the man in Calcutta who gave me only one extra.</p>

<p>In Bombay I was buying picture frames. For two or three frames I was bargaining and bargaining. God knows, the man insulted me with his price, and I insulted him with my price!</p>
<p>Finally I had to surrender to his insults because I liked the picture frames so much.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Airport deception</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Airport deception" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Always I go to the airport early to buy things or to eat. On the trip to India, I ate so much and gained four or five pounds. This time I went to a restaurant in the Bombay airport to have a little juice and some Horlicks, a hot drink.The man told me the price-five dollars. Indian rupees they do not accept-only American dollars or British pounds. I had Indian currency, but the only American currency I thought I had was a hundred-dollar bill. So before I ate, I asked the man if he would be able to give me change.</p>
<p>The man said, "Yes, easily!"</p>
<p>When it was time to pay, I looked in my bag and found both a hundred-dollar and a twenty-dollar bill. I said, "I can give you a twenty-dollar bill."</p>
<p>The man said, "No, you give me the hundred-dollar bill. I will be able to give you change."</p>
<p>He took the hundred-dollar bill, and then he gave me a ten-dollar bill in return. He was looking for more money, but be had only three one-dollar bills.I said, "Give me back my hundred-dollar bill and take my twenty-dollar bill." What kind of rogue God created! He said I hadn't given him a hundred-dollar bill. He said I had only given him the twenty.</p>
<p>My blood boiled! I said, "I am calling the police!" and started to walk away.Then he gave me my hundred dollars back. I had got thirteen dollars from him in change, and he was supposed to give me two more dollars, but I just called him a rogue and threw my twenty dollars at him.</p>
<p>Then I left the place, absolutely furious. Even now when I tell the story, I feel such disgust for rogues like this.</p>

<p>Since there were no shops open in Berlin when I went out walking this morning, I went into the hotel shop when I came back. I bought a magazine.</p>
<p>Then I saw a sweater that cost 1,000 marks. I said, "Expensive!"</p>
<p>The saleslady said, "First of all, it is expensive. Second, it is for ladies!"The sweater was not in the men's section.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The garlic bread</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The garlic bread" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Yesterday I went to a Greek deli and asked for garlic bread.</p>
<p>The man asked, "Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>I said, "From India."</p>
<p>He said, "That's why you speak like that."</p>
<p>Then I asked him, "Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>He said, "From Greece."</p>
<p>So I said, "We are brothers, we are brothers!"</p>
<p>He was Dividing fault with my pronunciation of 'garlic.' But he himself was speaking broken English.</p>
<p>When I first came to America, I used to feel a little sad when people could not understand me. But now I don't have to repeat words like 'magnificent' and 'table' because people understand me. Americans may criticise me, but the British-even children-don't have any problem understanding me.</p>
<p>In Scotland I find it very difficult to understand the people. Three or four times I have to ask them what they are saying. It is too much, too much!</p>
