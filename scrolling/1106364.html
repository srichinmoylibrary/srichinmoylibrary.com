<p>Today I lifted 200 pounds with one arm for the first time since I resumed my weightlifting just a few days ago. First I lifted it with my right arm and then with my left arm. For some reason, my mind was telling me that it had not gone high at all and so I lifted it two more times with each arm. If I had known that it had gone so high the first time, I would not have killed myself by lifting again.</p>
<p>I am more than satisfied with this lift. My right arm is out, and the height of the lift is very good. Today I am 144 pounds and so this is 56 pounds over my bodyweight.</p>
<p>I first lifted 200 pounds with one arm on March 6th, 1986 — almost twelve years ago. At that time I was 157 pounds. Then I took rest from weightlifting for more than nine years. Now God wants me to enter into the weightlifting field once again.</p>

<p>This evening in front of about twenty witnesses I lifted 300 pounds on my stomach ten times. Two years ago I did this kind of thing when we had our Rainbow-Dreamers club. I am sure people can see it is moving. Today I took only 549 calories and my weight is 146 pounds. People say I should be weaker from my dieting, but in my case, dieting makes my stomach strong!</p>

<p>Today my bodyweight is 142¼ pounds. The funniest thing is that yesterday I ate and ate and still I lost 1½ pounds! My ultimate goal is 140. My secret desire is that my body-boat shall ply between 140 and 145 pounds. Now I feel very, very, very light.</p>
<p>This morning I gave my right arm a complete rest because the palm of my right hand is full of pain and I am unable to push against the bar. I am sure that in two or three days this pain will go away.</p>
<p>When it came to my one-arm lift, I did fifty pushes with 120 pounds using only my left arm. I feel sorry for my left arm!</p>

<p>The most difficult of the lifts that I do is the stomach lift. After that, for fifteen or twenty minutes, I do not know my name even. I have to drink something immediately and I do not feel like talking.</p>

<p>This morning I started lifting just after three o’clock. When it came to 120 pounds with both arms, I tried twice and failed. When I tried to lift the dumbbells separately, they went up, but I could not lift them simultaneously. I tried at least four more times.</p>
<p>I think we have made a mistake by putting a wooden plank under my feet. Now I am not getting the proper grip because I am higher. Let me ask Unmilan to take it away again.</p>

<p>Today, while I was doing twenty repetitions with 145 pounds, I tried something new. Instead of holding onto the side of the apparatus, I released my free arm. You can see that it is hanging by my side. This will be more dramatic because I am not holding onto anything. It is much more difficult. Tonight I will try to do it 100 times. Why did it not occur to us in those early days to release that free arm? This style is much more impressive because I am not taking any support. Also in those days I used to waste time changing the arm after each lift.</p>

<p>Early this morning I lifted 270 pounds for the first time since I started again. I did it four times with my right arm and four times with my left arm and these lifts are higher than my 250 pounds! I am fully satisfied. From tomorrow I shall practise 300 pounds. In 1986 I failed 213 times before I lifted it. Now I think I will be able to do it in fifty. In a week I think I shall be able to do it. I have one month and ten days before we leave for the Christmas trip. I am ready for 300!</p>

<p>Today I lifted 130 pounds two times with both arms together. These lifts are better than yesterday, true, but still they are not satisfactory to me. What I am doing wrong, God alone knows. Every other lift I am doing miraculously, but when it comes to two arms some magic is needed. I would really like to have a little better results.</p>

<p>This morning I could not do anything because of the pain in my legs. I went to Annam Brahma Restaurant to receive some treatment from Dr. Chu. When I am walking, I am unable to straighten my leg because it hurts so badly. Afterwards I was joking with one of the disciples that the condition of my legs is as bad as the condition of her soul.</p>
<p>Today I told Ketan that I want to lift six planes as soon as possible. The sooner the better for me. They should be between 2,700 and 3,200 pounds. I may have to go out of town very soon and I have so many other things to do. So I would like to lift them in one day if I am allowed.</p>

<p>Today I lifted 300 pounds with one arm eight times. At one point the sign fell down and I had to replace it. Then I had so many things to think of — calling my sister and so forth — so I was unable to concentrate properly. In spite of that, I do not think I lifted 300 pounds this high twelve years ago.

<p>This morning I lifted 300 pounds with one arm ten times. But there was no seriousness involved. I strongly feel that I am not using my full capacity. I am only giving 70 per cent of my attention. I do not know why, but I am not getting any inspiration or joy from this lifting. Today I did not want to lift even four times with each arm, but I did it five times. That shows my mind was not there.</p>

<p>Today I was very happy to lift the plane in New Jersey. The plane was huge. One side had the fuel. It went higher than the other side. Afterwards, for the second lift, we added six human beings and it became 10,527 pounds. That lift was really difficult. My shoulder and calf muscles were dancing! My whole body was shaking.</p>
<p>This plane was heavy, but I want to do a heavier one. I shall ask Ketan to find a plane that weighs 13,000 pounds. The drive to New Jersey was two hours, so my legs were a little stiff when I arrived.</p>
