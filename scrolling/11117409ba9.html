<p>In today's race I didn't know that Fred Lebow was ahead of me. They were announcing that Mary Decker Tabb would run there in September. Then they said, "The President has come." Karabi heard it over the loudspeaker as she was finishing.</p>
<p>Dipali, out of her infinite kindness, stayed behind me so that she could follow me to the end. But Karabi went ahead at the very beginning. Husiar was twentieth out of thousands.</p>

<p>A lady told Shephali that she saw me running once a few years ago before she knew anything about meditation. She said, "I saw a man running at a distance. He was like a light. I was so curious that I followed him in my car." The lady pointed to her third eye and told Shephali, "He was just like a light."</p>
<p>Then Shephali showed her one of my "Run and Become" books, and the lady was laughing while reading the stories.</p>

<p>When I ran the 100-metre dash in India, after 60 metres, out of the blue I used to get such speed. But here on Sports Day, after 70 metres everything went blank. I was about to collapse.</p>
<p>Next year I will keep the same people in my heat: Pulin, Sandhani, Pulak and Sanatan. My time was 15.2 seconds. Now I am crying, but twenty or thirty years ago I would have laughed at this timing. Now I have to cry and cry and cry. When in my life did I ever run 100 metres even as slow as 15 seconds? I started at 12 seconds and then went to 11. Now, if I can run under 14, I will be so happy. Next year I have to aim at under 15.</p>

<p>In India I used to do 200 metres in 23.4 seconds. But today it became 36.9. I should commit suicide. One or two years in India I stood second. Then after that, every year I was first.</p>
<p>In 400 metres I was always first. One year there was a tie with someone who was in another heat. If we had been in the same heat, God knows, I would have gone faster.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The false start</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The false start" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once in India I was using the starting blocks in a race. When you use the blocks your foot has to touch the ground. You cannot put your foot on the block unless it is also touching the ground. I was 100 percent sure that my foot was touching the ground, so I was surprised when the official gave me a false start. He said my left foot was not touching the ground.</p>
<p>The official felt sorry for me but he couldn't tell me what I was supposed to do. He could tell by looking that my left foot was not touching the ground, but he couldn't say anything to correct it. So I took a standing start, which is useless. Even then I won the 200-metre dash. Then afterwards he saw me on the street and said, "I feel very sorry about your timing."</p>
<p>I said, "I was first."</p>
<p>He said, "That is true, but if you had started from the crouching position, your timing would have been better."</p>

<p>Yesterday's parade route was seven miles long. From one end to the other, the marchers and floats spread out over 700 metres, practically half a mile. I would run one mile and wait for the parade to go by. Then again I would run one mile and watch the parade.</p>
<p>I told one of my attendants, Tejiyan, to be careful. Next year I will run at a seven-minute pace. He said he has started practising running so he will be able to keep up with me while accompanying me.</p>

<p>I was running near my 500-metre mark on 150th Street when a young student with a tape recorder in his hand came out of his house. He was listening to music. When he saw me he said, "Happy birthday!"</p>

<p>I beat Sanatan in the 100-metre dash on Sports Day. As you know, I always call him my Rabbi. That means that this Indian spiritual Master is better than that Rabbi.

<p>The two English brothers, Devashishu and Sahadeva, write to me quite often. One time the little one, Sahadeva, lodged a complaint against the older one. He said that sometimes he doesn't want to run, but his brother compels him. That's why he hates his brother.</p>
<p>But Sahadeva also loves his brother because his brother is kind in other ways. Now Sahadeva has to love his brother because Devashishu was able to run seven miles. That's why he got a special prize from me.</p>

<p>Today I was practising speed work on the street in front of my house. I would run a hundred metres, stop for a short time and then run another hundred metres. After finishing one 100-metre sprint, I turned around only to see a white dog in front of my house. I didn't see the owner at all.</p>
<p>All of a sudden a fat lady with white hair came from behind me and put her hand on my left shoulder. She said, "You look so beautiful today!" I smiled at her. What could I do? She was blessing me.</p>
<p>This lady also has a granddaughter. Both of them sometimes sweep their backyard. Her dog's name is Pauly. Some years ago she had a fight with another lady on my street, and I took her side. So she and I became friends.</p>
