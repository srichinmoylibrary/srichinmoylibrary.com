<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people have played the game and they are tired. They have played, but now they do not want to teach the game to anybody else. Carlos says, “I have learned how to play the guitar. That is enough. I don’t want to teach anybody else. It is too difficult. I have achieved my goal. Now why should I waste my precious time? Let me now enjoy my achievement.” Learning is so difficult and teaching is also difficult. Some people say, “It took us years and years of struggle to learn this. Now again it will take years and years of struggle to teach somebody else.” So they do not want to do it. There are many people in this world who were students once upon a time and then became teachers, but there are many who have completed their studies but do not want to teach. They just go into some other line of work.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a difference in the spiritual life. If one does not want to teach after one has realised God, he may not teach outwardly, but his very presence on earth is a great blessing and help to others, because he offers his good will to everyone. The good will of a God-realised soul has tremendous power. Right now I am actively trying to be of service to you, to the world. But even if I had stayed in Himalayan cave after realising God, I would have had only good will for the world. At that time, there is no evil will, no ego, no jealousy, no negative forces. But in my case, my feeling of oneness with humanity made me feel that after my own God-realisation, unless and until every body else was realised, I would remain imperfect. I have realised God, but perfect perfection will be achieved only when everybody has realised God.</p>
<p>A God-realised soul is not a fool. When he discovers that he is incomplete and imperfect, naturally he will try to offer his help to others so that they will lead better lives and realise God sooner. The very fact that a spiritual Master offers good will is enough, for his good will has tremendous power. When everybody realises God, then the Yogi will be complete.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, in one of your plays there was a king who was jealous of a spiritual Master. So he went and realised God, and after he realised God, he was still jealous. How is that possible?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, in one of your plays there was a king who was jealous of a spiritual Master. So he went and realised God, and after he realised God, he was still jealous. How is that possible?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know that realising God is like touching the foot of tree. When you have realised God, you have touched the foot. Then you have to climb up to the top. If you do not have the capacity or the wish to climb higher, you remain at the foot. If you have the capacity to climb up to the Highest, then you will be able to perfect your human nature, which means to transform jealousy, anger, pride, ego and so on. But some God-realised souls are afraid that once they come down from the tree, perhaps they will not be able to climb up again. So they go up a few branches and then stay there. But if someone has the capacity to climb up to the Highest and again climb down to help mankind, then he will accept disciples and help those who are unable to climb up. He will teach them, inspire them, or place them on his shoulders and then climb up. He will take some up, and then he will come down again and take up a few more on his shoulders. If one has the capacity to climb up and climb down, to carry humanity up and then climb down again, that person will not have this kind of difficulty.</p>
<p>Touching the foot of the tree is also realisation, because the realisation-tree is very tall. So you have to know whether someone is just touching the foot of the tree or if he is going up to the highest branch. There is a difference. You have to know the degree of a person’s realisation. This king, Vishwamitra, had realisation, true, but his realisation was not complete. Until you reach the highest branch of the realisation-tree and come down from the height, your realisation is not complete. He realised God but the perfection of his human nature was not achieved. Some people do not try to change their nature. They have realised the truth, but they do not want to conquer their lower vital movements. They are satisfied to remain imperfect. Some spiritual teachers have got real light, but they drink and smoke and do many silly things. They do not purify that part of the vital. Only when they meditate, they enter into the soul’s purity and perfection. But the other room, the vital room, they keep absolutely dirty and dark. They are spiritual teachers, but when they are compared with those who have got the highest Illumination, there will be a vast difference.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I don’t know why my mother objects so strongly to my coming to you.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I don’t know why my mother objects so strongly to my coming to you." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The parents of some disciples are jealous because they see that their children are listening to me. But they do not realise one thing — that I know these are the children of the Supreme. They are not my children. You have an eternal Father, who is the Supreme, and I am in touch with the Supreme, so I know what is best for you and I tell you. If your mother is truly fond of you, then in your happiness will be her happiness. A real mother eventually surrenders to the happiness of the child. We have had quite a few instances where for three or four years the parents of the disciples were so displeased with us. They said, “How is it that we are their parents and they don’t listen to us, but they listen to an Indian Guru?” But finally both parents saw that the Indian rascal was not as bad as they thought. He had changed their children for the better and had brought them happiness.</p>
<p>Then the parents also say, “We gave them money, but they were not happy. We gave them sound advice, but they did not take it. We offered them everything we had, but they did not accept it. By what kind of magic has he now given them happiness? We tried to make them happy in every way, but we could not.” These parents were digging my grave and making my coffin ready. But now they see their children’s happiness. Many parents who began by digging my grave are now coming to our Centre or to our big functions. They appreciate and admire me and tell me how happy and grateful they are that their children are now in good hands. They see that their children are not smoking, drinking or taking drugs, so now I am their genuine saviour.</p>
<p>What do parents want for their children? Only happiness. In the beginning pride comes forward. “They are my children. What right does he have to exercise his authority?” But afterwards, they see that it is not a matter of authority, only of love. So many parents are now full of appreciation for me because their children are happy. Your mother will observe you for some time, and when she sees your happiness shining or blossoming, she will say, “I didn’t see this happiness before in my son. He was a very great musician, but where was his happiness? He had name, fame and wealth before he entered onto this path, but these things did not give him inner joy, inner light or inner confidence.”</p>
<p>So please do not worry. She is not far from our path. She is only watching. She wants to see whether you have done the right thing. You <em>have</em> done absolutely the right thing. Just wait a little longer. It is just a matter of time.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, what is the purpose of telling you things outwardly? I mean, what do you actually need to know from us outwardly?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, what is the purpose of telling you things outwardly? I mean, what do you actually need to know from us outwardly?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It helps the disciples, and it also helps me. The disciples then feel that I really have concern for them on the physical and mental planes as well as on the spiritual planes. They feel that the human in me also takes an interest in their activities. I ask all my disciples to do some kind of regular work. I tell them not to lead a vagabond life. I know that they are all doing something, so why do I actually ask them what they are doing? I ask so that they will see that I am interested in them. When I have the opportunity, I become involved in your outer activities. This convinces the physical mind. Otherwise, the physical mind will say, “No, he does not care for our outer life. He only cares for our inner life.” But that is not true. I do care for your outer life also.</p>
<p>Sometimes I actually already know what you are doing before I ask, and sometimes I do not know. If I know your soul, and how much progress you have made, that is most important to me. If you become the President of the United States, it might not help your soul. My main concern is with your soul, and how your soul will make the fastest progress. If the outer achievement comes from the realisation of the soul, then it is worth much. Otherwise, in outer achievements you may become great, but your inner achievements may be eclipsed.</p>
<p>The important thing is for you to be great inwardly. Achieving inner greatness is the hardest work. From that you can easily come to outer greatness if you want to. It is not necessary for me to know what you eat for breakfast. But if you meditate regularly in the morning, that is most important to me. That you feed your body with most delicious food is unimportant. But I want to know, did you feed your soul? Did you meditate? If you have meditated, then I know you are fulfilling God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you feel that you are tired, exhausted, please breathe in quietly. Take several deep breaths and try to feel that you are breathing in from various places. Try to feel that you are breathing in through the eyes, the ears, the forehead, through the crown of the head, through the shoulders and so on. When you are breathing in, if you are conscious of your breath, then you will not feel sleepy. But being conscious of your breath does not mean that you will make a sound. You will just feel that a stream of energy is entering into you with every breath. Feel that every place you are breathing in is a door. Each time you breathe in, you open a door here, there or somewhere else. Naturally, when you open the door, light enters. Then energy enters through the various doors into your body. This exercise is for everybody.</p>
<p>When you are meditating very well, you can feel that unconsciously you are doing this — you are drawing energy not only through your nose, but through your head and other places. Energy is coming from all quarters, so that universal energy wants to enter into you by various doors. Naturally, the more energy you can draw inside you, the higher will be your meditation. Everything depends on the energy that is circulating inside you. Where does it come from? It comes from the Universal Consciousness. So when you do not have the energy, it means that the Universal Consciousness is not entering into you properly.</p>
<p>If you cannot meditate well, please feel that it is still a necessity to meditate, just as it is a necessity of the body to eat even though you may not get most delicious food. Your wife knows how to cook extremely well, but if she does not give you the most delicious food every day, what will you do? Will you get angry? No, you will just feel that she has done something more important than cooking food. Similarly, you will think that if the Supreme has not given you a good meditation today, He is thinking of doing something more important for you in some other way. Instead of getting angry with Him or disgusted and disheartened, if you have faith, which you have, you will feel that the Supreme is going to give you something else most important. In the case of your wife, her whole existence is inside you. If she cannot give you most delicious food, she will do something else to please you, to make you happy. In God’s case, if God does not give you a good meditation today for some reason or other, He will give you something else which is equally important or more important. In the meantime, your business is to accept whatever He gives you. Even if your wife cooks very untasty food, you have to eat it. Similarly, when you sit down to meditate, you also have to feel that it is up to Him. Meditation is our spiritual food. The Supreme will not give you the same taste every day. He may give you something different each day.</p>
<p>If someone loves us, that person has every right to please us in various ways; otherwise, it becomes monotonous. Today the Supreme is pleasing us through meditation, tomorrow through dedication and the day after tomorrow through something else. He wants to fulfil Himself in and through you in a new way every day. He has every right to change, so we should not have a fixed expectation. If we do, we will be disappointed. If we eat the same food every day, then after a few days we will be sick of it. There should always be variety.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to feel that the day you accepted me as your spiritual teacher was the very beginning of your life. Spiritually you are just one year old. Now, you have to know whether a child who is only one year old has any responsibilities. No, he has somebody to take care of him. When you grow up, when you are eighteen or twenty, you will want to take all the responsibilities from your mother and father. But a child always cries to remain in the lap of the mother or in the arms of the father. So how can you increase your inner cry? You can feel that you are a child only one year old, and not a young man of twenty. Consciously you have to feel that you are a child. If you think of yourself as a child, then every day you will be able to make progress.</p>
<p>Who makes noticeable progress? A child, not an old man. Old people do not care for progress. But mere years do not make people old. Somebody may be sixty or seventy years of age, but that person may have the enthusiasm, inner joy and inspiration of a child. Again, there will be people seventeen, eighteen and nineteen years old who have no aspiration, no inspiration, no dynamism. In the spiritual life we are not concerned with earthly years, but with our inner eagerness to do something, to become something. Now what should we become? Only a child of God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, in the soul’s world there are significant things, but these things will not be manifested. In the soul’s world there is no manifestation. Progress is there, but not in the sense of evolution.</p>
<p>We enter into the soul’s world to take rest. But if our soul associates with a higher soul, a more illumined soul, then naturally we will be inspired. If, in the soul’s world, we are near a spiritual Master <em>or</em> some other very great, significant, spiritual person, then naturally we will be influenced.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Shall I have to change it into a silver boat just for you, because you are a doubter? Absolutely there is a golden boat. It is not symbolic; it is real. It is golden not only in consciousness but also in colour. Each Master has a colour. In my case I have blue and gold. Blue is the colour of Infinity. Sri Krishna’s light was blue. Mine is blue and gold. The golden colour is necessary. The golden colour is for manifestation. When it touches the physical plane it becomes reddish. But my boat is actually golden. It is not just a word I am using. It is the reality of the boat itself. The colour of the boat is golden, and that boat really exists. You are bound to see it some day.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First you have embodiment. You have a most delicious mango inside your pocket. You are embodying the mango, since your shirt is a part of you. Inside the pocket means inside you. Now, if you put your hand inside the pocket and bring the mango out, then you have revealed it. Then you have to manifest it. How will you do it? By cutting it into a few pieces and giving it to me and to others. That is manifestation. First you will have it; that is embodiment. Then you will show it to me; that is revelation. Then you will share it with the world; that is manifestation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Guru, one thing I&#039;ve wondered about for a long time is the high population in the world now and the pollution.

Is there something that these problems are going to teach mankind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As seekers, we feel that we should not worry about these things. We should worry about our inner illumination. Over-population is not good; pollution is not good. But why are they happening? Because people are ignorant. We have to go to the root-cause of world-problems, and the root is human ignorance. If we can go to the root and remove this ignorance in just one human being — ourselves — then there will be one rascal less in this world. Today if there is one rascal less, tomorrow there may be another rascal less, and in this way it will go on.</p>
<p>If we think all the time of over-population, pollution, and other world-problems, if we use our time to pay considerable attention to them, then when we go to the other world, what will happen? God will not ask us, “Do you know anything about the population problem? Do you know anything about pollution?” He is not going to ask that. He will ask us, “Did you think of Me? Did you meditate on Me?” God will never ask us impersonal questions. He will ask us what we have done for Him. We have to be ready to answer Him properly. This is not a selfish attitude. When I become good, automatically there is one more positive force and one less negative force on earth. If I can transform my own ignorance into light, then the quantity of ignorance on earth has already decreased.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the Western world you have angels to protect you. In India we have three major deities: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Then we have, according to us, as many minor deities as there are human beings. What we call deities in India, here you call angels. But the members of the Trinity — Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva — are infinitely more powerful than ordinary presiding deities and ordinary angels. I know the Western angels very well, and also I know the Indian deities.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What does a miracle teach?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What does a miracle teach?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> By showing a miracle we cannot raise the consciousness of humanity at all. In India our servants used to live a very pure life for two months, practise austerities and pray to all the cosmic gods. Then they used to walk on fire in front of us. If we walk on fire, our feet will burn. But when it is a matter of real spiritual life, we lead an infinitely better and purer life than these servants did.</p>
<p>Does a miracle help us in any way? It only increases our curiosity. It does not help in raising our consciousness. Sri Ramakrishna used to tell a story about two brothers. The older brother left the family and went into the forest. He meditated and meditated for about twelve years. When he got a little occult power, he came back home. His younger brother said to him, “You have meditated for twelve years, brother. Now show me what you have achieved.” The elder brother said, “All right, come.” He led his younger brother to a tiny river nearby. Then he said, “Look, here is my capacity,” and he started walking on the water. The younger brother immediately called the ferry man, gave him one-quarter of a cent and went across. When he came up to his brother on the other side, he said, “You spent twelve long years in praying to God for something that is not even worth a penny.” Then the elder brother realised his foolishness, and went and prayed sincerely to God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I have already seen a Master and he told me to be happy. So can I still follow you?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I have already seen a Master and he told me to be happy. So can I still follow you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you see ten Masters, every Master will tell you to be happy. I will give you the same advice. Who will not give you this advice? The world is wanting in happiness, so every Master will give you this same advice. But you have to know which particular Master you want to be your guide. If somebody tells you to be happy, that does not mean that he has accepted you or you have accepted him. Even if he accepts you, you may not accept him. You may say, “No, I don’t want you as my Master.” It is your life that you are going to offer to someone, so there has to be mutual acceptance. The Master has to accept the disciple as his own, and the disciple also has to accept the Master. Then only does the real divine game start.</p>
<p>Every Master will tell you to be happy. The spiritual Master’s task is to bring joy into the earth-atmosphere. All spiritual Masters are trying to do that. Now you have to feel which Master can bring the most joy, light and peace into your life. When you feel that you have found that particular Master, you have to accept him as your own.</p>
<p>There are some Masters who say, “Whoever wants to follow my path is welcome.” These Masters may have twenty thousand disciples, but God alone knows in which way they are helping those disciples. I cannot appreciate that kind of approach. If I accept someone and he accepts me and follows my path sincerely, then I have to be fully responsible for his outer life as well as his inner life. I have disciples, my real disciples, about whom I can tell you everything. I have accepted them as my very own.</p>
<p>I am not criticising the Master you are speaking about. Far from it. I am only telling you that just because this Master has told you to be happy, that does not mean that he has accepted you as his disciple. You have to ask yourself whether you feel deep within that he should be your Master, that you have accepted him as your Master and he has already become your Master. If so, you do not need me or anybody else. But if you feel that you have not accepted him or you have not made a commitment, but he has given you some divine advice, this is absolutely true. It is the duty of all spiritual Masters to tell the seekers that they have to be happy. If you are depressed all the time, cherishing negative, undivine forces, then you will not be able to make progress. But if you are happy, then your spiritual progress becomes really easy.</p>
<p>So the advice he has given you is absolutely correct. The only question is: are you going to go deep within to see whether you want to follow his path or some other path? This question you can answer better than anybody else. You have to ask your heart what commitment you have made to him and what commitment he has made to you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If Jesus Christ is the answer for you, then you don’t need any other spiritual Master. If he is your Master, then you don’t need any other spiritual Master. If he is your Master, then you can just see me as another Master. Who is better of the two is not the important question. The main thing is that you have a Master who will be able to take you to the Highest. Each spiritual Master, whether he has left the physical sheath or is still on earth, has a boat of his own. If you have a boatman and you are satisfied with his boat, then you do not need another boatman or another boat. You have only to consider me and other spiritual Masters as boatmen who are carrying other aspirants to the Supreme Father.</p>
