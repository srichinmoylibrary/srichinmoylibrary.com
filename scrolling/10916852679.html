Only people who are spiritually developed, only those who deal with the subtle life will notice the change in the vibration of the room. How is it that today they are not in a very high frame of mind, whereas previously inside that room they used to get a kind of soulful feeling? That is what they will notice.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What are group souls?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What are group souls?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Group souls are found in animal life and also in human life. In human life, there will be thousands of people who are of almost similar standard in terms of spiritual evolution. They are at one place. Their group soul is in a particular spot in the soul's region. Here we say, "Birds of a feather flock together." If your standard and somebody else's standard are the same, then your souls go together in a group.</p>
<p>When you have a spiritual Master, just because of his love for you and your love for him, you get his compassion and blessings; then immediately he takes you to another plane, another standard. Then you can go beyond the group. But group souls do not get special blessings, special concern, from any spiritual Master. They go together, like a particular class in school where the students are studying together because they are of the same standard. But if the teacher says, "No, I will give you special training because I want you to go to a higher class," he can do this. The teacher can give private instruction and take his student to a higher class.</p>
<p>Again, apart from that group, some souls care more for Peace, some for Light, some for Bliss. So, if they care more for Peace, then they stay together. When it is time for them to incarnate, they may not come to the same country. One may go to Germany, one may go to India. But in the inner world they stay together.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is it like when you see the soul?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is it like when you see the soul?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul can take the form of the physical. X has died. But whenever X sees me, whenever I see him, always he claps. He is announcing my victory, our victory, the victory of our mission. Sometimes I see X the way I saw him on earth, exactly the same. Sometimes I see him as just a tiny doll. But the doll is not made of rubber or plastic or flesh. It is different.</p>
<p>The same soul can be seen in a different way, without form. A river is flowing and inside the river is life energy. With your human eyes, you will see that life energy is liquid. But the life energy has a form of its own. If you use the third eye, you can see it. So, I can see X's life energy and also the life energy of others. It is like knowing the strength that a boxer has inside his arms. With your physical eyes you can see his arms and legs, but with the spiritual eye you will see the thing that is inside the arm, the thing that has created this miracle. When you use occult vision, you won't see the human form, but something else-liquid or solid power.</p>
<p>Sometimes I see the soul like some kind of very tiny fish in the water. And then, if I am going to feed the soul, greedily it eats. And the food that it eats, you will think that it is all bone, powdered bone. But it is not powdered bone: It is something else-all white and beautiful. But if an ordinary human being is given it to eat, he will think it is all pure bone.</p>
<p>When I ate soul's food for the first time, it didn't taste at all good. Heaven-food does not taste good to the human taste. Although some people who are in the soul's region enjoy the food, I have no taste for it. Right now I am here on earth and I eat earthly food. It is a different world. I can feed those who have died because I know my capacity. But I can't appreciate the food myself. It is like the mother who does not like children's food, although the children like it. Children like cereal and all kinds of things. God knows what they eat! But I don't have to eat it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are sitting in the park or on the bus and you see someone. He is not paying any attention to you but you are getting such good vibrations from him. Again, somebody who is dressed up well and is a perfect gentleman may not be giving you good vibrations. But soul's affinity is one thing and soul's standard is something else. You are an expert at your standard, and somebody else is an expert in his standard. So two experts have met together at one place. But soul's affinity is not the same thing. Two persons of different standards may have a soul's affinity. A spiritual Master may have a soul's affinity with a very undeveloped soul.</p>

Later we met this same disciple again. Is that just all coincidence? I thought something was going on there." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the physical plane we will think it is nothing special. We call it a coincidence. But on the spiritual plane it is not like that. On the spiritual plane that disciple perhaps needed help. Suppose he has just come back from a trip and his mind is not fixed. Today you are in a better frame of mind, so his soul may be coming to you for help. If someone is in the mind or the vital, or any part, the soul will know that by mixing with so and so and talking about me and the Centre, immediately the consciousness will change. Unconsciously, his mind is taking help from you, or he is giving help to you. But the soul is conscious of this.</p>
<p>There is nothing accidental in the soul's region. Everything is recorded. On the physical plane everything is an accident; we can't account for it. In the soul's plane, it is not like that. The soul's biography is very minute, precise; again, the soul will not give much importance to the success or failure. You have tried for so many hours to elevate Z's consciousness, but both of you have failed each other. You will feel miserable that you spent two hours of your precious time and could not elevate his consciousness And he will feel sad that you did not help him. But the soul deals with Eternity. The soul will take these two hours and say, "Oh, this time is not wasted at all. The next time we meet there will be a little more progress." But in the human life it is not like that. Today both of you are good friends; tomorrow you may be good enemies. It is like that. On the human level everything is unpredictable. On the divine level, there is continuous progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part III — Eternity and immortality</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part III — Eternity and immortality" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What is the difference between Immortality and Eternity?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Immortality deals with life, life in the form of consciousness, life in the form of reality and life in the form of object, subject or substance. Immortality means Immortality of the consciousness, not Immortality of the gross physical. One can leave the body at one's own sweet will. But if anything has to last on the physical plane for an indefinite time, it becomes the greatest torture. I tell you, even the most materialistic person on earth, even a pleasure loving person, will be disgusted if he stays on earth for more than one hundred years. Every undivine desire will be fulfilled, but even then he will be disgusted because he is not dealing with the illumining Consciousness. When you deal with the illumining consciousness, at that time you do not pay any attention to the senses. You feel that you don't need the satisfaction of the senses, or of anything that belongs to earth, because at that time you see that earth itself is impermanent. The only thing that is permanent is the birthless and deathless Divine.</p>
<p>Now when we think of Eternity, at that time we have to know that anything that is created, either on the physical plane, the vital plane, the mental plane or the transcendental plane, can be eternal. It may have had its beginning yesterday, but it can go on, go on for millions and billions and trillions of years.</p>
<p>Immortality deals with life and life came from Silence. We can count Eternity, but we cannot count Immortality. However, Immortality came first, because Silence itself was life. So life comes first, and then only can we start counting. First one is born, then he is one second old, one day old, one year old, and so on.</p>
<p>So in Eternity there is a sense of measurement, while there is none in Immortality. You can't measure Immortality, whereas you can try to calculate Eternity with your imagination. The sense of measurement comes in Eternity. It is divine, intuitive and psychic measurement. Then, if you use your third eye, immediately you will know when it started and how it goes on. Immortality is something that is already there.</p>
<p>Let us take Eternity as a tree that is growing, growing and growing. Eternity grows and Immortality remains the same. Immortality is already there; just use your vision. But Eternity is always going upwards. Eternity's conception goes upwards, while Immortality is all around.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is Immortality?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is Immortality?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The word itself explains its meaning: that which lasts. We know that Divinity exists. Again, there are many undivine things on earth which last for a long time. When we see a thing that lasts for a long time, we feel that that very thing is immortal. If somebody stays on earth for eighty, ninety or a hundred years, sometimes we cut jokes and we say that he is immortal. When we see a banyan tree which has lasted for hundreds of years, we say that it is immortal. But real Immortality is consciousness.</p>
<p>When we speak of Immortality, it is the Immortality of consciousness that we are referring to. Consciousness does not die. Consciousness always has to be expanded. Right now we are living in an unconscious world, but a day will come when we will all be conscious, divinised and transformed. This consciousness which is already immortal will be enlarged when our human nature is transformed. Immortality means that which will last forever, and what lasts forever is our consciousness, our aspiring consciousness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One gets higher joy and more illumining joy in sahaja samadhi than in nirvikalpa samadhi. Nirvikalpa samadhi has tremendous intensity in it, although this intensity is not outwardly visible or inwardly felt by the observers. But sahaja samadhi is spontaneous. Here the Master can have sky-vast spontaneous confidence. The intensity is there, but it is so normal and spontaneous that nobody will be able to trace it.</p>
<p>There have been very few people on earth who have been blessed with sahaja samadhi. In their outer activities, they have almost always been misunderstood-not only by the unaspiring world but by the aspiring world too. Even some of their own disciples may not understand them. The disciples see the human in the Master and do not see the Divine which he eternally is and which he is constantly offering to the world in his own way. Sahaja samadhi is not only a spontaneous expression of the divine reality within us, but also a reality that synthesises the Silence-Vision of the Supreme and the Sound-Mission of the Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Would you tell us what Nirvana is?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Would you tell us what Nirvana is?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Hundreds of thousands of books have been written on Nirvana. We first come to hear about Nirvana from the Lord Buddha. It was he who offered to the world at large the conception of Nirvana.</p>
<p>What is Nirvana? It is the extinction of desires, suffering, bondage, limitation and death. It is a very high state where transcendental Bliss reigns supreme. When one is in Nirvana, one's cosmic play is done, and one no longer barters with time and deeds. On the strength of his aspiration the Golden Day dawns when the aspirant enters into the Nirvanic consciousness. He goes beyond the limits of time and space. You have to say that in Nirvana the Divine is enjoying its own self-amorous state. So Nirvana means the extinction of teeming earthly desires, sufferings and sorrows, and at the same time the Bliss and divine enjoyment of the highest trance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You said once that man is evolved from animals, and another time you said that man was once divine, then fell.

Can you resolve this paradox?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no paradox. The first time I was talking about evolution and the second time I was talking about involution. In evolution the spirit evolves from plant to animal to man. In involution the spirit enters from the soul's region into matter to perfect it. Some souls, when they realise God, will remain in the soul's region if they don't want to manifest divinity on earth. Those who want to manifest are like soldiers. They come down time after time for the Supreme, for the transformation of humanity. As you get joy when I ask you to do something for me or to work for me, also you should get the same joy if I ask you not to work. It is the same way with the spiritual Masters. The Supreme asks some souls to work for Him on earth and some not to.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do all Avatars have the same realisation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do all Avatars have the same realisation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are full Avatars and partial Avatars. A partial Avatar is not always totally aware of his transcendental height and universal reality. In his case, he feels that God at times plays hide-and-seek with him. A full Avatar is he who is constantly aware of his transcendental height and universal reality. A partial Avatar is not sure twenty-four hours of his inner divinity. In the inner world, he may be searching for something but may not know where it is; he may be sometimes disturbed, puzzled or afraid in the inner world. In the outer world, even some of the full Avatars have felt that they have lost the transcendental reality which they had already achieved. This does not happen in all cases, but it does happen in some cases. In the inner world a full Avatar is always aware of who he is and what is taking place. If the Master constantly knows what is happening in the inner world, even if he doesn't know outwardly, then nothing creates problems for him or his disciples whether things are taking place in the inner world or in the outer world.</p>
<p>A partial Avatar acts at times in a very human way. He is assailed by fear, doubt, anxiety, anger, frustration and other undivine qualities in spite of having a full realisation. But a full Avatar is realisation in the inner world and revelation and manifestation in the outer world. Within he is divinity's realisation and without he is divinity's revelation and manifestation,</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is the awakening of the kundalini the same as God-realisation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is the awakening of the kundalini the same as God-realisation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The awakening of the kundalini does not mean the realisation of God. The awakening of the kundalini is only a method of entering into inner consciousness. There are thousands of people on earth who have awakened their kundalini. They have become conscious of their inner psychic power. But to become consciously aware of your psychic power does not at all mean realisation of God, far from it. God-realisation is infinitely superior and more fulfilling than the awakening of the kundalini.</p>
<p>When one's kundalini is awakened, one feels that some inner power is at his command. But this inner power is not the infinite Peace, infinite Light and infinite Bliss of the Supreme. So, when the kundalini is awakened, one can say that one is in possession of a blade or a penknife and that one can use the penknife to do certain things. But when one realises God, one feels that one has the capacity to use an atom bomb. This is the difference. When I speak of using a knife or a bomb, I don't mean in a destructive way. It is actually the capacity I am referring to. So when one realises God, his divine consciousness bursts into the earth's atmosphere and is spread all over the length and breadth of the world. But when the kundalini is awakened, one has only very little power.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, the awakening of the kundalini can never bring immediate God-realisation. But again, after the awakening of the kundalini one sees the limitation of kundalini power. Then one wants to go high, higher, highest and one feels that until one has realised the absolute Highest, one will not put an end to one's journey. Naturally, one will march on, march on, until the infinite Goal is realised.</p>
