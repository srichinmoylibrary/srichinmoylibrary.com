  <h2 id="page-title">The seven-year-old defeats the scholar</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The seven-year-old defeats the scholar" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a great scholar. He was very proud and haughty. In argument, he used to defeat the rest of the scholars. Those who were defeated by him had to pay a penalty. On a monthly basis they had to send the scholar either money or material objects. This went on for a long time. Nobody could defeat him.</p>
<p>One day a little boy saw his teacher sad and miserable. He was only a seven-year-old child. He asked his teacher, "What has happened to make you so sad?"</p>
<p>His teacher said, "I have to pay my next instalment to the greatest scholar and today I do not have any money. My payment is due and he will be so angry with me if I do not pay him on time."</p>
<p>The little boy felt miserable. Something within him prompted him to say, "I will be able to solve the problem of this bad scholar who is torturing everybody."</p>
<p>Something within prompted this little boy to challenge the greatest scholar. He asked his teacher to take him where the greatest scholar was currently residing. The teacher became frightened. He said, "I cannot take you. You are a little boy. How are you going to challenge such an expert on the scriptures?"</p>
<p>All of a sudden the teacher and the little boy heard an enthusiastic noise. The greatest scholar was passing by on a palanquin, and his admirers and adorers were singing his praises. It was his practice to go from village to village in this way and challenge the local scholars.</p>
<p>When the little boy heard the commotion, he went running into the street and stood directly in front of the greatest scholar. People could not account for it. "What is he doing?" they asked.</p>
<p>The little boy ignored them. In a loud voice he said to the greatest scholar, "You have to stop! Stop! I have to ask you a question and you have to answer me."</p>
<p>All the villagers were highly amused.</p>
<p>Then the little boy collected some sand from the street and closed his fist. He said to the greatest scholar, "Please tell me how many grains of sand there are inside my palm."</p>
<p>The greatest scholar could not reply. He did not know the answer to the child's question. Some of the villagers became frightened, some were amused and some started clapping because the greatest scholar could not accurately say how many grains of sand were inside the little boy's palm.</p>
<p>Then the boy said, "Since you have lost to me, all the other scholars, including my teacher, do not have to pay you their penalties. They are freed from their debt."</p>
<p>All the scholars agreed. They said, "Why should we pay you? This little boy is greater than you are. You could not answer his question."</p>
<p>Soon news of what had happened reached the ears of the king. The king had tremendous admiration for the greatest scholar. He was astonished to hear that the greatest scholar had been defeated.</p>
<p>The queen said to the king, "I would like to see this little boy who defeated the scholar."</p>
<p>The king replied, "I still cannot believe that it is true."</p>
<p>The queen said, "I believe it. Let us invite both of them — the so-called greatest scholar and this seven- year-old boy who has now surpassed him. Let us hear them debate and we will decide for ourselves."</p>
<p>So the pair were summoned and all the scholars in the kingdom, plus thousands of their friends and relatives, gathered at the palace to witness the debate.</p>
<p>When the queen saw the little boy, in silence she poured all her affection, love, sweetness and fondness into him. She said to herself, "This little boy has to win."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when the king saw this upstart, he began laughing and laughing. He said, "I cannot imagine how this little boy is going to defeat the scholar!"</p>
<p>The queen said emphatically, "He is going to defeat him. In my heart I know it."</p>
<p>"Let us wait and see," replied the king.</p>
<p>The debate began. First of all, the greatest scholar said to the little boy, "It is beneath my dignity to ask you questions. You can ask me any question and if I can answer successfully, which I shall easily do, I shall apply this hammer to your head to teach you a lesson." Then he brought out a hammer from his garment.</p>
<p>Everybody was shocked. They were afraid that he would kill this little boy. But the little boy was not frightened. He said to the scholar, "I am going to make three statements, and you have to prove that in each case I am wrong. My first statement is: I am my mother's only child. The second statement is: our king has committed no sin. The third statement is: the queen married only the king. Think it over and see if you can refute these statements."</p>
<p>Now, the greatest scholar had listened to the statements with increasing dismay. The little boy was known to be the only child of his mother. It was the simple truth. How could he deny the truth? The second statement was much trickier. In order to win the point, the scholar had to prove that the king was full of sin. If he did so in front of so many people, he would lose his job - and perhaps his head! But the third statement was by far the trickiest of all. He had to prove that the queen had married someone else other than the king. He ran a tremendous risk by even discussing such a subject. So the greatest scholar was forced to admit that he could not disprove any of the statements. He hung his head in shame.</p>
<p>Then the queen said to the little boy, "My child, in order to win the debate, you yourself must disprove the statements."</p>
<p>"That I shall gladly do," said the little boy. "In one of our scriptures it is written that if a mother gives birth only to one child, then she is as good as childless. If she is blessed with only one child, then she is considered unmarried, a virgin. So according to the scriptures, my mother has no child."</p>
<p>What he said was absolutely true, but the scholar had not remembered this scripture passage.</p>
<p>The little boy went on, "My second statement was that the king is free from sin. That is also false. The king has accrued no sin personally. Everybody knows this truth. But if he is a real king, he has to identify himself with the sins of all his subjects. A real king is full of oneness, oneness, oneness. We are all his subjects and we have committed so many sins. If he is a real king, which he is, then he has to establish his oneness with all of us. Since he has to share our sins, we can say that the king is also full of sin."</p>
<p>The king was not pleased with this answer at all, but the queen said, "What the child has said is absolutely true. What kind of oneness can you claim to have? You always brag that you have such sympathy for your subjects. Such being the case, you are also full of sin."</p>
<p>The queen fully supported the little boy, so she was determined to justify him. Then came the third statement, which was the most difficult, that the queen married only the king. The queen was so eager to hear what the little boy would say. Everybody felt that here he would certainly fail.</p>
<p>Again the little boy drew from the scriptures: "It is an ancient tradition," he said, "that when a wedding takes place, the bride is first married to the five cosmic gods. Then only does she marry an earthly human being. So our queen was already married five times to the five principal cosmic gods. Therefore, how can she say she is only married to the king?"</p>
<p>The queen knew that what the child said was absolutely true. In the marriage ceremony, first the priest invokes the five main cosmic gods to marry the bride. Then she takes a human husband. So the queen immediately embraced the child and she said, "I am not going to allow you to go home. Your parents and everybody in your family have to come and live in the palace."</p>
<p>Then the queen said to the king, "I want you to say the greatest scholar has been defeated in front of the whole world. Now we shall keep him as our slave, our lifelong slave."</p>
<p>So the greatest scholar had to stay there in the palace and perform the duties of a slave and the little boy was given the greatest honour. The king said that when the time came, this little boy would marry the princess. His whole family became members of the royal family.</p>
<p>His questions were so difficult to answer, but his third question in particular absolutely puzzled the queen! So we see that bad people will eventually be punished.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Children ride free</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Children ride free" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A father, mother and two children went to the market to do some shopping. When their shopping was over, the whole family was coming back home. It was a distance of four miles. Because the children had walked to the market with their parents, now they had become a little bit tired. The father saw that a horse-drawn carriage was returning from the market. It had brought some people there and they were now engaged in shopping, so it was coming back empty.</p>
<p>The father hailed the carriage and asked, "How much will you charge to take us home?"</p>
<p>The carriage driver said, "For you one rupee, for your wife one rupee, but children can ride free of charge."</p>
<p>Immediately the father said to his children, "Jump into the carriage. You can ride for free. Your mother and I can walk."</p>
<p>The carriage driver said, "What? It was understood that all of you would ride home with me!"</p>
<p>The father said, "No, you did not say that if all of us went, the children would ride free. You simply said that children are free, whereas my wife and I are supposed to pay. So we do not have to pay."</p>
<p>Now confusion arose. The carriage driver did not want to take the children free of charge and the father did not want to pay. What is more, the children did not want to descend from the carriage. The father said, "If you agree, we can strike a compromise. Instead of paying one rupee each, I will pay you a quarter and my wife will pay you a quarter. Between us, my wife and I will give you half a rupee, and our children will ride for free. If you agree to this compromise, then we shall use your services."</p>
<p>The carriage driver said to himself, "I am dealing with rogues, but I want to prove that I am superior to them. It is better to have something than nothing. If I do not take them, if I go home without any passengers, then I will get nothing. The best thing is to take these two rogues. At least now I am getting half a rupee." So he took the husband and wife plus their two children home from the market.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The superior friend</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The superior friend" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This is a story about three friends. One friend was always bragging that he had so much knowledge, so much wisdom and so much wealth. He asserted his superiority in every way. His kind-hearted friends said, "It is true. You are wealthy and we are poor. But do not brag, do not brag. Boasting is not good." In spite of this, the friendship of these three was in very good shape.</p>
<p>One afternoon all three friends were on the bank of a river under a tree. The two kind-hearted friends advised the boastful one, "It is true, you are wiser than we are, you have more wealth than we have, but it is not good to brag. You will invite some calamity." Unfortunately, their friend did not heed their advice. He continued his endless boasting. But they forgave him because they wanted to maintain their friendship.</p>
<p>As they were chatting about various topics — "cabbages and kings" and so forth — a young man happened to pass by. He looked very strong and smart. Out of curiosity, they asked him who he was and he answered, "I am the wisest man in this district, and I am also the strongest. Everybody appreciates me, admires me and adores me. It is very strange that you have not heard about me."</p>
<p>They were puzzled because they had no idea who he was. They did not know anything about him. Then the friend who was very proud of his knowledge, wisdom and wealth said to this young man, "Would you like to answer one question?"</p>
<p>The young man answered, "Certainly! I will answer any question you have, since I am the wisest man."</p>
<p>The boastful friend continued, "Now you are seeing me and my two friends. Please tell us which one is giving you more joy. You are looking at us, but all of us cannot give you the same kind of joy. Somebody has to give you more. Which one of us is it?" He was sure that he would be the one chosen because he was clearly superior in every way.</p>
<p>The young man said, "Now, this is a most difficult question. I cannot answer it immediately. I have to examine you one by one. I shall ask you a question with regard to money. This will determine the outcome. Please tell me how you deal with money."</p>
<p>One friend said, "It is good to have money. Money enables us to buy material things, so in that sense, money is keeping us alive."</p>
<p>The second one said, "True, money is necessary, but money quite often creates problems for us. When we misuse money, we suffer."</p>
<p>The third friend, the richest one, said, "I have lots of money, but I am not attached to money at all."</p>
<p>He wanted to prove that he was rich, and at the same time that he was spiritually great.</p>
<p>He went on, "I have plenty of money, but I am not attached to it in the least. If anybody wants to take away my money-power, I will not mind."</p>
<p>Again he was showing off to this man that he had tremendous wealth, but he was above it.</p>
<p>The young man said, "Unfortunately, I am now on my way to the town, so I cannot give you an immediate decision. Tomorrow, if you happen to be here, I will tell you which one I have selected. Or, if you wish, I could come and see you. Where do you live?"</p>
<p>The friends answered, "We also have houses in town."</p>
<p>"You have houses in town?" said the young man.</p>
<p>"Do you want to be our guest?" asked the three friends. "We each have our own house."</p>
<p>The young man said, "All right, if you will allow me, I will gladly be your guest. With each one I shall spend a night, so I will be spending three nights altogether, and then I will be able to give you my answer."</p>
<p>The young man started reciting slokas from the Vedas, the Upanishads and other sacred books. He was showing off how he was the greatest pandit. The three friends were deeply moved that they would receive knowledge and wisdom from him.</p>
<p>Then the two kind-hearted friends said, "Here is our dearest friend. He is the one who has so much material wealth and who is so learned. We feel in all sincerity that he deserves to have you as his guest first. Then you can come to our places to stay."</p>
<p>The young man agreed to this proposal. He said, "Let me be at his place today, and tomorrow and the day after I shall come to your homes."</p>
<p>The young man accompanied the boastful friend to his home. This particular friend was very, very kind to him and showed him tremendous hospitality. Together they talked and talked far into the night. Alas, the boastful friend was tempted to show off. He showed the young man where he kept his safe and his expensive things, such as diamonds and gold.</p>
<p>The young man said, "I am not interested in these kinds of things. I am only interested in the Vedas, the Upanishads and physical strength. For me, the body and the spirit must go together. It is good that you have so much wealth. God is indeed kind to you. But, unfortunately, I am not interested in material wealth. I am only interested in my own physical strength and in reading the scriptures.</p>
<p>The boastful friend was a little bit sad that this young man was not interested in material wealth and could not appreciate his expensive things. But he enjoyed talking with the young man immensely. After some time, the young man declared that the following day he did not have to stay at the other two places, for he was planning to announce that of the three friends he had chosen this one.</p>
<p>"You are giving me tremendous joy," he said. "I do not think that I will get the same kind of joy from the other two. I am ready to declare you the winner."</p>
<p>The boastful man was so happy and so proud that he was chosen before the other two had even been examined. Then both the host and his guest retired for the night.</p>
<p>Now, the young man merely pretended that he was fast asleep. He even started snoring. The richest man was sleeping soundly. This young man was actually a rogue of the first water. When he was certain that the rich man was fast asleep, he emptied the safe and took all the jewels. As he was leaving the house, he saw that the rich man was still fast asleep. He said, "How can he sleep like this?" Then he kicked the rich man a few times. In case his victim woke up, he was ready to run away. He said, "I am infinitely stronger that this stupid fellow. He will not be able to do anything." He gave the rich man a few extra hard kicks, but still he did not wake up. Then he left with the stolen things.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, the rich man woke up. He immediately noticed that the young man was missing and the door of the safe was wide open. The rich man said, "What has happened! He has taken away everything!"</p>
<p>He rushed to his friends and cried, "I have nothing. I have nothing! Everything has been stolen by that rogue. I am now bankrupt!"</p>
<p>The two friends tried to console him. They said, "We begged you not to brag. We knew that you would invite some calamity and now this is what has happened."</p>
<p>The rich man stopped crying and said, "God has really blessed me today. Although you two were my friends, inwardly I used to look down upon you because I was infinitely richer and more learned than you. In every way I felt superior. I told that young man that, despite having great wealth, I was not attached to it. You two said that money is necessary and then again money can create problems. In my case, I was showing off, but in the heart of my heart, was I not attached to my money? I was so proud of my money-power. God has really saved me from my pride. Now I can truly claim you two as my friends. My friendship with you has proven to be infinitely more important than my attachment to wealth."</p>
