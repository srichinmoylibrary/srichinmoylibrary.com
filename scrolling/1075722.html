<p><em>(The Abode of Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. Mind has not been born there. The One without a second and the Mother of the Trinity are rapt in trance in the holy Fire. The teeming Gods go round the Infinite and the Mother of the Golden All, singing anthems to them.)</em></p>
<p>1ST BAND OF THE GODS: The face of Truth is covered with a brilliant lid; that do thou remove, O Fosterer, for the law of the Truth, for sight. [fn:1]</p>
<p>2ND BAND:</p>

<p>From the non-being to true being,<br /> From the darkness to the Light,<br /> From death to Immortality.<br /> OM. Peace! Peace! Peace!<br /> So be it. [fn:2]</p>

<p><em>(Their creation has compelled the primaeval parents to descend upon earth for the Divine Play and thus to terminate the earth's ceaseless pangs.)</em></p>
<p>BRAHMA: It is I who create. None save I is the Infinite's creative Power. Therefore, no equal have I.</p>
<p>VISHNU: It is I who uphold. I am His preserving Power. Hence, matchless am I.</p>
<p>SIVA: I am Rudra. I am His force of Destruction. Boundless also is my Compassion for the doleful earth. It is I who lead the earth and her children towards a new creation. Therefore, unique am I.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Earth sows, Heaven reaps. Our supremacy amongst each other can be proved only on the earth, and there alone shall we be able to find which of our devotees are truly superior.</p>
<p>VISHNU: I see eye to eye with you.</p>
<p>SIVA: Needless to say, I shall accompany you. We are but the triune limbs of the Supreme. We exist simply because we must needs help Him in his Divine Play.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Has the earth invoked our presence there? Without their mounting cry how can we descend?</p>
<p>VISHNU: I shall sow the seed of yearning in the heart of the mortals. With a heart full of devotion they will pray to us.</p>
<p>SIVA: Remember, the Asura with his hosts will not remain asleep. How can the earth hail our advent, she who has been under the octopus tentacles of the brooding Giant of Evil?</p>
<p>BRAHMA: We are fully aware. Mahadeva, you will be our Captain! It is you who will ruthlessly destroy the Adversary and found our victory on the aspiring soil.</p>
<p><em>(Behind the curtain a tremendous call and yearning)</em></p>
<p>O, save the earth! O, save the creation! Do flood the earth with the sanctified waters of the Truth and cast the Falsehood down into the Chasm of Nothingness. Set the earth-life free from the roaring den of Death. Brahma, Vishnu, Siva! deign to alight on this orphan earth where Ignorance reigns supreme. We yearn to see your divine Play on the sorrowful dust.</p>

<p><em>OM. Anandamayi Chaitanyamayi Satyamayi Parame.</em><br /><em>OM. Anandamayi Chaitanyamayi Satyamayi Parame.</em><br /><em>OM. Anandamayi Chaitanyamayi Satyamayi Parame.</em></p>

<p>THE MOTHER: Alas, the earth is inundated with ceaseless sorrows and pangs. Her throbbing heart compels my descent. I am the Mother. Who but I can save my children?</p>
<p>THE INFINITE: I, too, on earth shall descend. My advent the East shall acclaim, thine the West.</p>
<p>THE MOTHER: My Grace shall give Immortality to earth. With me will I carry the flame of fire-pure Transformation.</p>
<p>THE INFINITE: I will found thy supernal Kingdom on the neglected earth.</p>

<p><em>(The residence of Dr. K.D. Ghosh. A smiling garden in front. Swarnalata, his wife, while plucking flowers, sings.)</em></p>
<p>"What shall we mortals do? O, ours to meet With worshipping brow the flowers of His feet!"</p>
<p><em>(Enter K.D. Ghosh)</em></p>
<p>KRISHNA DHAN: I cannot believe my ears! You sing surprisingly sweetly. They say you are 'the Rose of Rangpur' and I know you to be a matchless woman. But I have never heard you sing.</p>
<p>SWARNALATA: Truth to tell, I am not inclined to music; at least, music is not my forte.</p>
<p>K.D.: Who was it singing then like an angel?</p>
<p>SWARNA: Ah! don't you know that alone anybody can sing?</p>
<p>K.D.: Not always. The singer in me, if any, wouldn't sing, even if alone.</p>
<p>SWARNA: I believe you, too, would sing if you dreamt my dream.</p>
<p>K.D.: Dream! Do open your heart. Am I not your husband?</p>
<p>SWARNA: True, you are my confidant. But it's not the proper moment to give away the secret. Let me see if my dream comes true.</p>
<p>K.D.: Swarna, you too! — you appear to be my eighth wonder.</p>
<p>SWARNA: That is a long story. It would be a Mahabharata if I told it. To be brief, I had a toy Krishna when I was a child. As I grew up, I was wont to pray to Sri Krishna in the evening when the earth sank into silence. My sole desire was to be the mother of the embodied Divine.</p>
<p>K.D.: We are too human for a divine dream. Kausalya, Devaki, Sachi — was there anyone on earth who suffered more than they? What a fanciful desire, indeed! What a lofty dream!</p>
<p>SWARNA: But you have not yet heard me out.</p>
<p>K.D.: Do say your say. I will keep it to myself. I give you my word of honour.</p>
<p>SWARNA: But do you know yourself? You are an atheist.</p>
<p>K.D.: Atheist! My father was a Hindu, so am I. I am a worshipper of Kali. My father's mother is at Varanashi. A devotee of Lord Siva is she. Am I an atheist because I move in European society?</p>
<p>SWARNA: Let it be. My dream demands your heart's encouraging, your true sympathy!</p>
<p>K.D.: Swarna, I empty my heart to you.</p>
<p>SWARNA: My prayer shall bear fruit before long. He, the Light of the world, is within me. <em>(A bashful smile.)</em></p>
<p>K.D.: Is He? <em>(A broad smile.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter a poor Muslim in hot haste)</em></p>
<p>ABDUL: Babu, Babu! cholera has broken out in our village. I am very, very poor. Two of my sons were snatched away to the other world last week. My youngest, my dearest, my last son threatens to go. I pray, do call at my hut. Your very presence shall cure my dying son.</p>
<p>K.D.: I shall try my best. My life on earth has no other aim but to protect the weak and help the needy. Those who wallow in wealth can call in eminent doctors. But my hand and bottle are for those whose friend is poverty itself. My work is to have money from the haves and contribute to the funds of the have-nots.</p>
<p>ABDUL: Babu, Babu! I can pay the flood of your sympathy only with my tears of delight.</p>
<p><em>(Exit K.D. Ghosh and Abdul)</em></p>
<p>SWARNA: <em>(With tears streaming)</em> Alas! him to call an atheist whose heart is a surge of sympathy — the living image of philanthropy? O Merciful! O Light of the blind! your pardon, your high pardon my sharp tongue desires.</p>

<p><em>(The Himalayas. A galaxy of Kuthumis. The ingress and egress of the aspirant souls.)</em></p>
<p>1ST KUTHUMI: The largesse of the mind is almost come to an end. Mind is the fount of problems. A permanent solution is not to be had there.</p>
<p>2ND KUTHUMI: True, mind is unable to solve all problems. Dangers weave their meshes around the human souls. But who or what can make the impossible possible?</p>
<p>3RD KUTHUMI: I know, I know. It is the pinnacled light of the Supermind which is utterly empty of all problems. It is a fount of harmony, of unity-in-multiplicity.</p>
<p>4TH KUTHUMI: The endless urge of the Supermind is to descend upon the earth and change her consciousness.</p>
<p>1ST KUTHUMI: To serve the purpose God's human birth is the supreme need.</p>
<p>2ND KUTHUMI: Many a time He has descended on the earth across the centuries. But earth seems to have made no satisfactory progress. He comes and goes at His chosen times. Each and every time His Mission appears to be thwarted by the wild ignorance of the earth. The wide hunger of Time devours all the spiritual wealth that He brings down. A ruthless oblivion lords it over the mortals.</p>
<p>3RD KUTHUMI: It is victory and not defeat that is the first and last word of God. Soon the Infinite shall alight on the throbbing heart of the soil.</p>
<p>4TH KUTHUMI: When, why, how, where?</p>
<p>3RD KUTHUMI: It is in India, it is in the land of the sages and the spiritual giants that He will see the light of day.</p>
<p>2ND KUTHUMI: And what is expected from us?</p>
<p>1ST KUTHUMI: Ours is to be a flower offering to Him, to His Mission.</p>

<p>SWARNA: Father, may I have a share?</p>
<p>RISHI: Certainly, my dream concerns you much. You all know that I have been a votary of the Nirakara Brahman for a couple of decades. But now no more. I saw Him ... It is beyond my power of expression. My eyes swam in light and delight.</p>
<p>SWARNA: Who was it, Father?</p>
<p>RISHI: The Light of the world, Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>SWARNA: Where?</p>
<p>RISHI: My daughter, in you, in you and nowhere else. Since the small hours of the morning I have been a torrent of ecstasy. I have also seen the Gods bow down on their knees before Him, your coming son. Swarna, you are my matchless jewel.</p>
<p>SWARNA: Father, you are my greatest pride. You stand very high in the estimation of all. You are the polestar of the Nation. Your voice has rung out the inmost voice of India. Now it is my hope that God will make me worthy of your prophetic vision.</p>

<p><em>(The abode of Manomohan Ghosh, a Barrister and close friend of Or. K.D. Ghosh. Behind the screen.)</em></p>

<p>The Birth of the Infinite<br /><em>(5 a.m., August 15, 1872)</em></p>
<p>The golden dawn of the cosmos rapt in trance,<br /> Awaits the birth of the All.<br /> The seven worlds' bliss converges in her heart<br /> With august and sun-vast call.</p>
<p>Slowly the Peak unmeasured of rapture-fire<br /> Climbs down to our human cry.<br /> His diamond vision's deathless Will leans low<br /> Our mortal frames to dye.</p>
<p>Suddenly life's giant somnolence is stirred.<br /> His all-embracing Wing<br /> Declares, "I come to end your eyeless fear:<br /> To me alone now cling!</p>
<p>"No fleeting dreams your teeming births do trace:<br /> Now own my infinite bloom.<br /> In me the flood of Immortality!<br /> Nowhere shall be your doom."</p>

<p>MANOMOHAN: My joy knows no bounds that your son takes birth in my house.</p>
<p>K.D.: No doubt, it will be a matter of great rejoicing if the dream of my wife comes true.</p>
<p>MANOMOHAN: How does her dream run?</p>
<p>K.D.: Friend, to me it is just a dream, a chimera's mist, but to her it is a blazing truth.</p>
<p>MANOMOHAN: Krishnadhan, I wish to hear her dream and not your comment on it.</p>
<p>K.D.: Well, during her confinement she dreamt that it was Sri Krishna who would take human birth through her.</p>
<p>MANOMOHAN: I see nothing wrong in her dream. You are a pessimist from head to foot. Come, let us hurry to the child. Who knows, we may find the Marvellous One?</p>

<p>SWARNA: Father, I see no wonder in his face. In my dream he was the Wonder of Wonders.</p>
<p>RISHI: My daughter, do not look at him with your earthly eyes. To me he remains the same as in my vision when I saw him as the Light of the world. Never forget that God is the Thaumaturge of thaumaturges. Therefore, his appearance has put a mask on his real nature. Swarna, what a pride now tingles through my blood! My heart is swayed by a riot of joy. Krishna, Krishna is come. Dark clouds of doubt must not blight your vision. He is our Aurobindo. He is the Divine Lotus. Petal by petal He will bloom to a perfect perfection.</p>

<p><em>(The parlour of Dr. K.D. Ghosh. Evening sets in.)</em></p>
<p>K.D.: I have a fine proposal, Swarna. I would like to call in an Englishman.</p>
<p>SWARNA: What for?</p>
<p>K.D.: To tutor Benoy and Mano in English.</p>
<p>SWARNA: And then ...</p>
<p>K.D.: For Auro an English governess.</p>
<p>SWARNA: If my approval has any value then you have it hundred per cent.</p>
<p>K.D.: Something more ...</p>
<p>SWARNA: What is it?</p>
<p>K.D.: Starting from to-day, indeed from to-day on, Bengali is not to be spoken in our house. English, only English. How I wish my children could speak in English, write in English, think in English and even dream in English! They must be Englishmen to the core. I shall soon send them to Darjeeling and place them in a convent school. A few years later, I shall take them to London. My sons must be among the brightest jewels in India's crown.</p>
<p>SWARNA: An exquisite plan, indeed. But before that why not say that you want to send me to the land of Death? How dare you think that I can endure the absence of my sweet children? Shall I not go mad?</p>
<p>K.D.: I knew it well that the mother in your heart is too strong. You are a typical Bengali woman. You want your sons to be helpless, mere babes in arms. Your pale, pathetic look pierces my heart. Swarna, your skin must not lose its colour because of worry. Do not be upset.</p>
<p>SWARNA: I am sorry. It is not in me to cross you. But you have given me a great shock.</p>

<p><em>(Darjeeling. Benoy, Mano and Auro are returning from school. On the way they happen to meet a Sannyasin. Many people have gathered about him. He smokes profusely.)</em></p>
<p>A VILLAGER: Sadhuji, please give me some religious knowledge.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: All I can give you is a bit of advice. I am afraid, although my advice will reach your sceptic ears, you will never apply it in the practical field. <em>(Some of the villagers burst into a peal of laughter.)</em> My advice, you know? The world is an illusion. Have no link with it!</p>
<p>A MERCHANT: Be pleased to read my palm.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: You, you wallow in the pleasure of wealth. Am I right?</p>
<p>MERCHANT: Absolutely perfect. But, Sadhuji, I have not seen the face of peace even for a fleeting second.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: Ah, peace! peace is not to take birth here in this world. It is the offspring of another world. This world is made of din, dust and dizzying demonstrations.</p>
<p>MANMOHAN: Please run your eyes over my palm, and drop a few hints about my years to come.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: Ah, a poet, a fine poet. This is what your future says.</p>
<p>MANOMOHAN: <em>(Pointing at Auro)</em> And how does the fate of my younger brother run?</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: <em>(Looking ahead he meets Aurobindo's curious eyes; and in the twinkling of an eye sprints off.)</em> His future is at his command.</p>
<p>MANMOHAN: Only a few days back Auro composed a beautiful poem on Kanchanjunga. The teachers have appreciated it greatly.</p>
<p>SANNYASIN: No wonder, he is not a common boy. He will be a great Yogi who has to play a great part on the world scene! Brahman! Brahman! O Lord of my breath, Thou art verily Thy unfathomable mystery.</p>

<p>MR. DREWETT: Good morning, Mr. Ghosh. Come, come, my young friends! <em>(Looking at Mrs. Drewett)</em> You were praying for a child. Now God brings you three in a row.</p>
<p>MRS. DREWETT: Thank God. Mr. Ghosh, I shall love them as if they were my own children. <em>(Caressing Auro)</em> I shall teach you English myself. I will not let you go to school at this tender age.</p>
<p>MR. DREWETT: I shall teach you Latin. I shall help you in every way. My young friend, I can brook no delay. Come, let us start our Latin lesson. Just repeat what I say.</p>
<p>Father - Pater</p>
<p>Mother - Mater</p>
<p>Brother - Frater</p>
<p>Sister - Soror</p>
<p>Son - Filius</p>
<p>Daughter - Filia</p>
<p>And now please repeat all the words by yourself.</p>
<p><em>(Auro's answers are perfect.)</em></p>
<p>Wonderful, your memory is wonderful.</p>
<p>AURO: Sir, what is the Latin for "God" and "Goddess"?</p>
<p>MR. DREWETT: Well, "Deus" and "Dea." What made you ask this, my boy?</p>

<p>MANO: Fortune dawns on us at last. But what is wrong with father? Why has he stopped sending money?</p>
<p>BENOY: My feeling is that father is not keeping in sound health. Alas, the moment I think of Auro my heart aches. He is only just out of his childhood.</p>
<p>MANO: Poor Auro, he has to learn the meaning of poverty at the very start of his life.</p>
<p>BENOY: For the last three months we have been unable to have a full meal. God knows how many days more we are to go on thus.</p>
<p>MANO: My poems bring in cheers, praises, appreciations but not a single penny. Such is my fate!</p>
<p><em>(Enter Auro)</em></p>
<p>AURO: Here, a hundred shillings!</p>
<p><em>(Benoy and Mano jump up with astonishment.)</em></p>
<p>BENOY AND MANO: From where? From where?</p>
<p>AURO: An article of mine has been published, and they have given me this. Now, I would like to tell you something. You two always think of my suffering and poverty. But why do you forget the truth that there are millions on the earth whose condition is infinitely worse than ours? Our present condition makes us better able to fathom their sorrow. With a cheerful face let us brave the future.</p>

<p>AURO: We must pay the British back in their own coin.</p>
