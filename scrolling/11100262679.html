<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Repeat your name fifty times most soulfully. Soon you will be in another world; the world of the soul's divinity. Take some rest, then start again. If you make a mistake and lose track of the number, pay no attention to it. Just continue with some likely number. You have to understand why I asked you to count. When you count, you separate your consciousness from other things. At that time you will not be thinking of someone else or something else. Your consciousness will be focused on what you are repeating and you will begin to feel that you are meditating only on your higher self.</p>
<p>While you are counting, you should enter into the world of silence deep inside the consciousness of your soul's name. Then you won't have to count at all.</p>
<p>When a runner is about to begin a race, he is full of conscious awareness. His hands, knees and feet all have to be in the right position when the starter fires the gun. But once he is in motion and running at top speed, he doesn't think whether or not he is placing his feet properly on the ground. He just runs. He does not look back; he looks forward. Lo, he reaches his goal. Each seeker is a divinely inspired runner, running consciously and speedily toward the Goal of the Beyond.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, everybody has his own <em>mantra</em>. There are many, many Sanskrit <em>mantras</em>. A <em>mantra</em> can be only one syllable, or it can be a group of syllables or a sentence. But in the Indian scriptures it is said that if you want mental illumination, you can practice the <em>mantra</em>. If you want purity, you can use this <em>mantra</em>. If you want some other quality you can also use this <em>mantra</em>. AUM is a <em>mantra</em> which is most effective for anything and for anybody.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On my path you should meditate on your heart. If your <em>japa</em> conflicts with the kind of meditation I ask you to do, and with your oneness with me, then I advise you to give it up. But if you feel that it does not conflict at all and is only adding to the effectiveness of your present method of meditation, then please continue. If it is obstructing your spiritual growth, please give it up. But do not spend all your meditation time in chanting. You should do pure meditation also.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are six major psychic centres in the human body. These centres are actually located in the subtle body. For each centre there is a seed sound or seed word. Each word represents a state of consciousness and within each state of consciousness there will be a particular symbol: perhaps a flower or an animal.</p>
<p>There is a centre at the base of the spine which is called <em>Muladhara.</em> If we can repeat the seed word lam while focusing all our attention at the base of the spine, in the course of time we will open this centre and we will be endowed with the power to cure diseases.</p>
<p>A few inches higher, near the spleen, is another centre, called <em>Svadhisthana</em>. If we can repeat the mantra <em>vam</em> while concentrating here, we will eventually be endowed with the power to offer love to everyone and everything and to receive love from everyone and everything.</p>
<p>At the level of the navel is a centre called <em>Manipura.</em> If we can concentrate here and repeat the syllable <em>ram</em> with power and force, we will eventually be able to conquer all sorrow and suffering. Also, this centre gives us the power to enter into the subtle worlds and higher planes.</p>
<p>The heart centre is called <em>Anahata</em>. The mantra yam has to be chanted here slowly and sweetly. If we can open the heart centre, we can attain pure joy and the bliss of oneness.</p>
<p>The throat centre which is the fifth centre, is called <em>Vishuddha.</em> If we chant ham while we concentrate on it, we will receive the power of eloquence in expression in all forms of art.</p>
<p>Then we come to <em>Ajna,</em> which is a little above the base of the nose. There the seed word is AUM. By concentrating on this centre and charting AUM, we can get boundless psychic and occult powers.</p>
<p>No matter which centre we choose to concentrate on or which mantra we repeat, we should try to feel a vibration from all the centres. While we are repeating a particular mantra, we should try to feel that a current is flowing through our spinal cord as if a snake is passing through us, and all our centres are being aroused by this current.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy: Sahasrara</em> is considered to be the seventh spiritual centre, although it is not linked to the other six. The <em>Sahasrara chakra</em> is located at the crown of the head.</p>
<p>When one enters into this crown centre, he enters into trance and goes beyond the consciousness of this world. The mantra of this centre is 'Supreme'.</p>
<p>There are many other insignificant centres in the subtle body, but the six I have talked about and this <em>Sahasrara chakra</em> are the most important ones.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The significance of Aum</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The significance of Aum" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>AUM existed. Nothing else. AUM exists. Nothing else. AUM will exist. Nothing else. What is AUM? It is the mother of all Indian mantras. What is a mantra? It is the Power in the guise of a sound. The sound of AUM is unique. Generally, when two things are struck together, we hear a sound. But this sound needs no such action. It is <em>anahata</em>, 'unstruck'. It is the soundless sound. A yogi or a spiritual figure hears it self-generated in the inmost recesses of his heart. When you begin to hear it, you can be certain that you are far advanced in the spiritual life. Your God-realisation will no longer remain a mere cry in the wilderness. The day of your Self-realisation is fast approaching.</p>
<p>'A' stands for Aspiration to realise God. 'U' stands for Union with God. 'M' stands for the Manifestation of God in us, with us and through us.</p>
<p>AUM says that man errs when he says that he lives because he breathes. He lives because in his breath there is the Power that is God Himself.</p>
<p>O man, AUM can fulfil all your desires or AUM can free you from all your desires. Only one boon is granted; choose either of the two. If your worldly desires seem infinite, then rest assured that God's wealth is more than infinite. You can freely continue asking Him for things mundane. But if you want inner and outer freedom, God, being absolute Freedom, can eternally fulfil your highest aspirations. So you can freely go on aspiring for things divine.</p>
<p>AUM is a single Sanskrit character represented in English by three letters pronounced as one syllable. We could speak about AUM until the end of the century without exhausting its infinite meaning. We can say that AUM is a tree. A tree has its roots firmly embedded in the ground. Its trunk, branches and boughs reach up, up, up in a mute prayer to the Highest. A tree is a living symbol of flaming aspiration. The roots, digging deep as if trying to reach the very bowels of the earth to extract its life's nourishment, are represented by the 'A'. The trunk and foliage, manifesting the eternal Life for all of us to see on this plane of existence, are represented by the 'U'. The topmost boughs reaching up toward the infinite as a mute prayer to the Highest, are represented by the 'M'.</p>
<p>AUM is a river. The 'A' is the source, surging forth from the bosom of the earth. The 'U' is the rushing current of eternal Life carrying with it all that it touches. The 'M' is the ultimate arrival at the infinite Ocean of the transcendental Beyond.</p>
<p>AUM is a lighted candle. 'A' is the wax, 'U' is the flame, 'M' is the light and heat spreading outward toward the farthest and upward toward the highest.AUM is a man. 'A' represents his basic physical nature, the forces that nourish and propel him. 'U' represents his life's manifestation, growing toward greater and higher forms of expression. 'M' represents his aspiring soul touching the Feet of the Supreme.</p>
<p>AUM is God. 'A' manifests the visible existence: creation in its infinite forms and innumerable expressions. 'U' is the current of Life eternal, carrying all creation onward and upward. 'M' is the infinite Supreme, the transcendental Unmanifest.</p>
<p>AUM is the soundless sound. It is the vibration of the Supreme. It is a single, indivisible, ineffable sound. When we hear the soundless sound within, when we identify with it, when we live within it, we can be freed from the fetters of ignorance and realise the Supreme within and without.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What happens when we chant AUM?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What happens when we chant AUM?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A Sanskrit word or syllable has a special significance and creative power. When we chant AUM, what actually happens is that we bring down Peace and Light from above and create a universal harmony within and without us. When we repeat AUM, both our inner and our outer beings become inspired and surcharged with divine Light and aspiration. AUM has no equal. AUM has infinite Power. Just by repeating AUM, we can realise God.</p>
<p>When you chant AUM, try to feel that God is climbing up and down within you. Hundreds of seekers in India have realised God simply by repeating AUM. AUM is the symbol of God, the Creator.</p>
<p>No matter how grave one's sin is, if one chants AUM a few times from the depth of one's heart, the omnipotent Compassion of God will forgive and redeem the victim. In the twinkling of an eye, the power of AUM transforms darkness into light, ignorance into knowledge and death into Immortality.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. I sometimes do it, but it is not at all necessary. When I first started my spiritual journey, I was fond of this divine sound which represents God in three forms: God as Creator, God as Preserver and God as Transformer. When we begin our meditation, we can first enter into God the Creator who is creating aspiration in us. Then we can feel that God the Preserver is preserving us to continue our divine journey. Finally, we can feel that God the Transformer is transforming our ignorance into wisdom at every moment. He is transforming our unlit consciousness into the illumined consciousness, our darkness into light, our falsehood into the plenitude of truth. The chanting is not at all necessary, but if one wants to get inspiration, it can be helpful.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Will you please tell me briefly about the soundless sound?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Will you please tell me briefly about the soundless sound?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The most significant mantra is AUM, which is called the soundless sound, <em>anahata nada</em>. <em>Anahata</em> means 'that which is not struck'. If I strike something you will hear a sound. But the sound of AUM is created without any collision; therefore, it is called the unstruck sound, the sound that is not made by striking something. Yogis, great spiritual figures and all who are far advanced in the spiritual life hear the soundless sound in the inmost recesses of their hearts.</p>
<p>If you repeat the mantra AUM every day for two hours, three hours, or four hours, you will get the vibration of that sound within your heart. You will not have to strike your heart in order to hear this sound, but by repeating the word AUM outwardly, you get the sound inwardly.</p>
<p>When the soundless sound is vibrating constantly in your heart, your whole body is surcharged with divine knowledge, divine light, divine power. If you practise only that mantra, that is enough to take you to God. The syllable AUM is the most effective mantra. Again, if you want to hear the soundless sound, you can aspire all the time, saying, "O God, descend into me and make me hear the soundless sound." But the easiest and the most effective method is to repeat the mantra itself. AUM is the symbol of God, the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! It will do everything. It will be visible, it will be audible and it will bring you closer to God within you. AUM is the mother of all mantras. AUM is God's sound. Every second God is creating Himself anew inside AUM. This sound He used to create the world; this sound He uses to preserve the world; this sound He is using to transform the world.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How are we actually supposed to chant AUM?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How are we actually supposed to chant AUM?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are various ways to chant AUM. When we chant AUM with tremendous soul's power, what we actually do is enter into the cosmic vibration where the creation is in perfect harmony and where the cosmic Dance is being danced by the Absolute. If we chant AUM soulfully, we become one with the cosmic Dance; we become one with God the Creator, God the Preserver and God the Transformer. All that God has within and without, AUM can offer to us, because AUM is at once the Life, the Body and the Breath of God. This is what an Indian seeker or an Indian spiritual Master feels when he chants AUM.</p>
<p>If you get an attack on the emotional vital plane and wrong thoughts, wrong ideas, wrong vibrations enter into you, repeat AUM or the name of the Supreme as fast as possible. Do not chant slowly. When you are trying to cleanse your mind of impurities you must chant as if you were running to catch a moving train.</p>
<p>When you do <em>japa,</em> do not prolong your chanting too much. If you prolong the syllable AUM, you won't have the time to chant five hundred or six hundred times. Just say the syllable in a normal but soulful way so that you will get the vibration.</p>
<p>I know that some of you repeat AUM and 'Supreme' at home. It is wonderful that you practise this, but please practise it aloud, not silently. Let the sound of the mantra vibrate even in your physical ears and permeate your entire body.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can we hear AUM inwardly if we can&#039;t say it out loud?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can we hear AUM inwardly if we can&#039;t say it out loud?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible to utter the word AUM silently or to hear it inwardly without actually saying it. Wherever we are, the sound of AUM is already there. We have only to enter into the sound. If we know how to enter into the original source of the sound, which is inside the heart, then we need not chant aloud. We chant AUM aloud because when the outer mind is convinced, we get greater joy and a greater sense of achievement. We can very often hear the sound of AUM without chanting it ourselves, but we do not know whether it is coming from our heart or from the atmosphere. Sometimes during meditation seekers hear the sound of AUM although nobody is chanting it aloud. This means that inwardly somebody has chanted or is chanting AUM and the meditation room has preserved the sound. If we are conscious during sleep, we will hear the sound. It is not the heartbeat we will hear, but the soundless sound. We will hear it and feel it most convincingly.</p>
<p>If you want to meditate while you are in some public place where there are all kinds of noise, what can you do? If you go deep within, from inside either you can bring to the fore just a drop of infinite Peace, or you can bring forward a louder sound. That louder sound is not a destructive sound but a sound that contains indomitable power. It gives us the feeling of how potentially great and divine we are. If you can bring your indomitable power to the fore and become one with the force which is coming from your heart, you will see that the outer noises of the world are no match for your inner sound.</p>
<p>When you are surrounded by outer noises, try to enter into your own inner sound itself. To your surprise, you will see that the sounds which disturbed you one minute ago do not bother you now. On the contrary, you will get a sense of achievement because instead of hearing noise, you will hear divine music, and that divine music is produced within you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> True. In your culture the most significant word is 'God'. In India, we repeat AUM or the name of a cosmic god or goddess, like Shiva or Kali. In chanting a mantra the most important thing is to know in what aspect of the Supreme we have absolute faith. I use the word 'God' here in the West because I know that all your life you have been trained to pray to God. But today AUM can enter into you with all its significance. The time will come when you can go deeper within, and if 'AUM' inspires you more than 'God' then you should chant AUM. It is the inspiration that you get which is of the utmost importance. You can chant the word 'God' if that gives you more inspiration.</p>

<h2>Question: Sri Chinmoy: When you close your eyes completely and hum that way, does that create a kind of hypnotism in your followers?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not at all. My followers know that I am not a hypnotist. I do not believe in hypnotism and I do not encourage my disciples to use hypnotism. Whether I keep my eyes open or closed, they feel the same divine consciousness when I meditate. The chanting itself enters into their aspiring heart and creates a divine vibration which inspires them to pray and meditate. This has nothing to do with hypnotism.</p>

Sometimes when we invoke you, we feel that it is because you are not with us that we have to invoke you." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is wrong. It is not true that I am not with you. On the contrary, you have to feel that I am with you and you are with me, always. My consciousness is always with you and with all my disciples. You have to feel that you are within me and I am within you, which is absolutely true. Oneness is already established, but it needs to be manifested. What actually happens is that when you are invoking me you are manifesting me. It is not that I am in some other place far away and you are bringing me by invoking me. We are already one, but when you invoke me, you are like the child who calls his mother because he needs something from her. When the child calls, immediately the mother knows that he needs her to do something for him. To do the thing is to bring it into manifestation. When you invoke the Supreme, at that time you feel that you need something and the Supreme is going to do it for you. Invocation means that something is being manifested in your consciousness and in the outer world.</p>
