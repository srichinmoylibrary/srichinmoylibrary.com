<p>As I was filling out the form for a refund, the head stewardess came by and said, "Where did you get this?" She was absolutely furious.</p>
<p>The first stewardess said, "I am giving him a refund. Otherwise, these people are going to sue the airline. We have taken money from them for ambassador class, but these are not ambassador-class seats."</p>
<p>There were only eight of us in the ambassador class, although there were about 40 seats. So the head stewardess went to get refund forms for the other seven passengers as well. First she was angry at the stewardess who gave me the refund form. Perhaps she had wanted to deceive us. But then she herself went to all the other ambassador-class passengers and gave them forms.</p>
<p>It was all because of the man who called me 'God' that eight people got refunds. The other ambassador class passengers were fools like me. If that man had not spoken up, the stewardess would have kept silent about the fact that they were not ambassador-class seats.</p>
<p>My only thanks to that man came through my smiling. The man was very pleased when I smiled at him. Then he went away. After some time I got up to look for my friend, because I wanted to thank him. I walked all around the economy section, going to this side and that side, but I could not find him.</p>
<p>First this man was angry at me. Then his heart came forward and he brought a little pillow and blanket for God. Then he saw that God was suffering, so he wanted to sue the airline. Because of him eight people got refunds.</p>

<p>As soon as the plane was in the air, a young man got the inspiration to dance. He would stand in front of someone and then start his dancing.</p>
<p>When I saw him coming near me, immediately I pretended to fall asleep. When he saw that I was sleeping, he went past me.</p>

<p>In two hours' time at least ten or twelve people from economy class came to lie down in the ambassador-class seats. These people didn't pay anything for ambassador class; they just came and were sleeping there. The stewardesses didn't ask them to move. If it had really been ambassador class, they wouldn't have allowed people from the economy section to occupy the seats.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Thin Man</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Thin Man" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I finished eating, I got up to go to the back of the plane to use the bathroom. Since we were only in the ambassador class, we were not allowed to go forward to the first-class bathrooms.</p>
<p>The stewardesses were still serving, and they had their trolleys in the aisles. Ahead of me there were two ladies who also wanted to go to the bathroom, but they couldn't move because the trolleys were blocking their way. One of the stewardesses said to me, "You are thin. You can pass by. But they can't." She put her hand on my back and said, "You can try, but those two can't even try."</p>
<p>Then she turned the trolley in such a way that there was a tiny space. I went through, and immediately she turned the trolley straight. As I was coming back, I saw that those two women were still waiting to get through.</p>
