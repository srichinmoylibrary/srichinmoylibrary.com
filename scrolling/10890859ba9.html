  <h2 id="page-title">Austerity, the middle path</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Austerity, the middle path" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Mahavira's own personal austerities were much greater than those of the Buddha. After a few years, the Buddha gave up extreme austerities and adopted the Middle Path. Mahavira was undisturbed by hardships of any kind. He continued practising austerities until he left his body at the age of 72.</p>
<p>But Mahavira did not advocate austerities for all his disciples. To those who were ready to accept the life of monks and nuns, he said, 'You have to be very, very austere.' But to those who were householders, he said, 'Go slowly. If you are not strong enough spiritually to become monks or nuns, then continue to make progress at your present level.' So Jainism has two approaches. In this way, Jainism has left room for progress. Like kindergarten students, householders can grow and grow and grow until they eventually reach the level of the college students, who are the monks and nuns. Then again, these college students can also grow and grow. They will go on to university level and eventually become liberated. Mahavira knew that not everyone could maintain the same standard, and so he allowed immense scope for progress. You can say that Jainism has little plants and it has trees.</p>
<p>Jainism reminds me of our ancient Indian system which tells us there are four stages of life: first you go to school, then you get married and lead a householder's life, then you retire and, finally, you renounce the world and go into the forest. In the same way, Jainism has two stages: the householder life for those who are not strong spiritually, and the life of a monk for those who are ready for the higher life.</p>
<p>The Buddha's philosophy was completely different. He did not advise his disciples to go to the extreme. A musician, for example, cannot remain either on the higher notes or on the lower notes. It is not at all pleasing to the ear. So he stays most of the time in the middle notes. Similarly, the disciples of the Lord Buddha progress steadily towards the perfect bliss of <em>nirvana</em> without going too far on one side or the other. The Buddha had a heart larger than the universe. He cried for the end of human suffering. His path was also very strict, but he did not want to impose undue sufferings on his followers through austerities.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The idea of God</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The idea of God" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Lord Mahavira did not believe in the existence of God or in the idea of <em>Avatars</em>, direct descendants of God. He said that if you realise your own soul, you will attain liberation.</p>
<p>Although the Buddha denied the existence of God and the soul, he did believe in the inner Light and in an inner being, an inner existence. He said that it is our inner existence which is eventually freed from the fetters of ignorance.</p>
<p>The philosophies of the Buddha and Mahavira are very similar in many respects. Both of them share the goal of <em>nirvana</em> and both proclaim the principle of <em>ahimsa</em> or non-violence.</p>
<p>Lord Mahavira and Lord Buddha came from the same spiritual Home: the Heart-Nest of the Universal Light.</p>
<p>The Buddha embodied and revealed the Light-aspect. Mahavira embodied and revealed the Power-aspect.</p>
<p>Both Mahavira and the Buddha came from the Beauty of the Unknowable and returned to the Fragrance of the Unknowable.</p>

<h2>42.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><em>May the Siddhas, purer than the moons, more radiant than the suns, and as profound as the oceans, give me protection.</em> p1: — Jaina hymn of praise</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Buddhism with its high and noble ethics, Jainism with its austere ideal of self-conquest, Hinduism with its magnificent examples on all sides of the Dharma are not inferior in ethical teaching and practice to any religion or system, but rather take the highest rank and have had the strongest force.</p>
<p>— <em>Sri Aurobindo</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How can the Hindu, whose whole fabric of thought centres in God, believe in Buddhism which is agnostic, or in Jainism which is atheistic?</p>
<p>The Buddhists or the Jains do not depend upon God; but the whole force of their religion is directed to the great central truth in every religion, to evolve a God out of man. They have not seen the Father, but they have seen the Son. And he that hath seen the Son hath seen the Father also.</p>
<p><em> — Swami Vivekananda</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not Rama. I have no desire for material things. Like a Jina, I want to establish peace within myself.</p>
<p><em> — An utterance of Sri Rama in the Yoga Vasishtha</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mahavira proclaimed in India the message of salvation that religion is a reality and not a mere social convention, that salvation comes from taking refuge in the true religion, and not from observing the external ceremonies of the community, that religion cannot regard any barrier between man and man as an eternal verity. Wondrous to relate, this teaching overtopped the barriers of the race's abiding instinct and conquered the whole country.</p>
<p><em>— Rabindranath Tagore</em><br /><em>Nobel Laureate (Literature)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No religion of the world has explained the principle of <em>ahimsa</em> so deeply and systematically with its applicability in life as Jainism. As and when this benevolent principle of <em>ahimsa</em> is practised by people to achieve their ends of life in this world and beyond, Jainism is sure to have the uppermost status and Bhagwan Mahavira is sure to be respected as the greatest authority on <em>ahimsa</em>. If anybody developed the doctrine of non-violence, it was Lord Mahavira. I request you to understand the teachings of Mahavira, think it over and translate it into action.</p>
<p><em>— Mahatma Gandhi</em><br /><em>Father of the Indian Nation</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The path of <em>ahimsa</em>, non-violence, emerges unmistakably as the only effective counter to the atom bomb. The Jain message of non-violence can make a significant contribution in helping national and international societies to resolve conflict. More and more people have begun to appreciate the imperative need to adopt the non-violence formula so that a global war can be averted and tensions overcome.</p>
<p><em>— H.H. Acharya Sushil Kumarji Maharaj</em><br /><em>Jaina Spiritual Leader</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jainism is really neither Hinduism nor Vedic Dharma. It contributes to the advancement of Indian culture and the study of Indian philosophy.</p>
<p><em> — Jawaharlal Nehru</em><br /><em>First Prime Minister of India</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The term Jain stands for self-control and <em>ahimsa</em>. Where there is <em>ahimsa</em>, the feeling of hatred cannot remain.</p>
<p><em>— Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</em><br /><em>"The Iron Man of India"</em><br /><em>Political Leader and Patriot</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jainism has contributed to the world the sublime doctrine of <em>ahimsa</em>. No other religion has emphasised the importance of <em>ahimsa</em> and carried its practice to the extent that Jainism has done. Jainism deserves to become the universal religion because of its <em>ahimsa</em> doctrine.</p>
<p><em>— Dr. Rajendra Prasad</em><br /><em>First President of India</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is evidence to show that so far back as the first century BC there were people who were worshipping Rishabhdeva, the first <em>Tirthankara</em>. There is no doubt that Jainism prevailed even before Vardhamana or Parshvanath. The Yajur Veda mentions the names of three <em>Tirthankaras</em>: Rishabha, Ajitnatha and Aristanemi.</p>
<p><em>— Dr. S. Radhakrishnan</em><br /><em>Second President of India</em><br /><em>Philosopher</em>Scholar/</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All religions preach love and the shedding of hatred. It is the distinctive glory of Jainism that it has taken a lead in propagating the efficacy of <em>ahimsa</em>. The Jains have set the pace in serving humanity. The glorious heritage of the Jain religion can benefit the entire world.</p>
<p><em>— Giani Zail Singh</em><br /><em>Tenth President of India</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The sages, who discovered the law of non-violence in the midst of violence, were greater geniuses than Newton, greater warriors than Wellington. Non-violence is the law of our species as violence is the law of the brute.</p>
<p><em>— Romain Rolland</em><br /><em>Nobel Laureate (Literature)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not know if there is rebirth or not, or life after death. But if it is true, then I would like to be born in India as a Jain.</p>
<p><em>— Albert Einstein</em><br /><em>Nobel Laureate (Physics)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me assert my conviction that Jainism is an original system, quite distinct and independent from all others; and that therefore it is of great importance for the study of philosophical thought and religious life in ancient India.</p>
<p><em>— Dr. Herman Jacobi</em><br /><em>German Indologist</em></p>

<p>They say that Jainism and its <em>ahimsa</em> -code have caught the imagination of the Indian nation.</p>
<p>I say that Jainism and its <em>ahimsa</em> -essence have elevated the consciousness of the entire world.</p>
<p>They say that the Jaina religion is practised only by the few.</p>
<p>I say that the Jaina code of life is destined to be practised by the many.</p>
<p>They say that Jainism is confined to the shores of our Mother India.</p>
<p>I say that the heart and soul of Jainism will eventually be embraced by humanity as a whole. Indeed, that blessed day is fast approaching.</p>
<p>They say that Lord Mahavira and Lord Buddha were contemporaries, but by no means equals.</p>
<p>I say that Lord Mahavira and Lord Buddha were perfect embodiments of the selfsame Light of the ever-transcending Beyond. Who are we to judge them? We have to be fully enlightened like them before we can open our big mouths.</p>
<p>They say that Jainism is stark austerity-life.</p>
<p>I say that Jainism expects austerity from those who have the capacity to renounce the world for the world-illumination, and self-control from those who are still enjoying the pleasure-life.</p>
<p>They say that Jainism is too difficult.</p>
<p>I say that Jainism is easier than the easiest if you have but one feeling deep inside your heart: love and sacrifice for each and every living thing in the universe.</p>
