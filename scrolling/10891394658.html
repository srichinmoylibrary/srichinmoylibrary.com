<p><em>Seko:</em> Genius has a limited world, but for those who make the effort, there is an unlimited world. That is the most important thing. If you try very hard to make the effort, for you the infinite is there.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is true. A genius comes into the world with a special capacity from his past incarnation, or all of a sudden he achieves this kind of capacity. Then he may be satisfied with his capacity. He may not want to go beyond, whereas somebody who started with limited capacity may want to continue going beyond and beyond because he knows there is hope for him to do better. A genius may be a finished product, while somebody else who has aspiration and an inner cry will go on doing more and more.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There will be a real competition. Chicago will give more money. There will be a competition in money-power.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Kobayashi:</em> Probably the runners are more concerned with which races the stronger runners go to. They are more concerned with the competition than the money.

<p><em>Seko:</em> When a runner trains, he should have hard days and easy days in order to run a good marathon. He should prepare at least three months in advance.

A marathon runner shouldn&#039;t fear distance." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> So, Pahar, now you try.</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> Fifty miles a week is not enough.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now he has to do 100 miles a week?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> And also he should do a long run of 20 miles at least once a week. Then the rest of the week he can do shorter distances.</p>
<p><em>Pahar:</em> Two runs a day?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> That is the best. One in the morning and one in the afternoon or evening.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Shorter distances.</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> Then, once a week he should do speed work. Three times in one session he should run 5000-metre intervals in order to run a 2:30 marathon.As soon as my injury stops giving me problems, at the beginning of next year, I will start seriously training for the marathon. After my marriage, I stopped participating in races, so the world is saying that I have become lazy. I have to be careful so that people do not say that my wife is preventing me from participating in marathons. So I would like to start again participating in marathons.</p>

<p><em>Seko:</em> Thank you.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am sure Mr. Kobayashi will come with you.</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> Mr. Kobayashi is afraid of airplanes. He has never ridden on a plane. He is afraid even to fly to the South island. He goes by train. He would like to take a boat to America.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Like Mahatma Gandhi, he is afraid of planes. Gandhi also used to take trains.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Kobayashi:</em> I have inherited Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have seen you in Japan. Now we would like to see you in America.</p>
