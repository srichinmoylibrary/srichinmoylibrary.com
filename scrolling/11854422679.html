<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God will never demand from us more than we can offer Him. We are His beloved children. The mother will not place a heavy load on the shoulders of a small child. Even an ordinary earthly mother knows how much a child can carry. If the mother sees that the load is too much for the child, then she will not ask him to carry it. God is our eternal Father and Mother. He is everything to us. He will not demand of us something we cannot do. God is not imposing on you. God does not impose. Either you are making yourself feel that God expects something from you, or you are making yourself feel that you do not have the capacity to fulfil His expectations.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a matter of sincerity — how sincerely, how earnestly and how desperately you need to go beyond the experiences that you have already had. If you continue practising spirituality, which you have been doing for a number of years, then I assure you that you will make progress. It is a matter of regular practice. You have to practise regularly, soulfully and devotedly what you have been doing it is your regular practice that eventually will give you higher and deeper satisfaction.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From my point of view, they do need realisation. They are kind, they are good, they are sympathetic, they are sincere, they are pure, they have magnanimous hearts. These are the divine qualities they have got from the highest Source. But this is not enough. These things do not and cannot complete our human illumination. For our total illumination, we need conscious and constant oneness with the highest Source.</p>

<p><em>Steve Powers:</em> You're asking about healing? I guess first we have to establish whether you believe that there is a force of healing.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do believe in the force of healing.</p>
<p><em>Steve Powers:</em> And the source of the force?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The source of the force is God, the all-Good. God is omnipotent; again, He is all Love. So it is from His Love that the healing power comes into existence.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a matter of faith. Some people feel that if they do particular things, then someone will be cured, while others feel it is not necessary. You are dealing with individual faith. Some people use incantations in order to reach a higher state of consciousness, while others feel it is all within them, so it is necessary only to pray and meditate. You pray to God to give you the capacity to please Him in His own Way, and God will do the rest.</p>
<p>If I pray to God for His own fulfilment in and through my life, naturally He will do what is best for me. Some people pray to God, “God, grant me this. If I have this, then only will I be able to become a good instrument of Yours. I am now suffering from a headache and stomach upset. If You cure me, I will be able to have a good meditation.” But others say, “No, I wish to please You in Your own Way. If it is Your Will that today I do not meditate, if You have something else for me to do, if You want to give me an experience of suffering, then this is best for me. I do not know what is best for me. What is best for me only You know.”</p>

<p><em>Steve Powers:</em> That’s a very important question in our society. This woman feels that the more she allows herself to become sensitive, the more pain she feels and the more vulnerable she is to the sharks who seem to be constantly circling her.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I sympathise with her, I sympathise with you. But I wish to say that sometimes we see a dark tunnel before we see sunlight. Before dawn, the hour is the darkest. Right now we are experiencing the world as a harsh reality. The world is torturing us. We are trying to be good, kind, sympathetic, spiritual in every possible way, but in return we are being tortured by humanity. But we have to continue in our faith that God is all Power and that He is going to have a perfect creation. If we have faith in our own gradual perfection, then we will have the same kind of feeling about others. Right now if I look at myself and see what I am, as compared to what I was ten years ago, I would definitely notice an improvement. Ten years ago I was not, let us say, as divine as I am now. Ten years ago I was also, let us say, undivine. But I cried and I tried and my Lord was pleased with me, so He has granted me some light, some peace, some divine qualities. That’s why today I have become a better human being. So if I can make progress, I feel that others can also make the same progress. Today they are undivine, but tomorrow, like me, they can become divine. Not what one is right now, but what one will eventually become is what is most important. So these people who are now a threat to us need not and cannot remain a threat all the time because it is God’s Will that we make progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Caller: If God is all-loving, why does He permit suffering?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Caller:&lt;/em&gt; If God is all-loving, why does He permit suffering?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> ‘Suffering’ is a term we see in the dictionary. When we suffer, we feel tremendous pain inside us; there is no joy inside us. But I wish to say that suffering is a state of consciousness. When we practise spirituality and yoga, we feel that this suffering is nothing but an experience. And when we dive deep within, we feel it is not we who are having this experience of suffering; it is God Himself. He is the Creator; He is the creation. He is the Doer; He is the action itself. So the more we identify ourselves with the Source, the more we feel that what we call suffering is not suffering at all. It is an experience that God Himself is having in and through us for the fulfilment of His infinite Vision. I call it suffering, you call it suffering, but God does not call it suffering. He calls it an experience. It is a state of His own infinite Consciousness.</p>
<p><em>Steve Powers:</em> Nonetheless, the person who is suffering, in the common sense of the word, is in pain.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He is in pain because he has identified with the earth-reality. But if he identifies with God, then the suffering itself will be turned into delight.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I remain in an ordinary consciousness, then I will feel it as suffering. But if I am in a divine consciousness, then either I will take it as delight or I will take it as an experience of God in and through me. At the age of eight or nine I had a serious operation. I told the doctor I would like to watch the operation. The doctor said it was a serious operation, but I said, “No!” Right before the operation I put a very concentrated force on it, and during the operation itself I was smiling at the doctor. The doctor was horrified. On the strength of our concentrative power, we can transform suffering into delight itself if it is God’s Will. And again, if we want to experience the suffering and take it as an experience, we can do this. But if we do not transform suffering into delight, and if we do not take it as an experience of God in and through us, then it will hurt us deeply.</p>

Instantly I was besieged with a barrage of complaints and criticisms." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Steve Powers:</em> What you are talking about is the reaction of the people around you to your spirituality. I think that when people try to live a more spiritual life, there is a negative reaction from the people around them, who say such things as, “What, are you out of your mind?”</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a matter of choice. If I really want God and if I really feel that my goal is situated to the north, then I shall walk to the north, no matter what others say. Others have not given me satisfaction, but now I feel that there is something or someone else that will be able to give me satisfaction. Those who are criticising you in no way have given you satisfaction. Now you are looking for satisfaction deep within by praying and meditating. If they criticise you, if they ridicule you, you must not pay any attention to them. In this world there will always be people to criticise us, and again, there will be people to sympathise with us and inspire us. So the best thing is to know what you want. If you want satisfaction, then you walk along the road of prayer and meditation.</p>

Eventually, we develop the capacity to say soulfully and sincerely, “Let Thy Will be done.” We ultimately feel that it is for a necessary experience that we have had a catastrophe in the family. After all, God loves the child whom we have lost infinitely more than we do. When we love God, we realise that His capacity for Love is infinitely greater than ours. You are God’s child, and the son whom you have lost is also God’s child. The Supreme Father always knows what is best for each individual.</p>
<p><em>Steve Powers:</em> But don’t you still suffer the loss on a human level?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We do not suffer very much if our identification and oneness with God is complete. On the strength of our oneness we shall feel that for a few years God gave us another person to stay with us, and now he is needed somewhere else. We will suffer very little if our oneness is complete. But if we have established only a little oneness with God, then we shall suffer miserably on the human level.</p>

<h2>Question: What is the best way to be in a divine consciousness when we are working very hard?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to remain in a divine consciousness is to stop what you are doing for three minutes every hour. Each hour be alone for three minutes. At the end of each hour, no matter what is happening, for three minutes be alone and meditate. These three minutes will have tremendous power. If you can meditate for three minutes and get peace, light and confidence, then for an hour you can easily retain these qualities. You can be inside a room or in the street, but nobody should be with you or around you when you meditate. That will be the best way to remain in a divine consciousness during your work.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between determination and will-power?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between determination and will-power?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> With will-power we realise God. With determination we can perhaps win an outer race. Determination comes from the vital or the mind. Will-power comes from the central being. Will-power is infinitely more powerful than determination. If you use determination, then immediately it may be followed by frustration. But if you use will-power, then all around that will-power and inside that will-power you will see God’s Compassion. Once you use will-power, even for two minutes or five minutes, you get tremendous Compassion, boundless Compassion, from Above, and this Compassion is nothing other than divine Light. On the physical, vital and mental planes we use determination. On the psychic and soul’s plane we use will-power.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people use only the word ‘will’, but I like to use the term ‘will-power’, because there is no difference between inner will and power. When I say ‘will’, I see a seed, and when I say ‘power’, I see a tree. If we say ‘power’ without using ‘will’, that power can be vital, destructive power. Power in itself does not have to be undivine, but immediately vital power may come forward. But if I say ‘will-power’, then I know that it is something divine. So I feel it is good to use ‘will-power’ instead of just ‘will’.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we get will-power from determination?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we get will-power from determination?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First a child learns how to crawl. Then he can walk, and eventually he can run the fastest. While the child is at the crawling stage, he never thinks of running the fastest. It is impossible for him. But through a natural process he grows up, and eventually he starts running. By natural, continuous progress he gets more and more capacity until he is in a position to run. Similarly, if you have determination and you continue to make inner progress, then one day you will be able to develop will-power.</p>
<p>The best way to develop will-power is through union with God’s Will. Daily there may be many unpleasant happenings in your life. If you can accept them cheerfully, then you can increase your will-power. Again, you can increase your will-power by not being affected by the results of your actions. If something takes place, always try to see the positive side of the story. Suppose you are walking along the street and somebody snatches away your wallet. With your determination you will try to chase him, which is absolutely right on the outer plane. But at the same time, on the inner plane you can offer your gratitude to God that this thief has only snatched away your money, whereas he could have pushed you into the path of a car or stabbed you. If you can always offer this cheerful attitude, then you will develop will-power. You tell God, “Because of Your Love and Compassion for me, only this much has happened. It could have been infinitely worse.”</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> By your example. As soon as others see you, they have to see divinity floating in your eyes, in your face. That is the best way to inspire them. When they look at you, immediately they should be able to see the difference between their face and your face, between their heart and your heart. Your own face, your own heart, your own life is the example. As soon as you see a good person’s face, you are inspired. As soon as others see your face, your face will show the light that you have and the kind of spiritual life that you lead. If they are interested in the spiritual life, then as soon as they see your face, they can see that you are leading a spiritual life, and immediately they will try to lead a better life, like yours.</p>
