<p>When I was at nine and a half miles, it started raining so heavily! Everybody was miserable. After I had made the turn and was coming back — at around sixteen miles — I saw a middle-aged man coming from the other direction. He had only run thirteen and a half miles and had not yet made the turn.</p>
<p>He was a perfect gentleman, cleanly shaven and nice looking. He said to me, "You are a gentleman and I am a gentleman. So you don't mind." Then he turned around and joined me. He had only run thirteen and a half miles, but now he was running with me at sixteen miles. I said, "Wonderful!"</p>
<p>At first he was running with me, but after fifty metres he started walking.</p>

<p>One fellow who was running near me had five grandmothers. At one point he went off the course and kissed an old lady who was giving out water and oranges. He said to her, "I am okay, Grandmother." The "grandmother" was so happy. Like that, five times during the race he went out and kissed a grandmother. Then the grandmother would be so happy.</p>

<p>One runner who was doing his first marathon had been told never to stop while drinking water. This is what he learned from the elite runners. When he took a cup of ERG, half went into his eyes and half into his mouth and ears. Then he was apologising to the people who were around him. It came out in an article afterwards.</p>

<p>Every mile Savyasachi would come to give me something to drink. He would come either at the end of the mile or somewhere in the middle of it — wherever he could bring the car.</p>
<p>Many people were running on the sidewalk, so that the trees would protect them from the heavy rain. But I didn't like the leaves on the sidewalk and also I was afraid I would step in a puddle. At least on the street I could see where I was running.</p>
<p>At seventeen miles I found a friend. A young man, about thirty years old, was driving by in a car. He said to me, "I want to drive with you."</p>
<p>I said, "Fine!"</p>
<p>Whenever I would walk, he would stop the car and wait for me. He was following me and encouraging me, saying, "Yes, you can make it."</p>
<p>After driving with me for one mile the man said to me, "My name is Mark. What is your name?"</p>
<p>I said, "Chinmoy."</p>
<p>Mark said, "Come into the car. I will take you secretly a few miles ahead and nobody will know."</p>
<p>I said, "I can't do that."</p>
<p>He said, "You are a nice gentleman. Good luck."</p>

<p>When old ladies go ahead of you, you say, "O Lord, You have destroyed my pride. What else will You do?"</p>
<p>Then later, when a sixty-year-old lady starts passing you, you say, "O Lord, You have left some competitive spirit in me still."</p>
<p>I was trying to keep up with a sixty-year-old lady who was passing me, but her strides were so short that I couldn't run with her. Finally, after five hundred metres, I stopped, and she went away with her shorter than the shortest strides.</p>

<p>From eleven to thirteen miles, I practically walked the whole way because I saw that walking was far better than running. At twenty miles I said, "I am not going on. I am not running one more mile!"</p>
<p>Then Saraswati came, and for the last six miles she walked in front of me. While I was walking, I saw that people who were running were going slower than I was. I was walking, but I was passing people who were running! Some of them looked like real athletes — very strong. Some were getting cramps, and some were lying under the trees, giving up.</p>
<p>After nine miles, at least four or five hundred people went ahead of me. But after twenty-two or twenty-three miles, I was doing the passing. I passed at least twenty people that way. I knew that I was not going to get a cramp if I ran, but my speed was so bad that it was faster to walk.</p>

<p>The last three hundred metres of the marathon were in the stadium. You did not even have to run around the whole track — just three hundred metres. I said, "For God's sake, let me run."</p>
<p>But when I tried to take one step running, there was no power inside my lungs. I had no strength. Walking was far better.</p>

<p>When I finished the marathon, the person who took off my number said to me, "Super!" He was saying that because we were so brave to finish.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we drove three miles back along the course to see the people who were still running. We saw at least twenty people still running! I had walked quite a lot, so what kind of speed could they have had?</p>
<p>At the end some people collapsed from the heat. Bill Rodgers saw one person at the finish and said, "Major dehydration!"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Suffering</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Suffering" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In some ways the Orange Bowl Marathon was worse than the Greek marathon. In Greece I didn't suffer until after seven or eight miles. Here I began suffering after two miles. Then for six or seven miles it was drizzling, and for six or seven miles it was raining heavily. The newspaper said it was raining cats and dogs. Sometimes you could not even see anything in front of you because of the rain. The first two miles I wore a hat. Then it was so hot that I took it off and gave it to Savyasachi. "I will manage without it," I said. Then when it started raining so heavily, I didn't have the heart to put it back on.</p>
<p>Once while I was walking, an old man who was helping at one of the water stations put a sponge on my head and then brought it down along my spinal column. Such relief! He didn't say a word. He just moved the sponge from my head down my spine. He knew how much we were suffering. Everybody looked so pitiful.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The future of the marathon</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The future of the marathon" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Often people say they will never run a marathon again. During or after the race they say that this is their last marathon. Then after four days they start thinking about their next marathon.</p>
<p>In ten or twenty years, people will regard the marathon the way we regard a ten-mile race today. People will consider forty miles or seventy miles or a hundred miles as long distance. Long distances will be as popular as the marathon is today. People will pay more attention to fifty-milers and hundred-milers.</p>
<p>Now people are doing so well in the marathon. In four or five years the best runners will run the marathon in under two hours. In twenty or thirty years people will run at a five-minute pace for fifty or a hundred miles. The children of people who are running the marathon now will run at the present marathon pace for thirty or forty miles, and then even farther. They will have such stamina. Sports are like that. Roger Bannister's four-minute-mile record lasted for years. Then the hundred-metre record stayed for years. Jesse Owens' long-jump record stayed for twenty years before it was broken by Bob Beamon. But ultimately all records are broken.</p>

<p>The morning after the marathon, I ran seven miles. That shows what kind of marathon I ran! I hardly had to walk forty metres. There was no humidity, and I didn't even have to drink. During the marathon sometimes I drank every eight hundred metres!</p>
<p>After five and a half miles I started walking. At that time a man ran by me and said to me, "No walking, no walking!"</p>
<p>Then I started running again, and after half a mile, I saw the same gentleman, walking. I said to him, "It is not good to walk."</p>
<p>He said to me, "But while I was running, I was running faster than you are running!"</p>
<p>So we were two jokers.</p>

<p>While I was in Florida for the marathon, I went into a bookstore with Savyasachi. When I opened up a sports book, what did I see? The face of the little girl who lives next door to me in New York. Her soul appeared right in front of the page, looking at me. I said, "What is she doing here?"</p>
<p>Then when I came back to New York, as we were driving up to my house, she came out of her house and stood looking at me, not saying anything.</p>
<p>In Florida her soul came for my blessings, although outwardly I never talk to her.</p>

<p>This morning I was running on Hillside Avenue at about ten o'clock. Just before I reached Parsons Boulevard, I saw several policemen with guns and walkie-talkies. Somebody had told them that a man on the street had a gun. For one man who was reported seen near that place, how many policemen were there!</p>
<p>As soon as I ran by, a black man who was smoking said to me, "Shrai, Shrai, you are here? You invited me to come to a concert of yours, but I could not come. Can I have an interview with you?" He even wanted to shake hands with me. Four or five Puerto Rican children nearby started saying, "Sri, Sri." Then one of the policemen looked at me and gave me a big smile.</p>

<p>At one point X was singing, "I am a member of the New York Road Runners Club." Fred Lebow's name was there in the song.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Canadians were singing my songs in French. At one point they were singing "O Good Canada's Oneness-Heart." Then my America songs I heard. One group was singing songs from "Transcendence-Perfection." One group only sang "Phule phule." It went on and on. Their repertoire was very limited.</p>
<p>Some groups had songbooks and were singing the old songs that we never sing nowadays. O God, some songs I knew were mine, but they were so unfamiliar to me. Some of them were songs I had composed eight or ten years ago for the first group of non-singers, "Eternity's Patience-Pride." I wrote those songs for the absolute beginners. The people singing them as I ran had not even been my disciples at that time. They were singing songs like "Milbena bhai milbena." When I heard that song, I couldn't believe that someone was singing it after so many years.</p>
