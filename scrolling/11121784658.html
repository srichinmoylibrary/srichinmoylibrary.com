<p>As I was walking on the beach this morning, I saw that six or seven Balinese men had gathered to play volleyball. When I walked by, the leader came up to me, folded his hands, and said, "Amitabha, Amitabha!" I said also, "Amitabha, Amitabha!" Then, in case I did not understand, the man told me, "Lord Buddha, Lord Buddha." Soon after that, a Balinese lady saw me and said, "Wise man, wise man."</p>

<p>When I went out running this morning, I said, "At least there will be nothing open, so I do not have to take money." So I put only 10,000 rupiah in my pocket. I was walking and meditating. All of a sudden, I saw a little shop there in the sand. When I enquired, the man said that everything was fixed price. The Balinese man who owned the little shop spoke English. I wanted to buy three or four things. Each time he said that something was a fixed price, I bargained with him. Finally, when I said, "All right, then I will not buy it," he lowered the price. This happened with each item. So I took 10,000 rupiah with me and I spent it all.</p>

<p>While I was walking on the beach this morning, I saw a pier, ending in a circle over the water. So I went out on the pier. I liked it very much. There was water all around and I was meditating. At one point I was thinking of Niriha. She should have been there to catch it on video. Quite often she has excellent intuition, but this morning it was not working.</p>

<p>Am I too slow or is it true that the green light does not last as long as the red light? This morning I was on Main Street. I was waiting and waiting for the red light to turn green. As soon as the green light came, I started walking. But before I had crossed half of the road, it started blinking.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The vibration of Savitri&#039;s soul</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The vibration of Savitri&#039;s soul" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once Savitri, the leader of our Vancouver Centre, fell down on one of my running courses and her soul went up into a particular tree. Then I put the soul back into the body. This happened on my old course at two miles and 1,300 metres. The mark is in Flushing Meadow Park near the highway, not near the lake. At that point, there are a few trees. Now, whenever I pass by that place, immediately I feel the vibration and Savitri's soul comes to me. Not even a single time do I pass the tree and the tree does not respond, because the soul left the body and it was in the tree. Sometimes, when souls leave the body, they do not want to come back. But when there is pressure, the soul does come back. Had Savitri's soul left the body at that time, it would have been an untimely death. That is why I compelled the soul to come back. Then Savitri stayed on earth for at least ten or twelve years more. Her soul got the opportunity to love God more and manifest Him more. So that tree is always so grateful to me.</p>

<p>Usually I see quite a few people in the street when I run. This morning I did not even see Sulochana on her famous block. Then I saw Nemi's car. Nemi was probably going to our Runners are Smilers race. Quite a few cars were having problems because of the snow. It was very dangerous. Some buses were stuck at the top of 150th Street. They did not dare to go down 150th Street hill!</p>

<p>The great runner Calvin Smith needs no introduction. Today he was at Annam Brahma restaurant for forty-five minutes. Instead of allowing the disciples to ask him a volley of questions, I asked him one question after the other. I was very pleased to see him. He is simplicity incarnate. All his childlike qualities deeply impressed me and the disciples who were present. Strangely enough, some of his pictures are quite similar to mine when I was younger, and I also felt in him the same type of shyness that I had when I first came to America.</p>

<p>Our prayer for Calvin Smith was fruitful. He stood third in his race in New York and also that was his best timing for the entire year. Usually he does not do well in just 50 or 60 metres. So God listened to our prayers. Bhashwar has taken a very nice picture of Calvin Smith. Look at his innocent smile — how simple and childlike it is! His whole face radiates with his simplicity-smile. His smile comes spontaneously.</p>

<p>In Chico I ran my first marathon. I will never forget my very first attempt. One San Francisco girl instigated me or inspired me to run. During the marathon, I made a gesture and this girl thought I was getting a heart attack. Garima came and said, "O Guru, Guru!" I said, "I am not getting a heart attack," but they thought I was getting one. As a matter of fact, I enjoyed the marathon. This year I wanted to do Chico again. My hope and promise never die. They are always immortal in the loving hearts of my spiritual children. There are many, many things I may not be able to perform on the physical plane, as old age is shattering the body's physical capacity. But my spiritual children are still young, physically young, and I do want them to remain spiritually young. Your loving feeling of oneness I most deeply appreciate and admire. So this year I could not go because my legs are not allowing me to walk or run. But Garima is so kind. She wanted to pay for Savita to run. She bought the ticket plus Savita was ready. I said, "No, I do not want Savita to go. Then she will defeat my timing." I am so clever!</p>

<p>As I ran past my 700-metre mark, I saw a middle-aged man riding a bicycle. He had his helmet on. He stopped cycling and came up to me and said, in Bengali, "Keman ache?" which means, "How are you?" I said, "Bhalo, bhalo." I thought that perhaps he knew only one phrase, so I added in English, "Good morning!" Then, still in Bengali, he said, "Suprabhat," which means good morning in Bengali. He looked like an American. How did he know Bengali? Then I smiled and went away. This happened on 150th Street and 84th Drive. He lives there. He spoke to me in pure Bengali and I had to tell him good morning in English!</p>

<p>Among the non-disciples in the Ultra Trio Race, the best is Tom Klein. Two or three times, he grabbed me and said how grateful he is for this kind of opportunity to run and also to have such excellent organisation. Again and again he has told me. With other runners, we have to please them in millions of ways because quite often they feel they are doing us a big favour. We have to appreciate and adore them because they have come. But Tom Klein was deeply appreciating our activities. This time he has appreciated us and felt our sacrifice the most.</p>
