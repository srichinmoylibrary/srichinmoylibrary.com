<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two reasons why I am always with you when you are in trouble. The first reason, which is absolutely true, is that your trouble is my trouble. The second reason is that as a gardener picks a flower from a tree and plants it in the ground, even so I picked you from the soul’s world and brought you into your parent’s family and into our spiritual path. So even before you came to earth, when you were in the soul’s world, my responsibility started. Now you are in the physical world but my responsibility in regard to your existence started in the soul’s world. Therefore I will always be in your trouble and I will always be in your progress, success, achievement and fulfilment.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two ways. One way is to conquer them through a superior power, an infinitely superior power, which is the soul’s poise. The other way is to be on the same footing and to accept the challenge. If they criticise you because you are following a spiritual path, then you have every right to tell them that you are doing what you feel is best for yourself. Let them be satisfied with what they have; you will be satisfied with what you have. Whatever they feel best, they are doing; and whatever you feel best, you are doing. So in this way you can come to the same level and fight it out. But if you acquire Peace, Light and Bliss in considerable measure, then you go very high and you see that you have infinitely more power than the person who is talking to you with a bitter tongue. If you feel that you have established something solid, something concrete, then you can stay with your own height. You look at the person who is criticising you and you see that he is like an ant, like a tiny insect. But if you can’t do that, then the best thing is to be on his plane. Don’t box with him, but tell him to be satisfied with what he feels is best and you remain satisfied with what you feel is best.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because you sleep more than I do. In the outer life I don’t sleep, and also in the inner world I don’t sleep. Spiritual Masters have very little rest in the inner world. When you become an expert in something you know many, many things. Now what do I know about a car? A mechanic will know more because he is an expert on cars. You people are just like cars. You have an expert and he will take care of you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I conquer sleep?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I conquer sleep?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your body needs six or seven or eight or ten hours of sleep a night. If you try to conquer sleep when your body needs sleep, you will become insane. If you sleep when the body does not need sleep, then you are doing something wrong. Right now the body needs seven hours of sleep. If the body needs seven hours sleep and you don’t give your body rest for seven hours, then you are committing a crime. You are going from one extreme to another extreme. After a few years when you are far advanced spiritually and you don’t need sleep, then it will be a different matter. At that time if you don’t need sleep and you do sleep, then it will be wrong for you. But right now your body needs sleep. What the body needs you have to give. Sleep helps considerably to take all anxieties and worries away so that you can have a fresh start the following day. Right now, don’t try to conquer sleep.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Should seven hours be the maximum?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Should seven hours be the maximum?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For the disciples I always say seven hours, but again, every rule admits of exception. If somebody is used to sleeping for eleven hours, I don’t dare to tell that person to immediately start sleeping for only seven hours. That person should gradually reduce his sleep to ten hours, then to nine hours, eight hours and finally seven hours. If you have been sleeping eight or nine hours, then try to make it seven hours. But if you have been sleeping for eleven hours, then try to reduce it gradually.</p>
<p>Again, you see that some people who do selfless service sleep five hours a night, or not even that much, because necessity knows no law. There is one disciple who comes to the printing press early in the morning and works until twelve o’clock or one o’clock at night. Then again in the morning she has to come back. There are some disciples who get five or six hours sleep a night. There are some disciples who are constantly working for me, for the Supreme in me, who never get more than six hours sleep. Some of the boys and girls who work twenty-four hours a day for me conquer sleep automatically, just as I conquer sleep, because the opportunity is afforded to them. They don’t get even six hours sleep because I give them work twenty-four hours a day. But in your case right now you should get seven hours of sleep, otherwise it will tell upon your health.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In ordinary sleep you are tired, exhausted. But if you can stay in Yogic sleep, that is not ordinary sleep. It is soundless sleep. But “soundless” is a very mild word. In that sleep, you do not have any dream, you do not have any desire, you do not have any conflict with the finite. Only you remain in the infinite. Your consciousness stays in Infinity and Eternity. So in this kind of sleep, you do make the fastest progress. It is not sleep but conscious aspiration that will help you. Just by sleeping many hours a day, if you feel that you will get realisation, then you are sadly mistaken.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do we receive anything from you if we fall asleep during meditation, besides a scolding, of course?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do we receive anything from you if we fall asleep during meditation, besides a scolding, of course?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are right; I sometimes scold you if you fall asleep. Again, I am giving you a deeper philosophy. Sometimes when you fall asleep, it happens that it really helps you receive from me. Occasionally, you come to meditation agitated or angry with some disciples or with me. When you are angry with me, you are consciously hurting me. Instead of surrendering, you are only striking me inwardly again and again. If you get tired of doing this and you fall asleep, at that time what actually happens is that consciously or unconsciously you surrender to me and you give up the fight. At that time I am in a position to place you on my shoulder, and carry you towards your destination and show you light.</p>
<p>You are like a child who is angry with his mother. He goes on throwing dolls, toys and anything that he finds, and then finally he becomes tired. When he is totally exhausted, the mother can carry him anywhere she likes. So when you are angry with me, it is better to fall asleep during meditation, instead of throwing your anger and depression and other negative forces into me. If you fall asleep, then at that time I will lift you and place you on my shoulder. Whatever you have and whatever you are will all be on my shoulder. So at that time, sleep is helpful.</p>
<p>But if you come to me with devotion, love, aspiration and intensity, then it is a bad thing to fall asleep. At that time if you consciously give me all the good qualities that you have, the father and son or father and daughter become one and we become stronger. I deal with the infinite Light and Bliss, but the very fact that you are giving me something very good and divine immediately adds to your own capacity. If we have to fight against ignorance the tiger, since you are taking my side and I am taking your side, it becomes very easy. So, when you have come with aspiration, it is really harmful for you to sleep, harmful in the sense that if you come with aspiration then you can really be of great help to the Master. But if you don’t come with aspiration, if you come with agitation, anger or depression, then the best thing is to fall asleep.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to enter into my inner elevator, you have to develop the power of imagination. Imagination is of paramount importance. Scientists, poets — not to speak of Yogis — have all come to realise that imagination is the precursor of reality. What we call imagination is nothing short of reality in some other plane of consciousness. So when you meditate, try to imagine that I bring for you an inner elevator that climbs up fast, faster, fastest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One of my inner beings will definitely know about it. Without my approval or without the assistance of one of my inner beings, my disciples will not get any experiences. My physical mind may not be aware of all of them, but this is not necessary. Again, I wish to say that if you have mystical experiences, it does not necessarily mean that you are one step further towards God-realisation. I always say that there are two roads that lead to the destination. One road is full of trees and beautiful flowers, and the other road is extremely barren, but it does bring the seeker to the destination. It depends on the individual.</p>
<p>An individual will make progress on the road which inspires him to reach his destination. One may prefer the road which is full of trees, flowers and beautiful scenery. He will say, “The road is inspiring me; that is why it will be very easy for me to reach the Goal, and the Goal will be much more beautiful, more meaningful.” Another will say, “What shall I do with these flowers and trees? I may become totally enamoured of their beauty and then I may be satisfied here and not go farther. Let me walk along the road that does not have anything to tempt me or fascinate me. If the road is narrow or if the road is barren, it is a great blessing because then the road will not tempt me.”</p>
<p>Mystical experiences are absolutely nothing in comparison to the highest divine realisation. But again, here one seeker says, “If I get a morsel of food, then only can I look forward to a big feast.” The other one will say, “No, I don’t need anything. Either I will get the full meal or I don’t want anything to eat.” So in this way two roads ultimately reach the same destination. It is the individual seeker who has to make the choice. Again, if you have any real higher experiences, my inner beings will definitely know, for they come from one of my inner beings. This is only for my disciples. Others can get mystical experiences through other sources.</p>

<h2>Question: Isn’t it beneath your dignity to put up with the behaviour of some of your disciples?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, nothing is beneath my dignity. That is the trouble. By becoming one with God’s Will, I cannot say that anything is beneath my dignity. Impossible! Since God is inside everyone and everything, I also have to serve Him everywhere and in everyone.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have to stay with somebody who is very undivine. I am caught inside his ignorance. Here I am dancing. But I can’t say it is beneath my dignity. Only I made a mistake, a bad mistake, when I accepted that particular person as my disciple.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we have less competition and more harmony among the disciples?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we have less competition and more harmony among the disciples?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When there is a feeling of oneness, there can be no competition. However, you have to know that competition can serve a purpose. Once a year we have competition at our Sports Day. We do it for physical fitness. This competition will inspire you to get up in the morning at 5:30 or 6:00 and go to the playground. Otherwise you make friends with sleep and enjoy the affection and love of death and nothing more. The value of competition is that you will try to transcend your capacity. If you lose to somebody after trying your best, it is absolutely immaterial. But if you don’t make progress even here on the physical plane, then you won’t try to make progress on the spiritual plane. At that time you will say, “I get up at 7:00 or 8:00 and then once in a blue moon I meditate. Who is going to see?” If you are sincere about making progress on the spiritual plane, then you can start your sincerity with the physical plane. Then the progress you make will spread to the mind and to the heart.</p>
<p>I wish to say that there is nothing wrong with a competitive spirit, provided it is competitive in a good sense. You are competing with yourself. Only there have to be some rules and regulations; there should be some discipline. You and somebody else cannot throw the javelin at the same time, so you will throw it right after him. You may throw much farther than him, but you will be able to see your progress and he will be able to see his progress. When we give prizes, we give to those who have done the best according to the rules and regulations. Actually the prize has no value. Here there are many people who cannot run. Even if you come in last in the race, do you think that I will have less love for you than for somebody who can run the fastest? Not at all. Only you have to know that it is a matter of oneness. Your right hand may throw much farther than your left hand, but you don’t cut off your left hand and say that it is useless for that reason. You need both hands. If you have no left hand then you will see how odd you will look and how much difficulty you will have.</p>
<p>One particular lady is doing so much dedicated service by making shorts for the disciples and so many clothes for me. Her dedicated service means all her affection, love and gratitude. That is her qualification. Again, someone is qualified for running but he may not practise at all. He may say, “I stood first for four years. Now if I lose, no harm; nothing will happen.” At that time his consciousness will descend because he is making friends with lethargy and wrong forces. So if you have capacity in any field, you have to cultivate it. Here it is only a matter of opportunity; there is no competition. It is all the feeling of oneness. Everyone is doing his job.</p>
<p>Those who lose to you in sports competition are your brothers and those who beat you are also your brothers. So you have to know that the feeling of oneness removes the feeling of competition. If someone runs slower than you, then you should feel that he is your weaker part. And if somebody is faster, then you can feel that he is your stronger part. In that way there can be no sense of competition. It will be all oneness.</p>
<p>We have to offer the result of competition at the Feet of the Supreme. If you throw the shot or the discus or the javelin and you stand last, then you have to feel that that is what the Supreme wants from you. You are taking exercise for your own progress, for your physical fitness. It is necessary. The divine in us, the Supreme in us has to be manifested here on earth through the body, through the physical consciousness. Otherwise we could have remained in Heaven. In Heaven there is no manifestation. Manifestation takes place only on earth.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, are we aware that we are attacking you in the inner life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, are we aware that we are attacking you in the inner life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Oh yes, many times people are aware; again, many times they are not. But most of the time people are aware when they attack me. The human mind is like that. This moment I am your best friend, the next moment I can be your worst enemy. In five minutes time, somebody can be your best friend and, if you have a fight, he can become your worst enemy. During the day, how many times do I become the best friend and the worst enemy of the disciples? Suppose I deprive somebody of something and give it to somebody else. The person who gets it immediately says, “Oh, he has fulfilled my desire just to keep me quiet. He has given me a piece of candy so that he can give real divine Nectar to so-and-so.” And the one that did not get it at all feels, “Oh, all the Master ever gives me is talk.” But he has to know that if today he gets one cent, then tomorrow he will get five cents and the following day he may get a dollar. It is like that.</p>
<p>If you get, I am bad; if you don’t get, I am also bad. There is no way I can make the disciple feel that it is for his own good that I am giving him something or that I am not giving him something. How people can misunderstand. They feel that if Guru does not give something to them, it is proof that he does not care. They say, “Since I have not got anything today, I must not expect anything more from him in the future.” This is their logic. Only when one has made unconditional surrender will one see that everything I do is for his own good.</p>
<p>I find it so difficult to smile at people sometimes. Immediately they ascribe some motive to it. Sometimes disciples feel that if I smile at them, then it means that I want something from them. I am in a very good mood, so I smile. But someone immediately thinks, “Oh, I have so much money, and he wants to have a very large share. That is why he has given me a smile.”</p>
<p>It has happened many, many times that I am afraid to smile at certain individuals because if I smile, it is misunderstood. If I smile, immediately you think that I am expecting something from you in return. Then, if I don’t smile, you think that I am displeased or that I am not smiling because you have not given me anything. But whether you have pleased me more or not may have nothing to do with it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it true that almost all spiritual figures are doubted even by those who are close to them?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it true that almost all spiritual figures are doubted even by those who are close to them?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some of you may at times doubt me, but this kind of unbelief or disbelief all spiritual Masters have gone through; I am not the exception. As soon as a Master takes the human body, he is subject to others’ doubt. No matter who comes into the world with tremendous occult power and spiritual power, it is like this. Sri Krishna had four or five disciples who felt he was a God-realised person; but others doubted him and said many things against him. It was the same with Sri Ramakrishna and the Buddha.</p>
<p>I have a human body with eyes, a nose, arms, hands, legs, everything, but I can do quite a few things which most human beings cannot do. Tomorrow you will also be able to do these things, but I can’t blame you for doubting my spiritual capacity because this is human nature. The spiritual Master is always misunderstood. Only when he leaves the body is he worshipped and adored. While in the body, he is a victim to criticism even by his dear ones. The Upanishads say about the spiritual Master: “He is this and that, and again he is beyond both. This moment he is a child, the next moment he is a grandfather and the next moment he is the transcendental soul.”</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When people think of the Christ Consciousness, I do not know which consciousness they are thinking of. But they are not reaching or realising the Christ Consciousness; they are realising the Son consciousness. The Son consciousness means infinite joy, infinite love, infinite compassion and infinite oneness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you work beyond your capacity, at that time you are tired mentally and vitally. Then if you continue to work just for the sake of extra hours, you will ruin everything. So the best thing is to stop. Work devotedly, soulfully, for three hours or five hours or seven hours, and then give up. Otherwise, what is the use of going on and on and making mistakes? When your concentration falls and you get tired, this is the time to give up. Then, try to develop receptivity. Pray and meditate so that you can work for a few hours more; try to develop the capacity to work more.</p>
