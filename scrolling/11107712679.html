<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. Yoga is not only a cure, but it is the <em>only</em> cure to modern life's restlessness and nervousness. Yoga is conscious, real oneness with God. God is all Bliss, all Light, all Peace. If one has a free access to God, then naturally he will have God's qualities, which are Divinity, infinite Power, infinite Love.</p>
<p>The whole world is captured by restlessness and nervousness. The very aim of practising Yoga is to have peace, peace of mind. When one acquires peace of mind, automatically one possesses indomitable inner strength. How can nervousness enter into a person when he is surcharged with inner strength? There can be no restlessness, no nervousness. Nervousness comes when you take away a part from the whole. Fear comes when you separate something from the whole. God is the whole. God is the Absolute. When you practise Yoga, you touch the Absolute and enter into the Absolute; you do not remain a separate portion of the whole. When you enter into the absolute whole, there is all strength, all power; there is no fear. In Yoga you can cure all nervousness and all restlessness and all imperfection.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What benefits can be obtained from the practice of Yoga?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What benefits can be obtained from the practice of Yoga?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All kinds of benefits can be obtained from Yoga. If we practise Yoga for material gain, material wealth and material prosperity, Yoga will give these very things to us. But we have to know what we actually want. If we want something permanent and everlasting, something fulfilling and transforming which will give us constant joy, delight and a sense of perfection, then this purpose of practising Yoga is absolutely right and correct. Otherwise, if we want only material wealth, we will get it by praying to God: "God, I need money, I want wealth, I want name and fame." God will give us these things, for God is everything. He fulfils all our wishes. But satisfaction, constant satisfaction, eternal joy, we will never derive from these wishes.</p>
<p>If we feel that these are the benefits we need from Yoga — name, fame, wealth, satisfaction in showing the world how great we are — we will get them because Yoga is union with God. If we pray to God for this kind of benefit, God will be unified with us in this lower plane of consciousness. But if we want to realise God in the highest plane of consciousness where it is all Light, Delight, Perfection and Truth, we must know that Yoga can give us that also; Yoga has the key. The highest Yoga can give us these benefits. It is all-pervading and all-fulfilling. Many things we can get from Yoga. Only we have to know if we are going to be satisfied with the lesser goal or if we want to reach the highest Goal. the Goal where Infinity, Eternity and Immortality dwell together.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can Yoga change my life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can Yoga change my life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly Yoga can change your life. What is life? Life is an institute. Yoga is research. When we accept Yoga, we become a research institute. When we research something, we enter into it and discover its truth. When we discover the Truth in ourselves, we feel that we have abundant capacity to do whatever we want to do with our life. This is the only way to change one's life.</p>
<p>Yoga is one's conscious oneness with the Highest. The Highest is always the Mightiest. When we have become one with the Mightiest, when we have the Omnipotent to help and guide us in our day-to-day life, then our life is bound to be transformed. Impurity is transformed into purity, doubt into faith, fear into courage, imperfection into perfection and finally death into Immortality.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Is there any way you can incorporate your spiritual life into your everyday life?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Naturally you can and you should incorporate your spiritual life into your everyday life, only you must do first things first. The spiritual life comes first. That is to say, if you pray or meditate early in the morning before you go to the office, before you enter into your earthly activities, you are doing the first thing first. If you do it the other way around, if in the morning you lead an ordinary life and then after say 11:00 a.m. or 12:00 noon you try to aspire, it becomes almost impossible.</p>
<p>You have to feel that the outer life is not to be discarded as a filthy rag. The outer life has its own value in our evolution. Only right now, it does not have as much light as the inner life. Since the inner life has light, naturally you will try to bring to the fore the light of the heart, the light of the soul. If you expect light from the physical body, the outer mind and the outer life, you will be frustrated because they do not have any light. If you concentrate on the inner life, on the inner heart and the soul, you can easily get abundant light and then you will see that the outer life and the inner life can easily march together. This is the only way you can integrate the inner and the outer life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What should be our attitude to the unaspiring world?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What should be our attitude to the unaspiring world?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We know that it is really difficult for us to make a little progress by ourselves in the spiritual life, in our inner life and in our outer life. So we have to have infinite patience in order to see a little transformation in human nature, that is to say in mankind as a whole. We must not lose patience. Just because our neighbours and friends are not following the spiritual life, it does not mean that we should give up. We have to know that there was a time, either in this incarnation or in past incarnations, when we were also perhaps of their type and perhaps worse. We have to try to help people with the idea that once upon a time we were also unaspiring, unspiritual, but then by somebody's Grace or with the help of some people on earth, we became spiritual. Now perhaps we are not conscious of who actually helped us. But there was someone who helped us in our spiritual journey, in our inner awakening. So we shall also try to inspire people. If one person gets inspiration from us, that is enough.</p>
<p>Gradually, gradually, the number of seekers will increase. Now night is ruling the world. But a day will come when Light will rule the world, because it is from Light that the world came into existence. Some people are conscious of the fact that Light exists, while others are not. Those who are unconscious will naturally take a long time to reach the Goal. Those who believe in Light will advance much faster toward the Goal.</p>
<p>After one has practised spiritual disciplines for twenty years or perhaps even several incarnations, he realises God. Spiritual achievement is sacrificed after one realises God. A God-realised soul sacrifices his achievement by coming down into the world of suffering in a human body to work for mankind. This very act of coming down into the world is a tremendous sacrifice if one looks at it from a human point of view. But from the spiritual point of view there is no sacrifice. Who is sacrificing for whom? God is constantly sacrificing Himself for us, in us and through us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How can I be a better human being if I do not think of the Source? Who makes me good? Who makes me better? Who makes me best? Somebody who is infinitely better than I am, and that is God. When the necessity arises from within, you can be a good human being; you can help other people. Now, who is supplying you with the inspiration and aspiration to help mankind? God. The moment you want to be a better human being, you have to offer your good qualities: your sincerity, your humility, your love for mankind. These good qualities come from only one being and that is God. If you want to give, first you have to receive from someone who has already in infinite measure. If you do not receive, how are you going to give? How is it possible?</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The purpose of life is to manifest the inner divinity. The purpose of life is to become a conscious instrument, a chosen instrument of God. The purpose of life is to manifest the highest Truth which we embody. First we have to see the Truth and feel the Truth. Then we have to reveal and manifest the Truth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One does not have to abandon the outer life. One has only to go deep within. Then one has to see how much of the outer life is really necessary in order to lead a spiritual life and achieve God-realisation. There are many silly, useless things which we do in the ordinary life and we have to discard them. Again, there are many things in the outer life which we call duty, soulful duty. But when we enter into the deepest spiritual life, at that time we have no duty. Before we reach that stage, we have to fulfil some earthly duties. But when it is a matter of choosing between the outer and inner life, we have to pay more attention to the inner life — then we will have solid joy, peace, love and power. Then whatever is unnecessary in the outer life we can transform. If we go to the extremes, if we stop talking to people, we will become mentally unbalanced. Outer balance is necessary; we cannot go to the extreme. But we have to know what is really necessary and what is not. Talking to people for hours on end — that kind of thing is unnecessary. But there are things that are of paramount importance in the outer life which we must accept. Things which have to be given up in the outer life we shall give up. We have to simplify our life. God is very simple; we are complex. Inside simplicity is purity; inside purity is divinity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a link or a bridge between the inner world and the outer world?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a link or a bridge between the inner world and the outer world?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there is a link between the inner world and the outer world. Now what actually happens is that we are not paying any attention to the inner world. Most of the time we are on the surface. We pay all attention to the outer world. We don't get five minutes to meditate or concentrate on our inner, real world. Twenty-four hours a day we are moving, talking, shouting and living in the hustle and bustle of the world.</p>
<p>Now a true spiritual seeker feels that there is a link between these two worlds. And something else he also feels. He feels that if we feed the inner world, then only can the outer world have its true meaning. The body is the outer world. Daily we feed the body three times without fail. We have been doing it and we shall keep on doing it until we breathe our last. But again, there is deep inside us a divine child called the soul. We don't get time to feed this child. To keep the body alive we eat, but to help the soul, to fulfil its divine Mission on earth, we have no time. Unless and until the soul, which is the conscious representative of God in us, is fulfilled, we can never be fulfilled in our outer life.</p>
<p>Now how do we make the connecting link? If we know the art of concentration, if we know the art of meditation, if we know the divine art of contemplation, easily and consciously we can united these two worlds. And to our widest surprise we shall see that the outer world which is now full of complexity, disharmony and so forth, is bound to be harmonious, simple, straightforward and genuine. The inner life has the capacity to simplify the complexities of the outer life. The inner world and the outer world must go together. Otherwise, what will happen? The inner life will have to wait for millennia to offer God's Truth to the world at large and the outer life will remain a barren desert for millennia.</p>
<p>There is definitely a link between these two worlds. We have to consciously feel this link and finally we have to touch and strengthen the link with our soul's determination and our body's dedicated service and willingness. Now the body listens to the mind when the mind says, "Go this way." The body goes, but the next moment the mind says, "No, no, no! That is the wrong way to take. Follow some other direction," and the body follows. In this way the body is caught by limitations. But far beyond the domain of the mind is the soul. This soul is flooded with light. Now if we consciously try to have a free access to the inner being, to the soul, then naturally the light of the soul will come to the fore and it will help us at every moment to deal with the tenebrous darkness in us and around us. And finally, we will see that either we have transformed darkness into light or we have come millions and millions of miles away from darkness and are bathing in the sea of infinite Light.</p>
<p>So if the physical body listens to the soul and not to the doubtful, doubting and sophisticated, complex, destructive, unaspiring mind, at every moment the link between the two worlds will be strengthened and one will complete the other. That is to say, the inner world will need the outer world as its chariot and the outer world will need the inner world as its charioteer. If there is a chariot without a charioteer, it is useless, for without a charioteer the chariot cannot move. Again, if there is a charioteer without a chariot, he is also useless. So both the charioteer and the chariot are necessary. They are of equal importance. Similarly, the outer life and the inner life are of equal importance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is the conflict that we are experiencing in our times a detour or a destructive force at work?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is the conflict that we are experiencing in our times a detour or a destructive force at work?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is neither a detour nor a destructive force in our fast-progressing age. In the first place, there is no such thing as destruction. In Indian philosophy, the three aspects of God are Brahma, the Creator; Vishnu, the Preserver; and Shiva, the Transformer. Very often Shiva is known as the Destroyer. But God does not destroy. Rather He transforms. Perfection can be achieved. For this perfection, we have to go deep within. We see that what takes place is an inner transformation of human ignorance and doubt. If you have doubt, the apparent destruction of this doubt is actually its transformation. Everything that does not help us to run toward our Goal will be transformed into something positive.</p>
<p>The root of all man's problems is ignorance. But do you destroy a man in his ignorance? No, you transform him. God does exactly this. God has promised that He will transform our doubt, fear and ignorance. In our philosophy, no evil or sin exists on earth. We think of these things as ignorance. What some call ignorance can never be lasting. Ignorance will be transformed into knowledge. Undoubtedly there are negative forces in us and around us, in the cosmos itself. The source of the negative forces is ignorance. Negative forces try to cause the destruction of our inner possibilities. The force that comes from the inconscient level inside us will try to destroy all our inner possibilities.</p>
<p>When a negative force speaks from inside you, it will say, "You cannot be God's chosen child. Impossible! You have done millions of things wrong." The negative force will tell you that you cannot become the perfect instrument of God and that you cannot grow into His very image. Only these two things the negative force can tell you.</p>
<p>Immediately you have to tell this force, "All right, I have done millions of things wrong, but that is none of your business. I am not taking shelter from you. I am not going to be under your protection, under your wings. I am under the protection of the omniscient and omnipotent Supreme." The positive force will immediately tell you, "Yes, you already are an instrument, chosen instrument of God. You are growing into the very image of God because God Himself is evolving in and through you. Unfortunately, you are not aware of it. That is why you are suffering. And poor God has to wait for your conscious awareness of who He is and who you are."</p>
<p>Right now we give the negative forces the chance to attack us. But if we don't give them the chance, then the negative forces have to remain thousands of miles away from us. If we constantly harbour good thoughts, pure thoughts, divine thoughts, then the negative forces can never stay in us. Each moment we are thinking either good thoughts or bad thoughts, divine thoughts or undivine thoughts. If we cherish a divine thought, then negative thoughts will not be able to enter into us because they know well that the moment they enter they will be suffocated. There is no room left for them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, human beings get immense pleasure in cherishing undivine thoughts. After cherishing a divine thought for five minutes, they find it necessary to invite an undivine thought. Who suffers from this practice? He who is conscious of his aspiration, never he who is spiritually asleep. For an unaspiring person there is no such thing as negative or positive thoughts. He cannot discriminate between what is negative and what is positive.</p>
<p>Every day you have to tell yourself, "I am evolving." At least for five minutes a day you have to exercise your positive thoughts, positive will, positive forces. You have to believe that in you the Truth is already embodied, in you the Truth will realise and reveal itself, in you and by you the Truth will be manifested. For five minutes a day everybody can do this. Then there can be no negative forces to disturb you or destroy your aspiration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the spiritual value of the earth?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the spiritual value of the earth?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Those who accept life, those who accept Mother Earth as something real, feel that they have a bounden duty to perform here. This duty is nothing other than conscious realisation of God. Unconscious awareness of God everybody has. If one is not an atheist, if one does believe in God, then he will have awareness or at least unconscious awareness of God. But a seeker becomes consciously aware of God's Presence. He meditates on God and gradually, gradually, his own consciousness develops to such an extent that he feels God's Presence constantly, everywhere. He feels that it is his bounden duty to reveal God's Presence, which he feels and which he sees with his own heart and his own eyes. Finally, he feels that he has to manifest his realisation of the highest Truth. This manifestation has to take place here on earth and nowhere else. Realisation of the highest Truth has to take place here and manifestation of the Truth, the highest Truth, the ultimate Truth has to take place here on earth.</p>
<p>A real seeker, a sincere seeker, is a divine hero. He has to fight against teeming darkness and he has to fulfil God's will here on earth. Otherwise, earth will remain earth and Heaven will remain Heaven. There will always be a yawning gulf between earth and Heaven. This earth of ours must be transformed into Heaven, into a place of Joy, Peace, Bliss and Delight.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sir, it is true that you do not reject matter?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sir, it is true that you do not reject matter?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Never! We never reject matter, because if we reject matter, then where are we going to establish the Kingdom of Heaven? Heaven is a state of consciousness and the Kingdom of Heaven must be established here on earth, not somewhere else.</p>
<p>We never reject anything. We accept it and then finally we transform it. In matter, spirit is hidden; but the aspiration of matter we are unable to feel or see right now. When we practise the spiritual life, we enter into matter and see that matter is spirit which has been asleep for some time. When we energise matter with our conscious aspiration, immediately matter becomes fully vibrant with energy. Here on earth the material life and the spiritual life must go together. Through meditation one can unite matter and spirit.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, there is no physical life on any of the planets. When it is a matter of this kind of existence that we have, it can be created only from the five elements that are found on earth.</p>
<p>There are beings on other planets, but the beings are not physical. They can assume different forms. If you project your physical and mental vision you will see them as human beings, but if you touch them you won't be able to feel their substance.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here on earth not only physical manifestation but all kinds of manifestation can take place. Heaven is perfect. You take rest there after you have played your game. You are tired; you have worked very hard on earth and now you can enjoy yourself. But in Heaven there is no realisation, no manifestation; and that is why we do not give importance to Heaven right now.</p>
<p>Only here on earth can we reveal the Highest. Here we have come into the physical form and here we have to aspire. Real achievement or manifestation we have to win. God is acting through the earth-consciousness. Now we have to know how far we want to go. If we want to climb up the tree and reach one branch, we can stay there or we can continue climbing up the tree. It depends on how far we want to go.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When you say that earth can easily be transformed into Heaven, do you mean physically as well?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When you say that earth can easily be transformed into Heaven, do you mean physically as well?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know what we mean by Heaven. Heaven does not mean a place with big houses, big palaces or estates. No! Heaven is in our mind. When we enjoy divine thoughts, we are in Heaven. When we cherish jealousy, lower vital thoughts or other undivine thoughts, we are in hell. Heaven and hell are states of consciousness.</p>
<p>What does each human being have? Consciousness. It is through consciousness that we see reality. When we pray, when we aspire, our finite consciousness becomes infinite; our so-called unaspiring consciousness becomes aspiring. This is Heaven. If we say that we all will become divine, this is certainly true. We will have a divine life, but that does not necessarily mean a physically immortal life. When we think of Heaven, we feel that it is immortal. The consciousness of Heaven is immortal. But very often we are mistaken. We feel that the physical will remain immortal, as Heaven is something immortal. But this physical body will live for sixty, eighty, one hundred, perhaps even two hundred years and then go.</p>
<p>The very conception of Heaven is something bright, luminous, delightful and, at the same time, immortal. But we have to know what is immortal in us. It is consciousness, the aspiring consciousness in us. When we say that earth will be transformed into Heaven, that means that anything that is within us or in the world which is now imperfect, obscure or unaspiring will be transformed eventually into perfection.</p>
