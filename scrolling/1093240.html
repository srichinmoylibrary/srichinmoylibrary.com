<h2>My brother's birth</h2>

<p>My brother Chitta was born on August 16th, 1914. Actually, he was born just after midnight of the fifteenth. In India, when somebody is born before the morning of the following day, we may give that person's birth date as the day before. To us, it is still part of the same day. But in Chitta's case, because August 15th is Sri Aurobindo's birthday, his birthday came to be celebrated on the 16th.</p>
<p>My brother was not an ordinary human being. He was a really great soul. In his previous incarnation, he had been Sri Ramakrishna's direct disciple. Then he came into our family and he became my strongest admirer. Only a great soul can recognise another great soul.</p>

<p>Before I was born, my brother Chitta had a number of dreams that my mother would give birth to a great soul. He was only sixteen years old at the time. When he told my mother, she said, "Perhaps Lord Krishna has sent his dearest devotee into our simple, humble and prayerful family."</p>
<p>But Chitta felt that the child she was carrying would be not just a devotee of Lord Krishna but a spiritual soul of the highest magnitude. That was my brother's prediction.</p>

<p>My brother Mantu is three years older than I am. God created this brother of mine without any desires. When he was born, five religious mendicants — we call them <em>baouls</em> — came to our place out of the blue and started singing in front of the house. <em>Baouls</em> are singers who have renounced the whole world, so they were singing songs of renunciation.</p>
<p>One of the members of the family went out to see them and they said, "The boy that has been born in this house today will renounce the whole world." They were so right. From the dawn of his life, my brother Mantu has not had any desire to possess anything and he has no desire for name and fame. Renunciation is in his backbone. In his previous incarnation, he was a very close disciple of Sri Chaitanya. He used to sing and dance in the street.</p>
<p>So these <em>baouls</em> appeared from nowhere to give the family that message. How did they know Mantu had taken birth on that day? They had inner knowledge and wisdom.</p>

<p>Once my brother Chitta was very, very sick, and a relative's son was also sick. He was a distant cousin on my maternal uncle's side. Both were in the Chittagong General Hospital and both cases were getting worse. My parents and my distant cousin's parents both went to see an occultist uncle of mine for help. His name was Tara Charan and he lived in a village that was five or six miles away from our village, Shakpura. This uncle was very spiritual and he was very fond of both my father and my mother. He had never paid any attention to studies; he did not even go to primary school. But, since he was a very great occultist, many people used to visit him when they were in trouble. If a cow was stolen, he would tell the owner to go to a particular village to find it. He used to exercise his occult power so often to please ordinary human beings.</p>
<p>From time to time, he lost his occult power and then he became the happiest person because people would stop bothering him. On other occasions, he used to deliberately say the wrong thing because people used to ask him all kinds of stupid and useless questions. But he was very kind to our family.</p>
<p>On this particular day, my cousin's parents arrived at the occultist's home earlier than my parents. They begged him to cure their son. My occultist uncle said to them, "God is also inside the doctors. I am so glad that your son is in the hospital and not at home. God will do everything correctly through the doctors. I always say that God has created doctors and God is inside doctors. So do not worry."</p>
<p>A few hours later, when my parents came to see the same occultist, he said to them, "Doctors are useless! What do the doctors know? They will never be able to cure your son. I am warning you not to let your son take any medicine. Here, I am giving you blessing ash from the Feet of my Mother Kali."</p>
<p>Then the occultist collected some ash from his shrine to Mother Kali. He was a most devoted worshipper of Mother Kali. He gave the ash to my mother and said, "Put this on your son's head and heart and then bring your son back home. Do not let him remain in the hospital."</p>
<p>Because of his great love and respect for my parents, the occultist helped my brother Chitta. My mother took the ash and put it on my brother's head and heart. My brother recovered but, unfortunately, in two or three days' time, our relative's son died. So Mother Kali's force saved my brother. God knows why, but the doctors' treatment could not cure our distant relative's son. This incident happened when I was two or three years old.</p>
<p>The presiding deity of our family is Mother Kali. She saved me <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and she saved my brother Chitta when we were near death.</p>

<p>My sister Lily once had a very serious type of typhoid fever. The village doctor, who was our family doctor, tried to cure her, but he was not having any success. My sister's condition was only getting worse.</p>
<p>My mother did not believe in doctors at all. According to her, prayer is the only answer. So she went to one of our relatives who used to be a doctor. He had given up his medical profession to become a sannyasin because he believed that traditional medicine was useless. He felt that one had to go to the real doctor and the only real doctor is God. My mother said, "Since he has had the realisation that the real doctor is God, and he has given up his medical practice, I will bring him to see my Rani."</p>
<p>When this relative came to our house, what did he do? He only placed his hand on my sister's head and started massaging it. The sickness left my sister. This is how the doctor who became a spiritual man was the only one to cure my sister, and not our family doctor.</p>

<p>My parents and the elder members of the family used to call my brother Chitta by the nickname Badoi. Badoi is a kind of cute, tiny bird that eats next to nothing. They thought that he would also eat next to nothing.</p>
<p>My brother Hriday's nickname was Khoka, which means "the darling of the family."</p>

<p>My sister Lily's nickname is Rani, which means "Queen." All her life, my sister has had the aura of a queen. When she walks, mixes with people, talks — in anything she does — she always maintains a very special kind of high dignity. She has a very soft oneness-heart also, but her queenly dignity is really something rare and unique.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My mother&#039;s prayer</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My mother&#039;s prayer" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once my mother was attending a theatrical performance — we call it <em>jatra</em> — by a village theatre troupe. My brother Chitta had taken my mother to watch the life of Sri Chaitanya, our great Bengali spiritual Master. At one point in the story, Sri Chaitanya's mother was shedding bitter tears because her son had taken a solemn vow to renounce the world and follow the spiritual life. My own mother, in the audience, became racked with sobs. My brother Chitta attempted to console her: "Mother, do not cry! Sri Chaitanya was disobedient to his mother, but we will never be so. We will remain with you always. We will not take renunciation. Have no fear! You will have grandchildren. We are all going to get married and have children. Do not cry, do not cry."</p>
<p>My mother said, "Fool, fool, fool! You do not understand why I am crying. It is because I want all my children, sons and daughters alike, to follow that path. I want all my children to remain unmarried and take <em>sannyasa</em> like Sri Chaitanya. I long for each one of them to be able to realise God in this life! Will God listen to my prayer?"</p>
<p>Such was my mother's inner cry. She was crying for her children to be spiritual, to renounce the world. My brother thought that she was identifying with Sri Chaitanya's mother, who did not want her son to go away.</p>

<p>When my father retired from his job as Chief Inspector of the Assam-Bengal railway line, he opened up a bank in the town. The name of the bank was Griha-Lakshmi, which means "House of Lakshmi." Since my eldest brother, Hriday, was at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Chitta went to work with my father.</p>
<p>At the bank, there were four or five rooms where my father and Chitta would stay during the week. On Friday evening, my father used to return home to our village, and then on Monday morning he would go back to work. Occasionally Chitta would also come home. They used to travel to and fro by ferry.</p>
<p>My brother Mantu and I had a private tutor in addition to our school lessons. The tutor used to give us lessons near a little temple that our family had for the goddess Lakshmi. Sometimes, on Monday morning, from the corner of my eye, I would see my father go to the temple for blessings and then start walking to the small dock to catch the ferry. Quite a few times I tried to follow him in secret. I used to watch him for two blocks and then run after him. I wanted to do it secretly, but my brother Mantu and my tutor used to shout at me, so I was always caught.</p>
<p>When my father saw me, I would start crying that I did not want to study. He would say, "How can I take you with me all the time? You have to go to school!" My brother Mantu would go and tell my mother what happened. She also felt that I should study, but she knew it was a hopeless case. So she would send a servant with extra clothes for me to wear in town during the week, since I would be wearing only a pair of shorts and a shirt.</p>
<p>Like this, many times I used to go to town instead of going to school. For seven or eight years, from time to time, I did not go to school. I would learn from Mantu and my tutor. Then, when the examinations came, I always stood either first or did very well. Of course, my teacher was also very, very indulgent to me because my father was a big shot in the village!</p>
<p>When I was in town, the whole day I would just roam. I would spend time with my brother Chitta at the bank or I would go riding with the messenger when he went out on errands. I also liked to go to the Karnaphuli River to see the boats and ships. Again, I was fascinated by thieves, so I used to go to the court to watch them.</p>
<p>I would either stay with my father and Chitta at the bank or with my maternal uncle. When I stayed at the bank, Chitta would cook for us. When I stayed with my maternal uncle, his wife would make delicious meals.</p>
<p>Often I would spend the whole week in the town. But if I insisted on staying in town for more than one week, either my mother would come to town herself, or she would send someone to bring me back. She did not like it when I stayed away too long.</p>
<p>I would always cry when I had to go back home. Why? I was very fond of my mother, but at home I had to study. Studying was too much, too much!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My dire horoscope prediction</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My dire horoscope prediction" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I was three years old, my horoscope was drawn up for the second time by the village astrologer. There he predicted that as an infant I would die in water. Everybody in the family was so shocked and upset. My cousin Pushpita, who is almost the same age as my brother Chitta, was the one to do something about it. That same day she took me to our nearest pond.</p>
<p>In Chittagong villages, we have a superstition that if you eat a live fish you will be able to learn to swim very easily. So, first of all, she gave me a tiny fish to swallow. I put it in my mouth and, with great difficulty, I managed to swallow it. I suffered a lot, but I really wanted to learn to swim, so I gladly obeyed her.</p>
<p>Then my cousin put me on her back and she began swimming around in the pond. I was holding onto her and moving my legs. In a few minutes I learnt how to do frog-kick. After we had practised for some time, we came out of the water. My cousin lifted me onto her shoulder and carried me home to my mother. She was so happy and delighted with my progress.</p>
<p>My poor mother had been very frightened by my horoscope prediction, but my cousin was able to convince her that I would not die if I was thrown into the water because I knew how to swim.</p>
<p>In spite of my cousin's sincere attempt to cancel my fate, my horoscope prediction was almost infallible.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The saviour boat from the depths of the unknown</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The saviour boat from the depths of the unknown" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I was a child of five, I was coming home from town one day with my elder brother Chitta, who was already an adult. We were riding back in a small ferry which was somewhat like a shuttle boat travelling from our village to the town and back again. It held six or eight passengers, including Chitta and myself. The ride ordinarily took an hour and a half, as the river, the Karnaphuli, is one of the widest and wildest rivers in Bengal.</p>
<p>On this particular day, the river was in its wildest fury. After a heavy downpour of rain, a storm continued to rage. In addition to this misfortune, the boat had sprung a large leak and it immediately started to sink. It was sailing in the heart of the wide river, at least three miles from either shore.</p>
<p>The passengers were panic-stricken. They, as well as the boatman, did not fail to invoke the great spiritual Masters as well as the cosmic gods and goddesses for immediate help. Rama, Krishna, Kali and Durga were all invoked. Tears were rolling down the cheeks of my elder brother, for he knew that I could not swim. The boatman pitifully cried out for help, but the neighbouring boats paid no heed. They, too, were caught in the storm and were possibly facing a similar calamity.</p>
<p>Slowly, but inexorably, the boat was sinking, sinking, carrying the panicky passengers with it. The fateful moment was not far off.</p>
<p>Suddenly, to the wide surprise of the boatman and passengers, a boat sprang up, empty, from the depths of the waters, right in front of our sinking boat-scarcely ten feet away. In no time, the boatman caught hold of me and threw me into the empty boat. Then all the other passengers hurriedly jumped into the boat, one by one. I was embraced by each and every passenger. They felt that it was my fate that had caused their lives to be saved, too. That was the day I was fated to die, but God decreed otherwise.</p>
<p>When the storm of nature was totally over, two boatmen shouted from a distance, "We are coming to help you!" But help was not needed now.</p>
<p>When help was really sought after, it was not forthcoming from any human being. It came directly from God. And this kind of timely help we get only from God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A traumatic experience in my life</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A traumatic experience in my life" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In our village, the children played a special game called <em>danguli</em>. Each person has two sticks, a big stick and a small stick. With the big stick, you have to strike the small one in such a way that it goes high into the air. Then you use the big stick to strike the little stick a second time so that it goes towards the opposing team. If the little stick is caught by someone on the opposing team, you lose the game.</p>
<p>Once Mantu and I were playing that game with some other young boys. We were on opposing sides. Someone from my team hit the little stick in such a way that it struck Mantu a glancing blow on his left eye, and his eye began bleeding profusely. We were so frightened and shocked. We were afraid that he would be totally blind in that eye.</p>
<p>When we brought Mantu to our mother, she became hysterical. She saw so much blood pouring from his eye and she thought that he had lost his eye. Then the village doctor arrived. He found that the eye itself was not affected, even though the area around the eye was severely injured. So Mantu's sight was saved.</p>
<p>That frightening experience lasted in me for hours and hours because of my love for my brother and his love for me. It was such a traumatic experience in my life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A bicycle of my own</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A bicycle of my own" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I was five or six years old, I was dying to have my own bicycle. I wanted to have a two-wheel bicycle. It was beneath my dignity to have a three-wheel one! My parents allowed Mantu to get a two-wheel bicycle, so I thought if Mantu can get one, what is wrong with me? Is it not an insult for me to have three wheels? But my parents were very strict. I had to have a small three-wheel bicycle.</p>
<p>Then one day I saw a two-wheel bicycle in a shop near our bank. I was so happy. I went inside to ask the price. I had no money, but I was so eager to buy that bicycle. The bicycle shop owner said, "Yes, that bicycle is for sale. For fifteen or twenty rupees you can have it." I was so thrilled. I ran back to the bank and told my brother Chitta. Chitta said, "No, no, no, they are not going to sell that bicycle."</p>
<p>I said, "Definitely it is for sale. They told me." I started crying for that bicycle. Then Chitta said, "When I have finished my work, we can go and make enquiries."</p>
<p>But my brother was very clever. In the meantime, he secretly sent a peon from the bank to go and give them two rupees or something like that to tell us that the bicycle was not for sale. When Chitta had finished his work for the day, I dragged him to the bicycle shop. It was only a few hours since I had been there, but the shop owner said, "I am sorry, but that bicycle is not for sale." My brother pretended to be very innocent.</p>
<p>What can you do? A beggar cannot be a chooser. My brother did not want me to have a two-wheel bicycle because he felt I was too young to ride alone. He was afraid I would meet with an accident. So I had to be satisfied with sitting on the back seat of the messenger's bicycle.</p>
<p>So this is how my brother fooled me. I did not find out that he had fooled me until long afterwards, at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. There he told me the truth. At the Sri Aurobindo Ashram I was so unhappy because my brother Mantu had learned to cycle in Chittagong, so he was given a bicycle at the Ashram. But, poor me, I did not learn and also I am much shorter than Mantu, and so when I came to the Ashram, they did not give me a bicycle. This is how my brother Chitta prevented me twice from having a proper bicycle.</p>
