<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each spiritual Master either has a world of his own or he belongs to a particular, special soul’s world. It depends on the calibre of the spiritual Master. In the inner world, all the sincere Masters are not of the same calibre. So, according to their calibre, according to their standard, they have their source. Spiritual Masters of the highest order have a world of their own, along with their disciples, devotees, admirers, followers and acquaintances. So if a Master is really very great, he has his own world. Otherwise, he belongs to some special soul’s world.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can become more competent in fulfilling one’s earthly duties by doing first one’s heavenly duties. Heavenly duties will never ask you to neglect your earthly duties. Only you have to do the first things first. Your heavenly duty is to remain in Light. If you are inundated with Light, then only can you enter into darkness and do what is needed there. Earthly duties are full of darkness. Heavenly duties are prayer, concentration, meditation, contemplation. If you do your heavenly duties first, you eventually embody Light. Then, with this Light, you can enter into the earthly duties. So first things first. With your heavenly duties — prayer, meditation, concentration — you will invoke Light; and once you are surcharged with Light, then you will attend to the earthly duties. Otherwise, you will never be able to acquire enough capacity to discharge your earthly duties.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the spiritual point of view, football is extremely meaningful, soulful and fruitful. Each sincere seeker should pray to the Supreme to make him His football. When we kick a football, the football is at our mercy. The football is the instrument. We kick right, left, forward, backward and play with it according to our sweet will. Now, look at this football! It is far better than we are. The football does not quarrel with us, it does not fight us. At times the football, as an instrument, can fail us; the air can leak out, the bladder can burst, all kinds of problems can come up. But the main wish of the football is to please the football player.We should consider ourselves to be footballs of the Supreme. The earthly football, the leather football is under compulsion to please its master. The football that we kick is under our control, at our mercy. It has become our instrument and it is pleasing us, although it may not be pleasing us cheerfully. But we should be conscious footballs always trying to please the Supreme cheerfully so that the Supreme can at any moment kick us, shape us, mould us, form us in His own way. We should be real divine footballs so that He can use us all the time in His own way, according to His sweet Will.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The difference between God’s Compassion and God’s Justice is this: When we remain in God’s Consciousness, we feel there is no such thing as Justice: It is all Compassion. But when we remain in our own consciousness, then we feel that there is no such thing as Compassion; it is all Justice. When we live in the human consciousness, we say God is very cruel, unkind. When we live in the divine Consciousness, we realise He is all Compassion. The difference lies in us. If we live in ourselves, God is all Justice. If we live in God, then He is all Compassion.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends entirely on the development of the seeker. Each will ask the Master a question according to his own standard. The beginner will ask the Master, “How can I make my mind calm and quiet? My mind is bothering me and preventing me from making any progress.” This is a beginner’s question, according to his standard. Then, when one is very, very highly developed, when one is on the verge of realisation, he will ask the Master to tell him the date when he is going to get realisation. One who is on the verge of realisation has reached such a high level that he is begging the Master to tell him when he will realise God. And the other one will ask the Master how to make the mind calm and quiet. So it entirely depends on the standard of the seeker.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on what you create. Suppose you are an artist and you have painted say, an eggplant, or a carrot or a pencil; this will not purity your life. But if you draw my picture, if you draw something that has tremendous spiritual significance behind it, certainly it will help you. If you draw the sky, then the sky will give you a feeling of vastness. If you draw the ocean, then the ocean will give you consciousness. If you draw a boat, then the boat will give you a feeling of journey. You have to see the symbol behind the thing that you have drawn. No matter how beautifully you draw a carrot, or an eggplant or a tomato, still the consciousness will be limited. Even if it is extremely beautiful, how far can a tomato take you? Again, look how far the ocean or sky can take you. So you have to know what you are creating. Creation should be vast, boundless, sublime, so that it can carry you. Then you get the scope to purify your life. Otherwise, you will be bound by your own creation. If you enter into the ocean, it purifies you: If you enter into the sky, it purifies you. But if you enter into the carrot-consciousness, then it will not be able to purify you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My songs give such wonderful results because my songs are my inner experiences. Most of the experiences I get from you people. So they are really your own experiences. My inner experiences I get from you — from your heights, from your sufferings and from your joy. Your own experiences I bring to the fore and use for humanity. They are something of yours that secretly I have stolen. In your own way you do not know how to express them, but I do know how to express them. Therefore, when you receive or hear my songs, your inner being makes you feel something of your own, although your outer being is not aware of it. When somebody shows you or tells you about your own thing, you get tremendous joy. Your outer mind is not aware of it, but your inner being is fully aware of it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What creates the feeling of restlessness in every life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What creates the feeling of restlessness in every life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What creates restlessness? Restlessness indicates dissatisfaction with what we see and what we have and what we are. If we have peace of mind, anything that we have, anything that we are, anything that we are growing into is enough for us today. But tomorrow God will give us a new aspiration, so that we can go still higher. When there is peace, satisfaction is constantly increasing and inner hunger is also increasing. But when there is restlessness, we will feel there is no satisfaction. That is why it is like a mad elephant, going from this side to that side. How do we get peace of mind? We get peace of mind only when we feel that there is some higher Authority that is thinking of us, that is showing us His Love, His Concern. If we feel there is somebody far above us who is thinking of us and showing us Concern, Compassion, Love, Blessings, then only does our restlessness go away.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just think of your food. Regularly you feed your physical body. Because you are fond of your physical body, you eat every day so that you will live on earth. You can be fond of your soul as well. If you are fond of your soul, then naturally you will feed your soul through your prayer and meditation. You want to stay on the physical plane: therefore, you eat regularly. If you want to stay also on the inner plane, the subtle plane, God’s real plane, then naturally you will pray and meditate. The physical you are pleasing, and the soul also you have to please.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes they can come together. The mind walks ten steps and the heart walks ten steps and they come together. Or it can happen that the heart takes nine steps and the mind takes one step. Still, the mind is willing to be one with the heart. But sometimes the heart will come right up to the mind, but the mind hides. Then they can’t be together.</p>
<p>Very often only the heart’s purity can give the mind clarity, because the heart’s purity has much more power in it. It is like mother and child. The child can only crawl; he can only take one step. But the mother can take nine steps to meet the child. The heart is much more spiritual and powerful in every way in the inner world. But in the outer world the mind is stronger: It is defeating the heart. The earthly mind, limited mind, doubtful mind, sophisticated mind, intellectual mind — these things are all creating problems. But in the inner world, the heart is much stronger. Therefore, the heart has to come closer to the mind. Either they can both come to each other, or one has to come to save the other. Here, the heart has to come to save the mind. Most of the time, it is the heart’s purity that has to come first to bring clarity to the mind.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I increase my capacity to accept love?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I increase my capacity to accept love?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can increase your capacity to accept love by giving love to others. The more you give, the more you receive. So if you are able to give more love to mankind, then you will be able to receive from mankind. Self-expansion is God-expansion. You are expanding your own reality inside God’s Universal Reality. So the more love you give, the more you get from mankind and also from God.</p>
<p>So when you miss God, that is a very good sign, an extremely good sign. The first step is to miss Him. But then you have to go one step ahead and ask yourself whether the person you miss is universal. If you feel that He is universal, then you know that He is bound to be here, where you are. Therefore, you do not cry for Him. You try to see Him all around you, since He is universal. And if you want to see Him around you, then your aspiration has to be the strongest.</p>
<p>Our progress depends entirely on our sincerity. At home I spend hours and hours in my chair. But my chair will never realise God before you. Impossible! I may go to a disciple’s house only once a year: I may not go to a disciple’s house at all. But the disciple will realise God long, long before my chair and the other things that I use and have around me. Progress entirely depends on what you consciously want, and from whom. My chair does not consciously want God-realisation from me. Again, you may live thousands of miles from my house, but if you are consciously knocking at my heart’s door, naturally your progress will be infinitely faster than the progress of some individual who may stand in front of me and talk with me, but has no aspiration. So progress entirely depends on the inner necessity, inner cry and how badly one needs the Master.</p>

All, all, all those who have accepted God as their Master, all those who pray to God, are married to God. Here marriage means oneness. Marriage is not only oneness between two human beings, between man and woman; it is also oneness between God and man, oneness between the Creator and the creation. We are all creations of God.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Universal Reality is the reality that is not seen or felt in infinitesimal measure. You cannot take out a portion of the Universal Reality; it is not something that can be broken into various pieces. You can’t separate a portion from Existence. Universal Reality means the Reality from which nothing can be taken out. It is whole, complete, unlimited. Universal Reality means the Reality that came from the Transcendental Vision of the Supreme. The Transcendental Vision and the Universal Reality are one. They cannot be separated. The Supreme’s Transcendental Vision is universal. The Creator came down from above and then He became the universe.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The song of the birds says that there is no death. The birds fly in the sky. The sky signifies Infinity. If one remains in Infinity, then how can there be any death? So the song of the birds always declares the Immortality of the soul.</p>
