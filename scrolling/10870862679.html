  <h2 id="page-title">The shopkeeper&#039;s kick</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The shopkeeper&#039;s kick" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Let me tell you a juicy story that happened in Hong Kong. It is not wise to waste precious time in a shop — not your precious time, but the precious time of the shopkeepers.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong it was drizzling outside, so I went into a shop. I started looking at a translating machine that had a few cards with different words. If you put the cards into the machine, it will translate the words from English into Spanish, Italian and French. I was curious, so I tried using it. But when I saw that there were only 40 words in each language, and that those words perhaps I already knew, I did not want it. Curiosity always brings punishment.</p>
<p>The worker who was helping me happened to be Chinese. When he realised that I was not going to buy the machine, right in the shin bone he kicked me very nicely. He could have said that it was unintentional, but it was definitely intentional. He did not even apologise. Instead of crying, I laughed. I didn't feel like leaving just then, so I walked away a few steps and continued browsing.</p>
<p>There were also other customers in the store. One of them was a tall, stout man who seemed to be Scandinavian. His English was not very good. He was also browsing. Suddenly, I saw the Chinese worker do the same trick to that man also. But this time he picked the wrong person! The shopkeeper himself got a smart slap from the tall man.</p>
<p>Then the Chinese man started screaming, "I am calling the police!"</p>
<p>The Scandinavian man followed him to the telephone, saying, "Yes, call the police."</p>
<p>The worker was not dialing; he was only screaming that he would call the police, and I was enjoying it like anything!</p>
<p>I could have left after I was kicked, but God wanted me to stay there and see this.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Looking at flutes</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Looking at flutes" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Whenever I see an Indian flute, I always like to play it. In a store in Delhi I was playing a wooden flute. The price was ten rupees. In India I always offer them half the price, so I said, "Five rupees."</p>
<p>He said, "It is not even cost price. Cost price is seven rupees."</p>
<p>I said, "I am not going to take it."</p>
<p>Then he followed me two or three blocks, flattering me. He said that five minutes ago I had played so well.</p>
<p>Who can resist flattery? Because he flattered me so shamelessly, I gave him seven rupees and got the flute.</p>
<p>A few hours later I saw some reed flutes in another store. These flutes were not good at all, and the price was also very high. But I have a bad habit. Whenever I go into a store, I try to play the flutes. The salesman was annoyed that I was trying all the flutes and I could not make any sound. So he said, "The flute talks only to nice people."</p>
<p>I said, "It is true-it talks only to nice people." Since the flute didn't talk to me, I didn't have to buy it. So if you are not a nice man, you save money!</p>

<p>In India, no matter which hour of the day you go into a store, you are always the first customer. If you go at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock or even in the afternoon, the owner will say you are the first customer, and that is why he is lowering the price for you.</p>
<p>When I passed by one store, from a distance I could see that there were customers inside. The store was selling T-shirts. I thought that perhaps people were buying because they were quite cheap, so fifteen minutes later I went into the store. The salesman immediately told me that he would give me a very good price, since I was his first customer.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The tabla book</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The tabla book" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In a store in a Delhi hotel I saw a tabla book and I thought of Sahishnu. A few months ago I had said nice things about his tabla playing. So I said, "Now let me get him a book."</p>
<p>I was browsing through the book. I did not know the cost, but I made up my mind to buy it. I asked the owner, "How late do you stay open?"</p>
<p>He said, "9:30."</p>
<p>I said, "I will come back again." I was really hungry, so I went to eat.</p>
<p>Around 3 o'clock I came back. Their afternoon siesta is wonderful. Their lunch break is three hours, and the store was closed. So I came back again at 8 o'clock. Can you imagine? That book was sold. The shopkeeper said, "Do you expect opportunity to come again and again?"</p>
<p>I said, "Tell me the truth. How many months have you had that book here?"</p>
<p>He said, "Months? It has been here for two years."</p>
<p>So look at Sahishnu's luck. Nobody had bought the book for two years, but that day somebody had to come and buy the book. It was my stupidity. I should have bought it the first time.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The overpayment</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The overpayment" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The owner of an Army and Navy store in Jamaica likes me very much. The other day when I was in the store I asked him, "Do you have a medium jacket?"</p>
<p>He said, "Medium? For whom?"</p>
<p>I said, "For me!"</p>
<p>He said, "Extra large, extra large!"</p>
<p>I said, "Extra large for whom?"</p>
<p>He said, "Extra large for me."</p>
<p>I said, "You are the owner. Why do I have to get one for you?"</p>
<p>He said, "Can you not buy one for your old age?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am already old."</p>
<p>Then he looked around and found a medium. The jacket cost forty-six dollars, but he reduced the price to forty, and said he wouldn't charge me tax. I gave him the money and smiled, and then went out of the door. Suddenly he started shouting and shouting.</p>
<p>I thought, "What, have I not given him enough money?" So I turned around.</p>
<p>He said, "Man, you have given me fifty dollars!"</p>
<p>I had counted it, but I hadn't noticed that two ten dollar bills were stuck together. If he himself had trusted me and not counted it again, then he would not have known that I had given him too much. But for him to call me back was really something!</p>

<p>After overpaying for the jacket, I went to a bakery. I told the lady to give me a dozen cookies. She said, "I am sorry. We only have eleven."I said, "Fine, then give me eleven!"</p>
<p>She could have easily pretended that she had given me twelve. Who is counting? But some sincere people do exist. That's why we are still alive.</p>
<p>Eight or nine months ago I drank some tea in that bakery. The lady still remembers. She always says, "You don't want tea?"</p>
<p>This is that famous shop that always burns down. Previously there was another owner. He used to shake hands with me and give me everything half price.</p>
<p>Whatever the item was, he used to give me half for free.</p>

<p>Yesterday on my way back from the United Nations I went to an Indian restaurant in Manhattan called Curry in a Hurry. A young man came up to me and said, "Are you Sri Chinmoy? I am so happy to see you. I interview great men like you." Then he gave me a brochure about a book he had written on an Indian mental giant.</p>
<p>The man who was serving the food was looking at me with such admiration when he saw the other man talking to me, so I asked him, "Where do you come from?" First he said, "Bangladesh." Then he said, "Chittagong." Previously, whenever someone said he came from Bangladesh, it was always from some other district.</p>
<p>Here, for the first time, I heard "Chittagong," which is my own district. And then he said the name of a village which is only four and a half miles away from my village. For seven or eight years he had been in Cairo.</p>
<p>Thousands of miles from Chittagong we met. So is this not destiny? If the other man hadn't come up to me and said that I was a great man, I would probably not have spoken to the man who was serving. But if somebody says you are a great man, immediately ten persons look at you.</p>

<p>In Victoria we went to another restaurant and I asked for a grilled cheese sandwich. I paid for it with an American ten dollar bill, and the lady at the cash register gave me the change. As soon as I got it, I put it in my pocket and left.</p>
<p>After I had gone half a block, the cashier came running up to me and said, "I'm sorry, I didn't give you the correct amount of change. You gave me ten American dollars, but I gave you change for ten Canadian dollars."</p>
<p>So this is the good side of Canada; the bad side is that when you ask for egg salad you get mayonnaise.</p>

<p>I went to buy rasgulla today to give for prasad. It used to be my favourite Indian sweet. I also wanted eight or ten samosas. The people at the store were shylocks. They charged me $75.83 for the sweets. When I gave the lady $75, she said, "Eighty-three cents more."</p>
<p>I said, "Eighty-three cents?"</p>
<p>She said, "My boss will not allow me to give any discount."</p>
<p>I said to myself, "They do not deserve it!" So I took back the $75 and turned to go out of the store.</p>
<p>Then the lady said, "Oh, have a nice day. Please come!" Then she gave it to me for $75.</p>
<p>Can you imagine what her name was? Amita! I couldn't believe it. Amita is a Bengali name. How did she get it, since she was Gujarati?</p>
<p>The Korean store is far better. In the morning I got some hair and food items from the Koreans. I bought quite a few things from them. There the bill came to $65. I didn't bargain with them because they had already given me a discount.When I gave them $65, they said, "We will only charge you $64, and no tax."I said, "You keep the dollar."</p>
<p>The Koreans were far better.</p>

<p>When I was near a store called Sari Palace, an Indian lady saw me and became very excited. She came outside and pointed me out to an Indian man who was passing by. She did not say anything to him; she only pointed at me.</p>
<p>Then I wanted to go into Popular Fabrics. Baoul said I wouldn't be able to get Punjabi outfits there, but I said I was in the mood to go in.</p>
<p>When I entered into the store, a young Gujarati lady was talking to a Gujarati customer. They were bargaining and having an argument. The man was saying that she was charging too much. Finally, he got very mad and went away without buying anything.</p>
<p>When I went towards the counter, I noticed that my transcendental picture was hanging up along with other pictures of Indian cosmic gods and goddesses and spiritual Masters. There were Lakshmi, Krishna, Kali and others, as well as some spiritual Masters. The lady did not recognise me, and I said to myself, "Who wants to tell her?"</p>
<p>I asked the lady for Punjabi outfits. She said, "We don't have them ready-made."</p>
<p>I said, "You don't? Are you sure?"</p>
<p>She said, "No, but you can buy the material to make them. It is $4.99 a yard. We don't have special dupatta material, but you can buy six-and-a-half-yard lengths of material and make the whole outfit, including the dupatta."</p>
<p>I asked, "Can you not speak Hindi?"</p>
<p>"No, I do not speak it," she answered.</p>
<p>I told her, "Well, your English is perfect." So perfect English we used.I like bargaining, so I asked, "Can you not reduce the price? I will buy at least five different kinds of material."</p>
<p>She said, "$4 a yard."</p>
<p>I said, "Very good! I won't ask you to come down any more."</p>
<p>While I was looking at the material, she was telling me, "This is very beautiful, that is very beautiful."</p>
<p>Then, to my wide surprise, a middle-aged man suddenly appeared and fell flat at my feet. He was not bowing his head a little in the usual civilised way. No, he was lying flat on the ground, showing his respect according to the traditional Indian custom.</p>
<p>The lady was startled. She said, "He is my boss! Sushil! Sushil!" She couldn't believe that her boss was lying down flat on the floor. He had not been there when I entered into the store, but when he saw me, he was so happy and excited that I was in his shop.</p>
<p>When he stood up, he said to me, "You don't have to think of the price, Just take whatever you want. I will take care of it." I said, "This material was $4.99. Now she has reduced it to $4.00. I am satisfied. I don't want her to reduce it any more."</p>
<p>I continued browsing, and Sushil remained near me. He said to me, "Miss Ghose came here today." He meant that Ranjana had been in the store earlier that day. Then he said, "I come from the Punjab, and my assistant comes from Gujarat."When I had made my selection, the assistant cut six and a half yards from each roll of material, and put it all in a bag for me. When she was finished, I saw that the owner was not going towards the cash register. I said to myself, "What is the matter with him?" I calculated in my head that the material would cost $156.00. I opened my wallet, took out the exact amount and was about to give the owner the money.</p>
<p>Suddenly he was lying down flat on the ground at my feet! It was the same scene as before.</p>
<p>I said, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>He said, "You have blessed me. This store is here all by your grace. I first saw you when you came to my store on Canal Street. Then I got another store in Manhattan, and you came there twice. Now, for the first time, you have come here to bless me. I can't take money from you. Everything here is yours."</p>
<p>I said, "You are really embarrassing me! At least take $100."</p>
<p>He said, "How can I take money from you? Especially now, in Diwali festival time, how can I take your money? Absolutely, I can't take anything! Everything I have is all due to your grace." He was trembling with joy and delight. He couldn't believe that I was there in his store. I said, "Next time I come, you have to charge me. Otherwise, I will not come to your store again to bless you."</p>
<p>He said, "Yes, next time."</p>
<p>Eight or nine years ago, in Manhattan, the same kind of thing happened: a shopkeeper wouldn't take money from me. When I was picking out things, the man pretended he didn't recognise me. Then, afterwards, he wouldn't take money from me. I had selected $86 worth of things from his store, but he said, "Just give me a ten dollar bill and sign your name on it, so I can treasure it and preserve it always."</p>
<p>His friend had been a disciple in Connecticut for a short time, but the shopkeeper felt that he could not become a disciple because he was not pure enough.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Christian preacher</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Christian preacher" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A few days ago I went to a bookstore. I didn't buy any books, but I bought a few tapes because I wanted to hear what is required to be a "first-class Christian." I was eager to hear the sermon of the great preacher, so I played the tape while I was taking exercise.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe how he was criticising Indian spiritual Masters. He said that those who practised Indian-type meditation are possessed by Satan. In fifteen minutes you heard Satan's name more than God's Name. 'Satan' came in every sentence-not God.</p>
<p>Transcendental Meditation in particular he attacked like anything. He said, "If meditation is something worthwhile, why are they not practising it in India? Why do they have to come to the West?"</p>
<p>So, while listening, I was answering his rhetorical questions. I was saying, "You fool! The Christian missionaries came to us in India to teach us. We were their favourite students. Why did they not stay in the West with their religion? You felt you had something worthwhile to teach us, and we learned devotedly.</p>
<p>Now, whatever we have that is worthwhile, we have come here to teach you. So what is wrong?" Like that I talked to him. The Christian evangelists forget that they also go to distant lands to spread their light! The Transcendental Meditation people should hear this tape!</p>
<p>I never learn! One tape was not enough. I started listening to another tape. There also the preacher had nothing else to do but attack the Indian meditation teachers. Perhaps we are the culprits. We have probably taken some of his people into our fold. So what else can he do? Now he has to use his preaching power to take away some of the passengers from our boats.</p>
<p>Two or three years ago when I went to that bookstore, the owner, an old man, was very unkind to me. I used to go with a shopping bag, but he wouldn't allow me to carry the shopping bag inside the room. I had to leave it at the door. Always he believed I was going to steal something.</p>
<p>Now I have got a promotion. The new owner is very nice to me, although he doesn't know who I am. When I left my shopping bag at the door, he said, "No, you can take it in."</p>
<p>So I bought sixteen dollars worth of tapes.</p>

<p>As you know, I like bargaining. Here in Maracaibo it is quite possible to bargain. Today I wanted to buy something, but I don't speak Spanish, so I wrote down the price I wanted to pay. The storekeeper wrote down something else. Then what a battle we had! He wrote down 460 bolivars. I wrote down 350.</p>
<p>He said something very emphatic which, fortunately, I couldn't understand.</p>
<p>Then I wrote down 360. He wrote down 400. I said to myself, "No, I am not giving four!" and I started to leave.So I got it for 370.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Exchanging dollars</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Exchanging dollars" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I was in another store. I had only four bolivars left, so I wanted to change some American dollars. The shopkeeper said he would give me 11.30 per dollar. I knew the rate was higher, so I said, "12.30, or I am not going to buy!"</p>
<p>He said he would raise it to 12, but I insisted on 12.30, and finally he agreed.You may ask, "Is it good to do that kind of thing?" But with these people it is good, because they are such rogues! I never take those shopkeepers seriously! They say "fixed price," but you have to bargain with them if you want a grain of satisfaction.</p>
