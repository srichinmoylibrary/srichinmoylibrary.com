  <h2 id="page-title">Indian-style shopping</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Indian-style shopping" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>At one place in Mexico City I spent forty-five minutes or more trying to buy some things for the San Francisco girls' singing group. But I had bad luck. Finally I got something in the Mazatlan market.</p>
<p>The Mazatlan market reminded me of India, where I was born and brought up. There they had little shops where you could bargain with the people as much as you wanted to.</p>
<p>The first time I went to the market, Hashi was the interpreter. The rule was never to accept what they said, because they knew you were not going to buy it at that price. No matter what they said first, you had to ask them to come down.</p>

<p>This is a story about your Guru, about what kind of opportunist he is. In Mazatlan every day my mantra was that nobody should follow me when I went to the market. Everybody listened, but sometimes unconsciously people made mistakes.</p>
<p>One day, after I said that nobody should follow me, whom did I see in the market? Nayana! So I gave her an undivine look and she disappeared.</p>
<p>Then I bought something for Kanan's singing group. Just then I saw Hashi, and I gave her a very divine look. Do you know why? So that I could give her the things that I had bought. After I handed her the packages, I said, "Now, go away!" Then again I didn't let anybody come near me.</p>

<p>Before I went to buy gifts for Kanan's group, again and again I had asked him how many were in his group. Each time he had told me that there were ten members.</p>
<p>O God, right after I had bought ten gifts, I saw Kanan in the market. He said, "O Guru, our group has eleven members. But I won't mind if I don't get a gift."</p>
<p>Then I told him that he was hopeless.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Dog attacks</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Dog attacks" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The morning of our seven-mile race in Mazatlan, I ran seven miles by myself just before the race started. At least four times I was attacked by dogs. Perhaps the reason they attacked me was because I was wearing a red shirt. When they came at me, I stood there very bravely until they stopped barking at me. In one case a dog crossed the street to where I was running, but it didn't bite me.</p>
<p>Especially when you are running fast, you get alarmed when you suddenly see a dog. If you are running slowly, it is not such a shock. In my case I was going so slowly-at bullock-cart speed.</p>
<p>None of the disciples were attacked by dogs during the race. That was because they were running in a group.</p>

<p>Later that day I went out to go shopping, but it was cold. I thought perhaps X would have a car, so I came back to the Social Security Building, which we were using for our meals and functions. By that time X, Y and Z had all disappeared. But who was there? Pragati. It was her birthday, so I asked her to take me in her car. So Pragati had good luck on her birthday. She drove me here, there everywhere. Then Tanima joined us. After that we saw Garima walking, so we also stopped for her. Then again we went to the market.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Buying a sari</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Buying a sari" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Since it was Pragati's birthday and she was driving me, I said, "Let me buy her a gift." I entered into a fabric store, but they didn't have a proper sari. I asked, what is the price for a yard of this particular fabric?"</p>
<p>The lady said, "Fifty pesos."</p>
<p>I said to myself, "Let me not bargain, since I like the fabric. Today let me be a different person."</p>
<p>So I said to her, "All right. I would like six yards."</p>
<p>The lady started measuring it, and I began browsing in the store. By the time I came back, the fabric was all cut and properly folded. She had put it on the counter and had written down on a piece of paper, "Seventy-five pesos times six yards."</p>
<p>I said, "You told me it was fifty pesos."</p>
<p>She said, "No, while you were looking around the store, I saw that the actual price was ninety pesos. I told you fifty, but I was wrong."</p>
<p>I said, "Then you should have asked me if I wanted to pay more than fifty."</p>
<p>She said, "From ninety I have made it seventy-five."</p>
<p>She was showing me the price. It said ninety. But God knows if she had written it after she told me the price.</p>
<p>I said to myself, "Since she has told me one lie, how can I believe that this is six yards?"</p>
<p>I asked her to measure the fabric in front of me. She pretended it was beneath her dignity to do this, so I started measuring it myself. It was just a little over four yards-not even four and a half. Instead of fifty pesos, it had become seventy-five, and instead of six yards, it had become four.</p>
<p>Then she came up to me and said, "I told you fifty, so you can have it for fifty pesos a yard." She spoke good English. There was no problem with the language. Perhaps if it had been six yards, the length of a proper sari, I would have paid seventy-five pesos. But it was not even four and a half yards, so I just left the store.</p>
<p>That was my first bad experience with a Mexican shopkeeper. All frustration! If I had believed the lady that it was six yards, I would have given it to Pragati. Perhaps she would never have told me that it was only four yards. She would have kept it on her shrine instead of wearing it.</p>

<p>Then I saw a pair of white, plastic sandals in another store. I said, "These are very nice." But when I went to look, I saw that they were not actually a pair. They were two different sizes. One was size eight and one was size six.</p>
<p>I took the sandals to the shopkeeper and asked her to give me either a six or an eight, since she didn't have seven or seven and a half. She said that she only had this one pair of sandals. She said, "No, you take these."</p>
<p>Was I going to buy one size six and one size eight? Naturally, I didn't buy them. That was my second experience.</p>

<p>Then I went into another store. There I saw a very simple but very beautiful deer made of styrofoam. I said, "Here I will have no problems regarding the size." A deer stands for Pragati's speed, so I bought the deer.</p>
<p>I said, "If the deer wins the race, she will have victory. A peacock means victory." So I bought her a peacock as well.</p>

<p>Another day in Mazatlan I went to a sporting goods store. The two ladies there were so callous. They were just wasting my time. After I had stood there for ten minutes, I gave up and left.</p>

<p>The day before we left Mazatlan, I was running early in the morning. At one point a small car that was going quite fast came near me and stopped. A little boy five or six years old got out and asked me for directions in Spanish. He said three lines of Spanish, and I could not understand anything. I had been running fast, doing speed work, and I was exhausted. I don't know Spanish, and I was so tired that I couldn't talk. I was helpless.</p>
<p>When the boy saw that I didn't understand him and also that I was too tired to talk, he said very soulfully "Thanks a lot." There was no sarcasm involved. Then he ran back and entered into his father's car.</p>
<p>Another day while I was running in Mazatlan very early in the morning, I saw an American running. This man I had previously seen playing tennis. He was bearded and not very nice-looking. He asked me the time. So I said, "Five fifty-six."</p>
<p>Then he said, "Damn you! Why can't you say 'four minutes of six'!"</p>
<p>I never use the expression "thanks a lot," but I told him, "Thanks a lot," and continued running.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">An Acapulco welcome</h2><span property="dc:title" content="An Acapulco welcome" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Sometimes when I first arrive in a country or city, the soul of that place will greet me at the airport. Sometimes after a few hours or a day or two it comes to greet me. Other times I am greeted even before I arrive-either on the plane or at the previous place I am visiting. Sometimes the soul of one country or city comes to the previous place to escort me to its own place.</p>
<p>In Acapulco the soul of the city greeted me one morning when I was coming by taxi from my hotel to the hotel where the disciples were staying. At first the taxi driver did not understand my pronunciation when I said, "Hotel Versailles," so I showed him my key where the name of the disciples' hotel was written. I didn't see any meter inside the taxi, so I asked him how much it would cost. He said, "Forty pesos." Then he said to me, "Hindu?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, Hindu."</p>
<p>Then he put his hand on my shoulder very hard and said, "Amigo!"</p>
<p>As soon as he touched me on the shoulder, right on the windshield of his taxi I saw the soul of Acapulco welcoming me. The taxi driver was the instrument. This time the soul greeted me through an outer gesture.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the taxi driver was a rogue. He saw the key, but he wanted to leave me off seven or eight minutes' drive from the hotel. When I showed him the key again, from forty pesos the fare rose to eighty pesos.</p>

<p>In Acapulco I went to the market with Garima and Niriha. I got a few things and also some nice brooches for people who had not come to Mexico. The man selling the brooches wanted to fool us. They were butterflies and he was saying they could fly.</p>
<p>At one point I saw some tiny combs. I thought they were real combs to comb your hair. Niriha gave me proper wisdom. She said they were not hair combs; they were moustache combs.</p>
<p>I asked, "Who has a moustache?"</p>
<p>Niriha said, "Rabindra."</p>
<p>The man was asking four dollars for the combs. I definitely wanted to buy them, but, as usual, I wanted to bargain. Sometimes the shopkeepers pay no attention to the customers. I was standing there arguing to see if he would lower the price, but the man wasn't paying any attention to me. Finally I went away without buying the combs.</p>

<p>I was out shopping in Acapulco when I saw Shephali buying a very expensive gift. I said to her, "You are the richest person!" I didn't know she was buying the gift for me. Lavanya was standing nearby, but she didn't see me.</p>
<p>Then Subala and Chandika were fighting at the counter over who was going to pay for something. I wanted to go and pay, but I was engrossed in buying something else at the time. Later I was told that Chandika was having difficulty finding her money.</p>
