<p>Rembrandt had a special way of painting. At times he would take an oath that he would not allow anyone to watch him paint. He wanted to work all by himself, in pin-drop silence. If anybody came near him, he would become furious.</p>
<p>He said to his friends and colleagues, "You think it is just because you are my friends, colleagues and students that I am behaving this way. But I tell you, it is not true. I will not give an audience even to the first monarch of the world when I do not want to see anybody.</p>
<p>"Rest assured, this is not my whim. This is my oath! When I do not want to do something, I will not do it. When I want something to be done, I will get it done by any means. Here I am telling you, even the greatest monarch of the world will not be able to see me while I am painting if I do not want to see him. In what way am I indebted to anybody on earth? Since I am not indebted, I am under no obligation to see the greatest monarch of the world. When I want to be all by myself, I am at perfect liberty to keep myself free."</p>

<p>Rembrandt worked very hard. He blessed the world with hundreds of painting-boons, etching-boons and drawing-boons. His achievements are truly immortal.</p>
<p>His painting, <em>Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer</em>, was sold for more than two million dollars. Alas, what a shocking stroke of cruel fate: penniless he died. A close friend of his offered $85.20 to meet with the cost of the burial.</p>

<p>When the great Bengali artist Nandalal Bose was a little boy, one day he saw a man drawing something on a wall. When he came nearer and saw that it was a beautiful picture, he requested the artist to draw something for him.</p>
<p>The artist said, "I cannot do anything for free. You have to give me some money."</p>
<p>So the little boy gave the artist three paise, which is the equivalent of about one tenth of an American cent. The artist took the three paise and drew two or three lines. The little boy said, "You have not completed the picture."</p>
<p>The man responded, "You gave me three paise. What more can you expect for three paise? If you give me more, then only will I draw more."</p>
<p>So the little boy gave the artist three more paise. Then the artist drew a few more lines, but still the picture was not complete.</p>
<p>"It can never be complete," the man said, "unless you give me more money."</p>
<p>The little boy kept giving the artist three paise at a time, and each time the artist would add something more to the picture. Finally, to his wildest surprise, the boy saw that the artist was drawing his portrait. The boy was so moved and amazed to see his own face so beautifully drawn. The artist was drawing with charcoal and water. Instead of a brush, he used rags.</p>
<p>Eventually, this little boy, Nandalal Bose, became a great, immortal artist himself. He also used charcoal, water and rags for some of his most important works. These were done in Santiniketan, which is so well-respected by millions for its literary, cultural and artistic life.</p>
<p>Santiniketan was founded by Rabindranath Tagore. He made Nandalal Bose the first head of the art department and this art department subsequently became famous throughout India.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Japanese ink</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Japanese ink" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Rabindranath Tagore lavished boundless affection and love on Nandalal Bose, and he was also fond of the artist Mukul Dey. Mukul Dey was a great admirer and student of Nandalal Bose. Nandalal Bose and Mukul Dey went to many countries with Tagore, and Tagore liked them immensely.</p>
<p>Once, Nandalal Bose gave a bottle of ink to Mukul Dey and said, "This ink was made in Japan."</p>
<p>In those days in India, any article from a foreign country created such fascination and was deeply appreciated. Mukul Dey was so excited and delighted. He thought, "This is such a nice thing. I will not use it. I will give it to Gurudev (meaning Tagore). He will be very happy to use this."</p>
<p>Any object that is nice, people always wish to give to their dear ones. Because Mukul Dey was so fond of Tagore, he presented the ink to him.</p>
<p>When Tagore heard that the ink came originally from Nandalal Bose, whom he loved so much, he used the ink to compose a poem on Nandalal Bose. Tagore wrote the whole poem, but nothing was visible on the paper. Tagore and Mukul Dey thought that it would become visible in a few hours. But, O God, hours passed by, and still nothing could be seen.</p>
<p>Tagore asked Mukul Dey, "What happened? Nothing is coming out. I thought that Nandalal Bose was giving us something extraordinary, an ink which becomes visible only after some time."</p>
<p>So Mukul Dey went to Nandalal Bose. When Bose heard that Tagore had used the ink, he was thunderstruck! He was so embarrassed! "What have I done? What have I done?" he said.</p>
<p>Nandalal had never expected that the ink would go to Tagore; otherwise, he would never have dared to do this kind of thing. He gave it to Mukul Dey to pull his leg, but Mukul Dey took the gift seriously and presented the ink to Tagore, of all people. But Tagore also enjoyed that joke. Afterwards, he wrote out the poem again using proper ink.</p>

<p>Nandalal Bose was good friends with the great Mahatma Gandhi, who was highly venerated all over India and throughout the world. Once Gandhi and Bose went out for a walk to the beach. The artist entered into the water, but Gandhi stayed on the beach to take care of Nandalal's shoes because there were many people around and Gandhi did not want the shoes to be stolen. Gandhi usually liked to stroll along the beach, walking to and fro, but instead he just stood in front of the shoes, watching over them.</p>
<p>When the artist came out of the water, he was deeply embarrassed that Gandhi, who was so great, had had to look after his shoes while he was enjoying a swim. So he decided to give up wearing shoes.</p>

<p>Tagore and Gandhi were good friends. They loved each other deeply. They admired each other unreservedly. Once, however, they entered into a very unpleasant conversation, a terribly heated argument. Indeed, it was a shocking experience to their followers and admirers. Some took Tagore's side, while others took Gandhi's side.</p>
<p>A follower of Gandhi pleaded with the great artist Nandalal Bose to take one side. He immediately expressed his utter incapacity: "I am an artist. I like all the colours deeply and equally. To me, these two supremely great souls are like two Vision-Eyes. I cannot prefer one Eye to the other. I love them deeply and need them equally."</p>

 <p>
TRNS 51-53. These stories by Sri Chinmoy are about Indian spiritual luminaries.</p>
<h2>Shankaracharya's pride is hurt</h2>

<p>These two stories are about Shankaracharya, India's superlative philosopher and spiritual figure, who lived over one thousand years ago. In those days, Shankaracharya and others used to enjoy debating to prove who was the greatest, who had boundless knowledge.</p>
<p>Shankaracharya defeated all his opponents, but one gave him some trouble. The name of this opponent was Bandanashastri and his wife's name was Bharatishastri.</p>
<p>Shankaracharya and Bandanashastri needed a judge for their debate. Bharatishastri, like her husband, was conversant with Vedic literature. So Bandanashastri said, "She will be by far the best judge," and Shankaracharya fully agreed.</p>
<p>The debate commenced and it took Shankaracharya three days to defeat Bandanashastri. When Bandanashastri lost, his wife said to Shankaracharya, "Now you have to accept my challenge. I want to challenge you."</p>
<p>Then Shankaracharya said, "Oh, please give me six months' time." He took six months to prepare himself and then he said, "Now I am ready." The debate began and with greatest difficulty he defeated Bharatishastri.</p>
<p>Shankaracharya had a religious ashram and after this debate he named it after her. His pride was deeply hurt that it took him such a long time to defeat her.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Shankaracharya receives wisdom from a woman</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Shankaracharya receives wisdom from a woman" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In the beginning, Shankaracharya did not pay attention to women. He felt that women were not suited to spirituality. Then, when he was about to lose the debate to Bharatishastri, it dawned on him that Mother Kali was on Lord Shiva's chest.</p>
<p>There are two ways to interpret Mother Kali's pose. Some say that Shiva was giving her all energy, all power, and that is why she was able to kill all the enemies; another way is to say that Shiva was dead and Kali was standing on his chest to revive him. So you can choose whichever explanation you prefer.</p>
<p>Anyway, Shankaracharya's pride was smashed. Now it happened that one day he was going to his own temple. Right on the steps near the entrance to the temple there was the dead body of a man and beside it the man's widow was bitterly crying and screaming.</p>
<p>Shankaracharya said to the widow, "Give way to me. I want to enter into the temple."</p>
<p>The widow said, "I know who you are. You are Shankara. Your philosophy is: 'Brahman is all-pervading. Everything is pervaded by Brahman; everything is pure consciousness.' This is the philosophy you preach. But do you practise it? You tell the whole world that the world is an illusion and only Brahman is real because Brahman is all-pervading. If everything is Brahman, then am I not That? Am I not Brahman? And this dead body of my husband, is it not Brahman also?"</p>
<p>Shankaracharya was shocked to hear her words. He knelt down at her feet. His devotees were stunned. He said to them, "She gave me the wisdom. If I am preaching that Brahman is all-pervading, then Brahman is inside this dead body and it is equally inside this widow."</p>
<p>So this is how Shankaracharya received wisdom from a woman. Then he wrote many, many poems all dedicated to the female Goddesses. He felt that he could not look down upon women, for they represent the Divine Mother.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">King Janaka&#039;s palace catches fire</h2><span property="dc:title" content="King Janaka&#039;s palace catches fire" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Prince Siddhartha gave up his kingdom to become Lord Buddha. In Indian history only one person has ruled his kingdom and, at the same time, realised God. His name was King Janaka.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna used to say, "Do not think everybody can become Janaka. He is one in a million. Every rule admits of exception. Janaka is the proof. Tell me if there can be another Janaka who was in the world and who realised God at the same time. There is nobody else like King Janaka. He is the only one to realise God while he was King because he was able to renounce everything."</p>
<p>King Janaka had a spiritual Master and he used to go and see this Master, like an ordinary seeker. One day, while Janaka was visiting this Master, someone deliberately set fire to his palace. The fire was raging out of control. Others who were nearby were poorer than the poorest. They had only loin cloths and the simple necessities of life. But they all left the Master's presence and ran to save what little they possessed, Meanwhile, King Janaka stayed with his Master.</p>
<p>The Master asked, "Why are you not concerned about saving your palace and all your precious possessions?"</p>
<p>King Janaka replied, "I have come here to acquire God-realisation. Do I need those things?"</p>
<p>The other so-called seekers who had come to learn from the Master all went back to save their loin cloths, but Janaka, who stood to lose everything, was only praying to God and thinking of God. And in the course of time he did realise God.</p>
