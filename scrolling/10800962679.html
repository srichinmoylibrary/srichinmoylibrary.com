<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can fulfil the hearts and souls of the children of the world only by becoming the hearts and souls of the children of the world. What do we mean by that? At every moment we shall have enthusiasm and eagerness to learn more about Truth, more about Light, more about Delight. At every moment we must cultivate an eagerness to learn something illumining and fulfilling. It is our eagerness to learn that will give us a childlike heart, a childlike soul. This is the only way we can fulfil the hearts and souls of the children of the world.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I cannot categorically say what the Supreme is going to do. Already there have been quite a few extremely good leaders. Some of the leaders got the opportunity to lead, while others did not. But if there is a need for more leaders, then the Supreme will definitely grant more leaders. But if the leaders that are already there have the capacity, while others are praying for the capacity in their own way, then the goal of the United Nations will not always remain a far cry. In this case, there is no need for the Supreme to grant the United Nations more leaders.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no fixed date or fixed hour. It is only when we as individuals feel the necessity of oneness. Only when the hour has struck for a particular individual will that individual cry for world oneness, world progress and world perfection. The process will be one of constant awareness — by becoming consciously aware of what one as an individual and what one as a nation has to do. It is in conscious awareness that the right things can take place at the right moment in the right way and all the negative forces can be conquered, all the world problems can be solved.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to establish an inner connection with the United Nations, one has to look at the United Nations as the soul and one has to feel oneself as the soul. The soul is the representative of the God-reality, Truth-reality, Light-reality on earth. So if one sees the soul of the United Nations, then one will feel that everything that the United Nations does or stands for is absolutely perfect. Again, one's own aspiring soul is also perfect in its own way. If one sees both the United Nations and oneself as only the soul, then perfection is meeting with perfection. One perfect soul is meeting with another perfect soul — birds of a feather flock together. It is like this: if one can see one's own perfection, then only is one going to see perfection in others. So in order to establish an inner connection with the United Nations one has to feel that one is nothing short of the soul. And the soul of the United Nations has to be placed at every moment before this mental vision.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The most important thing to remember while working at the United Nations is the vision of the United Nations. The vision of the United Nations is world peace and world harmony: one nation, one soul and one goal. While working at the United Nations, you have to sing all the time in the inmost recesses of your heart the oneness-song.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Music will play a most important role in bringing about world oneness, for music embodies the Universal Heart, the Oneness-Heart. Music transcends the barriers of nations, nationalities and religions. Music embodies universal Light and universal Truth, and music also embodies the oneness-reality which we see in universal Love, universal Light, universal Awareness and universal Wakefulness. Universal Wakefulness we see inside all music. Music has to play a most important role in bringing about world oneness, for music is the connecting link between the One and the many and between the many and the One.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can dedicate each task you do to the soul of the United Nations only if you feel that by doing this you are expediting and accelerating your own progress. If you separate your own progress from that of the United Nations, then you will not be able to dedicate each task to the soul of the United Nations. So you must feel that your own progress and the fulfilment of the United Nations are one and identical.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, the ideals of the United Nations should be applied to each and every human heart, mind, body and vital. These ideals are found in oneness-song. In every area of our lives there should be the message of oneness. The United Nations means the united reality, which is God's cosmic manifestation taking place through His cosmic Vision. The different nations here are like the petals of a flower; only if all the petals are together will they form a rose. If the petals are torn, if the petals are scattered, then we can't call it a rose. There has to be a oneness, and this oneness is based on the collectivity and the unification of reality. So the body, vital, mind, heart and soul of each individual must be united. If the body, vital, mind, heart and soul of each individual are united, that means that all the nations representing God-reality on earth can be united.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each drop is essential to the ocean. You may be holding a very insignificant job, but if you are taken away, one more drop will be missing from the ocean. And when all the drops are taken away, there is no ocean. It is the unification, the combination, of countless drops that makes the ocean.</p>
<p>Similarly, the whole United Nations right from the Secretary-General is only one body, one soul, one reality, which is composed of glowing thoughts and glowing ideals. You represent a thought in an infinitesimal measure. The capacity that you have is in the form of an ideal. The ideal is always the same, although you may or may not embody the ultimate truth that this ideal holds. But you do represent and embody an iota of the ultimate truth. Some individuals have perhaps a little more light than others, but it is the combination of everybody's light that makes the whole reality.</p>
<p>So, you as an individual, in whatever capacity you are serving, must feel that you are necessary, that you are needed. Like you there are many who make up the United Nations. If all are excluded precisely because they are not Secretaries-General, or because they are not holding high posts, then there will be no United Nations. When a house is built, there are many bricks, there are many nails. If one or two bricks are missing then there will be a hole. The walls will not be strong and the foundation will not be secure. So each one is necessary, each one is essential. Each worker, no matter how insignificant his task is, is necessary in order to keep the body and the soul of the United Nations together.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is really good not to have a rigid way of looking at life. If you have flexible ideas, if you are adaptable to circumstances, then it is infinitely easier to manifest the truth — not only here at the United Nations, but everywhere.</p>
<p>The outer reality or the outer consciousness has to be flexible so that the inner reality can easily manifest itself in and through the outer reality. The inner vision can manifest itself only in and through the outer field of manifestation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can show your gratitude to the United Nations by becoming gratitude itself. When you think of gratitude, imagine that a flower is growing inside you. And feel that this particular flower has to be placed at the Feet of the Absolute Supreme. By imagining that a beautiful flower is blossoming petal by petal and offering its fragrance inside your heart, you can easily offer your gratitude. Gratitude is something beautiful, extremely beautiful: beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful. And what is beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful in you or around you or before you? It is a flower. So that most beautiful thing you must try to have inside your heart, which is the real reality in you. So inside your heart, inside your reality, there should be something that is really beautiful, divinely beautiful, supremely beautiful. So if you can think all the time that this flower-heart is your only reality, then automatically you will be offering gratitude to the soul of the United Nations.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here we have to know that oneness can be found only in aspiration. There is no other place, there is no other reality where oneness can be found. It is in our own aspiration that we can have oneness. And how can we increase our oneness? We can increase our oneness on the strength of our more intense, more sincere, more soulful and all-loving, all-crying aspiration. If our aspiration increases, automatically our oneness increases. This oneness can easily be established, felt or, the best thing to say, realised, with the soul of the United Nations through an intense inner cry.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Joy, spontaneity and self-giving always go together. If one has a joyful heart, that means that one possesses spontaneity or a spontaneous heart and also that one is self-giving. Or we can say that self-giving is the hyphen, the connecting link, between joy and spontaneity. So, if one wants to be constantly self-giving to the omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent Reality, then one has to constantly cultivate inner joy. inside this inner joy, without fail one will find self-giving, and this self-giving embodies both spontaneity and joy.</p>
<p>How can you become self-giving? You can become self-giving by constantly feeling joy in every part of your existence from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head. If you can feel that a river is flowing in and through you carrying the message of joy, then automatically and spontaneously you can become self-giving in whatever you say, do or grow into.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can see through God's Eyes only when we feel our conscious, constant and all-loving oneness with our Inner Pilot, the Lord Supreme. First of all, if we live in the mind or in the vital, then we have to try to establish a free access to the inmost recesses of our heart. But if we already live in the heart, then we have to feel the Presence of the One who lives in the inmost recesses of our heart, the Lord Supreme. When we feel His Presence, at that time we have to go one step ahead and feel our inseparable and eternal oneness with Him. Once we feel our inseparable, eternal oneness with Him, then whatever we do, we feel that He is doing it in us, with us and through us and we are doing it in Him, with Him and through Him. So, if we want to do anything on our own, it will be a serious mistake. But if we want to do something in and through Him, then the thing that is of paramount importance is to establish our conscious and constant oneness with God, the Pilot Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can accept everyone who works at the United Nations as our very own provided we feel that there is only one source. Here let us say that the source is the soul of the United Nations. If we love the soul of the United Nations and can soulfully and devotedly claim the soul of the United Nations, then automatically we will accept all the members of the United Nations as our own. It is like the head of the family. If we love the head of the family, if we claim the head of the family as our own, then all the members of the family also become ours. Also, if we like someone, if that person has a dog or cow or any animal, we also like his animal. Just because we love him, anything that belongs to him we feel is ours. So the soul of the United Nations embodies all the members of the United Nations. Only by becoming consciously one with the source can we claim all the members as our own, our very own.</p>
