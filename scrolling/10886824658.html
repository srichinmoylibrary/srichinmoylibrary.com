  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I am sure that a lot of weightlifters will be inspired by articles about you to try concentration and meditation to improve their weightlifting, but if a weightlifter is not a spiritual seeker, will he actually be able to gain anything?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; I am sure that a lot of weightlifters will be inspired by articles about you to try concentration and meditation to improve their weightlifting, but if a weightlifter is not a spiritual seeker, will he actually be able to gain anything?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Directly he will not gain, because he is not a spiritual seeker, but indirectly he will gain. If he is a spiritual seeker, he will try to lead a better life, a life of serenity, purity and so forth. If he prays and meditates and does all the things that we do, then he will get direct help no matter which part of the world he lives in. He does not have to think of me, no, no. But because my consciousness is universal and he is appealing to the universal consciousness, he will receive something.</p>
<p>If the weightlifter is not a seeker, however, he can be inspired by what I am doing. His inspiration will be in the ego. He will think, "If he can do this, what is wrong with me? He is 55 years old, 5'8", and he weighs only 160 pounds." Like this, mentally he will compare himself with all my weaknesses. The first weakness, of course, is my age. I am 55 years old and he is perhaps only 22 years of age. Then he will have such joy. "If an old man can do it, I can do the same!" Then he will think of his weight. "He is only 160 pounds, and I am 230 or 250 pounds." A few advantages he has and he will try to bring these advantages to the fore. Then he will try to compete with me.</p>
<p>So if the weightlifter is a seeker, then he will get direct help from me. If he is not a seeker, then he will get indirect help in the sense that his ego will come forward, not the destructive ego but the ego that wants him to become stronger.</p>
<p>But in all sincerity I have to say that many of my lifts can only be done by a seeker, by a God-lover. I do not think that with physical strength alone anybody will be able to do them. If he has to depend on sheer physical strength, no human being will be able to do them, even if he weighs 300 or 400 pounds, absolutely no. Will-power, inner power, oneness-power with God's Will, all kinds of spiritual power he has to use in order to do it. Physical strength alone is not enough.</p>
<p>I received help because I am a seeker. I got help from the universal Force, from Above, from my Mother Kali and all. And so much goodwill I have received from good souls here, from my disciples, from the departed ones, from my parents, from my dear ones. I have received so much from the other worlds. Goodwill is strength, power, and that strength I have received from so many disciples and champions like Mahasamrat Bill Pearl and Jim Smith and others. Definitely they have given me solid strength. Any positive will is helpful. I have received help from human beings and from souls who are not in the physical I have received considerable help. Each goodwill is solid strength.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You used your will-power to make your wrist stronger. Could you also use it on your knee so that you can run again? Is there any reason why you cannot do that?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; You used your will-power to make your wrist stronger. Could you also use it on your knee so that you can run again? Is there any reason why you cannot do that?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I use my will-power and my will is supported by the universal Force, by God's Will, then I am able to lift up very heavy weights. But the condition of my knee is something entirely different. This morning I tried to walk one mile and I suffered so much because of my knee. The thing is that if I want to cure my knee, I will be able to do it. But there are some forces that are preventing me, not my forces. There are quite a few defects I have in my body, specially in my knee, because I have not yet solved certain problems. In this knee I have taken the karmas of quite a few people. If I use will-power, I can throw these forces out, but I do not want to do that. So many times, before they are manifested on the physical plane, I take the ailments of my disciples. Some disciples would have gone to God long ago, and some are getting serious diseases like cancer. For them, it is a matter of life and death. My knee is the storehouse of all these accumulated weaknesses. In one sense, I will be the happiest person if I can have a better knee, but I cannot do that because I am not allowed. I am bound by my own law.</p>
<p>When it comes to my wrist, I am not affected in the same way. Here I have made no law, so I can do it. It is very complicated. Many things I cannot do because I have said I will not do these particular things under such circumstances. Then afterwards, I am the sufferer. In the inner plane, by becoming one with my near and dear ones, I am happy because they do not have to suffer. But on the outer plane, how much I suffer, how much I suffer!</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Do not pray, do not pray! Why torture yourself ? I only want you to have goodwill for my weightlifting, that is all. Your prayer means your goodwill. Unfortunately, some people have become jealous of my achievements in the weightlifting world. Does jealousy have any sense? It is absurdity on the face of it! Luckily, their jealousy could not prevent me from lifting.</p>
<p>I have some critics also. They have said that I am not lifting 300 and 400 pounds as high as I lifted the 100-pound dumbbell. Fortunately, Jim Smith has defended me. He says that when it is a matter of the heaviest weights, we just have to pass a piece of paper underneath to show that I have lifted it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Because of what you are doing with these weights, is there a permanent change in the evolution of the inconscience world?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; Because of what you are doing with these weights, is there a permanent change in the evolution of the inconscience world?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I will not be able to say. In my case, evolution is taking place, but again this evolution can be compared to an aeroplane. The aeroplane is getting better, but the pilot has to become better also. In my case, I am seeing that I have brought a little light into inconscience, but I will not be able to say, like the science and scientists, that it is now for all. This is the difficulty. Evolution of consciousness is not like the scientists' achievements. When they do something, immediately the whole world gets the benefit. If you have a little money, you can buy all kinds of modern electronics, but here it is not like that. Some people who are aspiring can get this light, but it is very limited. I cannot say that it is in the universe now. Yes, in theory it has taken place, but when it is a practical matter, I will have to look around and see where there is a little aspiration; there my light will work. There are many places with this kind of inconscience or resistance where I will be able to offer my light. But I will not be able to say that in every nook and corner of the world I will be successful, no.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Did you have any inner experiences with the Cosmic Gods and Goddesses when you lifted 1,300 pounds and 1,500 pounds with one arm?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; Did you have any inner experiences with the Cosmic Gods and Goddesses when you lifted 1,300 pounds and 1,500 pounds with one arm?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From 1,300 pounds on, Mother Kali, my dearest Goddess, is the only one. Today, before my assistants dismantled the dumbbell, I took Mother Kali's picture and I placed it on each metal plate. On each plate I put her blessings before we brought it down.</p>
<p>Each time I lift up a heavy weight, I see her standing with one foot on each side of the weight. She makes me feel that the weight is so light. Then I see occultly that it has gone up. This confidence she gives that it has already gone up. And sometimes she will say, "My child, it is already done." Then I will see a garland on her, around her. But while I am lifting, I see the garland is not there; it is on my neck. So these are my cock-and-bull stories. She is all the time with me when I am lifting.</p>
<p>Then there are others who come. When it was a matter of 1,300 pounds and 1,500 pounds, I saw the souls of Nivedita and my sister Lily. My sister is still on the physical plane and Nivedita is in the other world. My sister was absolutely dead against this lift. She was afraid I would have serious injuries. Even when I was successfully holding the weight, my sister was dead against it. Meanwhile, Nivedita's soul was saying, "No, my Lord can do it, my Lord can do it." Finally, when I did it, my sister was very happy.</p>
<p>The previous lift — 1,300 pounds — the soul of this Canadian lady, Nivedita, was all the time moving around telling me that I can do it. I go to this side to take preliminary exercises and I hear her telling me that I can do it. She has a most beautiful soul. Like a fairy, it was moving around me all the time saying, "My Lord, you can do it." I was uncertain, but she was going on, going on.</p>
<p>Since her passing, Nivedita's soul has come to me three times. These lifting experiences are most significant. On the one hand, my sister's soul was telling me not to lift because she was so worried, and there, side-by-side, Nivedita's soul was telling me that I can do it. So you can see how many things are happening in the inner world! Two persons have different opinions and Mother Kali is saying lift—how can one person handle everything? Only if you have inner poise. Otherwise, you will just drop the weight. You will say that he is bothering me, she is bothering me. But I am not bothered.</p>
<p>I have many, many juicy stories before the lift, during the lift and after the lift. Many, many stories. In a matter of a fleeting second, not even a second, I am seeing how many things are happening. It is not that my mind is roaming here and there, no. I am concentrating, but I am seeing that here and there it is all going on. In the sky we see that birds are flying, but we do not see any trace of the birds. The sky is not affected. It is like that; I am unaffected.</p>
<p>When the mind is calm and quiet and vacant, nothing will affect it. But if the mind is not calm, quiet and vacant, then at every moment it is affected. It does not have to be bad thoughts; even good thoughts can affect the mind. Sometimes, when people are upset, even good thoughts affect them. Let us say that you are upset. If someone says to you even a nice word, you hate him because you are in a very low consciousness. Afterwards, you realise, "He was so kind to me, he was greeting me in such a nice way." But at the time, you were already upset, so his good thoughts, his smile, his love, will not do anything for you.</p>
<p>If you are in a very high consciousness, on the other hand, at that time even if people are not polite to you, if they are unkind to you, you will not be affected.</p>
<p>Again, sometimes it can happen that when you have come down from your highest meditation, you have tremendous intensity. At that time, if somebody misbehaves or says something unkind to you, you become more furious. This is nothing but an attack of the hostile forces to ruin your highest height. You have to know that many times it has happened during your life, you have reached a very high consciousness during your meditation, and the next moment you see somebody whom you do not like. That person does not have to say a word to you, nothing. Just because he or she is your enemy, you direct all your intense dislike at that person. Then your high consciousness disappears. All the intensity that you had accumulated from the meditation for half an hour or an hour is ruined. So the hostile force brought that person right in front of you. One hour it took you to go to the highest Himalayas, then that person appeared before you and everything was finished!</p>
<p>If you had a little more wisdom, then immediately for that particular second you would have offered your love and goodwill to your so-called enemy. That is the only way to save yourself and preserve all your highest meditation that you had, your good thoughts, your elevated consciousness and so on. If you had wisdom at that time, then for that fleeting second if you had offered your goodwill to that person whom you may not like at all, then you would not have been affected. It is your own stupidity that caused you to descend. Then you lost all the inner wealth that you had accumulated. Your treasure, you lost it.</p>
<p>So often it happens that people lose their highest meditation. Even if the other party is a friend it can happen. You are still in your highest, let us say, and you are going out of the building. If somebody says even hello to you, or anything unimportant, you do not have the oneness-power to remain unaffected. You maintain your pride that you have gone so high, then you become mad at the person and you become the loser. You think that person has lowered your consciousness, so you are mad. I assure you, if you come down to that person's hello-consciousness, you are not going to lose anything, but when you are angry, upset, that he or she has lowered your consciousness, that means you have definitely lowered your own consciousness. This is all one hundred per cent true. Have you people experienced this or not? Or is it all my imagination? Is there anybody who thinks that I am wrong?</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to go higher! When we have an obstacle — on the physical, vital, mental, psychic or spiritual plane—we can either approach the obstacle as an enemy, which everybody does, an obstacle race, a hindrance, or we can say: "Here is an opportunity to strengthen my capacity. This is an obstacle; I will overcome it."</p>
<p>Not to take this obstacle as an enemy, but to take it as something that is unconsciously helping us to increase our capacity. If we ignore it, if we avoid it, then automatically we will increase our strength to surpass it. If we take each obstacle as an enemy, then when we use our aggression and anger, immediately we increase the power of that obstacle. But if we do not take the obstacle as an opponent, we can try to surpass that obstacle either by ignoring it or avoiding it or expanding it. In so many ways, we can go beyond that obstacle. But if we take it as an enemy, then our problem starts right from the beginning. You cross this person or that incident in your life and there is no end. Today this one is an enemy, tomorrow that one, the day after tomorrow somebody else.</p>
<p>It is not the person as such who is your enemy, it is the forces in them, in those people, in you, in me. Always we have to take the forces into account, not the person. Those people are as helpless as we are. Even as we are helpless, those people are also helpless. That we have to know. They are at the mercy of wrong forces as we are at the mercy of wrong forces. We are at the mercy at a certain time; they are at the mercy at a certain time. Always wrong forces are there to attack us.</p>
<p>There is another thing that weakens us and that is mental expectation. In our mind, we create thoughts and from those thoughts we expect something to happen. Since we created those thoughts, we think that, like children, they have to obey us. But they do not obey us; they do not listen to us. They are like unruly boys.</p>
<p>You have created the thoughts, true, but do not expect from them. If good thoughts do you a favour, wonderful. But just because you created them, you cannot expect anything of them. You created a plant, let us say, but then the plant dies. It does not live. So here is the thing: always do not expect, even from your own good thoughts. Your business is to create good thoughts, but those good thoughts may not come to help you at the moment you want to be helped by them. They may come at some other time to help you. Or they will help you in their own way, in their own time. But you are expecting them, here, now, at this moment and they are nowhere to be found. Then you lose your will-power, your capacities, because you are annoyed at them.</p>
<p>Whenever you show aggression or anger, immediately your inner strength goes away. Never think that anger is strength. Anger is absolutely weakness. As soon as you become angry, immediately your psychic strength from your heart goes away. So when the anger-attack comes, you have to say, "I will have nothing to do with you." Try to maintain your inner poise. I have a few good qualities. My soul's poise is still by far the best. It is my highest quality.</p>

<p>Throughout the lift, and specially at the end, I was invoking the Blessing-Light, Compassion-Light, of my Beloved Supreme. That is what we all must do when we want to achieve something momentous, something fruitful in our lives. Sleeplessly and breathlessly, inwardly and outwardly, we must invoke the Compassion-Light of our Lord Beloved Supreme if we want to achieve something divinely great and supremely good in order to manifest Him here on earth.</p>
<p>In the inner world miracles do take place. At every moment, there are countless miracles, but they are not called miracles in the inner world. They are mere incidents. But in the outer world, when something unusual takes place, we call it a miracle. Again, it is nothing but the inner light that comes to the fore to increase our faith in our own spiritual life, in our oneness-life with our Inner Pilot. God Himself manifests something that will help us to increase our faith in Him.</p>
<p>We all must increase our faith in our Inner Pilot every day, every hour, every minute, every second, if we want to make the fastest progress in our spiritual life. And our spiritual life encompasses the outer life. We have accepted the world in order to illumine it and transform it and make it a reliable, dependable, suitable and, finally, choice instrument of our Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>The outer capacities must blossom from the inner qualities and capacities. These inner capacities come from God's unconditional Compassion and the outer capacities represent His unconditional Satisfaction.</p>
<p>The inner life of aspiration and the outer life of dedication must go together, together, together. When the highest Will wants to manifest Itself in and through the physical body, the physical body must develop receptivity so that in the outer life, soulfully and devotedly, we can bring to the fore what we have within. Here I am not extolling myself to the skies. Here I am only offering my gratitude-heart sleeplessly and breathlessly to my Lord Beloved Supreme, for He chose me to be an instrument of His to manifest His divine Light in and through the physical plane.</p>
<p>Try to be one with the Will of our Lord Supreme and try to manifest His divine Will, supreme Will, in and through each action of your daily life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When do you know that you have achieved all that you wished to achieve in a certain lift?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; When do you know that you have achieved all that you wished to achieve in a certain lift?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am now lifting 155 pounds with both arms simultaneously. But I do not want to see the future. If I want to know the future, I can know easily. But I always allow inspiration to carry me as long as God wants it to carry me. By opening up my third eye, I can know God's Will. Then if God wants to change His Will, I immediately obey Him. As long as God wants me to do something, I will continue doing it.</p>
<p>It is always good to be a discoverer instead of an inventor. Then we get more joy. God has kept everything inside us, only we have to discover that hidden truth, hidden light. If we start inventing, then we become the doer, whereas, if we are the discoverer, Somebody else has done it and that Person is God.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Of all your lifts, which was the hardest?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The one that I cannot lift. Seven thousand pounds I lifted; only your third eye is needed to see the invisible! Three hundred pounds I failed so many times; God wanted the world to value patience. That is why 300 took such a long time. Then a few years ago, it took me many tries to lift 213 pounds.</p>
<p>The hardest thing is to lift up the human consciousness. It is like trying to straighten a dog's tail! The last time you straighten it, you have the feeling that it is going to remain straight. But again it curves to become even more curled. In the same way, we feel the consciousness of human beings is not going to drop again.</p>
<p>Before you lift up metal plates, you remember that they are going to fall down. But it is infinitely worse with human consciousness. Before you lift it, you know it is going to fall down. What is the use of lifting it? You know that like glass it will break. That is why you get such bitter experiences when you try to raise the consciousness of human beings.</p>

<p>You can call it nature's excitement. Nature is participating or threatening. I take it as nature's encouragement. It is an inner outburst of nature. Nature is already excited.</p>

<p>Father, with you I am going to complete 640 individuals who have inspired and uplifted the consciousness of mankind, and I am so happy, so grateful to you for giving me an opportunity to be of dedicated service to you.</p>
<p>My immediate goal is to lift 700 individuals who have inspired mankind in all kinds of ways, in all walks of life. But my ultimate goal is to love God the Creator and serve God the Creation, sleeplessly and unconditionally, until I breathe my last. This is my ultimate goal.</p>
<p>(<em>After the programme, Sri Chinmoy reflected:</em>)</p>
<p>Tonight I will be lifting up 26 doctors and nurses. Body, vital, mind, heart and soul — everything — should go together. We are now in the spiritual world. And in three hours' time I will deal with the medical world.</p>
<p>The spiritual world and the medical world go together so we can become better instruments of our Lord Supreme in body and spirit. The medical world helps us conquer death in its own way, and then through our prayers and meditations we try to conquer death in our own way.</p>
