  <h2 id="page-title">My maternal uncle</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My maternal uncle" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My maternal uncle was my father's greatest friend and admirer. He was so fond of our family. All our requests he used to fulfil. My father was also very fond of him.</p>
<p>One day my father's bank was robbed by my mother's nephew â€” her sister's son. My father and mother had brought this boy up, and when he robbed the bank my maternal uncle felt miserable. He felt miserable because the bank had been robbed by a close relative. He also thought that because our bank had been robbed, my father would become poor. My father said, "We have plenty of money in other banks and also property."</p>
<p>But my uncle eventually became insane because he had such affection for all the members of our family. He finally committed suicide by jumping under a train. My mother was thin and weak, but when she heard that her brother had died, it was such a shock that she practically turned a somersault in the air! That day such spirit entered into my mother. She had the energy of a three-year old. She cried so bitterly. They were so close to each other. What kind of suffering!</p>
<p>On the day my uncle died, my father went to the crematory hall. When everything was over, my father's eyes were flooded with tears.</p>
<p>When he was alive, my maternal uncle used to beg my father to give up smoking. My father would always do anything that my maternal uncle asked, but in this matter of smoking my father didn't listen. When my uncle died, my father was so sad. He said, "I could not fulfil your request while you were alive. But today I have to listen to you." On that day my father gave up smoking.</p>

<p>Once someone brought a lawsuit against my father. It was a real joke! The man was unnecessarily harassing my father. The man who was supposed to defend my father was very close to our family. He came to our house before he and my father went to court and ate with us. But later at the court he went against my father.</p>
<p>This man died a few months later. He had a young son and a young daughter. There was nobody to look after them. My father said, "Once upon a time he was my friend. He could not remain my friend, but I have to prove that I was his friend." So my father paid for the son's and daughter's schooling. He even paid for the son to go to college. That fellow had brothers and other relatives, but they didn't care for his children.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My father and the occultist</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My father and the occultist" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My father had a distant relative who was a great occultist. The occultist was very spiritual, and he was very fond of both my father and my mother.</p>
<p>This relative never paid any attention to studies; he didn't even go to primary school. But since he was a very great occultist, many people used to visit him when they were in trouble. If a cow was stolen, he would tell the owner to go to a particular place to find it.</p>
<p>This occultist helped my father many times. Once my father went to him when my brother Chitta was very sick. Both Chitta and a relative's son were seriously ill in the hospital. The occultist said to my father, "Doctors are useless! They won't be able to cure your son. Here, I am giving you blessing ash from the feet of Mother Kali. If you put this on your son's head, he will be all right."</p>
<p>My father went to the hospital and put the ashes on my brother's head. Because of his great love and respect for my father, the occultist helped my brother Chitta. But when the relative whose son was also in the hospital went to the occultist, the occultist said, "God is also in the doctors," and he did not help him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the doctor's medicine did not do the needful. The relative's son died, and my brother recovered. So the occultist's ash saved my brother, whereas the doctor's medicine could not cure our relative's son.</p>
<p>There is another very striking story about this occultist. My father felt sorry for a particular family that had opened up a shop and gone bankrupt. People were bothering them to pay their debts, so my father wrote them a postcard promising to give them some money. The family kept the postcard and planned to use it in court to prove that my father was responsible for their debts.</p>
<p>A friend of my father heard about this and told the occultist about it. The occultist said, "I will take care of it." The friend had faith in him and told my father not to worry. When the particular family brought the postcard to court, the judge saw that there was no signature on it. So he said that my father could not be held responsible. From a distant Indian village the occultist removed the signature in the court in the town, just before the judge looked at the postcard.</p>
<p>Once my father and a friend went to see the occultist very late at night, around midnight. Village people usually go to bed around eight o'clock, so by that time everyone in the village was fast asleep. The occultist happened to be meditating, and he saw inwardly that my father and a friend were coming. He had tremendous respect for my father, so he woke up his mother and said, "They have been travelling for a long time and they have not eaten. Please cook something." When my father and his friend arrived, the food was ready.</p>
<p>One day this occultist went to Calcutta, and people begged him to give a talk. His first sentence was, "Without God everything is a broomstick." The word he used for broomstick was in the Chittagong dialect, which the Calcutta people did not know. They thought it was a mantra, and they started repeating it.</p>
<p>In the audience were five or six women from Chittagong. They started laughing. The Calcutta people were furious that the Chittagong people were so rude, and the Chittagong people were so embarrassed that the Calcutta people were repeating the occultist's 'mantra!'</p>
<p>When the occultist was a young man, his parents forced him to get married even though he did not want to. When he saw his wife in the palanquin, he cried, "Bondage, bondage!" and jumped out. Then he ran away. What a calamity he created!</p>
<p>In later years he allowed his wife to come back to him, but she never cared for meditation â€” never! When he died, the occultist's disciples tried to persuade her to take his place, but she refused. She said, "No, I cannot accept your pranams and all your devotion."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The carbuncle</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The carbuncle" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once one of my relatives developed a big boil. We call it a carbuncle, and it is very painful. It was not bursting at all, so the doctor said that my relative needed an operation. But when it was time for the operation, he was frightened to death. Although he was suffering unbearable pain, my relative said that anything was better than having an operation.</p>
<p>We had a Muslim servant who considered himself a doctor. He had no degree in medicine, but he used all kinds of herbs and natural remedies. The servant went to my father and said that he would be able to cure our relative. My father said, "Nobody has faith in you. Do you really think that you will be able to cure him?"</p>
<p>The servant had such respect for my father. With folded hands he said, "How could I tell you lies?"</p>
<p>The servant took an eggplant and removed the pulp. Then inside he put all kinds of things â€” mustard oil, ginger and other herbs and spices from the kitchen. Then he said his own mantra and placed the eggplant not on top of the carbuncle but alongside it.</p>
<p>Then what happened? The carbuncle burst! It did not take even ten minutes.</p>
<p>My relatives wanted to give the servant some money. He said, "I can't take anything," but they kept insisting. Finally the servant said to my father, "I am always ridiculed and sometimes insulted. If you want to return my favour, please tell people who criticise me that I know a little about medicine. That will be enough of a reward."</p>
<p>My father was like the head of the village; he always got so much appreciation. He told everyone that the servant knew how to cure carbuncles and other ailments. From then on people took the servant seriously.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The bone in the throat</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The bone in the throat" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My father had the capacity to remove bones that were caught in people's throats. If someone had been eating meat or fish and if a bone got stuck in his throat, my father knew how to remove it occultly.</p>
<p>Just before my father's death, when I was ten years old, a middle-aged Muslim got a bone stuck in his throat. He went to so many doctors, and they all said he had to undergo a serious operation. He couldn't eat anything and he was in absolute agony, but he was afraid of having an operation. The Muslim found out that my father had the capacity to remove bones from people's throats, so he came to see my father along with two or three of his friends. By that time the Muslim had become very, very weak because he had not been able to eat for so many days, and he was screaming and crying in agony.</p>
<p>Usually when Muslims came to our house, they were not allowed to go past the courtyard, which was sixty or seventy metres from the main house. So this Muslim was told to wait in the courtyard. At that time my father was bedridden and he was near death. Everybody was annoyed that at this time a Muslim had to come to bother him.</p>
<p>My brother and uncle thought that perhaps because my father was on his deathbed, he had lost the capacity to remove bones from people's throats. So they casually asked him if he still had the capacity. He said, "Yes, I have the capacity. Is there anybody suffering from that problem in the family?"</p>
<p>They said, "It is not anyone in the family, but somebody else â€” a Muslim." My brother and my uncle were dead against his using his capacity to help the man. They said, "We do not want a Muslim to come into your room."</p>
<p>My father said, "He can stay in the courtyard and I will cure him from my bed. Just ask him to lie down."</p>
<p>My father rubbed his throat three or four times, breathed heavily a few times and coughed. Then he said, "Go and see!" When the family members went out to the courtyard, they found out that the bone in the Muslim's throat had disappeared. The Muslim was crying with joy. He wanted to give my father some money, but my father would not accept it.</p>
<p>That was my father's last act for a Muslim. He did not know the Muslim; he was not even an acquaintance of my father. But just because he was suffering my father helped him.</p>
<p>Two or three days later my father died.</p>

<p>My father had other kinds of occult power as well. He could look at a pumpkin while it was still on the vine and say how many seeds were inside. When we would cut it up and count all the seeds, it would be exactly the number he had said. That I saw only twice, but other members of my family saw it many times. My father could also take away very severe headaches.</p>
<p>When I was a little boy, I used to beg him and beg him to teach me occultism. He never did, but by the time I was thirteen or fourteen years old, occultism descended on me like a torrential rain.</p>

I was such a fool! I went to my father and told him that my brother had such a nice dhoti and he would not give it to me.</p>
<p>My father got the point. He said to my brother, "I am not going to die soon. You give it to him!"</p>
<p>When my father uttered the word "die," I felt miserable, and tears came into my eyes. After that I didn't take my brother's dhoti.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The two patients</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The two patients" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>At one point my father and mother were both sick. The two patients were staying in separate rooms. Whenever the doctor came, my father would say, "I am not needed. If I die, my wife will take care of the children. But if she dies, the whole family will collapse. So please go and take care of her."</p>
<p>But my mother would tell the doctor, "Please go and cure him. I am insignificant." Each of them used to send the doctor to take care of the other one. Finally, my father would compel the doctor to take care of my mother first.</p>
<p>So many doctors worked on my mother. My father had only one or two doctors, but my mother had doctor after doctor. She was sick for a year and a half. She suffered so much!</p>
<p>My father lived to be 62, but my mother never reached 50. My mother died only one year after my father. This is the proof of their deep soul's connection.</p>

<p>One of my father's very close friends was Govinda Das. On the day he died, my father said, "I am leaving. He is going to follow me very soon." His prophecy proved correct. A few days later Govinda Das also left the body.</p>

<p>After my father was cremated, we came back home and everybody was crying and crying. Who would console whom? In three hours' time a Bengali newspaper called Panchajanya, or "Krishna's Conch," came out with an article all about my father. When I looked at the article, I received such consolation. As soon as I read how nice and how great my father was, I stopped crying.</p>
<p>Even then, for weeks I would look at his picture early In the morning and cry. I would appreciate, admire and adore him, saying, "Oh, I am his son."</p>

<p>In India they observe quite a few rituals when someone dies. For a month after someone dies, the family will put all kinds of food in front of the house in case the person who has just died is still hungry.</p>
<p>Our family put food out when my father died. Very often we saw a dog come to eat it. At first we got annoyed, but then the village brahmin gave us sound advice. He said, "No, your father has taken the form of a dog and is eating the food."</p>
<p>After that we used to be very moved whenever a dog came. I observed this at least six or seven times with tears in my eyes, thinking, "Oh, my father is eating." The dog would eat the food, and I would look at the dog with such affection.</p>
<p>This was just a village custom, but we observed it for one month after my father died, and also after my mother died.</p>

<p>When somebody dies in an Indian family, it is a custom that for the next three days the relatives cannot get married.</p>
<p>The day my father died, it happened that one of my second cousins was supposed to get married. Early in the morning it came out in two newspapers that my father had died, and my father's dead body was outside in the courtyard. But my cousin's parents became very clever. They pretended they did not know that my father had died. They thought they would be able to deceive everybody.</p>
<p>But when the bride's family came to learn that my father had died, they did not want their daughter to be married that day because of my father's death. My cousin's family and the bride's family quarrelled and fought like anything. Finally the bride's family agreed to the marriage and my cousin's family was very happy. But what the bride's family did was this. The girl had a brother who had the same kind of beautiful face as his sister. Her family put a sari on the son and decorated his body so that he looked like the bride.</p>
<p>It is an Indian custom that the husband and wife don't see each other before the day of the marriage. The parents make all the decisions for their children. When my cousin saw the beautiful face of his bride, he was very happy. My cousin and his bride were riding in the palanquin together during the three-and-a-half-mile journey from the bride's house to his house.</p>
<p>After some time the brother made his voice sound like a woman's voice and asked if they could stop for a minute so he could respond to nature's call. The palanquin bearers let him out, and he took a few steps very slowly. Then suddenly he threw off the sari and ran away. The others saw that it was a boy, but they could not catch him. My cousin was so furious that he refused to marry that particular girl. Eventually he married somebody else.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My father&#039;s desire</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My father&#039;s desire" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I am talking to someone on the outer plane, at the same time I am talking to so many people in the inner world. Once after I scolded some of my disciples, both my mother and father came to me from the soul's world. My mother said, "Yes, you are their real father. On the one hand, you show them affection and love, and on the other hand you are quite strict."</p>
<p>My physical father comes to me only rarely, on very significant occasions. My mother comes on every occasion â€” for every little thing. If I have a toothache or high fever, my mother will come. She has a very free access. No matter what mood I am in, she comes. She comes with good news, bad news, sad news, any news just for a chat. She will come God knows how many times â€” seventy or a hundred times a year, or even more. But my father comes only on rare occasions â€” perhaps five or six times a year. At those times he stands before me full of compassion and concern.</p>
<p>One day in October 1973, my father came to speak to me. When my father comes, he appears as I remember him, although the soul can take any form. When he came to me on this occasion, he said that he would not be satisfied with my writing only two hundred books. He wants me to write one thousand books! I said, "Am I doomed to stay on earth such a long time?" He laughed and laughed. He knows quite well how many years I will stay on earth.</p>
<p>Out of one thousand books, he said, perhaps only thirty books need not be spiritual in the strict sense of the term. Can you imagine, only thirty books he excluded! My joke books and a few others fall under that category.</p>
<p>One thousand books: a father's desire, a father's dream! He said I should write one thousand books just because I have the capacity to do it. He didn't tell me outwardly how many years it would take, but intuitively he gave me the message. He is one hundred percent sure that I will be able to do it.</p>
<p>I am ready to take up that challenge. You may think that it is impossible for me to fulfil my father's desire, but you have to know that I have another father, a Supreme Father, my real Father, my only Father. Is anything impossible for that Father to do in and through me? Now, to my utter surprise, I am almost fulfilling my father's desire. I have covered a long way: over 861 books go to my credit.</p>

<p>A week before my father's centenary, I gave a concert at Carnegie Hall. Immediately after the performance I saw Sri Krishna, Shiva, my parents and my other relatives all on the stage. They were all so happy, delighted and excited. I was seeing them not only with my third eye, but even with my physical eyes.</p>
<p>My father was very happy with the centenary celebration we were holding for him. He is very pleased and very proud of his youngest son and his disciples.</p>
