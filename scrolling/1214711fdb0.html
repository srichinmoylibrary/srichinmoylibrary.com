<p>Education is cultivation of knowledge. The outer world feels that world-information is enough for cultivation of knowledge. The inner world feels that there is only one kind of knowledge that can cure the ignorance-night which is humanity’s malady of millennia. The cure is called wisdom-light.</p>
<p>U Thant the education-seer illumines us about education, outer and inner: <em>“In Asia, if I may say so, the traditional aim of education is to impress on the young the importance of the mind rather than the body, and even more basically, the importance of the spirit rather than the mind. Education thus becomes inward looking, and the aim of education is the discovery of one’s self rather than the discovery of things external to us.”</em></p>
<p>There are two aspects to reality: the body-reality and the soul-reality. The body-reality looks around for its satisfaction. The soul-reality looks within for its satisfaction. The Eastern approach or, let us say, the Asian approach to reality is to dive deep within and discover the soul and, thus, know everything and become everything. The other approach, which we may call the Western approach, instructs us to look inside the body-reality and around the body-reality to see what it really is and what it can contribute to world-success.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">U Thant the friend of the mass media</h2><span property="dc:title" content="U Thant the friend of the mass media" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>U Thant, ever a friend to the mass media, wrote in the September 1955 issue of <em>Guardian Magazine: “One of the impressions I have gained... is the essential similarity of national characters on which a world-wide understanding can be built and global solidarity can rest. Everywhere men and women, young and old, love peace, enjoy a good joke and lead affectionate family lives. No doubt mass media... have bred in the minds of people certain prejudices and bias... but I believe that the same mass media... can turn such people into their real selves.”</em></p>
<p>Individuals can go together, mix together and fulfil themselves together. There is and there will always be an underlying oneness, an essential similarity of human beings, nations and national characters. It is not that each one must discover his goal totally apart from the rest of the world. Together we must strive to achieve the selfsame goal, for it is collective oneness alone that can grant us perfect satisfaction.</p>
<p>Again, we are afraid that the mass media have created tremendous confusion in life, a sense of superiority and inferiority that can ruin human minds. But U Thant’s prophetic utterance is that the same mass media can help human beings see, realise and become their true selves.</p>

<p><em>In an interview in</em> The Saturday Evening Post <em>of 21 September 1963, David Sureck asked U Thant:</em></p>
<p>“The first United Nations Secretary-General, Trygve Lie has described your job as ‘the most impossible job in the world.’ What did you think about it on the day you were sworn in?”</p>
<p>U Thant’s answer was: “A feeling of humility and an overwhelming sense of responsibility, to which was added a dawning hope that the unanimous support which has so generously been accorded to me would make ‘the most impossible job in the world’ a little less impossible.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">U Thant the champion of human dignity</h2><span property="dc:title" content="U Thant the champion of human dignity" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Dignity is not a philosophical dream. Dignity is not an expression of ego’s aggrandisement. Dignity is a supreme necessity if we want to touch each other, feel each other and realise each other on a higher level of consciousness.</p>
<p>U Thant the champion of human dignity says: <em>“…The dignity and worth of the human person is not merely a philosophic concept. It is, and should be, a working principle of human existence guiding our daily lives. Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves. This, as the sages of many lands have taught us, is a golden rule in individual and group, as well as international, relations.”</em></p>
<p>When we show our dignity, we bring to the fore our divine capacities. When others show their dignity, they also do the same thing. In the expression of dignity, all of us bring forward our inner, divine, illumining and fulfilling capacities and we triumphantly arrive at a higher goal which has been the aspiration of human beings from time immemorial. The sages of the hoary past offered us this sublime vision, and now we are trying in our own age to transform this vision into concrete reality.</p>

<p>U Thant has served the world in various capacities, but he started his career as a schoolteacher. We notice in him a born teacher of mankind. He taught the world how to bring to the fore the capacities of the heart and thus create a oneness-world.</p>
<p>U Thant the teacher of mankind offered this momentous advice in his farewell speech: <em>“In this world, try to be both good and able men. If you do not become able men, at least try to be good men. The country has no use for able but bad men.”</em></p>
<p>According to him, what the world needs is a combination of good men and able men. It is good men and able men combined that can create a new society, new progress, new perfection.</p>

<p>In an address to the General Assembly commemorating the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, U Thant the world citizen declared: <em>“In this age of the jet plane and the Telstar, the world is fast becoming a community, a community with common interests and common aspirations. Gone are the days when each nation was an island unto itself. Today, questions of human rights are a matter of international concern.”</em></p>
<p>U Thant not only felt humanity’s excruciating pangs but also became one with humanity’s astounding progress. This progress gave him abundant joy and a true sense of satisfaction. He saw that mind-division is surrendering to heart-oneness and national pride is yielding to international light, creating a new and illumining world-society.</p>

<p>With his cosmopolitan heart, the unparalleled seeker U Thant climbed up the aspiration-tree to a surprisingly lofty height. From there he illumined the votaries of the world-illumining religious faiths.</p>
<p>At the opening of the African Summit Conference in Cairo on 19 July 1964, U Thant the exemplar of religious tolerance said: <em>“How are we to practise tolerance? What states of mind are necessary for all of us to live together in peace with one another as good neighbours? How are we to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security? The answers to these questions lie, it seems to me, in our ability to bring out the best in us and to return to the basic moral and ethical principles of all great religions. Let us, therefore, dedicate ourselves anew to a new pledge: to make Muslims better Muslims, Hindus better Hindus, Christians better Christians and Buddhists better Buddhists.”</em></p>

  <h2 id="page-title">U Thant the visionary</h2><span property="dc:title" content="U Thant the visionary" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>U Thant feels that as different religions live in the peace room, even so societies can live in the peace room. There is no hard and fast rule that societies cannot have the same inner growth and the same outer broadness as religions.</p>
<p>U Thant the visionary says: <em>“...As Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and all other religions are existing peacefully in amity, I believe a day will come when these different societies — communist societies, capitalist societies, socialist societies, and any other type of societies — are going to exist peacefully. I believe in these things.”</em></p>
<p>Peace is within, peace is without. The core of society we touch with our inner peace. The body of society we touch with our outer peace. The inner peace unites the heart and the soul of the world. The outer peace unites the body and the mind of the world.</p>
<p>Spirituality has achieved considerable success in casting aside unfortunate and unlit conflicts with regard to religious beliefs that once upon a time dominated the human mind. Likewise, aspiration is going to achieve towering success in different societies. U Thant’s belief in these things is nothing short of his infallible vision.</p>

<p>U Thant, the United Nations pilot, while most successfully steering the United Nations boat, voiced forth during a United Nations Day address in 1964: <em>“The United Nations... is simply an Organization, serving all nations but dominated by none, which has the continual obligation to avoid disaster and misery and to provide for a better and more productive future for all peoples. The emergence of such a mechanism is both a great step forward and a historic challenge. This is, indeed, an idea to possess men’s souls.”</em></p>

<p>U Thant speaks on behalf of the soul of the United Nations with regard to the common goal: <em>“Here in the United Nations we also have a basic aim in common, which is to preserve the peace and to enhance human happiness and dignity throughout the world in accordance with our Charter.”</em></p>
<p>At the United Nations, many nations with different opinions are working together. Although outwardly they seem to have divergent goals, they are running towards an inner goal which is nothing short of a common goal.</p>

<p>On 22 December 1971, U Thant expressed his boundless confidence in Kurt Waldheim and warmly welcomed him as his worthy successor:</p>
<p><em>“I was right to insist that I should leave my office at this time. In doing so I am greatly heartened and encouraged by the thought that I shall be leaving this office in such capable hands.</em></p>
<p><em>I have known Ambassador Waldheim ever since he first came to New York as Permanent Representative of Austria to the United Nations in 1964. Subsequently he has been Foreign Minister of his own country, and I was personally very pleased when he was reappointed as Permanent Representative of Austria to the United Nations last year. I know that he is held in very high esteem by all of those who have come to know him during his many years in New York. Apart from his wellknown diplomatic ability, he has shown a special talent for conciliation in his work as Chairman of the Outer Space Committee and in other United Nations bodies. I wish him every success in his new and high responsibilities.”</em></p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Letter to Aye Aye Thant</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Letter to Aye Aye Thant" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Dear Aye Aye,<br /> Your beloved Father and my beloved spiritual Brother, U Thant, will always triumphantly stand in the vanguard of humanity’s soulful success and fruitful progress.</p>
<p>I liked him. I admired him. I adored him. I loved him. I liked him because in him I saw a sea of simplicity, humility and purity. I admired him because I saw a wisdom-sun upon him constantly radiating its unhorizoned effulgence. I adored him because his heart’s Illumination lovingly covered the length and breadth of the entire world. I loved him because his life of self-giving to humanity’s Cry and Divinity’s Smile made him the supremely perfect instrument of the Lord Buddha.</p>
<p>Your unparalleled oneness-heart with your Father’s vastness-heart and your Father’s soul-concern for you have touched the very depth of my heart. The human in us misses him badly. The divine in us tells us that he is with the Lord Buddha here on earth, there in Heaven, inside all human beings and all divine souls.</p>
<p>He is at once with the Creator’s ever-transcending Vision and ever-manifesting Reality.</p>
<p>As the Creator and the creation are inseparable, even so his unconditionally surrendered will to the Will of the Lord Buddha are eternally inseparable. Infinity’s greatness he has. Immortality’s goodness he is.</p>
<p>I wish to offer my most respectful salutation to your mother, my loving regards to your kind and good husband, Dr. Myint-U, and my soulful love to your divinely sweet children.</p>
<p>I pray to the Lord Buddha to bless you and your whole family with His infinite Compassion-Light and His eternal Satisfaction-Delight.</p>
<p>Affectionately yours,</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">&quot;Detachment-light&quot;</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&amp;quot;Detachment-light&amp;quot;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Only a highly advanced soul like U Thant can achieve detachment-light. Most illumining was U Thant’s intrepid detachment from the fruitless trivialities of human life. To our deep sorrow, some unlit human beings took his detachment-light for insouciance-night. Again, to our deep joy and satisfaction, they eventually realised their grave folly.</p>
