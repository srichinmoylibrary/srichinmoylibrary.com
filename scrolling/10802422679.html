<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know whether it is a real inner struggle. It is very easy to use the term "struggle." If we have to budge an inch, we say it is a struggle. If we have to get up early in the morning, if we have to tell the truth, it is a struggle. If we have to face reality for a fleeting second, it is a struggle. But each individual has to realise what real struggle is. Real struggle, for a sincere seeker, is to conquer ignorance in his own life and in the world around him. If the seeker is sincerely struggling to conquer himself, to be the ruler of his own life, then in his very effort he is bound to get joy. While struggling against falsehood, inertia, darkness, imperfections, limitations and bondage, he is bound to feel a kind of inner joy, provided he is sincerely struggling.</p>
<p>We have to know how hard we are trying to realise the Highest, how many minutes of our daily life we are consecrating to the Supreme in us, how hard we are struggling to see the light within us and others. If we have this kind of struggle, then the divine qualities which we have are bound to increase, because it is the divine qualities within us that are inspiring us to fight against teeming ignorance. So how can they desert us when it is they who have asked us to fight against darkness and ignorance? If we are really making an inner, sincere spiritual struggle, then we are not going to lose our divine qualities. On the contrary, our inner qualities will increase in boundless measure.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the best way to pray for others?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the best way to pray for others?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to pray for others is first, before you even start praying, to invoke the Presence of the Supreme. Then, once you feel His Presence, try to see or feel the people for whom you are praying inside the heart of the Supreme's Presence. Once you invoke His Presence, He will definitely come in His Subtle Body. His Presence may not take a human form, and you may not see Him in a human body. But you will be able to feel His Presence, and in your feeling a form will be embodied. Inside the form, try to feel the person for whom you are praying. If you can invoke the Supreme's Presence and feel inside His Presence the human beings for whom you are praying, then that will be the most effective way of helping them through your prayer.</p>
<p>But before asking the Supreme to help with your prayer, first ask Him whether you are supposed to pray. This you have to do. Otherwise, you may be praying for others out of sheer attachment, so that the other person will be pleased with you and do something for you in the outer world. If you get a message or inner feeling from the Presence of the Supreme that you should pray for that particular person, then only you should pray for him. Otherwise, the Supreme's Presence will be there, but He might not be at all pleased by your prayer. And even if He answers your prayer, it will be with tremendous reluctance, because the after-effect may be harmful. Before you pray, if you get express permission from the Supreme to pray for someone, then you are doing the right thing. But if you do something in this world without His approval, sanction or permission, then you will be committing a mistake.</p>
<p>Suppose somebody is very sick. You may think that if you pray for him, it will be a good thing, because he is suffering. But perhaps God wants him to have this experience at this particular time. You have to know that God is infinitely kinder than any human being could possibly be. If you pray to God, "Cure him, cure him," you may be standing in God's way. God wants to give him the experience of suffering in His own way. So always ask God if it is His Will.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we make our prayer most intense?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we make our prayer most intense?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can make your prayer most intense through your gratitude-heart. While you are praying, prayer is coming from your heart. You have to feed the prayer with gratitude. Gratitude is the nourishment. If somebody is going to run a race, he needs to be fed — not just before he runs, but a few hours before that. If anybody is going to do something great or good, he needs nourishment. Similarly, if you don't nourish the prayer with your gratitude-fruit, then your prayer will not be intense.</p>
<p>Nothing divine will be intense unless and until you are grateful to the Supreme. You want intense love for God, intense devotion to God and intense surrender to God's Will. But you will not have these divine qualities unless gratitude comes to the fore for what God has given you and for what God has not given you. The good things that you prayed for, He has given you, and the bad things that you prayed for, He has not given you. You have to be grateful for the things that He didn't give you and for the things that He did give you. If He had fulfilled your desires, then He would have proved to be your worst enemy. But instead of asking Him to fulfil your desires, if you asked Him for aspiration, then that He has granted you.</p>
<p>At every moment during the day you are energised by good thoughts or assailed by bad thoughts. You have to know that the good thoughts which you get are coming directly from the Supreme, and the will to fight and destroy or illumine the bad thoughts is also coming from the Supreme. He is inside you as a Warrior when wrong thoughts come to attack you, and He is inside you as the heavenly Father, the Supreme Beloved, when good thoughts come to illumine you. So, naturally you are grateful.</p>
<p>So use your gratitude-heart to feed your prayer. Early in the morning, if you don't renew your gratitude-heart during your meditation or prayer, then nothing will be intense. At every moment your gratitude-heart must feed your intense inner cry and aspiration. Then you can intensify your prayer, your aspiration, your dedication and everything.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Since the Supreme is fully aware of all of our needs, why is it appropriate to pray?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Since the Supreme is fully aware of all of our needs, why is it appropriate to pray?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you get something through prayer, it only increases its value in your life. You can tell the world, "I prayed for it. That's why I got it." A child is hungry and he tells his mother, "I am hungry." Then the mother feeds the child. Then the child will be able to tell the world, "Look, I have this kind of closeness with my mother." Yes, the mother would have fed the child on her own, but the fact that he asks and his mother listens to his request gives him joy. It means that she is at his beck and call. Because of his inner connection and closeness with his mother, the child can ask the mother to help him.</p>
<p>God sees everything, but in the outer life, if we ask Him for something and He gives it to us, then we get the glory. At that time, however, as individuals we are separated from Him. We feel that God is somewhere and we are somewhere else. We never think that He is around or beside us. We don't remain in our highest consciousness where we feel that we and God are one. If we feel that we and God are one, then the question of prayer does not arise, for our needs are His needs.</p>
<p>As long as we feel separated from God and feel that we have to ask Him for what we need, then we get joy from our prayer. We feel, "Just because I prayed, God gave me what I wanted, so I am worthy of having His Compassion." He would have done it unconditionally, but we would not have had the same kind of satisfaction. In a race, if somebody tries very hard and runs the whole course, she will be so delighted when I give her a trophy. She has run with such difficulty and with so much trouble, and she feels that she has earned the trophy. Now, even if you don't finish the race, I can also give you a trophy, because the trophy is there, but you will not feel satisfied because you have done nothing. God can give everything unconditionally, but you will not be happy, whereas the person who tries and shows the capacity really deserves what he gets. Here the fulfilment of our prayer is the trophy. If somebody prays and meditates and gets something, he will get more satisfaction than if God had given him the thing unconditionally.</p>
<p>Prayer intensifies our intimacy with the Supreme. Meditation increases our oneness with the Supreme. Before we meditate and become one, we have to acquire intimacy. First we have to feel that we and God are intimate friends; then we can realise our oneness-reality with God. Before we meditate, if we pray for a few seconds, then we are developing our intimate connection with the Supreme. Then, once we start meditating, we are developing our oneness-reality with the Supreme. Prayer is intimacy. Meditation is oneness. Unless we are intimate, how can we become one? We have to become intimate first; then only we can become one.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is charity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is charity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Charity is a form of giving. If we have ten dollars and we give five pennies, then we feel that we have done an act of charity. In charity, we give just a little, just a grain. Although we have a large quantity, we give just a portion of it and we feel that this is more than enough. We justify ourselves and say, "We have voluntarily given this little portion, but who has the right to tell us to give anything at all?"</p>
<p>There is a great difference between charity and self-offering. In the spiritual life, when we use the term self-offering, it means that we try to give what we have, unconditionally. What we have, we give to God or to mankind. Self-giving comes from the integral, entire being, but charity comes from an infinitesimal portion of our existence.</p>
<p>When we give something with charity, then we have a kind of inner feeling that the world will come to know of our kind action and appreciate and admire us. We tell others that we are giving something through charity, and then we wait like a beggar. Inwardly we try to see who is appreciating us or who is acknowledging our charity. So always there is some condition behind our gift.</p>
<p>Self-giving is a giving of the entire being: body, vital, mind, heart and soul. What we have and what we are, we are giving to the divine cause. This is the difference between charity and self-giving. Charity is a form of self-giving, but this self-giving is only in a very, very limited measure. It is by no means complete self-giving. Complete self-giving comes only from the spiritual life, only when we have the capacity to identify ourselves with the infinite Light and the infinite Vast.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You must never feel that you are hopeless. If you feel that you are hopeless, then I wish to say that you are worse than hopeless. And if you feel that you are helpless, then I wish to say that you are really helpless. At that time, I can't help you at all, and no one else can help you. You are <em>not</em> hopeless and helpless. You are God's child. From Delight you came into existence, in Delight you grow and at the end of your journey's close, into Delight you will retire. This is what you must feel.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why is darkness impermanent and light permanent?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why is darkness impermanent and light permanent?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Light is permanent precisely because our Source is all Light. We come from Light, in Light we grow and through Light we fulfil our inner task. God is the eternal Source and we are His children. God-realisation, the flood of infinite Light, is our birthright. The more we go deep within, the easier it becomes for us to realise that there is something within us which is everlasting. Right now we are enveloped by darkness because we have been sleeping for a few years or a few incarnations. But a day will come when the infinite Light will dawn in us and make us feel what we truly are. Since our Source is God, who is all Light, eventually we also have to grow into Light. It is the Creator who has created us and eventually we have to grow into His very image.</p>
<p>What is Light? Light is Delight, and Delight means nectar. This nectar is immortal. In one of our <em>Upanishads</em> it is said that all human beings come into the world from Delight. Again, Delight is Light, God the Light. We grow in Delight, but we do not see or feel the Delight right now because we are living the surface life in the meshes of ignorance. But we shall continue to grow and, at the end of our journey's close, we shall again enter into the effulgence of Delight. We came from Delight, we grow in Delight and, at the end of our journey's close, we shall retire into Delight.</p>
<p>This experience of Delight we get only when we meditate. When we meditate, we get inner peace or peace of mind. Delight is visible, palpable and tangible only when we have peace of mind. Unfortunately, the modern, intellectual, doubting and sophisticated mind does not care for this kind of Light and Delight. It cries for outer information or it cries to achieve the Truth in its own way. But even while achieving the Truth, it negates the Truth. The mind sees the Truth for five seconds and then, when it is about to achieve the Truth, it doubts the possibility and potentiality of the Truth. Then who is the loser? It is the mind. But if we live in the heart or in the soul, which is within the heart, then we identify ourselves with the Light and immediately we become the Light. At that time there is no doubt; there is only a flood of certainty.</p>
<p>So if we can live in our inner existence even for one minute a day, we will see Light and feel Light in abundant measure. When we feel Light, we will feel the possibility of growing into the effulgence of Light. Our inner sun, which is infinitely brighter than the physical sun, will dispel the ignorance-night of millennia. Let us try to go deep within and enter into our inner sun, our cosmic sun. There we shall see the infinite, permanent Light waiting for us and crying for us. It needs only our conscious approval and co-operation to come to the fore.</p>

Will it lead to the destruction of our divine qualities?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the meaning of struggle in the spiritual life? Will it lead to the destruction of our divine qualities?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each individual has to realise what real struggle is. Real struggle, for a sincere spiritual seeker, is the struggle to conquer ignorance in his own life and in the world around him. If he is sincerely struggling to conquer himself, to be the ruler of his own life, then in his very effort he is bound to get joy. If he is sincerely struggling against falsehood, inertia, darkness, imperfection, limitation and bondage, then he is bound to feel a kind of inner joy.</p>
<p>Again, "struggle" is a very complicated word. If a lazy person has to budge an inch, then he feels that it is a great struggle. When we use the term "struggle," we have to know how hard we are trying to realise the Highest; we have to know how many minutes a day we are consecrating to the Supreme in us, how hard we are struggling to see the light within us and within others. If we are making a sincere struggle, then our divine qualities are bound to increase, for it is the divine qualities within us that are inspiring us to fight against teeming ignorance. So how can they desert us when it is they who have asked us to fight? If we are sincerely struggling to conquer the dark forces in our lives, then we are not going to lose our inner divine qualities. On the contrary, our inner qualities will increase in boundless measure.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Neither you nor I will be alive in three hundred years. So, why worry about three hundred years from now? We see how little progress we have made in three thousand or four thousand years, so how can we expect to be perfect in three hundred years? It is not possible for that kind of progress to be made in three hundred years; it is simply absurd. In order to make progress, we must have tremendous devoted love. God knows how many years it will take: perhaps three million years. Thinking about these things does not help you; it only feeds your curiosity. What is happening in your present life is what is important. As a seeker, you must think only of your immediate progress: today's progress and tomorrow's progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you speak on guidance?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you speak on guidance?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We all need guidance. The body is our guide; the vital is our guide; the mind is our guide; the heart, which has more knowledge than the other members, is our guide; and the soul, which has infinitely more knowledge and wisdom than the other members, is our inner guide. If you want to make a comparison, you can say that the vital offers a little more guidance than the body, the mind offers more guidance than the vital and the body put together, and the heart's guidance far exceeds the guidance of the body, vital and mind. Again, the light of the soul offers infinitely more guidance than all the others put together. Here on earth, millions of people are guided by the body, millions are guided by the vital and the mind. We get the guide that is most accessible to us until we can get the soul or God as our supreme guide.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we bring our dreams into our meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we bring our dreams into our meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have very happy and delightful dreams, then they may encourage you and inspire you to meditate. Again, it may happen that after you have a dream you will go on imagining all that happened in your dream, even during your meditation. You will say to yourself, "I saw a beautiful Golden Shore." Then you will be there all the time and your real inner cry will not come to the fore. Many times people have had very high dreams and tried to remain there, but then the real intensity of their meditation went away. Again, it also may happen that when you have an inspiring dream, you feel that the Golden Shore is not a dream but a reality. So you say, "Let me work very hard.</p>
<p>When you meditate, you don't have to think of your dreams at all; just meditate most sincerely so that you can go high, higher, highest. This is the positive way. In this way it is not necessary to bring your dreams into your meditation at all.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I have good dreams?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I have good dreams?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can do is this. If you normally get up at five o'clock, then get up at four o'clock. Take a proper shower and then meditate for half an hour at least. Then after meditation, sit down or lie down and concentrate on your navel. Do not think of dreams at that time. Try to feel that your navel chakra is opening. Try to imagine that a wheel is there rotating very fast. Because you have meditated for half an hour, you don't have to worry if you enter into that chakra, even though it is the vital chakra. From there you will get dynamic dreams or beautiful, soulful, colourful dreams. If you concentrate on other centres also you will get dreams. But be careful, so that you don't get carried away by the dreams.</p>
<p>Let us say that at five-thirty your meditation is over, and at six-thirty you have to get up again to go to school. So only one hour is at your disposal. But the navel chakra works very fast when it is invoked. If this chakra and the ones below the navel open too soon, then it is a real curse. But if they are opened at the proper time, then there is no difficulty.</p>
