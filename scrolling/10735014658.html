  <h2 id="page-title">Sri Chinmoy’s Meetings And Conversations With Carl Lewis</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Sri Chinmoy’s Meetings And Conversations With Carl Lewis" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Part II</h2>

<p><em>Carl Lewis first learned about Sri Chinmoy from music producer Narada Michael Walden and his wife, Anukampa, two of Sri Chinmoy’s students. In October 1983, Narada interviewed the champion athlete and sent the tape recording to Sri Chinmoy as a gift. Excerpts from that tape recording follow.</em></p>
<p><em>Narada:</em> Would you like to tell Sri Chinmoy something about the video of his running that you saw recently?</p>
<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> For inspiration and determination I use the challenge of perfecting the best in myself. Of course, in athletics that just comes from repeated practice. I saw some of your starts the other day and I thought they looked really good. The way you're going to get faster is to just keep working hard at it and wanting to do it. So many people have the capacity to be fast, but they all fall short because they do not want to work at it hard enough. But you also have to make sure that you do not overwork in your running. And if you ever feel tired, take a rest. If you ever feel you're not as excited on a certain day, just take a break — because there’s always a reason.</p>
<p><em>Narada:</em> What were you saying about how important it is to keep the hips above the feet?</p>
<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> In sprinting you want to have your centre of gravity over your feet. The thing that you want to do is to stand flat and straight, then rise on your toes, send your hips forward and just run off. That’s the idea you want. You want to get your hips over your feet. You do that by shooting them in. Then, of course, your upper body will just follow. You want your hands to swing up to your face in front and then your arm to go back just a little bit. Those are the mechanical concepts of sprinting, the easiest things.</p>
<p><em>Narada:</em> Is there any advice for someone who has a weak lower back?</p>
<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> I myself have lower back problems. I always have to stretch before and after I compete. Easy, slow sit-ups are good for backs — very slow and very easy. You don’t have to do very many just so long as you do them consistently — even if you do only 20 or 30 a day, three times a week. It’s not very much, but it helps activate the muscles in the back and gets your stomach muscles stronger so they can support the back. That’s the main thing with back problems: the stomach muscles a lot of times are not strong enough to support the back.</p>
<p><em>Narada:</em> Is God personal or impersonal to you?</p>
<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> I feel He has reached down and touched my head, and brought me along and paved my way. Even before I felt God in a personal way, I can look back and see that He was paving my way. it’s as though He kind of reaches down and touches me, and turns me this way and that way, or says, “Slow down!” or “Stop!” That’s why I feel Him to be really personal.</p>
<p><em>Narada:</em> What do you think about spiritual names?</p>
<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> I have been thinking so much about this, especially since all weekend I've been with you and your wife, Anukampa. Anukampa was saying last night that she feels it keeps her so positive. I think it would keep me positive and proud as well. My parents gave me the name ‘Carl’, but I think that a spiritual name is something I would really like. There’s no question that I'd really cherish it because it would be something that was given directly to me at a time when I could feel it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part III</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part III" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>On 11 November 1983 Carl Lewis met with Sri Chinmoy and his students for the first time, at Martin Van Buren High School in Queens. During this meeting, Sri Chinmoy’s students sang a song their teacher had composed, entitled “Carl Lewis,” as well as five songs in which Sri Chinmoy had set tune to the champion’s own words.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I offer you my boundless, loving gratitude for what you have achieved for mankind and for this world at this tender age. You have been supremely chosen. I offer you my heart’s deepest love and deepest gratitude.</p>
<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> I'm in a funny position right now because I've just met all of you today. For me to come in, sit down and feel so close means that there’s something that’s drawing us together. I feel so good sitting here right now because I have acquired so many spiritual friends. But I also feel that I have grown a lot in myself because I realise how much there is for me to see. I don’t think I can really tell you how much a time like this means for someone like myself, and how grateful I am to meet people like Narada and yourself. So many people we meet, but here I know that your spirit is with me all the time. Otherwise, I wouldn’t feel so comfortable being here. I'm glad we can be together. Hopefully, we can stay that way, and longer than we can all imagine.</p>

But I think it was important in my life to have seen both sides. I have seen people run faster and slower than me, and that was important.

So many people get involved in what others are doing, but that’s not my way. If you are within yourself and everything you do is within yourself, then relaxation won’t be difficult.</p>

<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> I do a lot of that. Even though I'm one of the best starters in the world, I have to work or I will lose. I work on my long jump mistakes to perfect them. I try to leave the board at a 22-23 degree angle. One degree can make a difference of six to eight inches. In the start, you basically want to get down in the blocks to the set position where you're comfortable — with the front leg at about a 90 degree angle. If my shoulders are too low, when I want to come out I have to step and stand up. So just a small difference in angle can make a big difference in the start. Even a person like myself has to keep working on it every day.</p>

<p><em>Carl Lewis:</em> In the set position, you leave your head where it is — right where the shoulders are and let it come down as the shoulders come up. The idea in starting is to keep the shoulders up, because you want to come out low and come up fast. Most people think you have to run low, but you will come out straight up. The right knee in the set position should not be straight but with a slight bend. The position of the front leg is most important. There can be a slight V. The back leg should be a little straighter than the front leg.</p>
