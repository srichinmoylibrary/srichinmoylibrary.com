 <p></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>On June 27th, 2003, at the kind invitation of the Provost, Sir Patrick Bateson, Sri Chinmoy visited King’s College at the University of Cambridge for a unique “Lifting Up the World With a Oneness-Heart” Award ceremony.</p>
<p>The ceremony took place in the beautiful setting of the Provost’s Lodge Garden. This was Sri Chinmoy’s ninth visit to the University of Cambridge. On November 12th, 1997, together with the Indian High Commissioner, Dr. L.M. Singhvi, Sri Chinmoy had planted a special “Dove Tree” to commemorate the two years that Sri Aurobindo spent at the University of Cambridge. On this occasion, Dr. Singhvi also unveiled a bronze bust of Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p>The connection between King’s College and Sri Aurobindo is deeply meaningful for Sri Chinmoy, who joined the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, India, in 1944, at the age of twelve, and remained there until 1964. Sri Chinmoy has written a number of books and composed many songs both in English and Bengali dedicated to the immortal Poet, Seer, Sage and Yogi Sri Aurobindo.</p>

<p>Today’s programme, “Lifting Up the World With a Oneness-Heart,” I am most prayerfully and most soulfully offering to my spiritual Master, Sri Aurobindo, who studied here at King’s College, Cambridge, from 1890 to 1892.</p>

<p>India’s Poet, India’s Seer,<br /> India’s Yogi,<br /> The transcendental Sri Aurobindo,<br /> Direct Descendant of the Absolute Supreme,<br /> To you I bow and bow and bow.</p>

As a prelude to the lifting part of the ceremony, Sri Chinmoy performed his own compositions for several minutes on the esraj, a slender North Indian bowed instrument with sympathetic strings.

<p>Mr. Devashishu Torpy, Master of Ceremonies</p>
<p>We are extremely happy and extremely grateful to welcome you here today to the Lifting Up the World With a Oneness-Heart Award programme. Sri Chinmoy has travelled throughout the length and the breadth of the globe to honour in his own unique way men and women of inspiration and dedication from all walks of life. In appreciation and gratitude for their world-serving contributions, he has presented this signal award to presidents, prime ministers, members of parliament, religious leaders from all faiths, Nobel laureates, outstanding artists, musicians, poets and athletes. Sri Chinmoy also wishes to honour citizens on the grassroots level who are serving others in extraordinary ways. Through their lives of devoted self-offering, all of our highly esteemed honorees, including each of you who has so kindly come here today, have raised up the standard of humanity far beyond our imagination’s flight.</p>
<p>In the same way that a star sports player here at the University of Cambridge is lifted up out of joy and enthusiasm by his fellow teammates, so too, Sri Chinmoy, in a spirit of sincere gratitude, lifts each recipient overhead from the honorary platform. The very first person to receive this award in 1988 was the legendary Bill Pearl, five-time Mr. Universe and Best Built Man of the Century. The 2,000th person to receive the Lifting Up the World With a Oneness-Heart Award was President Nelson Mandela and the 6,000th individual was the great Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p>Each one of our guests here today is offering something most significant through his or her own unique endeavours. Here, at the University of Cambridge, you are serving not only the students but the whole of humanity.</p>
<p>We are very grateful that you have come here today. Sri Chinmoy and all of us present offer you our most heartfelt welcome and congratulate you on soon receiving the Lifting Up the World With a Oneness-Heart Award.</p>
<p>We are very, very grateful to our host here today, Professor Sir Patrick Bateson. May I invite Professor Bateson to come up and say a few words of welcome.</p>
<p>Official Welcome to Sri Chinmoy from the Provost Sir Patrick Bateson</p>
<p>I want to welcome you all here to this College and I should say that this is Sri Chinmoy’s ninth visit to the University of Cambridge. In 1997, he planted a tree in memory of Sri Aurobindo, who was at this College back at the end of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The tree is an extraordinarily beautiful tree. It is called the Dove Tree because in the late spring when it flowers, it looks as though it is full of white doves. It is also called the Pocket Handkerchief Tree, not so romantically.</p>
<p>I am delighted that Sri Chinmoy has come here again and very honoured that he should be here. I just want to say welcome to you all and thank you for coming.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Illumining comments</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Illumining comments" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The Master of Ceremonies then invited the guests to offer extemporaneous reflections on their work and the nature of their experiences. An abridged selection of the comments that were offered follows.</p>
<p>Dr. John Barber<br />Senior Lecturer in Politics</p>
<p>The previous visit of Sri Chinmoy made an absolutely unforgettable impression on everyone who was present — not only an unforgettable, but an indelible impression — and I think the spirit of goodwill and all the other extremely positive feelings that were generated on that occasion by everyone present really have lived on. It is a marvellous thing today that we are able again to have the presence of Sri Chinmoy and all of the others of you here in King’s College, and I am sure that this will perpetuate this wonderful tradition associated, of course, initially with Sri Aurobindo, whose memory is revered to this day, and the connection that we value enormously with Sri Chinmoy.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Professor Tony Minson<br />Professor of Virology</p>
<p>It was a great surprise and a somewhat humbling one to be given this award from such a remarkable person. I have to say that Sri Chinmoy is just a breathtaking individual who has done some absolutely amazing things. I would also like to say that it is somewhat humbling to be in such illustrious company in receiving this award and I am grateful for that.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Professor Howard Chase<br />Professor of Biochemical Engineering</p>
<p>It is, indeed, a very humbling pleasure to be honoured in this particular way and I am so grateful to Sri Chinmoy for conferring this upon us all. It is quite an amazing experience on the stand here when you are waiting. You are lifted up already above the level of you all. For a moment nothing happens. And then suddenly you feel this amazing surge of strength as you get lifted up. I think that was a very, very special experience that I will certainly remember for the rest of my life. And thank you also for honouring my wife at the same time. It has been absolutely splendid.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Sir Nicholas Shackleton<br />Professor of Quaternary Paleoclimatology</p>
<p>Professor Roger Parker<br />Professor of Music</p>
<p>It is a wonderful occasion and the physical experience of being lifted up is quite amazing. The only thing I would like to apologise for is weighing so much.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Professor Jean Rudduck<br />Professor of Education</p>
<p>I would like to say that today my body was lifted up but my spirits were also lifted up, and I want to share that feeling with the many teachers up and down the country who have worked in very difficult circumstances to create a new order of experience for young people and to make schools places that are inclusive and not divisive, where people can work together in the spirit of oneness. And I thank you all. 36</p>

<p>Dr. Frederick Sanger<br />Nobel Prize for Chemistry 1958 and 1980</p>
<p>I have enjoyed this very much. Thank you very much.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Professor Simon Goldhill<br />Professor of Greek Literature and Culture</p>
<p>There is an expression in Hebrew — <em>tikun haolam</em> — which means ‘to make the world whole’. That is what we are told we are on earth to do, and I am extremely proud to be part of an institution — and an occasion — which in its principles and its attitude has been doing that today.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Professor Robin Holloway<br />Professor of Musical Composition</p>
<p>I would like to give a little word of thanks to the choir as well, who have given us such pleasure...</p>
<div></div>
<p>Professor Alan Macfarlane<br />Professor of Anthropological Science</p>
<p>At the moment I am writing some letters to my granddaughter about very depressing things like war and famine and disease, and this is a wonderful change from that. There are not many people who dedicate their lives to try and make this world a little more peaceful, and we all know how important that is. So I feel very proud, as well as humble, to be a part of that movement.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Professor Ajit Singh<br />Professor of Economics</p>
<p>This was a very moving occasion. I am delighted to be honoured in this way and very humbled to be included in this august company. I think Sri Chinmoy’s work is of the utmost significance. There are about one and a half billion people on the planet today who are in absolute poverty. The world produces enough and has potential to be able to feed all of them today, and certainly in the next century there is no reason why the world should not move towards a more equal distribution of wealth. I thank you for honouring me in this way.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Professor Janice Stargardt<br />Professor of Geography and Archaeology (Comment received after the event)</p>
<p>I certainly felt a stream of energy emanating from Sri Chinmoy when standing near him. It was good and peaceful and will be a lasting memory.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Lady Dusha Bateson</p>
<p>It was a most memorable experience for us. I was both touched and honoured.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Professor Sir Patrick Bateson<br />Provost, King’s College; Professor of Ethology</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the ceremony Sir Patrick Bateson approached Sri Chinmoy and, very warmly and affectionately shaking his hand, said: You are a very, very great man...</p>
<div></div>
<p>The Provost’s Lodge<br />King’s College, Cambridge<br />1st August 2003</p>
<p>All of us here in Cambridge who met you were enormously impressed by your serenity and presence and by the obvious devotion inspired in all those who have close contact with you. My time as Provost is now drawing to a close and my wife and I are currently moving out. It is sad to go but we shall, of course, maintain a very strong relationship with the College. Thank you again for gracing us with your visit.</p>

<p>Following the ceremony, Dr. John Barher escorted Sri Chinmoy into King’s College, where he had made arrangements for Sri Chinmoy to visit the room in which Sri Aurobindo actually studied during his Cambridge years.</p>
<p>The small study room is now the living quarters of Mr. Peter Avery, OBE, formerly a lecturer in Persian Studies at the Faculty of Oriental Studies and now retired.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy later commented that this was for him the happiest day. He stayed in the room for ten minutes. Out of reverence for Sri Aurobindo, he would not take a seat during his visit, in spite of Mr. Avery’s most kind and repeated requests. He remained standing and meditated. He later said, “How could I dare to sit in the room where my Master had studied? I was trembling with delight inside that room. My eyes were flooded with tears and my heart was swimming in the sea of delight; my heart was throbbing.”</p>
<p>Mr. Avery expressed his gratitude to Sri Chinmoy for paying a visit to his room. Sri Chinmoy replied, “It is I who should be grateful to you. I am a humble disciple of Sri Aurobindo.”</p>
<p>This visit to Sri Aurobindo’s room held a deep personal significance for Sri Chinmoy. He later said that he would cherish this precious memory until the very end of his days.</p>

<p>Each successive time my joy increases. This time my joy is limitless. This time I have accomplished something, by the Grace of my Lord Beloved Supreme, which is absolutely new. I was able to be inside one of the rooms where Sri Aurobindo actually studied. It was over a century ago.</p>

<p>I hasten to say how great a privilege it was to receive you in the rooms which I now occupy and which Sri Aurobindo used to occupy during his period in Cambridge from 1890-1892. I feel that the rooms do indeed retain a special aura. They are certainly conducive to my work in Sufism and Persian medieval mystical poetry. But whatever their aura might have been before Friday, 27th June, it was enlivened, brightened, made more by your kind presence. I only wish that your visit could have lasted longer, but I hope that you will come again.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>The higher worlds</h2>

<p>Cambridge, I bow to your aspiration-height. I bow to your knowledge-light. I bow to your divine pride. True, you are of England, you are in England, but you are of the world at large. The entire world claims you as its very own.</p>
<p>There are seven higher worlds and seven lower worlds. The higher worlds are: <em>Bhur</em>, <em>Bhuvar</em>, <em>Swar</em>, <em>Jana</em>, <em>Mahar</em>, <em>Tapas</em> and <em>Satya.</em> One of the Upanishads names seven higher regions. These are: <em>Agniloka</em>, <em>Vayuloka</em>, <em>Varunaloka</em>, <em>Adityaloka</em>, <em>Indraloka</em>, <em>Prajapatiloka</em> and <em>Brahmaloka.</em> Certain spiritual figures are of the opinion that the first-mentioned group of the worlds corresponds to the second. Others, equally qualified, strongly object to this belief. Strangely enough, all, without exception, agree that the world <em>Satya</em> and <em>Brahmaloka</em> are one and the same.</p>
<p>We can enter into these worlds on the strength of our aspiration and receptivity. When we have aspiration, these worlds can never remain a far cry.</p>
<p>Aspiration. What do we mean by this term? The inner cry, the mounting flame within us. Aspiration is reality's constant necessity.</p>
<p>Receptivity. How can we have receptivity? We can have receptivity if we grow into purity and sincerity. When sincerity and purity loom large and important in our earthly existence, then we can easily have receptivity.</p>
<p>A sincere seeker needs aspiration and receptivity. Without aspiration, he is rootless. Without receptivity, he is fruitless.</p>
<p>The higher worlds. Each individual has the divine right to enter into the higher worlds. His aspiration can easily guide him and lead him to God's Throne. To enter into high, higher, highest worlds, what we need is the inner cry. We cry for name and fame. If we inwardly cry for abundant peace, light and bliss, here on earth, then our entire being can be flooded with peace, light and bliss.</p>
<p>These higher worlds are within us and not without. When we concentrate, when we meditate, when we contemplate, we enter into these higher worlds. When we concentrate dynamically, we near the door of these higher worlds. When we meditate soulfully, we enter into the Room Divine. When we contemplate unreservedly, and unconditionally, we reach God's Throne.</p>
<p>Since we aspire to enter into the higher worlds, we pray to the cosmic gods. We feel that the cosmic gods will come to our aid. They will help us enter into the higher worlds.</p>
<p>Here at this point, I would like to invoke the soul of Marcus Aurelius,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either the gods have the power to assist us, or they have not. If they have not, what does praying to them signify? If they have, why do you not rather pray that they would remove your desires than satisfy them, and rather set you above fear than keep away the thing you are afraid of?</p>
<p>— Marcus Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, if we want to enter into the higher worlds with a view to fulfilling our desires, then we can never enter into the higher worlds. We can enter into the higher worlds only because it is the Will of our Inner Pilot, the Lord Supreme. When we go deep within, when we meditate for a couple of hours, if it is most soulful and if the meditation is unconditional at the same time, then we envision the higher worlds. No sincere seeker of the highest Truth, the ultimate Truth, will be denied the higher worlds.</p>
<p>Porphyry throws further light on the matter,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We must ask of God only such gifts as are worthy of God, that is to say, such things as we cannot obtain from any except God.</p>
<p>— Porphyry of Tyre</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to enter into the higher worlds what we need is sincerity; what we need is purity; what we need is peace; what we need is delight.</p>
<p>Sincerity: Inner beauty's other name is sincerity.</p>
<p>Purity: The name of God's first child is purity.</p>
<p>Peace: Peace is unity's sovereignty and multiplicity's divinity.</p>
<p>Delight: Delight is the name of God's permanent Home.</p>
<p>There are two things we observe in our day to day life: human and divine. In everything we do, say or grow into, we see either the divine or the human.</p>
<p>The human world and the divine world. A clever man is he who knows how to deal with his outer world. He does not want to be deceived by the world, by mankind, but unconsciously or consciously he deceives the world, the world of ignorance. A wise man is he who knows all about the inner world, the higher worlds. He does not deceive anybody. He wants to conquer the outer world, the world of ignorance. But his is not the conquest of Caesar, "I came, I saw, I conquered. <em>Veni, vidi, vici</em>." Far from it. When a wise man wants to conquer ignorance, he does so only because his inner being compels him to transform the face of the world. He does not take pride in conquering the world. No. He feels the very breath of ignorance, and then he feels that it is his bounden duty to transform ignorance into knowledge, darkness into light, death into Immortality.</p>
<p>There are two ways to enter into the higher worlds. One is the way of knowledge, the other is the way of devotion.</p>
<p>Knowledge. I am the knowledge, I am the known, I am the knower.</p>
<p>Devotion. I am devotion, I am dedication and I am salvation.</p>
<p>Knowledge enlarges itself, expands itself into Infinity.</p>
<p>Devotion identifies itself with the absolute Truth. On the strength of its identification, devotion grows into Infinity.</p>
<p>A sincere seeker of the ultimate Truth can either follow the path of knowledge or devotion. But at the end of the journey's close, the seekers who follow the path of knowledge and the seekers who follow the path of devotion will meet together and shake hands, because they have reached the self-same Goal.</p>
<p>We live either in the world of human thought or in the world of divine Will. Human thought slows down and dies out, but the divine Will constantly grows and swiftly flows.</p>
<p>Similarly, human power is born of futility. Divine power is born of reality.</p>
<p>Finally, we observe our love: human love and divine Love. Human love is an express train, destination: frustration. Divine Love is a local train, destination: Illumination. Human physical love is slow poison. Divine Love is the running stream and unceasing source of nectar. Human love can be transcended. Divine Love can be manifested. Human love is fruitless expectation. Divine Love is fulfilled perfection.</p>

<p>Unconditional love God is.<br /> Unreserved devotion man needs.<br /> Mutual surrender God and man offer.</p>

<p>When the power of love replaces the love of power, man will have a new name: God.</p>
<p>The Golden Hour, God's Hour is dawning fast. Let us offer our heart's aspiration to the lofty realisation of the seers of the hoary past,</p>
<p><em>Ānandāddhyeva khalvimāni bhūtāni jāyante</em><br /><em>ānandena jātāni jīvanti</em><br /><em>ānandaṃ prayantyabhisaṃ viśanti</em></p>
<p>From Delight we came into existence.<br />In Delight we grow.<br />At the end of our journey’s close, into Delight we shall retire.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The seeker&#039;s journey</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The seeker&#039;s journey" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Some of you have come here to see a spiritual teacher. Some of you have come to see a yogi. Some of you have come to see a seeker. I am grateful to those who have come here to see the spiritual teacher in me. I am more grateful to those who have come to see the yogi in me. I am most grateful to those who have come here to see the seeker in me.</p>
<p>As a spiritual teacher, I teach my students or disciples with my heart's love. I have no other way. I have no other knowledge but the knowledge of love. With my heart's love, I try to teach my followers and disciples.</p>
<p>As a yogi who is constantly one with his Inner Pilot, I try to be always at the command of my Inner Pilot. I try to execute His commands and thereby be of service to those who come to me for inner guidance.</p>
<p>As a seeker, I am always at the feet of the Transcendental Supreme. I am a seeker, a seeker of the Infinite Truth. A seeker knows that his journey will never come to an end. He realises the Truth, but he feels that there is no end to his realisation. He discovers the loftiest Truth, the Transcendental Truth, but then he feels there is no end to his Truth-discovery. He comes to realise that because God is infinite, eternal and immortal, there is no end to God's Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. God Himself is constantly transcending His own Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. So we must realise that we are seekers of the ever-transcending Beyond. Each seeker is transcending his own capacity, his own reality, his own dream, his own realisation every day, every hour, every minute and every second.</p>
<p>When one becomes a sincere seeker, he discovers something which a non-seeker has not discovered. A sincere seeker of the highest Truth discovers the fact that he made a solemn promise to the Supreme before he entered into the world arena. This promise was very simple and, at the same time, very soulful. His promise was to be the conscious instrument of the Supreme and to manifest the Supreme here on earth through his dedication, through his aspiration and through his conscious oneness with the world at large. This is the promise each aspiring soul has made, according to the seeker's own vision. All human souls, without exception, make this promise to the Absolute Supreme. Unfortunately, when we enter into the world, we enter into the sea of ignorance. We bathe for thousands of years in this sea of ignorance, but when we become tired of this ignorance-bath, we enter into the Sea of Knowledge and Wisdom. Then we remember our promise, our promise of God-manifestation on earth. Each individual being will one day come to realise that he has made this promise to the Absolute.</p>
<p>Unconsciously everybody is trying to fulfil this promise. But a seeker is trying consciously to fulfil it, and a realised soul has already begun to fulfil it consciously and unconditionally. A seeker of the highest Truth fulfils his promise consciously and soulfully. A spiritual Master fulfils his promise consciously and unconditionally. But the individual who is not aspiring and who does not care for God-realisation or God-manifestation right now, is fulfilling his promise unconsciously.</p>
<p>When one is fulfilling or trying to fulfil God consciously, he is fulfilling God in a perfect manner. When he is fulfilling God unconsciously, he is fulfilling God in an imperfect manner. When one has realised God consciously, one goes a step further and tries to reveal God consciously. Finally, one tries to manifest God consciously. In conscious realisation, conscious revelation and conscious manifestation, we see God the Eternal Perfection. God is for everyone, but one who is conscious of God's Existence-Reality is undoubtedly ahead in the divine race.</p>
<p>Each individual looks for something here on earth and there in Heaven. Here on earth we look for something in God. When we enter into the spiritual life, we pray to God, we meditate on God, we contemplate on God. First we start with our prayers. We learn how to pray from our parents. Then we try to concentrate on something which we want to achieve. We know that when our mind wanders we cannot achieve anything, whereas when we focus our attention and power of concentration on a particular thing we achieve success. We learn the art of concentration, then we go one step ahead to meditation. When we meditate, we try to embody the Vast, the Infinite within us, or we try to dive into the vast, infinite Sea of Light and Delight. The last step is contemplation. When we contemplate, our consciousness becomes one with the thing that we contemplate upon. The lover becomes one with the Beloved. The finite loses its finite existence and becomes one with the Infinite, becoming the Infinite itself. The earth-bound consciousness becomes one with the Heaven-free consciousness.</p>
<p>A seeker wants to see God. When he sees God face to face, he wants to see a certain thing in God, a special thing, and that thing is a sweet smile. Just by seeing God, he will not be satisfied. He wants to see God's exquisite smile. If he sees that God is smiling at him, he will achieve everything. Then the seeker wants to see a certain thing in man and that thing is gratitude. He looks around. He feels that at every moment, consciously or unconsciously, he is offering something to mankind. He feels that if he can observe an iota of gratitude in mankind, then his self-offering will be fulfilled. But mankind is not responding.</p>
<p>Then the seeker looks up to Heaven. He wants to see a certain thing in Heaven, and that thing is Compassion. He feels that if Heaven does not supply him with infinite Compassion, he is helpless. Although he has achieved something in life and the world extols him to the skies, he knows in the inmost recesses of his heart that he is helpless. He feels that if he gets more encouraging and fulfilling Compassion from Heaven, then he will be able to complete his task on earth most convincingly and powerfully.</p>
<p>The seeker expects something from earth. What does he expect? Patience. Earth has given him everything, but when he wants to do something for the earth-consciousness, he feels that the earth-consciousness is restless. It wants everything in the twinkling of an eye. He wants to see patience in the earth-consciousness, and eventually there comes a time when the earth-consciousness does have the necessary patience which permits him to manifest the highest truth on earth. The seeker expects something from his own life. What does he expect? Unconditional service to mankind. If he can serve mankind unconditionally, then he will be satisfied. If he serves conditionally, then he can never be satisfied or fulfilled. He expects from himself unconditional service to the world at large, and ultimately he grows into that unconditional service-tree.</p>
<p>The seeker expects something when his present earth-pilgrimage comes to an end. What does he expect? He expects the Song of Immortality. He feels that if he can hear the Song of Immortality, then he will someday achieve everything for the earth-consciousness.</p>
<p>Here we are all seekers. Now, there are two categories of seekers: mind seekers and heart seekers, or mental seekers and psychic seekers. The seekers who want to realise the Highest with the help of the mind, through the mind, eventually come to know that they are travelling on a very crowded train. This is the mind-train. While they are travelling on the mind-train, they see that with them are quite a few other passengers, and these passengers are fear, doubt, anxiety, jealousy and other negative and destructive forces. The train is overburdened. It goes slowly, very slowly, creeping sluggishly towards its destination. God alone knows when it will reach its journey's goal. With utmost uncertainty the mind-train crawls toward its destination. But those who want to realise the Highest through the heart and with the help of the heart travel on another train. That is the heart-train. When the seeker travels on the heart-train, there is nobody else with him. He is alone, he and the mounting flame of his aspiration. The train flies toward the destination at top speed because there are very few passengers weighing it down, and it reaches its destination sooner, much sooner than it even expects.</p>
<p>God is an eternal Player. We are His children, who are also playing in the Cosmic Game.</p>
<p>When we live in the physical, we play with sleep, day in and day out. Our consciousness is not awakened.</p>
<p>When we live in the vital, we play with depression and frustration. When we do not achieve our goal in the vital, we are frustrated and depressed; and when we do achieve our goal, we also feel frustrated and depressed, because we feel that it was something else we wanted.</p>
<p>When we live in the mind, we play with doubt. While playing with doubt, at times we feel that doubt is not a good partner, so we suffer a lot.</p>
<p>But there comes a time when faith looms large within us, and then we transfigure our mental doubt. On the strength of our inner faith, we begin to live in our heart and we play with surrender. Sometimes we surrender to the Absolute, sometimes we try to compel the Reality which we are praying for to surrender to us. And Reality, being all one, surrenders, because of our sincere inner cry. But when Reality enters into us in the form of aspiration, it makes us feel that by pleasing us in our own way, it will never be able to satisfy us. Only if we please the ultimate Reality in <em>its</em> own way can we be fulfilled. In the spiritual life, many times when we are pleased in our own way, we are not satisfied. Only when we are pleased in the way of the Divine, of the Supreme, can we be inwardly fulfilled.</p>
<p>At the beginning, we start our journey to please ourselves. In order to please ourselves, naturally we have to go through some discipline; for without discipline, we will not have any success. We have to follow mental, vital, psychic and spiritual discipline in order to see the face of inner satisfaction. Even when satisfaction looms large, we are not satisfied unless we please the Inner Pilot in His own Way. Only then does real satisfaction, eternal satisfaction, dawn in our lives. We try to control our lives, we try to perfect our lives and that is good. But when we try to please the Inner Pilot in His own Way on the strength of our unconditional surrender, when we make an unconditional surrender to His Will, when we become His chosen instruments and fulfil Him in His own Way, at that time we become perfect instruments. When today we have the inner dedication to say, "Let Thy Will be done," tomorrow we will have the right to say, "I and my Father are one."</p>

<p>It is said that the lecturer stands up, speaks up and shuts up. Here the seeker in me is standing up in order to offer his divine love to the audience. The seeker in me is speaking up in order to establish spiritual oneness with the audience. And finally, the seeker in me will shut up when he finds that he has established his inner oneness with the aspiration of the audience.</p>
<p>I wish to speak on failure from the spiritual point of view. There is not a single human being on earth who does not feel that he is a failure. For his failure he blames many others: he blames the world, he blames his friends and acquaintances, he blames his enemies. But he finds it difficult to blame himself. Here we are all seekers, so we are all God-lovers. For true seekers, for God-lovers, for oneness-dreamers, there is no such thing as failure; there <em>can</em> be no failure. For earth-transformers, for God-fulfillers on earth there can be no failure.</p>
<p>There are two lives: the human life and the divine life. The human life sings the song of failure. The human life fails, but the divine life succeeds and proceeds. The divine life always succeeds and continuously proceeds. The human life fails precisely because it does not claim God's Eternity, Infinity and Immortality as its very own. The divine life succeeds precisely because it does claim God's Eternity, Infinity and Immortality as its very own. The divine life not only claims them, but also feels that it is always of Immortality and always for Eternity and Infinity.</p>
<p>The human in us binds; the divine in us expands. The human in us wants to wallow in the pleasures of the finite, at times unconsciously and at times consciously and deliberately. The divine in us wants to fly in the firmament of Freedom-Light and Bliss. The human in us and the divine in us both want happiness. Both feel that if they achieve happiness, then there can be no failure. But the human in us feels that happiness lies in sense-enjoyment or in pleasure-hunting, while the divine in us feels that happiness lies in aspiration, in realisation, in self-transcendence and in God-manifestation.</p>
<p>Aspiration is our inner cry to reach the highest pinnacle of Truth, Light and Bliss. Aspiration is the only key that can unlock God's Door. The very thing that is aspiration today, tomorrow is achievement. Achievement is conquest; self-conquest is self-mastery. Self-mastery and God-discovery are one and the same. In God-discovery, earth-transformation looms large; in earth's transformation, God's Satisfaction-Smile dawns.</p>
<p>Realisation is our conscious, constant and inseparable universal oneness. Self-transcendence is our ever-glowing and ever-expanding receptivity that lets us house God's infinite Truth, eternal Light and immortal Life. God-manifestation is our fulfilled promise. Before we entered into the world arena, we made a solemn promise to the Lord Supreme that we would manifest Him here on earth. When we manifest Him on earth, we fulfil our promise.</p>
<p>I wish to tell you an amusing incident about Oscar Wilde. Oscar Wilde once went to a party after seeing one of his plays. His friends asked him about the play. His reply was that the play was a success but the audience was a failure. In the cosmic game, we are playing with the Supreme. He has allotted a specific role to each of us. If we play our role satisfactorily, then that is our success. World-appreciation and world-admiration cannot elevate our consciousness. It is only in the expansion and heightening of our consciousness that we can see the Face of God and grow into the very image of God.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life first we have to be awakened. Then we have to aspire and then we have to surrender our will to the Will of the Supreme. He who is awakened can never fail. He who aspires can never fail. He who surrenders his earth-bound will to the Heaven-free Will can never fail.</p>
<p>Quite often seekers of the ultimate Truth are misunderstood by unaspiring people. Unaspiring people are very often loud and emphatic in their insistence that God-realisation is of no avail. Without the perfect knowledge of God one can easily exist: this is their discovery. Although they are not atheists, they do not care for the living God. But a seeker cries for the living God. Since we are all seekers, we are crying for a God that is living; at every moment we try to see Him, feel Him and talk to Him face to face. Unaspiring people put forth many tenuous arguments, but we offer them our compassion-smile for we know that they are totally mistaken. When these people become vociferous and supercilious, at that time we have to offer them our forgiveness-weapon. With our forgiveness-weapon we can conquer them in the inmost recesses of our aspiring heart. God is living, and He can also be living for us. What makes Him living for us? It is our inner cry, our aspiration. We can feel Him constantly. When? When the inner flame within us is constantly burning.</p>
<p>We are seekers, but we also work; we do dedicated service. When we work we have to ask ourselves whether or not we work and serve devotedly, cheerfully and unconditionally. If we serve God in man devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally, then success is bound to dawn. Success we attain only through our dedicated service, only by offering our service with joy.</p>
<p>When we offer our success to mankind, we can offer our success as an inspiration, as something to increase the world's aspiration. But very often we offer our success to the world at large only for our own ego-aggrandisement. We want the world to appreciate our success and laud us to the skies. If we offer our success for ego-aggrandisement, we commit a Himalayan blunder. We are all cosmic players in God's divine Game. Let us play the game the way it has been ordained by the Lord Supreme. Let us offer our success to the world in the right way, in the divine way. Otherwise, at the end of our journey we shall miserably fail.</p>
<p>Just because we are seekers, we have to know that success is not our goal. Progress is our goal. Success is earth-bound. It is noticeable mostly in our vital life, the life that struggles and strikes and gets satisfaction when it notices an iota of success. In our life of aspiration, progress is of paramount importance. If we make progress, automatically we are succeeding in our aspiration, in our realisation, in our God-manifestation.</p>
<p>At every moment a seeker should feel that he is a murmuring and flowing river. Eventually he will enter into the vast sea of Knowledge, Light, Peace and Bliss. In this sea of infinite Peace, Light and Bliss, he will feel continuous progress. Today's achievement will be only tomorrow's starting point. A seeker is a divine climber: he climbs up the evolution-tree slowly, steadily and unerringly and reaches the Highest. But when he reaches the Highest, he comes to realise that this height is only the starting point for something still higher. He realises that he is growing into the ever-transcending Beyond.</p>
<p>When a seeker assimilates his realisation, he feels that there can be no failure. In his Heaven-life of aspiration and in his earth-life of self-dedication, his life becomes a life of continuous progress in God's manifestation on earth.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Confidence</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Confidence" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Dear friends, dear brothers and sisters, dear seekers, I wish to give a short talk on confidence. Here we are in Cambridge. Cambridge immediately awakens confidence in us. What we call confidence in the outer world is nothing short of assurance in the inner world. Therefore, I bow to the confidence and the assurance in Cambridge.</p>
<p>Confidence awakens our physical. Confidence energises our vital. Confidence illumines our mind. Confidence purifies our heart. A pure heart, an illumined mind, an energetic and dynamic vital and a wakeful body can and will manifest the divine realities here on earth.</p>
<p>Confidence is a divine revelation of our inner assurance. There is an unseen reality within us, a divine Pilot, an Inner Pilot who moulds and shapes our lives. When we hear the message of the Inner Pilot, in our outer life we feel confidence. Confidence is an outer gift from above, whereas assurance is an inner gift from above. Confidence is self-awareness. We want to be aware of ourselves. We want to know what our source is, where we came from, what we are doing here on earth. We want to know our respective roles in this cosmic Game, this <em>Lila</em>. Our confidence brings to the fore the inner vision, the reality that we are aiming at, that we want to grow into.</p>
<p>Confidence is not a display of our egocentric life. Confidence is a divine force. Ego binds us, blinds us. Ego offers us the message of separativity and self-enjoyment. Confidence, on the other hand, wants to express its universal oneness. It is for all; it is for the Infinite, the Vast. Confidence cannot be satisfied all by itself. It wants to grow into the Universal Light and Transcendental Height.</p>
<p>When we have confidence in ourselves, we realise the ultimate Truth and Light, the Absolute Supreme. When God has confidence in us, He makes us not only His perfect instruments, but conscious representatives of His Divinity, His Reality, His Infinity, His Eternity and His Immortality on earth. With our confidence in God, we go up and reach His Transcendental Height. With God's Confidence in us, God comes down and makes us His Infinity, His Eternity, His Immortality. And this is not the end of His Game. Then He wants us to manifest what we have become.</p>
<p>Confidence is introduction. Confidence introduces our earthly reality to the divine Reality. And the divine Reality introduces its wealth — infinite Peace, Light and Bliss — to us when we are confident.</p>
<p>Life is either meaningful or meaningless. For those who do not seek, life is meaningless, a barren desert. For seekers, at every moment life is meaningful and fruitful; life has a purpose, a meaning, a reality and an ultimate Goal. What brings us the message of the ultimate Goal, what brings us the reality of the inner world, the more illumining, more fulfilling higher world? It is our confidence. With our confidence-light, we dig deep within; and while digging within we cultivate the bumper-crop of realisation, liberation and perfection.</p>
<p>An unaspiring person talks to himself and talks to the world. But he cannot talk to the Ultimate Reality. It is only a man of confidence, inner confidence, divine confidence, supreme confidence who can talk to the Highest Reality: the Transcendental Vision and the Universal Reality.</p>
<p>One portion of divinity comes down into the world and another remains above. The one that remains above is known as the Father-Reality and the one that comes down is known as the Son-Reality. Again, there comes a time when the two realities become inseparably one and tell the world of their oneness. Jesus Christ, the Saviour, announced, "I and my Father are one." His confidence-light he brought down into the world; and it was his confidence-light that uttered, "I and my Father are one." When divinity enters into humanity and illumines humanity, at that time humanity claims divinity as its very own.</p>
<p>Confidence is oneness with the Beyond, the oneness of earth-life with Heaven-life. Where God is, confidence is bound to be. God has given us the secret key to open up His Heart's Door and that secret key is confidence. We pray, we meditate, only to cultivate one divine quality and that one divine quality is confidence. Confidence shows us the way to go ahead, the way to dive deep within, the way to fly above. Confidence is the pioneer that constantly leads us, guides us, beckons us to the ultimate Source.</p>
<p>Each individual has teeming questions: "Who am I? Where do I come from? What is my ultimate goal?" All the questions of our inner and outer life can be answered by one solitary thing: confidence. If we have confidence, then we can explore the inner world. If we have confidence, then we can explore the outer world.</p>
<p>Here we are all seekers. We want to know the reality that we eternally are and that we are going to offer to the world at large. And for that what we need is perfection, self-perfection. It is only in self-perfection that we can please the Inner Pilot, the Supreme Pilot, the world around us, the world within us. This perfection is our constant confidence in ourselves and in our Inner Pilot.</p>
<p>Again, this confidence has a Source. Its Source is God's Compassion-Light and Compassion-Delight. God grants us Light in boundless measure at our journey's start. And it is He, the Supreme, the Eternal Pilot, who grants us eternal, boundless Delight. Light energises us. Light leads us, guides us to our ultimate destination, where we see the transformation of Light into Delight. Delight fulfils us. Delight immortalises us.</p>
<p>We aspire to become good, to become loving, to become devoted, to become useful to the world at large. But this aspiration also needs something from us. It is confidence that aspiration expects from each seeker. If the seeker is wanting in confidence, then his aspiration can never be regular, it can never be spontaneous, it can never be continuous. But if inside his aspiration confidence looms large, then he walks along a sunlit road to his destined goal.</p>
<p>A child has confidence in his parents. He feels that his parents know everything, have everything and are everything for him. Similarly, a seeker has all confidence in his Inner Pilot, the Supreme, who is guiding his destiny, his life, his aspiration, his realisation, his reality to the ultimate Goal.</p>
<p>Each day we are granted by the Author of all good, out of His infinite Bounty, confidence both in our inner life and in our outer life. But if we use our physical mind — our earth-bound, sophisticated, obscure, unlit, unaspiring, intellectual mind — to search, we may not feel God's Confidence-Light. For the earth-bound mind feels that it is complete in itself; it does not need any reality other than its own existence.</p>
<p>But the heart constantly feels that it can house something more, that it can see something more, that it can grow into something more, that it has something more to offer to the world at large. The heart has the eagerness to receive and to achieve from the world within and from the world without. The heart has a constant inner thirst to be universal, to be transcendental. Therefore, the heart always looks within and around to grasp and invoke the infinite Realities that abide in God's entire Creation. The heart comes to realise that there is only one way to achieve and grow into these infinite Realities and that is the way of self-giving. And what is self-giving today, tomorrow that very thing is God-becoming. So, on the strength of self-giving, our aspiring heart becomes both universal and transcendental. And this self-giving heart has a source of its own and that source is confidence. Confidence also has its source. Its source is God's Compassion, God's infinite, unconditional, immortal Compassion in man, for man.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Progress-delight</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Progress-delight" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>May 15th, 1981. Sri Chinmoy’s lecture was introduced by the President of the Society of the Common Life. As part of Sri Chinmoy’s programme, he performed on esraj, Western flute and harmonium. He also answered questions from the audience.]</p>
<p><em>Asato mā sad gamaya</em><br /><em>Tamaso mā jyotir gamaya</em><br /><em>Mṛtyor māmṛtaṃ gamaya</em></p>
<p>O lead me from the unreal to the Real.<br />Lead me from darkness to Light.<br />Lead me from death to Immortality.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is the prayer the Vedic seers of the hoary past offered to humanity. It is at once a soulful prayer and a fruitful meditation. I am a seeker. If I can soulfully pray and fruitfully meditate, then I make progress. This prayer and meditation embodies my progress and delight.</p>
<p><em>Ānandāddhyeva khalvimāni bhūtāni jāyante</em><br /><em>ānandena jātāni jīvanti</em><br /><em>ānandaṃ prayantyabhisaṃ viśanti</em></p>
<p>From Delight we came into existence.<br />In Delight we grow.<br />At the end of our journey’s close, into Delight we shall retire.</p>
<p>A seeker’s progress is his delight. Again, his delight is his progress. A seeker’s progress-delight is his self-transcendence. I am a seeker, a Truth-seeker. I am a lover, a God-lover. I transcend. What do I transcend? I transcend my inner capacity and my outer capacity. My inner capacity is my receptivity and my outer capacity is my speed. I must needs have a receptivity-heart larger than the largest. Something more, I must needs have an ever-expanding heart. I need speed. Faster than the fastest speed I need in my life. Something more, I need an ever-increasing speed, so that sooner than at once I can reach my goal. And again, I know perfectly well that each goal is the starting point of a further goal, a higher goal, a deeper goal.</p>
<p>My progress-delight is my Lord’s revealing Sound. My progress-delight is my Lord’s fulfilling Silence.</p>
<p>Thoughtful inspiration I need, soulful aspiration I need, fruitful meditation I need. My thoughtful inspiration will make me a great God-seeker, my soulful aspiration will make me a good God-server and my fruitful realisation will make me a perfect God-lover.</p>
<p>I cry and I smile. I cry in my heart and I smile with my soul. My heart’s cry reaches the perfection-sky. My soul’s smile transcends to the satisfaction-sun. I must ascend and transcend. My ascendance is my aspiration-cry and my transcendence is my satisfaction-smile.</p>
<p>There are human beings who think that life is a dream, an illusion, while others claim that life is a battlefield. Still others think that life is a divine play and each human being is a divine instrument. A seeker is he who has become a conscious instrument of his Beloved Supreme. Him to love, Him to serve and Him to manifest in His own Way is the aim, the sleepless aim, of the seeker.</p>
<p>Here we are all seekers. What we have is a mounting cry and what we are is a gratitude-flame. On the strength of our aspiration-cry and our gratitude-flame, we are bound to reach our destined Goal: the Goal that is beckoning us, the Goal of God-satisfaction in God’s own Way at God’s choice Hour. There can be no better way to feel progress-delight and to feel our entire being flooded with light and delight than to please God in God’s own Way. How do we achieve this? We achieve this great realisation-height only when we value at every moment the real self within us and not the usual self within us. The real self within us is our constant inner cry. The usual self within us is our desire-cry, which at every moment wallows in the pleasures of ignorance.</p>
<p>Success-life is not our goal. Progress-life is our goal. We compete not with others. We compete with our teeming doubts, worries and anxieties. When we minimise our doubts, worries and anxieties, we make more satisfactory progress, and there comes a time when we free ourselves, liberate ourselves totally, from doubts, anxieties, worries, insecurities and so forth. That is the moment when we enjoy our progress-delight.</p>
<p>Soulfully let us pray, fruitfully let us meditate, and ours will be the Goal of goals: God-realisation in God’s own Way.</p>
