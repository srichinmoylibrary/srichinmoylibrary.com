<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can see God if you pray and meditate when you are alive most devotedly and soulfully. When you die you don't actually die. Your body dies but your soul remains alive and always alert. At that time you are nothing but your soul. Now you are nothing but your body. When you are the body, you have to pray and meditate to see God. When you are the soul, you just spread your wings. Lo, you will see that God too has wings.</p>

<h2>Question: Why is it that I cannot see God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sweetest Stephanie, you see God, but you do not recognise Him. There are many people on earth whom you see, but you do not know who they are. But once somebody tells you who these people are, then later on when you see them you easily recognise them. For example, when you saw a policeman for the first time, you did not know who he was. But once your parents told you, each time you saw a policeman you knew that it was a policeman. Similarly, when you see God, one day either your soul or your Guru will tell you who God is. Also, you have one more eye in between your eyebrows, a little above. Pray to God to open up that eye. Once He opens up that eye, you will not only see God but recognise Him.</p>
<p>If you see through the third eye, you will be able to recognise God easily. But if you see with your two human eyes, then you will not recognise Him. At that time you need either your soul or your Guru to tell you that He whom you have seen is God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people see Light and others don't because some people need Light while others don't need it. If you need something, then you see it, get it and grow into it. If you don't need it, you will not care to see it. When you were a baby, you cried for toys and your parents did give you toys because you needed them. Now you are a little bit grown up. You do not care for toys as much as you did before. Therefore, your parents do not bring you the same number of toys as they did before. A few years later you will not care for toys at all. Therefore your parents will not bring you any toys. So you see, when you needed something, you got it; and when you do not need it, you don't get it. But I wish you to feel the need of Light all your life so that God will always be most pleased with you and most proud of you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dearest Nicole, I have not only seen God personally but I shall make you see God when God wants me to show Him to you. There is something called God's Hour. I can show you God only when God's Hour strikes in your life. But in the meantime you can hasten God's Hour by praying and meditating every day most devotedly and soulfully. Try! You will certainly see God as I see God. Needless to say, I shall always help you with my heart's deepest concern and blessingful love.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is karma?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is karma?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Nicole, I am so glad you have learned the word 'karma'. It is a Sanskrit word. It means work. In our spiritual life, when we use this word we usually mean service. Now, whom do we serve? We serve God. Why do we serve Him? Not because He has tremendous power, but because He is extremely fond of us. We serve Him because when we serve Him, He never makes us feel that we are His slaves. On the contrary, He makes us feel that He and we are one and equal. It is like holding a mango in your right hand and then putting it in your left hand. This action of placing is called karma. Why do we do that? We do that because our right hand loves our left hand and our left hand loves our right hand. Just because the left hand loves the right hand as well, a few minutes later the left hand will also place something in the right hand. So karma means give and take. Karma means service, but here service means give and take. We give to God. We give Him what we have: our ignorance; and God gives us what He eternally is: Light.</p>

<h2>Question: Where does God live?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God lives everywhere, but His home is like a house. There are many rooms inside the house. You spend most of your time in your living room. When somebody wants to see you, he enters into the living room and finds you there. For you, the living room is your heart. If you enter into the heart-room, God is found there very easily. He is in the heart-room all the time. True, he is everywhere else all the time, but inside the heart-room His Presence is seen and felt most.</p>

But once I realised God, I came to know that I had definitely always known Him from the beginning of His creation, from His highest transcendental Height to when He entered into the heart of inconscience. That was a very long, long time ago.</p>
