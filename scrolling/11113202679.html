<p>An hour later, I was running to the tennis court. A young boy was standing there, holding some books. He was about seventeen or eighteen years old.</p>
<p>He said, "Guru, you look fine. Guru, you look fine." Then he noticed a tennis racquet in my hand. "Oh, you play tennis as well?"</p>

<p>This morning around 5:30, a lady came out of her house with a little dog. I was going down 150th Street, running very slowly. She said, "Hi!" Then I said, "Hi." She said, "I was talking to my dog, not you."</p>
<p>I went on running. About fifteen minutes later, as I was running very slowly up the hill, I saw the same lady in her front yard. I didn't pay any attention to her. I didn't want to be insulted by her again.</p>
<p>She said, "Hi!" This time I absolutely remained silent. She said, "What is the matter with you? You don't know how to talk?"</p>
<p>This was my morning blessing. I thought she was saying "Hi" to me, but her dog is better than I am. Then she insulted me again, fifteen minutes later. This is how the lady blessed me.</p>

<p>I said, "I am very tired." He had just started running, and I was stopping.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at two o'clock in the morning in Queens I was walking very fast. Six cars — not one, but six — were bothering me like anything. They were driven by young boys, blacks and Puerto Ricans. They were going against the light and going the wrong way down a one-way street. They were screaming and doing all kinds of absurd things.</p>
<p>Then they drove onto the sidewalk to bother me. So I tried to get the license numbers. Then they got frightened and said, "Sorry, sorry, we won't do it anymore."</p>

<p>For fifty metres during the inspiration Marathon, I was blessing Hashi like anything. How? I was ten or fifteen metres behind her. Each time I saw her shadow, bang! I put my left foot on her head. For fifty metres I did it. It was at the twelve-mile point.</p>
<p>I was ten or fifteen metres behind her. She is so short, but her shadow was quite long. Then, the second time Hashi started running with me, she went so fast.</p>

<p>In the Vermont Inspiration Marathon, the first time I saw G., at sixteen miles, he was smiling. S. was behind him. The second time I saw them, S. was ahead of G.. S. was so happy that he was ahead and had taken the lead.</p>
<p>When I started running at the twenty-one mile mark, I saw S. again. He was very glad to see me and said, "Guru, Guru, Guru!" G. was nowhere near him. I was always waiting to see if I would hear G.'s footsteps, and I kept looking around. But the only footsteps I heard behind me were not a man's. It was P. G. was walking.</p>
<p>Then I saw that husband and wife were going together — Y. was inspiring him.</p>
<p>The first time I saw him at sixteen miles, he was quite happy. Then at twenty-one miles, he was not smiling, but S. was so happy.</p>

<p>I was on 150th Street, returning from my morning run. I had just passed a few of my girl disciples.</p>
<p>As I was approaching the bus stop, a woman with thickly painted lipstick said to me, "Master, Master, why do you have to run? Why can't your disciples run for you?"</p>
<p>I smiled at her and said, "I run and they run too."</p>
<p>Had one of the disciples whom I had just passed run by at that moment, I could have said to the woman, "Here is the proof. I am running, and they are running too."</p>
<p>How do these people know me? I'm sure this lady was Puerto Rican, or else she wouldn't have used the term "Master."</p>

One foot away there was a pole, and I fell against it. Otherwise, my whole head would have been smashed.</p>
<p>At that time, I did not think license number. The accident seemed like nothing. But when the shock was over, about two minutes afterwards, I could not see anything."</p>
