  <h2 id="page-title">The chosen instrument of God</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The chosen instrument of God" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>U Thant was a chosen instrument of God. U Thant was a chosen instrument of man.</p>
<p>God gave him His Compassion-sky to offer to man. Man gave him his suffering-sea to offer to God.</p>
<p>U Thant started his earthly sojourn as a Rangoon, Burma Buddha-son. The Absolute Supreme gradually made him into a universal Wisdom-son and a universal Blessing-gift.</p>
<p>To us, peace is something that belongs in a dream-land. Since it belongs to dream-land we talk about it. To U Thant, peace is something that belongs to the reality-world. Therefore he lived in the reality-world of peace and was a solid and treasured member of the reality-peace-world.</p>
<p>To us, oneness is something that we seem to want but we do not actually feel the need for it. To U Thant, oneness was something of constant need, something indispensable. His heart cried for this oneness and the Lord Supreme, the Author of all good, fulfilled his heart’s burning desire.</p>
<p>The United Nations gave U Thant the opportunity to speak to the world-body as a supreme leader of mankind. In return, U Thant gave to the United Nations the message of the world-illumination, of the world-heart-perfection and the world-life-satisfaction.</p>
<p>U Thant was the supreme choice of the United Nations, and God was pleased. But God wanted U Thant to please Him more. Therefore, he made U Thant a pioneer voice of light from the higher worlds.</p>
<p>Simplicity, purity and integrity he was. He was a child’s simplicity. He was a saint’s purity. He was a God-lover’s integrity.</p>
<p>He struggled calmly. He suffered ceaselessly. He hoped sleeplessly. Again, he knew how to dream of success. He knew how to become the river of progress.</p>
<p>We feel that man is bad, imperfect and undivine. His conviction was that man is good, perfect and divine, for that is what each individual in the inner world eternally is.</p>
<p>U Thant’s life of humility was the result of his heart’s nobility. His heart of nobility was the result of his soul’s unparalleled divinity.</p>
<p>Sincerity spoke through him, integrity breathed in him, spirituality walked with him. He knew the world-problem: ignorance. He knew the world-answer: meditation, and this he practised in silence.</p>
<p>God practised His silence-meditation in and through U Thant. God practised His sound-dedication in and through U Thant.</p>
<p>U Thant was at once God-Humility and man-dignity. He was at once man-frustration and God-Illumination. He was at once the soulful son of God and the faithful slave of man.</p>
<p>Self-demonstration he ruthlessly shunned. Self-perfection he practised. God-Perfection he sought to embrace and treasure. Before him the United Nations was great, divinely great. With him, after him, the United Nations has become supremely good.</p>
<p>In the inner world he was God’s Promise, God’s Promise to the outer world. In the outer world he was man’s confidence, man’s confidence in becoming a dedicated instrument of the inner world.</p>
<p>Earth gave him the responsibility. Heaven knew it and saw it. Heaven gave him the authority but, unfortunately, earth did not know it or did not care to know it. His heart of brotherhood was misunderstood. His life of sacrifice was not valued. But his vision of oneness-goal will eternally be pursued by aspiring humanity.</p>
<p>An Asian seed he was. A world-fruit he has become and forever and forever he shall remain.</p>

<p>[The Secretary-General and Sri Chinmoy greeted each other with folded hands at the door of the room where the interview was to take place, and then U Thant invited Sri Chinmoy to come in.]</p>
<p><em>U Thant:</em> Sri Chinmoy, please come in. I have been hearing about you from many, many people. Whoever speaks to me about you is all appreciation and admiration and I personally feel that you have been doing a most significant task for the United Nations. I have been observing it from the very beginning.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is most kind of you to tell me all this. I am most grateful to you. Before our short interview, may I invoke the Lord Buddha to bless us? You are a most devoted child of the Lord Buddha and I have the greatest admiration and adoration for him.</p>
<p><em>U Thant:</em> Yes, please, please chant.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy chanted three times:</p>

<p><em>Buddham saranam gacchami</em><br /><em>Dhammam saranam gacchami</em><br /><em>Sangham saranam gacchami</em></p>
<p>[I go to the Buddha for refuge.<br /> I go to the Dharma for refuge.<br /> I go to the Order for refuge.]</p>

<p><em>U Thant:</em> [U Thant was silent for some moments, deeply moved.] I have not been able to see you before please forgive me. Because of my heavy schedule and politics, my inner life was not coming to the fore for me. That is why I hesitated a little to see you. Today I am seeing you and I wish to say that all I have heard from others about you is absolutely true.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The world knows you as a champion of peace. Being a spiritual man, I wish to tell you that in the inner world too you are something really great. Now that you are physically away from the outer battlefield you will be able to see the world situation with your intuitive light and you will make a contribution in the inner world that will be most effective and most fulfilling.</p>
<p><em>U Thant:</em> I am so happy to hear that. This is what I wanted. Now I will be writing my memoirs and I need a peaceful life. My memoirs will be different, totally different, from the memoirs that others write. Here I want to show how spirituality and philosophy can lead and guide politics.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is the thing that only you can do because in you I see a true seeker of Truth, Peace, Light and Bliss. I know nothing about politics, but I do feel that politics has to be guided by spirituality and philosophy. What you are saying, most revered Brother, gives me immense delight.</p>
<p><em>U Thant:</em> I pray to the Lord Buddha for a continuous success in your mission in spreading God’s Peace and Light on earth.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I appreciate and admire you, not only as a great lover of mankind, but as a most devoted, dedicated child of God who wants to bring God’s wealth from the inner world and offer it to his brothers and sisters.</p>
<p><em>U Thant:</em> It has been a great privilege for me to see you. Please feel my sincere respect and sincere concern for what you are doing for mankind.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please feel my deepest joy and pride in you and my most soulful gratitude for what you have done for the United Nations and also for the entire world.</p>
<p>[As Sri Chinmoy left, he and U Thant saluted each other with palms joined together, in pranam.]</p>

<p>With your kind permission I wish to offer two most striking experiences of mine. The first was when I met with Secretary-General U Thant in his office. His simplicity, sincerity, humility, purity and divinity made me immediately feel that I had found in him a true and genuine spiritual brother. In him I also discovered a heart of universal oneness. Then, a few years ago, I had the golden opportunity to pay my most soulful respects to the soul of Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold at his grave in Uppsala. While I was offering my most soulful love, appreciation and adoration to this divinely great soul, I discovered immediately the luminosity of his mind. In his mind I found the most illumining and fulfilling vastness. Two supremely giant souls — Dag Hammarskjold and U Thant, U Thant and Dag Hammarskjold. Inside the vastness of Dag Hammarskjold my heart felt the love of oneness, and inside the oneness of U Thant my soul envisioned the vastness. Their oneness and vastness and vastness and oneness make me feel and realise that this United Nations — their dream-fulfilling reality and reality-transcending dream — will forever and ever be cherished and treasured by the aspiring, self-giving and truth-loving humanity.</p>

<h2>Abdelaziz Bouteflika</h2>

<p>The past and the present can be United. The past can offer its wisdom-light to the present so the present can be a source of pride, light and delight to the future. It happens that sometimes it is necessary to break asunder the past in order to have a clear and illumining vision of the years to come. But U Thant had the unusual inner strength to do what was nearly impossible and unite the past, the present and the future.</p>
<p>Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the U.N. General Assembly in 1974, has brought to the world’s attention something unique with regard to U Thant’s unusual capacity and unprecedented achievement: “Who was better qualified than U Thant to preside over such a transformation without breaking with the past while keeping a clear vision of the future, without frustrating the great powers or driving the small ones to despair? The metamorphosis through which our Organization went at that time resulted from a gradual evolution the scope or depth of which, since it took place smoothly, was often unguessed at.”</p>

<p>Mortals long for name and fame, for they feel that to have name and fame is to have everything. But U Thant did not see eye to eye with human beings. He felt that only service to mankind, acceptance of the inner light and the manifestation of truth, light and bliss on earth could quench his inner thirst.</p>
<p>He refused world acclaim sincerely and smilingly. Service was his joy. The result of all his actions he offered in silence at the Feet of the Lord Buddha. The supreme pilot of the United Nations-Boat, Kurt Waldheim, who brings about world progress with lightning speed, graciously tells us of U Thant’s genuine concern for world problems and his significant contribution to world hope and world peace: “In 1965, when full-scale war erupted between India and Pakistan, U Thant went to the subcontinent to negotiate a cease-fire. At about the same time also, the tragedy of Viet-Nam, in which the United Nations was never directly involved, began to assume its historical momentum. U Thant made a long personal effort to help in ending the Viet-Namese tragedy. In 1967, there was renewed war in the Middle East. In early 1971, the war clouds gathered again in the South Asian subcontinent and the situation dominated U Thant’s last months as Secretary-General.”</p>

<p>His body U Thant sacrificed. Untold suffering he embraced. Wild frustration he endured. The present-day world is extremely grateful to Secretary-General Waldheim for revealing these illumining and fulfilling secrets about his predecessor: “No one will ever know the intense internal struggle which U Thant’s discipline and his deep faith concealed from the public gaze. He was occasionally even reproached for his calm. His medical history, which he concealed as far as possible, tells another story — the story of a good and disciplined man doing his best to perform one of the most difficult jobs in the world, and privately enduring the extremes of fatigue, worry and frustration.”</p>

All these years he has been engaged in a passionate quest for peace and his selection for the Award has evoked universal acclaim.” With these remarks, we see one world teacher appreciating another world teacher.</p>

<p>Only a man of vision can recognise another man of vision. Only a man of promise can recognise another man of promise. Only a man of concern can recognise another man of concern</p>
<p>President John F. Kennedy saw in U Thant a sun of wisdom-light. President Kennedy discovered in U Thant a colossal achievement.</p>
<p>In a telegram, President Kennedy declared: “The election of His Excellency U Thant is a splendid achievement in which the whole world can rejoice.</p>
<p>“Please express the congratulations of the United States Government to the United Nations membership for their action in electing so distinguished a diplomat to succeed the late Dag Hammarskjold.</p>
<p>“In preserving the integrity of the office of the Secretary-General, they have reaffirmed their dedication to the U.N. Charter....As he [U Thant] begins one of the world’s most difficult jobs, he has our confidence and also our prayers.”</p>
<p>Mr. Zenon Rossides, Ambassador of Cyprus to the United Nations, described President Kennedy’s response to U Thant’s handling of the Cuban missile crisis: “The most dangerous of all crises since the Second World War was resolved in a manner that prompted President Kennedy to say, ‘U Thant has put the world deeply in his debt.’”</p>

<p>Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s peerless freedom-fighter and India’s matchless nation-transformer, offered these words of welcome and cooperation to U Thant in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on 10 November 1961, a few days after U Thant had been appointed Acting Secretary-General: “To you, sir, who occupy now this high seat of the Secretary-General, I offer my warm welcome and regard and greeting. And I can assure you that we, in common with others, not only welcome you here but offer you our full cooperation, for you represent the United Nations, to which all of us must offer cooperation.”</p>

<p>Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Queen of India’s heart and veerless pilot of India, expressed her strong support and admiration for U Thant in an address to the United Nations General Assembly on 14 October 1968. Speaking of U Thant’s miraculous perseverance, she said: “I should like to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General.

<p>His confidant and closest associate, C.V. Narasimhan, U Thant’s chef de Cabinet, shares rare insights about U Thant: “U Thant was a Buddhist, but not a fanatic. Indeed one could not conceive of his being fanatical on any subject, except perhaps in respect of his total commitment to the Charter of the United Nations. From his religion derived his modesty and humility. It was these qualities which made him repeatedly assert in the course of 1966 that he would not be available for a second term as Secretary-General. He used to say that no person should aspire to a second term as Secretary-General. His calmness in times of crisis bordered on nonchalance and was in fact sometimes even criticised when it was mistaken for indifference. His total serenity in his personal relations was no doubt the cause of his ulcers; although his doctors advised him to explode now and again, it was inconceivable that he would, even to save his health.”</p>

<p>The Indian heart comforted him by presenting him with the first Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding. By honouring him, India once more reaffirmed its message to the world at large — its motto <em>Satyam eva jayate:</em> “Truth alone prevails.”</p>
<p>Swaran Singh, Indian Minister of Foreign Affairs, a man who perfectly blended mind and heart, said: “My country recognised his great contribution to world peace by conferring on him the first Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding on 12 April 1967. We wish him a well-earned rest but we hope his advice will still be available to all of us in the years to come.”</p>
