<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It happened three times very recently. Once, after I dialled, I changed my mind. I wanted to do something infinitely more important. Another time I let the phone ring three times, but there was no answer, so I gave up. Usually you answer on the second ring. And once your consciousness was unimaginably low. After I dialled I got a very unpleasant vibration, inner resentment, so I didn't speak to you. It was the day you took vacation for four or five days. I didn't send you, but you decided yourself to take vacation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Jason is so appealing because God has given him a heart which is extremely, extremely generous. He does not think, he does. And when he does, most of the time, he does with his heart. Therefore, people see in him the flowering of a heart and not the unnecessary flickering of a mind. That is why he is so appealing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not only do they have the capacity to help humanity, but they <em>do</em> help, provided people believe in their existence. They help humanity mostly through inspiration. The inspiration that they offer is not received by the mind, but by the life-energy, during the inhalation and exhalation of the aspiring breath. Again, there are destructive beings, but you are not speaking of the destructive beings.</p>

For 699 calories a day He will take responsibility. More than that if you take, you will be responsible. And drink four glasses of water, at least! If you do this, then your health problems will be solved.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> According to Jason the Great, you are oblivious of the world around you. You are either fixed on the world on which you are focusing your attention, or you are in your own world of fantasies and phantasmagoria. In your case, no matter what you do, you use your concentration power beyond necessity. When you use your power of concentration beyond necessity on mundane things, you are misusing it. It is like buying something at a higher price when you know that you can get it at a lower price. If you spend your money unnecessarily while buying one object, then naturally you will be short of money when you want to buy something else that is more important and more significant for your life.</p>
<p>While you are walking along the street, you need a certain kind of power of concentration: otherwise, you will not be able to walk properly and you will have an accident. But if your concentration expands and extends unnecessarily, if you are at one place and you are concentrating on the cars that are one or two blocks away, then you are misusing your power of concentration. For those cars are not going to come at you; they are quite far away.</p>
<p>When you are deeply absorbed in buying material things, you are not concentrating on the objects themselves. Here only you are lost. Your mind is lost in the material world. The material world we need, true. But everything has its own importance, and the material world is not so important that it should completely absorb your attention. Concentration is like money-power. It is not advisable to pay too much attention to the material world, for then you are squandering your money.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: After a few hours of working at Annam Brahma, I get a strong desire to go up into a nice, cool, breezy tree house and go to sleep. How can I conquer this desire?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: After a few hours of working at &lt;em&gt;Annam Brahma,&lt;/em&gt; I get a strong desire to go up into a nice, cool, breezy tree house and go to sleep. How can I conquer this desire?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to satisfy this desire in the world of imagination, you can. But if you want to fulfil it on the practical plane, it is impossible. You have to know that imagination is a world of its own, a reality-world. Take imagination as the first floor of your life and physical reality, let us say, as the basement. The imagination world is higher than the reality-world, but both worlds are used; the basement is used and the first floor is also used.</p>
<p>If you want something that is on the first floor, then naturally you will go there. But if you want to find the same thing in the basement, then there are a few things that you will have to do.</p>
<p>I have my harpsichord in the meditation room. Right now, let us say, I am in the basement, so if I want to play, I have to come to the meditation room. I can also bring the instrument down to the basement and play there. But for that I will need to take help from a few strong boys, and it is very difficult.</p>
<p>Why do you have to do something on a particular plane which is inaccessible to you? You may feel that you should always try to do whatever is difficult, difficult, difficult, and you may think that imagination is easy. But there are many people on earth who can't imagine at all. Who says that it is easy to imagine? No, no, no! For a few seconds you can think of the vast ocean, you can think of the vast sky. But try for five minutes to imagine. It will be impossible! In one minute your imagination-power will be gone. So do not think of the imagination-world as a weak world and the physical reality as a strong, real world. No. Whatever is in the imagination-world is real. Something does not have to be in the basement to be absolute or real. So always try to become part and parcel of the reality in the imagination-world. Imagination is a real reality which is trying to be manifested in the physical plane.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. In the souls' world they have enjoyment. In their eyes, sometimes our enjoyment borders on the undivine or vulgar, to say the least. But in the souls' world it is not like that. When we perform skits about the undivine qualities of others, at that time we cause suffering for others. But in the souls' world, the sense of amusement is different. It is based on utmost purity. There they do enjoy this kind of amusing skit, and from their amusement they get experiences. From anything they do they get experiences. But no matter what they do, whether it is just for fun or whether it is something sublime, it is done with tremendous purity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If he stops telling funny stories his heart will lose strength and become small, smaller, smallest. Then it will not be able to contain energising, elevating, illumining and fulfilling life. So Jason should not and must not give up telling illumining stories. His stories are innocent. They not only give us immortal lessons but also give a spontaneous inner awakening to those who want nothing but progress through pure innocence, pure concern for mankind and pure oneness with mankind on any plane. Jason's stories do not bring embarrassment. They bring inspiration; they are a blessing in disguise.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, God has told you a secret. That secret is not to expect anything from others or even from your own aspiration and dedication, but to expect everything from the Supreme inside your Guru. You cannot expect anything because of your determination or because of your speed or because of what you are going to become; you can expect only because the Supreme in your Master is always unconditional compassion, constant concern and unconditional fulfilment for you. This is the supreme secret that God has told your soul. Your soul has given this message to your aspiring heart. When the hour strikes, your aspiring heart will also give this message to your mind. Then when the hour strikes for your mind, it will also do the needful and give the message to your vital. And when the hour strikes for your vital, your vital will do the needful and give the message to your body. Your soul has already done the needful. Your heart is taking some time, and the mind's illumination is not complete. As for the vital and the body, they are still totally unaware of the ultimate reality that will eventually be manifested by the seeker in you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The cosmic gods and the spiritual Masters do enjoy jokes. They enjoy jokes about earth's self-imposed responsibility. They enjoy jokes about Heaven's promise to earth, which remains only a promise and does not become a reality on the physical plane. And when earth says that it has done everything that it can for God, which is totally absurd, the cosmic gods enjoy earth's stupidity. The cosmic gods and spiritual Masters enjoy jokes when Heaven says that earth is too weak and too impure for Heaven to keep on helping it. They also laugh at Heaven's stupid, baseless estimation of earth's capacity. Whenever stupidity looms large as a reality-conviction either in Heaven or on earth, the cosmic gods and spiritual Masters make jokes about it. Stupidity's self-aggrandised capacity the cosmic gods always joke about, for stupidity can never conquer the reality. It is the reality, the divinity, that will eventually conquer stupidity, not by punishing it but by loving it. The face of stupidity and the mind of stupidity can and will be transformed.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When Harry was given an award by the president of the U.N. Ambassador Hotel, the Supreme laughed twice. Once God laughed when Harry thought that somebody was president other than Himself. The Supreme laughed because He is the only president. Then the Supreme laughed when Harry thought that it was he who deserved the award. So the Supreme laughed twice: once when He heard that there was another president, and once when He heard that the person who received the honour from the president felt that he deserved it. The Supreme is the president and He is also the recipient of the award. When everybody knows this, only then He will stop laughing. He is the only giver, He is the only receiver. When the whole world realises this, the Supreme will stop laughing; not before that.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In money-power or heart-power? Easily you can be as rich as Jason in money-power, but first try to be rich in heart-power. How can you be rich in heart-power? You can be rich in heart-power by feeling sincere concern for the rest of the world. Every time you do something for someone, you have to feel that the other person has done you a big favour. Every time you do something for someone, feel that you are doing it for your own progress. Never think that you are doing someone a favour. Feel that he is doing you a favour by giving you an opportunity to make inner progress. If you can bring forward your heart-power, then money-power will automatically come. Since you are desperately in need of money-power, then give your heart-power and concern-power. That is the only way you can become happy. When you are really happy, it is not difficult to achieve money-power.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the particular human being with whom He is dealing. God is a perfect gentleman. If a teenager, especially a young girl, giggles, then God returns the giggle in a more powerful manner. If a seeker feels inner happiness and smiles at God, then God gives him an infinitely more soulful smile in return. And if a carefree person laughs and laughs, either to forget the pressures of the world or to feel that the world is all illusion, then God also laughs, for it is true that the world is an illusion for those who believe in illusion. God says, "If you believe in illusion, I want to please you by bringing everything to you as illusion." So whenever we laugh, God returns our laughter, for He does not want to remain indebted to anybody. It is we who have to decide whether we shall offer God a soulful smile, a silly giggle or our stupid, shameless laughter. But whatever we offer, God will return it, for He does not want to remain indebted to us.</p>
