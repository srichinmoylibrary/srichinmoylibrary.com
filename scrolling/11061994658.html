<p>This morning I tried to go sleep at around 2:00, but I was restless, so I got up. While getting up I bumped into the stronger-than-the-strongest metal bar near the scale in my bedroom. By then it was already 2:30. Sound sleep I didn’t get yesterday even for 10 or 11 minutes. Usually, when I get up I take a 10-minute shower, but this time I took a 20-minute shower to make sure I didn’t fall asleep while exercising.</p>
<p>I did each exercise so many times! First I lifted 10 pounds 50 times, then I lifted 20, 30 and 40 pounds. From 40 pounds I jumped up to 2,000.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Best Prediction</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Best Prediction" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Last night a few boys were over at my house for Sahishnu’s birthday. Everybody was predicting when I would lift 2,000 pounds. They all said I would do it today. Dhanu and Achyuta were the only ones who didn’t make any predictions.</p>
<p>Some were saying that I would do it at 1:30 in the morning. I told them that I would not try before 4:30 because I was so tired and exhausted, but still they thought I would try right away.</p>
<p>Some predicted times that were only 10 minutes after Unmilan and others finished building the new power rack.</p>
<p>Sahishnu’s prediction was the closest. He said I would lift 2,000 pounds at 7:37 a.m.</p>
<p>This morning at 4:30, I started doing my usual endless weightlifting exercises. Then, at around a quarter to seven, I started attempting to lift 2,039. It was over 500 pounds heavier than my previous best lift, 3 days ago. My fifth attempt was my best performance. After my fifth attempt, I looked at the time and saw it was 7:40. So Sahishnu’s prediction was the best.</p>
<p>Ketan was the farthest away. He said I would do it at 9:00.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My Prayer</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My Prayer" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I always give a very nice prayer before I lift, either silently or out loud. Today in my mind I was praying that either in the near or distant future I would lift the 2,000 pounds. But the phrase “in the near or distant future” was not coming out. I could not add that phrase to my prayer because God knew that it wouldn’t be in the near or distant future but in the immediate future.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Mother Kali On Video</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Mother Kali On Video" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I lifted 1,515 pounds a few days ago and also today when I lifted 2,039 pounds, only my Mother Kali was there — nobody else. She did everything to help me. She came with such power and such beauty and stood on the metal plates with one foot on one side and the other foot on the other side. Then she lifted the weights up on the inner plane even before I actually started my lift. Then, just before I began my actual lift, she told me, “My child, you have done it!” Then she got off the weight.</p>
<p>When she stands on the weight, which is so high, the ceiling disappears. At that time you don’t even see the ceiling. The inner plane where the gods and goddesses appear is far beyond the physical plane, so the physical surroundings don’t interfere at all.</p>
<p>If I see the video, I will be able to see Mother Kali. She has become part and parcel of the video because her consciousness in the room was so powerful. With the third eye one can see it. The original video has the fragrance of her consciousness. I do not know if she will appear on copies.</p>

<p>2,000 pounds feels so difficult compared to 1,500. But extra strength comes from within. This extra strength you can see in my screaming. For today’s 2,000-pound lift, the noise that I made you can’t imagine! It is so frightening!</p>
<p>I concentrate on each weight before I lift it. At the same time, I don’t think of it. When I look at the weights, believe me, there is nobody more frightened than I am. I say, “This is the weight I am going to lift!” But then more inner strength comes.</p>

<p>Two video cameras can prove that I did my 2,000-pound one-arm lift. On my second attempt I was successful, and my third and fourth lifts were progressively better. But the fifth one was the best.</p>
<p>On my fifth lift my tongue was out of my mouth! If Ranjana had taken pictures from the other side, then my tongue could have been seen. I became like Mother Kali. On the video you can hear what kind of scream I gave.</p>

The camera clicked, but it was the wrong film. Fortunately, this time with my 2,000-pound lift, there was no problem.</p>

<p>After I did my 2,000-pound one-arm lift, I was so happy! I phoned up Bill Pearl right away. I was so excited and he was so excited. He knew I was trying to do 2,000, but he thought it would take 10 to 15 days because Unmilan had not yet fixed the power rack. When I told him what time I did the lifts, he said that he had been saying my name 100 times at that very hour, while I was lifting.</p>
<p>Bill Pearl says I am not threatening anybody in the weightlifting world now because I have passed that stage. He says I have come to the “unbelievable” stage.</p>

<p>This morning, when I was lifting the cow, the weight that they gave was totally wrong. When I first tried to lift it, I said, “This will be my first embarrassment.” Then I killed myself and did it!</p>
<p>I wanted to have Samarpana on the platform while I was lifting the cow, but the cow was so heavy that I changed my mind. I said, “Now if I take Samarpana also, it will be too much for me to lift.”</p>
<p>Already the platform that is on top of my shoulders weighs 460 pounds. It is much more difficult than the one which rests on the ground.</p>
<p>In Chittagong we had a cow named Nandini that was almost the same size as the one I lifted today. We had anothercow named Surabhi. Surabhi was quite thin and Nandini was quite heavy.</p>

<p>Of all the animals, the cow received the most from me spiritually when I lifted it up. Then came the bull. The donkey was the worst. The deer received a little. One horse received a lot. The lamb also received.</p>
<p>Both the elephants received so much. The big one, Jack, received a lot. Before the lift, I garlanded it and said, “You are my friend, my heart’s friend, my soul’s friend, my life’s friend.”</p>
<p>Karen, the little elephant, also received, but Jack’s soul is more mature, much more advanced. Jack will have a human incarnation, whereas Karen will take a few more animal incarnations.</p>

<p>The world is so peculiar. Last year, when I went to a gym in San Francisco, the owner would not condescend even to talk to me. One of his workers showed me so many exercises. He was so kind to me and gave me lots of advice.</p>
<p>Now the owner has become my greatest admirer. He has posted so many pictures of my weightlifting. Yesterday he predicted I will do 2,000 pounds. He has pictures of my 600 and 800-pound lifts. But when I went to his gym the first time, he would not talk to me.</p>

<p>Once some nuns invited Bill Pearl to speak to some disabled people about fitness. He got so nervous. When he saw those unfortunate people, he could not speak. Nothing was coming out. Finally he said, “Sorry, I can’t say anything.”</p>
<p>He was comparing his experience to what happened when I led a meditation at the bodybuilding exhibition in Vancouver. Since it was a new world for me, he thought in front of 2,000 people I would also behave that way. But I didn’t get frightened. I only had to meditate; I didn’t have to say a word.</p>
