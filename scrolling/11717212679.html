 <p>
SCA 1244-1248. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in Xiamen, China, on 20 December 2004.</p>
<h2>Question: I love everything in nature. It inspires me and makes me happy. But I do not like the wind and I am wondering what is the quality of wind?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good question! The wind has many, many spiritual meanings. Let us say you are in a park or an open space and you are doing something serious. Then the wind comes. From the human point of view, it ruins everything. But then again, it depends on how we take it. In my case, the wind gives me tremendous joy. On the one hand, we can say that the wind embodies restlessness. On the other hand, we can say that the wind makes us feel that the entire world is very small. It starts blowing in one place and then it goes to another place. So far and so fast it goes! So, unless it is very, very cold, I really like wind. In Chittagong and Pondicherry, it used to give me tremendous joy.</p>
<p>The wind shows us that nothing is permanent at any one place. We feel that one particular place is permanent. We have kept some important papers there and we are sure that the papers will remain in a fixed position. Then the wind starts blowing. Alas, everything flies away.</p>
<p>In my case, when there is wind, I get nourishment in my entire being. Even if the lower portion of my body is covered and only my face and upper portion are exposed a little, when the wind comes I feel that it goes inside my body, like the blood it is flowing.</p>
<p>The wind has many, many good qualities, but the main thing is that it shows us life is not permanent. It breaks our way of living. We have a fixed way of staying peaceful and so forth. But the wind comes and gives us the message, "No, no, no! Do not take life so seriously! This life is not permanent. It will go away. So why do you have to take life so seriously?"</p>
<p>In so many ways, the wind helps us. But if you do not like the wind because of your personal feelings, there is nothing wrong with that. It depends on how you take it. Sometimes, while children are playing, the wind is blowing and they get additional joy and energy. Look at the difference! Here you are disliking the wind, but these children take it as great fun. The wind is blowing and when they kick the ball, it does not score, it goes in a completely different direction. But they get more joy, even when they are not scoring, because it is great fun for both sides. Like that, in hundreds of ways the wind gives me joy.</p>
<p>There is one particular poem of Sri Aurobindo's, <em>Invitation</em>, where the wind is blowing and he is inviting everyone to join him:</p>

<p>With wind and the weather beating round me<br /> Up to the hill and the moorland I go.<br /> Who will come with me? Who will climb with me?<br /> Wade through the brook and tramp through the snow?</p>
<p>Not in the petty circle of cities<br /> Cramped by your doors and your walls I dwell;<br /> Over me God is blue in the welkin,<br /> Against me the wind and the storm rebel.</p>
<p>I sport with solitude here in my regions,<br /> Of misadventure have made me a friend.<br /> Who would live largely? Who would live freely?<br /> Here to the wind-swept uplands ascend.</p>
<p>I am the lord of tempest and mountain,<br /> I am the Spirit of freedom and pride.<br /> Stark must he be and a kinsman to danger<br /> Who shares my kingdom and walks at my side.</p>

<p>Here the wind is blowing and the invitation is coming from Sri Aurobindo to join him.</p>
<p>There are many who may not like the wind. In my case, I like it very much, very much.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do sports help to purify the vital?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do sports help to purify the vital?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely! Sports help considerably to purify the vital, provided that is what you hope to achieve from them. Some competitors adopt foul means in sports in order to stand first. They take to drugs and so forth, which is out of the question for spiritual seekers. But if you do sports as such, without adopting undivine methods or bringing drugs into your system, then sports can help you to achieve purity, because as soon as you practise sports, all the limbs of your body become alert.</p>
<p>When we do something active, we feel joy. If we walk, even if we just stand up, we get joy. Then, if we can run, we get more joy. The blood is circulating in the body, the vital feels more dynamic, and even the mind gets a tremendous feeling that it has done something.</p>
<p>Not by thinking of the results — that you have to be first in running or throwing — but by caring for sports as such, definitely it disciplines and also purifies the body, vital and mind. By practising sports, many, many people — whatever their events — have developed purity.</p>
<p>If you are about to throw the shot-put ten metres, for example, and an impure thought comes, all of a sudden you may find that you can only throw seven metres. That impure thought has taken away your capacity. Then you hate yourself. You say, "Why did I allow that impure thought to come?"</p>
<p>Before you throw, if you can pray to God, "O God, save me! I do not want any undivine thought to come and ruin my performance", God will listen to your prayer. Then God will keep His Protection ready for you when it is needed. It is a matter of necessity. When you need to buy a piece of cloth, for example, you go to the shop and buy it. That necessity you can meet only with the money-power inside your pocket.</p>
<p>So here, prayer is like that. Before you do something, if you can pray to the Supreme for protection and for purity, it will help you considerably. These things you are asking for consciously. You know when the wrong thought comes how much you suffer. You can throw the shot-put much further, but it goes a shorter distance. That is why you are praying to God. Had you not been doing sports at that moment, perhaps you would not have prayed to God for protection and purity.</p>
<p>Again, sports discipline us. If you have to go out running, you will get up at six o'clock. Otherwise, you can get up at ten o'clock. Sports give us discipline in our body, vital and mind. That is the most important thing.</p>
<p>There are hundreds and hundreds of sports. You can choose one that you like. Now you have chosen swimming. Do it! You will find that when you are in the water, if you have a good thought, a pure thought, your strokes, your style — everything — will be much better.</p>
<p>Purity plays a most important role in our spiritual life. One pure thought has the strength of an atom bomb. That pure thought will enable you to identify yourself with thousands of people at a time. And one impure thought will break your connection with twenty people in one second. You will see that one wrong thought has cut off your connection with so many people. You may not know the names of the people, or you may not want to know, but you will see the result.</p>
<p>You are not obliged to take up any particular sport because that one is better than the others, no. I always tell people, do the one you like. If you feel like swimming, do it. If you feel like ping-pong, do it. If you feel like running, do it. It is enough that you like it. That is the sport you should practise. Sport is not only running, jumping and throwing. Lifting weights is also sport. Anything that is physical activity is sport. Sport is necessary, necessary!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Should we repeat one particular prayer, or can we repeat many different prayers?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Should we repeat one particular prayer, or can we repeat many different prayers?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on you. If you want to have one particular desire fulfilled, it is better to have one prayer. If you want water, if that is your prayer, you have to dig at a certain place. Today if you dig here and tomorrow you go there and the day after tomorrow you go somewhere else, you will not get water. You have to dig at one place. Like that, if you have one desire, then continue with the same prayer.</p>
<p>If you want to have two or three desires fulfilled at the same time, you cannot maintain the same intensity in each prayer. On an everyday basis, if you have three desires to fulfil, you will not have the same eagerness and intensity in all three prayers. So the best thing is to have one desire. Then, when that desire is fulfilled, you can take up another desire. True, you may have three or four desires, but one desire has to be fulfilled first. Then pray to God to fulfil your second desire.</p>
<p>Otherwise, in the morning if you ask God for one thing, in the afternoon another thing, and in the evening a third thing, then there will be no intensity on your part. There is a great possibility that not even one desire will be fulfilled. So it is better to wait and deal with one at a time.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I wanted to ask if you have any dreams when you are resting.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I wanted to ask if you have any dreams when you are resting." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not have dreams. I used to have many dreams, but since becoming fully conscious of what I am, I never have ordinary dreams; I have visions. Even when I sleep, they come to me as visions. Once you come to a certain stage, dreams no longer occur.</p>
<p>To give you an example: let us say that during the night, some Indian gods and goddesses come and bless me. If I see them, I will not take them as dreams because I will be able to converse with them, I will be able to commune with them on their own level.</p>
<p>Usually, when human beings have a dream, they see it, they watch it. But there is a great difference between having a dream, enjoying the dream, and becoming one with it. You and the dream are two totally different things. You, as an individual, are one thing, and the dream is something else.</p>
<p>In my case, when I see someone, at that time I have the capacity to identify myself with that person. Even if it is an object, like the moon, I can identify myself with it. So I cannot call it a dream because at that time the communication problem is gone. Normally, when you have a dream, you are the enjoyer and the dream is something separate. In my case, I can become both the enjoyer and the enjoyment all together.</p>
<p>You may have a wonderful dream that tomorrow you will become the most perfect disciple. Then, as soon as day breaks, problems and worries descend on you and that sweet dream goes away. Again, during the night you may have a nightmare attack. When day comes, the nightmare has gone away, but the suffering and fear still remain.</p>
<p>Some dreams can be very sweet and encouraging. Again, some dreams can be very discouraging. When you have an encouraging dream, give value to it, take it seriously. And when it is discouraging, just throw it out of your system. That is called wisdom. Anything that helps you, take it as your very own, and anything that does not help you, why do you have to keep it? You stay with your friends. Do you stay with your enemies? No. So, as soon as a good dream comes, cherish it. When a bad dream comes, discard it, discard it. Do not think of it in the morning. You do not need it at all.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you please tell us what is the most powerful way for us to feel the Supreme&#039;s Protection?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you please tell us what is the most powerful way for us to feel the Supreme&#039;s Protection?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only by praying to the Supreme. As soon as you get up in the morning, sing the Invocation. Invocation means "to invoke the Supreme — His Presence, His Blessings." Then afterwards, you have to pray to the Supreme for His Protection.</p>
<p>During the day, if you are in a car, even if somebody else is driving, you must pray for protection. The driver will pray, plus the passengers also have to pray for protection. Most of the time, only the driver prays. Sometimes unfortunate accidents take place because inside the car there are some people who have not prayed. If the driver is alone, and he has prayed to the Supreme for protection, at that time 95 or 98 times out of 100 we see that protection has been granted. So sometimes unfortunate accidents take place because of the passengers.</p>
<p>Again, there are some people who pray to the Supreme for one minute before driving, but their prayer is mechanical. When the prayer is mechanical, it does not work. When you pray to the Supreme, it has to be like a fresh beginning. Every morning when you get up, there should be freshness and newness in your prayer and meditation. Similarly, when you pray to the Supreme for protection, at that time you have not to think of the previous day's prayers. Do not think that for the last ten days or ten months you have been praying for protection. No. When the day starts, after singing the Invocation, if you pray to the Supreme for protection, then it has to be very fresh. Do not think of yesterday or ten days ago or ten years ago.</p>
<p>At every moment we have to pray for protection. It is absolutely necessary. Prayer solves each and every problem. To conquer jealousy, to conquer pride, to conquer any undivine force, we have to pray. Protection is something that we need at every moment in our lives.</p>
<p>To give you an example: Just recently, when I was in Sanya at the previous hotel, I was walking very slowly inside the hotel. I was walking practically against the wall. One hotel worker, a young girl, suddenly came running, not very fast, but perhaps she was not keeping her eyes open. I was going absolutely against the wall, grinding the wall, and she had to dash against my left shoulder. Now she was a very thin girl, very light, so luckily I did not fall down. Nothing happened. But I felt miserable for her. It was one hundred per cent her fault, her unconscious life. She did not pray to the Supreme for protection, far from it. It is her own life, but I am the one who could have been injured. So you see, at every moment we have to pray for protection. Otherwise, we are not responsible for what happens.</p>
<p>Again, so many times it happens that when you do pray to the Supreme for protection for yourself, if your protection is very, very strong, it goes to the other person also. It does not last only for yourself. If you pray for protection very seriously, then you can help the person who is going to dash against you.</p>
<p>In this city, our driver was driving so dangerously. He was absolutely callous. My seat was right behind him and I could see that many times we were on the verge of having an accident. So I had to scold him. I said, "Now, go slowly!" Then that stupid fellow began going fifteen miles per hour. Before that, he used to go forty-five!</p>
<p>In New York, I like to go twenty-five or thirty miles per hour. When my disciples drive me, I ask them to go twenty-five miles per hour. It is my law.</p>
<p>So this fellow was going forty-five miles per hour or even more. Then, when he got my scolding, he reduced the speed to fifteen miles per hour! Today I had to tell him, "Go a little faster!" I do not know which lane is faster, but whichever lane he took, he stayed at fifteen miles per hour. So slowly! Finally, I surrendered. I said, "All right, that is better than going very fast!"</p>
<p>Here, in this case, I am praying for protection, but I have to think of the hostile attack that may come from somebody else. If we pray for more protection, then our prayers will enter into the persons who may unconsciously attack us. So many times, when something untoward happens, we say, "Not our fault, not our fault. We prayed for protection, we prayed." But if we can pray for more protection, then God will enter into those people who are going to unconsciously attack us and they do not attack us.</p>
