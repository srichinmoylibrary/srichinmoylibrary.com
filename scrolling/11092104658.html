<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme is all-Patience and all-Understanding in your life. If you see what He is doing for you and if you are grateful, then naturally that very thing you will want to do for your sweet child. Since you see that someone is doing for you the very thing that you are trying to do for your daughter, only infinitely better, then there is every possibility for you to do the same for your child.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the morning, when you pray and meditate, feel that you have gained real wealth in the form of Peace, Light and Bliss. As you keep your money inside your wallet, so you can keep your Peace, Light and Bliss inside your heart. Then, when ignorance comes, with your spiritual wealth you can threaten or conquer the undivine force that is approaching you. With money-power you can buy anything you want. Similarly, the spiritual power you get from prayer and meditation is a real power. When people are shouting, screaming and behaving undivinely, just bring forward the inner power which you have kept inside your heart. Think of how much Peace, Light and Bliss you got early in the morning. Peace is power, Light is power, Bliss is power, jut as money is power. Just bring it forward and you will not have any difficulty at all.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I maintain the peace that I feel at the Centre when I get home?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I maintain the peace that I feel at the Centre when I get home?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can maintain this peace if you imagine this place and what you have felt here. Your soul is carrying it permanently, but your mind perhaps will lose it the moment you enter into your car. As soon as you reach the street, the forces from the street may enter into you and steal away your peace. But if you can constantly imagine what you received, then you are safe.</p>
<p>Imagination is the precursor of creation. Without imagination we cannot do anything. Imagination is not everything, but we always start with imagination. First we imagine that our spiritual Master will be like this or our peace will be like that. Then we go deep within and see that from imagination we have got inspiration. From inspiration we get aspiration, and from aspiration we get realisation.</p>
<p>If you meditate at home every day, then it will be very easy for you to maintain the peace that you receive at the Centre. But if you have problems at home, or if you are working or studying at a place where it is impossible for you to maintain peace, then please try to imagine what you felt here. Let your mind be surcharged with the imagination of the peace that it carried from here. Imagination alone is not the answer; only it is helpful in the very beginning.</p>
<p>Another thing you have to do is to meditate every day without fail. Early in the morning is the best time, before the day dawns. Every day begins with new light, new hope. New life is entering into us every morning, so morning meditation is indispensable for anybody who would like to follow the spiritual path.</p>
<p>Again, if you can mix with spiritual people, they will be able to help you. Others you will not ignore or hate; far from it. Spiritual people have no right to hate mankind, but you have to be cautious. You have to know that your power, your capacity, is very limited. As long as your capacity is very limited, you cannot mix with all and sundry. So when you leave this place, try to mix with spiritual people and meditate regularly. When you have enough inner strength, then you won't lose anything no matter what you do. Whatever you get from here and whatever you get from your own meditation you will be able to preserve. But right now, always mix with spiritual people and come to the Centre regularly. Please do everything to allow peace to be assimilated inside you. Before assimilation takes place, there is every possibility that peace will disappear. But once it is assimilated in the spiritual system, then you can never lose it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I maintain my joy and simplicity in the midst of the mental activity that my school work demands?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I maintain my joy and simplicity in the midst of the mental activity that my school work demands?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your school work demands mental activity, but you have to feel that while you are studying you are doing something to please a higher authority inside you, that is to say, the Supreme in me. If you were allowed to make a choice between your school studies and selfless service, dedicated service, immediately you would want to put aside your school studies and do the thing for the Centre, for the mission. But while studying you should feel, "No, this thing I am doing because I have been asked to do it from within, by my Master." The moment you feel that you are the instrument and not the doer, then you will only try to please the Inner Pilot. While pleasing the Inner Pilot, the joy that you get will always remain with you. Although you are doing something mechanical, something intellectual, or something which is absolutely unaspiring or uninspiring, just because you have been asked to do it from within, it will give you the greatest joy. You are studying, but you have to feel that it is an inner command that you are fulfilling. By fulfilling the command, you feel the greatest joy because you have been chosen to do this thing. Whom do we ask to do something? We ask only someone whom we love, someone in whom we have confidence, someone in whom we have hope. So when God asks you to do something, you have to feel that it is something that He needs and He wants. In that case, obedience itself is the greatest joy.</p>
<p>But if you feel that God is not involved and that your spiritual life is not involved in what you are doing, then there can be no joy. You are touching, say, mud and clay, but who asked you to do it? If your Inner Pilot, your Guru, asked you, then it is the right thing and you will get joy. At that time you are not the doer; you are only a server of the higher Reality. A sincere seeker is he who serves the inner divinity, the Source. So if you can have the feeling of serving, then there can be no greater joy. But if you are not asked from within or by a higher authority, then the problem starts. At that time you are the doer, and joy is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>So feel that you are not the doer; you are just executing a higher order. Then you can get joy no matter what you do. Even if you become almost a machine itself while working on some machine, you will get the greatest joy because you are serving a higher cause. Something within you is doing something and you are just an instrument. You are only allowing the higher Source to have an experience in and through you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Do undivine thoughts come to you?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> No, they don't come. I am very, very elated and very happy.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is very good. Why don't you try to meditate again? If you cannot fall asleep and undivine thoughts are not bothering you, if you don't feel like meditating, then you can read my writings or some other spiritual books. If wrong thoughts are not entering into you, then the best thing is for you to study and prepare yourself for meditation. God has given you an opportunity to meditate more. But on the following day are you tired?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> Well, I usually feel wonderful coming here in the morning, but then I am afraid always that my meditation won't be as good as it should be because I haven't slept enough.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why? If there are no disturbing thoughts, no disturbing elements, then you should be very happy that you can utilise that time for meditation. But don't torture yourself by denying yourself the necessary sleep. If sleep comes, you will allow it. But again, if sleep is not torturing you, then you should feel fortunate that these hours you can use for your own purpose.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The most important thing is to offer your gratitude every second to the Supreme. Your inner cry comes from God's Concern and Compassion. When you offer your gratitude, immediately your cry increases; it becomes continuous and constant. When you offer gratitude, your inner cry mounts to the highest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely right. We have to make a fresh surrender every day. Again, I wish to say that this surrender has to be made not only every day, but every hour, every minute and every second. Every second we have to renew our surrender. Otherwise, early in the morning we shall surrender to God, but during the day, when we get some bad or frustrating news, then immediately we shall stand totally against God. In the morning we feel that God is a merciful God, so we can surrender to Him. Then during the day we get all kinds of bad news, so we say that God is the worst possible being. We won't surrender to such a cruel God. This moment we are pleased with God, so we say, "God, I can surrender to You." Before the next moment comes we think, "Now I have to surrender again. How will I do it?"</p>
<p>While we are reading or eating or cooking or talking, at every moment we have to feel that we are in the Lap of the Supreme. A child feels that when he is in his mother's lap, he is perfect. When he is in his mother's lap, it is the mother's responsibility to take care of him. Similarly, in the spiritual life you have to feel that you are in the Lap of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Every second, twenty-four hours a day, nobody can meditate. Twenty-four hours a day nobody can say, "I am making my surrender." But we can all the time keep in our mind or right in front of our vision the idea that we are in the Lap of the Supreme. We can just imagine and that very imagination will work the miracle that will eventually make our surrender constant. But that we don't do. We meditate only for an hour or half an hour, then for ten hours we don't meditate. In the evening we again start meditation. But before we start again, we see that many, many problems have entered into our lives. Who allows these problems-to enter into our lives? It is we who allow them, because between our first meditation and our second meditation we have left a big gap. We can easily avoid this gap if we can make ourselves feel that we are all the time sitting in the Lap of the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, no! Surrender is not a prayer. Everybody prays in the morning to make his will one with the Supreme's Will. In the morning perhaps you will say, "O Supreme, make Your Will my will." But real surrender is not your prayer or your meditation; it is your action. If something is happening in your mind or in your life, at that time you have to see whether you have surrendered your own will to the Supreme's Will.</p>

Lo, the world loves me and God blesses me.&amp;quot;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In our day-to-day life when we tell the truth the world is not ready to hear it. The world immediately is hurt. If we flatter people, they like it. They don't deserve our flattery, but they like to hear it. Whenever they don't deserve something and we give it, they are pleased with us.</p>
<p>Truth is so painful. We have to know whether by telling the truth we are awakening the divine consciousness in others or creating more hostility in them. Sometimes we tell the truth just in order to say, "I know the truth and you should also know the truth." But by telling others the truth with that attitude, we are not doing them any good because they may not utilise the truth properly, face-to-face, which is the way we want them to see the truth. They will not see the truth. They will simply be hurt. Then they will become more hostile toward us and, at the same time, more hostile toward themselves. Out of arrogance and fear they will try to destroy even the little possibility of truth that they have. So let us be very careful and remember that when we tell the truth, the world is hurt. The world is not yet ready to listen to the truth and accept the truth. The world is ready only to hear from us appreciation or flattery. Truth is very painful.</p>
<p>When I tell a lie, naturally God will be hurt. So I must live in silence and become the smiling breath of silence. Lo, the world loves me and God blesses me. If we really live in silence, in purest silence, then automatically love, purity and inner joy grow within us. Silence does not remain alone. In silence there is joy; there is a kind of inner delight and inner assurance. So when we are in highest silence, the people around us will automatically get the divine qualities that are enveloped by silence. At that time the world will deeply appreciate us.</p>
<p>We may think that by remaining silent we are simply not antagonising anybody. But our very silence, if it is divine silence, emanates inner divinity. And this inner divinity enters into those who are around us. Then they will really love us, for unconsciously they will feel something beneficial coming from us. They may not actually know what we are offering them, but they will feel that we are giving them something solid, something soulful, something significant which they need. At that time they will deeply appreciate our offering.</p>
<p>God will immediately bless us if He can turn our existence into a sea of silence. And if we can free ourselves from this world of turmoil, worries and hesitation, then God will again bless us. In the sea of silence grows our true divine life. The divine life can grow in each individual only if he can have silence within and silence without. This silence is not the silence of a dead person. It will act most dynamically, most powerfully, but not in an aggressive way. It will act with the soul's power. While we are acting, inwardly we remain calm and poised. Again, while we are silent, we are running very, very fast, even though there may be no outer movement or outer gesture. Everything is done in the inner world, the soul's world, where silence is most dynamic and most fulfilling. When we have that kind of silence, naturally God will bless us, because we have discovered the Truth and we are living the Truth.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do we begin to develop sincerity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do we begin to develop sincerity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can develop true sincerity provided one starts his journey with soulful gratitude. Say that a seeker has come to attend one of our Centre meetings. His parents have not come with him, his relatives may be watching television, his acquaintances perhaps have gone to a bar or a cocktail party. He could have also done the same things that his family or acquaintances have done, but he did something different. He came to a spiritual gathering. Who has inspired him to do the needful? Someone from within him. If it was left to him alone, perhaps he would have gone the same way as his friends, relatives and acquaintances. But he knows that there is a higher Power that brought him to this place for meditation. He should come with a gratitude-heart because already he has achieved something. When he comes with a gratitude-heart, he has already established some sincerity. Gratitude is a reality, and gratitude always embodies sincerity. So a sincere heart and a gratitude-life must go together.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can a person feel a longing for God and, at the same time, have patience? It seems like a contradiction.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can a person feel a longing for God and, at the same time, have patience? It seems like a contradiction." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not a contradiction at all. To have a sincere longing does not mean that one cannot have patience. A kindergarten student sees that his brother has got a Master's degree, whereas he is still studying in kindergarten. He has a sincere longing for a Master's degree, but he knows that time is a factor; it will take him twenty years to get that degree. But if he does not pay any attention to his studies now, then he will not pass his examination. Then how will he go on to high school and university? Right now he is the seed. Gradually the seed will germinate and become a tiny plant. Finally it will become a huge banyan tree. Does the seed think that by some miracle-power it will turn into a banyan tree overnight? No, it is absurd. There has to be an evolutionary process of gradual development. We have to progress gradually. If we lose our patience, then we lose our inspiration and aspiration and we will never reach our destined goal.</p>
<p>Everything that we want to accomplish, we have to do on the strength of our sincerity. If we are students, we have to study. If we are seekers, we have to pray and meditate. Sincerity is of paramount importance. If the child knows at the very start of his life that he wants to get his Master's degree, he will become sincere. Then he has to remain sincere all his life. Even after he has reached his goal, he has to be sincere in distributing the light that he has received from his goal.</p>
<p>If we are sincere and patient at every moment, then we will have real satisfaction in our achievement. When the child goes to primary school and high school, he will get satisfaction from his constant progress. Our present satisfaction may not be the ultimate satisfaction, but just because we have got some satisfaction on the strength of our sincere cry, we can rest assured that the ultimate satisfaction is bound to grow and evolve in us. Sincerity and patience must go together. We start our journey with sincerity and then sincerity and patience together continue the journey. If they are separated, then satisfaction can never be achieved by the seeker. Through gradual progress he reaches his goal. When he covers one step, he has to feel that that is his goal. Then tomorrow he will cover another step. But if he wants to reach the ultimate goal all at once, it is impossible. Whenever we are sincere, we are bound to get some satisfaction. This satisfaction may be limited but, at the same time, it is most precious. Then from the limited satisfaction he will grow into boundless satisfaction.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there anything we can do to maintain the inspiration we have at the beginning of the year?

Usually by March, I&#039;ve just given up hope on my New Year&#039;s resolution." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Instead of one resolution, you can have twelve projects. This is the month of January. In January, feel that you will accomplish one project, not by hook or by crook, but with your best vigilance, your best aspiration. Then at the end of the month, if you do not succeed, forget about it totally. Feel that that month did not exist in your life. If you think, "Since in January I have failed, there is no hope of my succeeding in the month of February," then you will be totally lost. If you fail in January, feel that the month of January does not exist on your calendar. This is not deception; this is called wisdom. Anything that does not allow you to run the fastest on the way to the goal is your enemy. Again, if you succeed, then you can be wise and say, "I won the case in the month of January. Now I must also win in the month of February.</p>
<p>Many years ago, my boss wrote something that I could not believe. Now, over the years, I have come to understand it. He wrote, "Neutrality is very bad. If you are neutral, then you are my enemy." I said, "How can it be?" He said, "When you are not wholeheartedly taking either my side or the other person's side, but you are taking fifty per cent of each side, then you are my half-enemy." So neutrality we have to take as our real enemy. When a new month starts, anything positive from the old month we shall keep; anything negative we shall discard. We shall not be neutral. We shall be one hundred per cent for one cause, one goal.</p>
<p>But you have to know that neutrality is not indifference. Most of the disciples remain indifferent. This is very, very bad. Real detachment, spiritual detachment, is transcendence. When we have that kind of detachment, we are independent, we are above the turmoil of this world. At that time, natures dance cannot affect us. We transcend the happenings of the world.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it proper to answer a question with silence, or when we are asked a question are we obliged to tell the truth?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it proper to answer a question with silence, or when we are asked a question are we obliged to tell the truth?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here we have to know the real truth. Suppose two young boys have quarreled and now they are fighting. They start by using their fists and, finally, they take out their knives. Then, one of them feels that he is the weaker of the two and runs away while the other one chases after him. You are meditating at the foot of a tree and you see the victim go hide in a cave. The other one says to you, "Did you see him? Where has he gone? I want to kill him!" You know the truth. Are you ready to say, "Yes, he is hiding there in the cave"? If you tell the truth, then what will this boy do? He will immediately go to kill the other one. This kind of truth is nothing but stupidity. At that time, you have to remain silent. You won't say anything. You know the truth, but that truth will be more damaging than the actual problem. So at that time you have to remain silent.</p>
<p>In this world we have to know immediately whether our truth is going to fulfil God's Vision and God's Reality on earth. It is very good to tell the truth, but we have to know the immediate result of the truth. If we tell the truth and someone is killed, in God's Eye we will be the culprit along with the person who does the actual killing.</p>
<p>I always say, "Tell the truth, but remain in a soulful consciousness. Then you will know what God wants from you. " If we remain in our ordinary consciousness, then we always try to derive joy or pleasure from truth in our own way. But we can run into great difficulty if we try to utilise the truth for our own sake. But if we use the truth for God's sake, then immediately God will give us the wisdom to know when to open our mouth and when to keep our mouth shut. Truth is good, but in this limited world we have to see the ultimate Truth the way the Divine, the Supreme, wants us to see, realise and become the truth.</p>
