  <h2 id="page-title">Evolution</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Evolution" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We know that there is some Being whom we call God. We know that there is something which we call the Soul. It was the great American philosopher, Emerson, who said: “God is an infinite circle whose centre is everywhere, but whose circumference is nowhere.” We can say definitely that this centre is man’s soul.</p>
<p>The soul is an eternal entity. Now what is its connection with reincarnation? One can write endless pages on reincarnation, that formidable concept which is so widely spoken about and just as widely disbelieved. Let us try to understand, in one short sentence, the essence of the matter. Reincarnation is the process by which the soul evolves; reincarnation exists for the growth and development of the soul.</p>
<p>We all know of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, the evolution of species. It is the change in the physical organism from lower to higher, or from simpler to more complex. Spiritual evolution runs parallel to physical evolution. The soul exists in all beings. True, it is divine and immortal, but it has its own urge to be more complete, more fulfilling and more divine. Hence in the process of its evolution, it has to pass from the least perfect body to the most perfect body. Meanwhile it takes into itself the real value of all its earthly experiences. Thus the soul grows, enriching itself, making its divinity more integral, more harmonious and more perfect.</p>
<p>Reincarnation tells us that we have not come from nothing. Our present condition is the result of what we have made ourselves from our past. We are the consequence of our past incarnations.</p>
<p>“Many births have been left behind by Me and by thee, O Arjuna! All of them I know, but thou knowest not thine,” said the Divine Krishna to the yet unrealised Arjuna.</p>
<p>Evolution is the hyphen between what was and what would be. I am a man. I must know that I was not only my father, but I shall also be my son. Problems I had. You had. He had. No exceptions. We faced them. We face them even today. But we shall solve them unmistakably.</p>
<p>We made a promise of transformation, a promise that has no equal. We want the transformation of the inner and the outer. Each one of us may vision the face of transformation and finally be ourselves transformed. But how to achieve this transformation that will hold aloft the Torch of Immortality? For this we have to know what aspiration is and what doubt is.</p>
<p>Doubt is a destructive influence, an inner war, that works day and night to prey on our inner life. Aspiration, on the other hand, is the most effective energising power in a truth-seeker. It is at once the uplifting joy and the intensification of our consciousness. Aspiration places the thirst for Truth above and beyond all things.</p>
<p>Aspiration can be developed. It is like crossing a street, one step at a time. Each time we aspire, we perform in the very depth of our consciousness, a miracle of welcoming the Beyond. Aspiration is based on a spontaneous faith that visions the future. Aspiration comes from our faith in God; more so, our faith in ourselves. In the secrets of Aspiration, Reincarnation, Evolution and Transformation lie our true destiny, a Divine Immortality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part II: Indian devotional songs</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part II: Indian devotional songs" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>1.</h2>


<p><em>Agne naya supatha rave asman ........</em></p>
<p>Agni! Lead us by the auspicious path to Prosperity;<br /> Thou God who knowest all our deeds ......</p>
<p>(From the Rig Veda: 1.189.1)</p>

<p>A devotional song has a universal appeal. It appeals to the aspiring soul and elevates the consciousness. It appeals also to our hearts and minds. A devotional song expresses a universal spiritual emotion, a personal experience which rises like a flame towards God.</p>
<p>I wish to say a word about the invocation I have just sung. The Vedas are the most ancient, the most inspiring and the most important of the Indian scriptures. The quintessence of the Vedic Truth is the concept of the Journey. This is the Journey of the Soul along the Path of Truth and Eternal Order. The Vedas overflow with love of life and energy for action; they invoke the Supreme with implicit faith for Guidance and Divine Inspiration.</p>
<p>The Vedas are four in number, each book containing several thousand hymns. The four Vedas are the Rig Veda, the Yajur Veda, the Sama Veda and the Atharva Veda. The hymn I have just sung is from the Rig Veda, from that part of it devoted to the adoration of Agni, the God of the Eternal Divine Fire. The “Prosperity” mentioned in the hymn is not merely earthly prosperity, but is an inner and all-fulfilling prosperity, a plenitude of both the Spirit and the outer life.</p>

<p>Now to come to the second song on the programme. The Upanishads are intuitive revelations derived from the Vedas. The Upanishads have inspired all systems of Indian philosophy and even today guide the spiritual lives of millions of Truthseekers. God alone knows how many Upanishads once existed, but only 108 have been faithfully preserved. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad contains one of India’s most significant and inspiring invocations to God. For centuries, the firmament of India has resounded with this beloved and immortal prayer:</p>

<p><em>Asato ma sad gamaya ...</em></p>
<p>Lead us from the Unreal to the Real,<br /> Lead us from Darkness unto Light,<br /> Lead us from Death to Immortality.</p>
<p>(From the Brihad-aranyaka Upanishad: 1.3.28)</p>

<p>The Gita is the Song Celestial, sung by Lord Krishna himself. The Gita is the essence of all Indian scriptures. There are eighteen soul-illumining discourses in the Gita. In the eleventh one, Lord Krishna reveals to his beloved disciple, Arjuna, his Visva-Rupa, his Universal Form. On seeing this overpowering sight, this Divine Form, the surrendered disciple in Arjuna cries out:</p>

<p><em>Tvamadi Deva Purusha Purana...</em></p>
<p>Thou art the ancient Soul,<br /> The first and original Godhead,<br /> And the Supreme resting place of all that lives;<br /> Thou art the Knower and the Known;<br /> the Highest Abode.<br /> O infinite in form, by Thee the Universe was extended.<br /> Thou art Vayu and Yama and Agni and Soma<br /> and Varuna and Prajapati,<br /> Father of creatures and the great-grandsire,<br /> Salutation, Salutation to Thee,<br /> A thousand times over and again,<br /> And yet again, Salutation,<br /> Again and again, Hail unto Thee.</p>
<p>(From the Bhagavad-Gita:XI.38-39)</p>

<p>In Vaishnavism, Sri Krishna is the sole object of love, devotion and worship. The Vaishnavites believe that unreserved dedication to Lord Krishna is the matchless ideal, the supreme way of life. Radha, Lord Krishna’s divine consort and disciple, is the very embodiment of that self-dedication. Having won Him by many lives of aspiration and devotion, she surrenders her very existence to serve Him.</p>
<p>Chandidas wrote this Bengali poem in the 16th century. He was a great Vaishnava poet, cherished by all in Bengal.</p>

<p><em>E ghora rajani meghera ghata...</em></p>
<p>The night is dark, the sky is filled with teeming clouds.<br /> Friend, what can I say to you?<br /> By virtue of many lives, Him I have won.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">5.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="5." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Rabindranath Tagore wrote:</p>

<p>To the birds You gave songs,<br /> The birds gave You songs in return.<br /> You gave me only a voice,<br /> But You asked for more,<br /> And I sing.</p>

<p>Rabindranath was a Golden Song sung by the Divine Singer in him. He was, indeed, the World-Song, the golden chain that bound East and West.</p>
<p>He offered the world more than two thousand songs. He once said that when he was capable of singing, his own compositions were very few in number. But when he had become a prolific composer, his voice failed him and he was unable to sing most of his own songs.</p>
<p>He made a prophetic utterance about his own songs: “With the march of time, everything changes. But the Bengalees will sing my songs epoch after epoch. They will sing my songs in the hour of their sorrow, grief, joy and delight. They will have no alternative.”</p>
<p>In the song I shall now sing, Tagore compares the Pole-Star, fixed and steady in the dark night, with the light of the mind and heart which illumines the unlit existence of human life:</p>

<p><em>Nivid ghana andhare jwalichhe Dhruva tara</em></p>
<p>In the tenebrous gloom shines the Pole-Star;<br /> O my mind, in the immense expanse of night,<br /> Lose not your Way.<br /> Dead with depression and despair,<br /> O my heart, cease not your singing.<br /> Breaking asunder the prison of delusion,<br /> Fulfil your life . . .</p>

<p>This is another song by Tagore.</p>

<p><em>Amar hiyar lukiye...</em></p>
<p>Lord, You have been hiding<br /> In the inmost recesses of my heart.<br /> I have not been able to see You.<br /> To the world without, I have opened my eyes,<br /> Not to the world within.<br /> You were in all my loves and in all my pangs,<br /> And in all my hopes;<br /> You were beside me,<br /> But I did not see You, I did not.</p>

<p>The next is an inspirational song written by Kaii Najrul Islam in the early decades of this century. It tells of the famous battle of Kurukshetra in the Mahabharata, addressing Lord Krishna, the Charioteer, and invoking Him to infuse man with courage and strength.</p>

<p><em>He Partha Sarathi, bajao, bajao Panchajanya...</em></p>
<p>O Charioteer,<br /> Blow, blow your conch;<br /> Drive away this depression of the heart.<br /> Make them fearless who are struck with fear.<br /> String the bow and hit the target.<br /> Singing the mantra of the Gita,<br /> Sacrifice your life.<br /> Make us forget the fear of death.<br /> Death is not the end of life.<br /> Through Eternity flows the eternal tide of life . .</p>

<p>I wrote the following song in India about fifteen years ago. It calls upon the soul to awaken and lead the entire being towards God-Realisation.</p>

<p><em>Jago amar swapan sathi, jago amar praner pran ...</em></p>
<p>Awake, O Comrade of my dream,<br /> Awake, O Breath of my life,<br /> Awake, my Boundless Heart spread over the universe, Awake, O that Consciousness of mine, Which ends not, Even crossing the Beyond.</p>

<p><em>Bande Mataram ...</em></p>
<p>Mother, I bow to Thee . . .</p>

<p>This was the original national anthem of India, and the source of profound inspiration in the long struggle for India’s independence.</p>
<p>The lines of the song were written by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, the greatest novelist of Bengal and one of her men of supreme genius. The song appears in one of his greatest novels, Ananda Math.</p>
<p>No Indian will forget the role that this national song, Bande Mataram, played in the patriotic feeling of the Indian people. It served a Divine purpose in energising them in their long struggle for freedom. From the burning hearts of India’s patriots, its flames of incantation rose high into the sky.</p>
<p>Many different tunes have been put to this song over the years. The present one was composed by a great musician of India, Dilip Kumar Roy.</p>

<p>Now we come to the last song, Phire Chalo.</p>
<p>By singing this song, a great singer of India, K. C. Dey, became immortal overnight. God had denied him sight; he was stone blind. But God sang through him in such soul-stirring grandeur as he performed this song for the famous film “Chandidasa” that his name became immortal in India.</p>
<p>In this song, Home is beckoning us. According to the Vedas, Home is Heaven on Earth, for it is by abiding in the soul here on earth that we achieve spiritual Bliss. In the Rig Veda, the seers sing: “Madhumat Punarayanam” which means “Sweet be my return [home].”</p>

<p><em>Phire Chalo, apana Ghare ...</em></p>
<p>Let us return Home, let us go back,<br /> Useless is this reckoning of seeking and getting,<br /> Delight permeates all of today.<br /> From the blue ocean of death<br /> Life is flowing like nectar.<br /> In life there is death; in death there is life.<br /> So where is fear, where is fear?<br /> The birds in the sky are singing “No death, no death!”<br /> Day and night the tide of Immortality<br /> Is descending here on earth.</p>
