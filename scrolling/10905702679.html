<p><em>[Gorakshanath is meditating in his room. Enter Matsyendranath.]</em></p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: My son, now see, the worst calamity is about to take place. Has your curiosity been fed? Are you satisfied now? I am sure you have heard that all the strong young men in the Kingdom are to be brought before the King. The King will select the strongest and have him hanged. He feels that the man who has escaped from his prison has insulted him, and he cannot brook that kind of insult. You are a very strong man. I do not know what may happen to you. Let us try to escape.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, I am at your feet. You are also strong. They may catch you as well. Although you are mature you are not yet old. I am afraid you are also in danger. Since I made the mistake, if the King sentences me to death, I am prepared. But if something happens to you, Master, I shall never forgive myself.</p>

<p><em>[The King's palace. The King and Queen are sitting on their thrones. Many strong men have been brought in, including Gorakshanath and Matsyendranath, and the King is about to make a selection. The guards begin pushing the men before the King one by one.]</em></p>
<p>FIRST MAN: No, your Majesty, I didn't do it. I wasn't even there.</p>
<p>SECOND MAN: I was out of town.</p>
<p><em>[In this way many men are brought before the King.]</em></p>
<p>KING: Now all of you stand in a line. Instead of having you come up to me, I will go down the line. Let me see who is the strongest.</p>
<p><em>[The King goes down the line. He picks out Matsyendranath and Gorakshanath.]</em></p>
<p>KING: Undoubtedly one of you will be hanged today, but it may take me a few minutes to decide who is actually the stronger.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: O King, look at my health, examine my physique. I tell you, if you want to kill the stronger of us two, then it is undoubtedly I who should be killed. Look at me. Look at my arms, look at my chest, look at my feet, look at my forehead, look at any part of my body. I am far stronger than this man.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Do not believe him, your Majesty. Look at me, look at my body. I am obviously stronger than this man. And besides, I am younger. You wanted to have a young man, and I have young blood. He is an old man. It is clear to see. Why, he was my teacher. He may be stronger than me in some things — in knowledge or wisdom — but if you want physical strength, I am the man for you.</p>
<p>KING: Yes, I want someone who is physically strong and not strong mentally or otherwise.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: So, King, it is I who should be killed.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: King, believe me, I am stronger than this young man. Since you want a really strong man, it is I who should be hanged. You are such a great, compassionate King. I have never seen such a compassionate King on earth. You want to make everything in your Kingdom equal to surpass Heaven in every way. I wish to say that, since I am older than he, I will not be of use to you much longer. Let the young man stay here in your Kingdom to serve you. He is much younger than I, and he can serve you for many more years. Let me go to Heaven.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: King, compassion is one thing and justice is another. This man is showing his compassion. I was his student. We are like father and son. When there is danger, the father wants to embrace the danger and let his son remain safe. But there is something called a promise. King, you are most honest. Now what did you say? You said the strongest man in your Kingdom would be hanged. Your Majesty, how did you become great? You became great by keeping your promises. You should continue to keep your promises, so it is I who should be killed.</p>
<p>KING: I really can't understand it. For the first time I am seeing two men simply dying to please me. Here all are shedding bitter tears because they may have to die. If I selected them, they would be the most miserable people on earth. But here I am seeing two men fighting over the opportunity to embrace death. I have never seen anything like it.</p>
<p>What is the matter with you two? I want to know why you are eager to die. Is there some special reason?</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH <em>[pretending to be hesitant]:</em> Well, there is a special cause. You think that we are very kind, nice and generous. But, O King, we are not so kind, we are not so nice, we are not so generous; our hearts are not so big. Both of us are very clever.</p>
<p>KING: Clever? What kind of plot do you have?</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: No plot. It is only that both of us know a little bit of astrology. I am an astrologer and I taught him how to cast a horoscope. That is why he was telling you that I was his teacher.</p>
<p>We also meditate a little. This morning we had a vision and heard an inner voice. But King, perhaps you do not believe in visions.</p>
<p>KING: Visions? Certainly I believe in visions. I believe in God. God has created Heaven so beautiful. It is my prayer to God that my Kingdom should surpass Heaven. Now tell me, what kind of vision did you have? What did the voice tell you?</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Both of us had the vision at the same time, and we heard the voice say that whoever dies today at four p.m. will go to the highest Heaven. That is why we are fighting for death. Otherwise, do you think that we would be so foolish?</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: So, King Harabhanga, now the secret is out. It is for that purpose that I wanted to die. I wanted to go to the highest Heaven. It was not actually that I have such love for my Master. I wanted to die so that I could go to the highest Heaven.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: It is the same with me. It was not my affection and love for my student that made me fight for the opportunity to die. I knew that I could go to the highest Heaven immediately if I could manage to die at four p.m. in some way.</p>
<p>KING: You think I am a fool. All the time I have been crying for Heaven, for the highest joy. Here I have pleasure, but I am not satisfied. I want something more. I know that Heaven is full of Joy and Delight. Do you think I am such a fool that I will allow one of you to go to Heaven while I remain here on this corrupt and imperfect earth? In my Kingdom everybody is quarrelling and fighting all the time. That is why I wanted my Kingdom to be like Heaven — even to surpass Heaven. I am so grateful that you two astrologers have told me this secret. <em>[Addressing has minister.]</em> Get ready. Invite all my subjects and all the royal family. This is my order. I am going to be hanged. I want to go immediately to Heaven. This world is corrupt. I don't see any hope for it. I wanted to bring happiness to my Kingdom, but I see this will never be. It is only when I have something myself that I can give it to others. Now I am distressed, but in Heaven I shall be most happy. And from there, I will be able to send happiness down to my Kingdom.</p>
<p><em>[Exit Minister.]</em></p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Your Majesty, I wish to say that your happiness is our happiness. If you feel that by going to Heaven immediately you will be the happiest man, then go. We shall miss you, the Kingdom will miss you, but we want to be happy in your happiness.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: It is you who wanted to have the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. Now you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. And once you enter there, I am sure you will be able to bring down the Kingdom of Heaven into this world. In your happiness is our happiness. We wanted to go to Heaven at four p.m., but we would rather make you happy.</p>
<p><em>[The Queen starts crying bitterly.]</em></p>
<p>KING <em>[to Queen]:</em> I thought that you loved me. Now that I am going to be happy, why do you weep?</p>
<p>QUEEN: I want you to be happy, but how can I live here alone without you?</p>
<p>KING: Don't worry. Once I am in Heaven I will bring you there to join me. It is only a matter of time. Perhaps tomorrow I will be able to get you. When I am in the highest Heaven I will have everything, and from there I will be able to send a messenger to take you.</p>

<p><em>[Gorakshanath and Matsyendranath are in Gorakshanath's room.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: O Master, I went along with you, but please tell me, why have you done this? Have we done the right thing? Oh, I know whatever you do is right, but please explain to me what we did. I want to know more from you.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: My son, do you feel sorry for it?</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: I do feel sorry...</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Why? Why do you feel sorry? You should be wise. This King was ruining the whole Kingdom with his stupid laws. How can everything be of the same value? How can everybody have the same status? Is it possible? God has given some men more capacity than others. God has made some things more valuable than others. On this hand two fingers cannot be the same. They are all different. If one person prays and meditates, and another does not, naturally the former will realise God sooner than the latter. You have prayed, you have meditated and you have realised God. Equality does not come without equal merit. King Harabhanga thought that just by making the price of everything the same, all people would become equal. But that is impossible. Everything has its own value. You cannot put a lion and a sheep together, feed them the same food and expect them to become the same. The sheep will remain a sheep, and the lion will remain a lion. Spiritual people will be spiritual, and ordinary people will be ordinary. God's Kingdom is vast and everybody has his own place. One cannot mix with those who are of a different standard and expect them to become equal. Now once again this Kingdom will have a sane life. A new King will take Harabhanga's place — perhaps his own son — and you will see that, like other Kingdoms, this Kingdom will have prosperity. It will have judgement, peace and divine glory, for everything will have its proper value according to its capacity and according to its merit. My son, you and I have done a great service for the Supreme.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, I have understood your philosophy. I am always at your feet and at your command. To please you, to be unconditionally yours, is the sole object of my life. My supreme adoration is Your Feet. Your very sight is my delight. Your very touch is my new mind, and Your Light of infinite Wealth is my true home.</p>

<p><em>[Gorakshanath stabs the Yogi several times.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: You are right! Not a sound! How is it possible?</p>
<p>YOGI: If one identifies with the infinite, then no sound will be produced by a blow. This proves that I am superior to you in occult power.</p>
<p><em>[Exit Yogi]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: <em>[to himself]</em> O Master, where are you now? I must speak to you about this. I will concentrate on you and see where you are and what you are doing.</p>
<p><em>[Gorakshanath sits down and begins to concentrate.]</em></p>

<p><em>[Matsyendranath is seated amidst great luxury, surrounded by beautiful girls. Some of the girls are dancing.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: How can this be? My Master is of the highest order. Perhaps my vision is wrong. Let me concentrate again.</p>
<p><em>[Gorakshanath concentrates.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: My Master has fallen! He is surrounded by so many beautiful girls, all singing and dancing. He is enjoying all kinds of vital life. I must save him! I will transport myself to this spot occultly.</p>
<p><em>[Gorakshanath approaches the group but is stopped by the gatekeeper.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: I wish to speak with that man. He is my Guru. He is Matsyendranath of Kaul. I must see him.</p>
<p>GATEKEEPER: Matsyendranath, Your Guru? Is that the renowned Matsyendranath of Kaul? He has fallen! What he was and what he has become now! He has fallen to such an extent that I cannot believe my ears when you tell me that this is Matsyendranath.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: I must rescue him immediately!</p>
<p>GATEKEEPER: If you can rescue him from this place, you will be extremely lucky. This is Mayapuri, the Illusion-City. Once a person enters here it is most difficult for him to leave again.</p>
<p><em>[Gorakshanath tries to approach Matsyendranath, but the dancing girls will not let him near.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: It seems I shall have to use my occult power to make myself into a beautiful girl, or I will never get near my Master.</p>
<p><em>[Exit Gorakshanath and re-enter as a beautiful girl. Matsyendranath does not recognise him.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, what are you doing here? What kind of life are you leading? You are a God-realised soul. What are you doing here enjoying vital life?</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Oh! I am fallen, I am fallen! I am fallen to such an extent! Now save me!</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: I shall use my occult power and take you away from here.</p>

<p><em>[Matsyendranath's ashram. Matsyendranath is seated in meditation, surrounded by his disciples. Enter Gorakshanath with another Matsyendranath, who goes to the meditating Matsyendranath and enters into him.]</em></p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH <em>[addressing one of the disciples in amazement]:</em> Has Master been away for a few weeks?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: No. For the last few weeks Master has been here, and we have all been with him.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: How can this be? Master, please explain this experience I have just gone through. I cannot fathom the mystery of what has actually happened.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: I had to do all this just for you, for your perfection. You have all kinds of occult power, but your pride was too great. I sent that Yogi to smash your pride, to prove to you that you are not the world's greatest occultist. There are many with far more occult power than you have. Also, you were very austere and rigid in your spiritual life. You looked down on women. I told you repeatedly that by looking down on women you would not be able to transform and perfect your life, but you did not care for women's liberation from ignorance. You are my best disciple. I gave you all kinds of occult power, but you were defeated by that Yogi only because of your pride. Now that you have been humiliated, now that your pride has been smashed, I wish to tell you something. Although you are my student, and although you lost to that Yogi, before long you will surpass both him and me. Because today you conquered your pride and saw the Truth in a divine way, and because by becoming a woman in order to approach me you learned not to shun or despise women, your tremendous potentiality will now be able to come to the fore. You are bound to surpass us. There is nothing else that I can teach you. All that I have, I have given to you.</p>

<p>[Matsyendranath's ashram. Enter Matsyendranath and Gorakshanath.]</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: My son, you have now equalled me in spirituality. You have inner peace, light and bliss in boundless measure. I want you to leave my ashram and open one of your own.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: <em>[bursting into tears]</em> Master, Master, this can never be! I can never leave you, and I shall never leave you. You are my life.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Son, two lions cannot live in the same den. We should not stay together now. You should now roam somewhere else. You have the capacity to guide world-souls as I am guiding them. Now you must use it. You are not getting the opportunity to flourish here.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, who wants to flourish? Not me! Not in the least! I came into the world to serve you, not to equal you. It was your mistake that enabled me to equal you.</p>
<p>MATSYENDRANATH: Whether it was my mistake or your tremendous capacity that has enabled you to equal me is not the question. You have equalled me, and now it is God's Will that you should serve Him by inspiring and guiding other souls. The world badly needs a Master of your calibre. Now go, my son. This is my soulful demand and command. If you really love me then you will obey my command. After six years you may come back and pay me a visit.</p>
<p>GORAKSHANATH: Master, I shall obey you although my heart is crying and bleeding within me. Please bless me once more before I depart.</p>
<p><em>[Matsyendranath blesses Gorakshanath.]</em></p>
<p>Although I shall not see you outwardly, please do not forget me. I shall come back in six years.</p>
