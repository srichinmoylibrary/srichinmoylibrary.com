  <h2 id="page-title">Going to College Street</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Going to College Street" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>India, my India, will always remain immortal, either positively or negatively. This was my very first experience on Indian soil this time. I landed at Calcutta Airport, and there were many coolies who were welcoming the passengers and helping with the luggage. When I went outside the airport building, I looked for a taxi to take me to a particular place called College Street or Bankim Chatterjee Street. It is better known as College Street, which is its old name. There you can get thousands and thousands of old second-hand books. It is my most favourite place in Calcutta.</p>
<p>I had thought of going to Belur Math, the Ramakrishna Mission, and I was even planning to go to Mother Teresa’s place. It falls practically on the way to College Street. But something within me was more interested in buying old books, Bengali books. College Street gives me immense joy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Choosing a taxi</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Choosing a taxi" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Now the taxi story starts. There were three or four taxi drivers waiting outside. I was examining the taxis to see what kind of condition they were in. One particular taxi had pictures of Mother Kali and Sri Ramakrishna. Both of them were garlanded. I said, “There cannot be a better taxi than this. I am carrying a picture of my Mother Kali all the time. Plus, this one also has a picture of Sri Ramakrishna.”</p>
<p>I said to the driver in Bengali, “You have to take me to College Street and bring me back. How much will you charge?”</p>
<p>He said, “Oh, no problem.”</p>
<p>“Meter?” I enquired.</p>
<p>He responded, “Babu, whatever the meter reads.” When they say “Babu,” it means gentleman or sir.</p>
<p>I said, “Perfect. Whatever the meter reads I will give you.”</p>
<p>I entered into the taxi. I bowed to my Mother Kali and her dearest child Ramakrishna very devotedly. I was so happy. After we had covered about a hundred metres I realised that the driver had forgotten to turn on the meter, so I said to him, “Brother, now turn on the meter.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I forgot to tell you that the meter doesn’t work!”</p>
<p>Can you imagine! Just two minutes before he had told me that I would pay whatever the meter read. So I said to him, “How could you forget such a thing? You told me that you would charge whatever the meter read after I asked you for a flat rate.”</p>
<p>So that is how the story started. Then I asked him his name. He said, “My name is Gauranga.”</p>
<p>I said, “Oh, Lord Gauranga, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.” I was so pleased to hear his name. We began talking about Gauranga, and he had also read a little bit of Indian scripture. I said to myself, “All right, the first time he fooled me, but now let us see if Lord Gauranga will also fool me.” We were talking and talking. He was telling me about his son. His son’s name is Abhijit. He is studying at the Ramakrishna Mission High School, and he is very happy there.</p>
<p>But in the back of my mind, I was thinking, “His first deception I know. Now let us see what he is going to do.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Buying spiritual books</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Buying spiritual books" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The taxi driver took me to quite a few stores on College Street, and he was telling me that Mother Teresa’s place was not far; I could easily go there.</p>
<p>I said, “No, I have changed my mind. I am not going there. This place will give me more joy.”</p>
<p>I went to a few more spiritual bookstores. There are so many spiritual bookstores on that street. As usual, we Bengalis do not know how to speak, we only know how to scream. Perhaps it is our national trait. The vendors were all screaming, encouraging people to buy their books. Everything is reduced, reduced to absolutely nothing, they say. But when you go to buy something, at that time you see that it has a high price.</p>
<p>I bought spiritual books from different stores. At one particular store, I saw a few books on Mother Kali and some that contained devotional songs. To my great joy, I found my favourite song that I sing, “Tumi nirmala karo” by Rajani Kanta Sen. I was so happy that one particular book had this as the first song.</p>
<p>The book stalls were all out on the street. I was standing there, reading the words to the song. The owner noticed what I was reading and said to me, “Babu, I am so happy you are reading that book. I myself am a good singer. Do you want to hear me?”</p>
<p>I said, “Certainly.”</p>
<p>He said, “I can sing this song.”</p>
<p>O my God, how sweetly he was singing the first song! I was so pleased with him. Then I said to him, “Do you now want to join me? I will sing the same song.” Then both of us sang together standing there in the street.</p>
<p>Before that I had told him that I do not live in India; I live in America. The price of the book came to 80 or 85 rupees, which is under three American dollars because there are 30 rupees to a dollar. After we had sung the song, he said, “I would like to charge 5 rupees less.”</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>
<p>He said, “You live in America and there you study music, so 5 rupees less give me.”</p>
<p>I said to him, “This is one of my most favourite songs, so I really want to give you 5 rupees more.”</p>
<p>It was 85 rupees, so I gave him 5 rupees more, saying, “I am so happy to find that you can sing the song so well. Every day you are working so hard to support yourself.”</p>
<p>That was my very first good experience. Then I bought quite a few more books, and I was very pleased. When I mentioned the titles of some books that I wanted, this fellow went running to other stores. He said, “I have three stores. Just wait here.” Only he knew which ones had those particular books and so he went there and brought them back. As long as I got the books, I did not mind waiting.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Returning to the airport</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Returning to the airport" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We drove back to the airport, and again the meter did not run. Finally, I said to the driver, “Now for God’s sake, tell me how much you want! Do not charge me too much. First, look at Mother Kali’s picture, look at Sri Ramakrishna’s picture.”</p>
<p>He said, “Oh, I will never deceive you.”</p>
<p>I said, “No, you will never deceive me! You started our trip with deception.”</p>
<p>It was all in Bengali, so there was no problem.</p>
<p>He gave me the total: “Three hundred fifty rupees.”</p>
<p>I said, “Impossible! Three hundred fifty rupees!”</p>
<p>He said, “Yes, yes, I charge 350 rupees.”</p>
<p>Then I said, “I will give you 300 rupees and no more.” So I gave him 300 rupees. I knew it could not be more than 150 rupees or maximum 200; 300 was absurd.</p>
<p>Then with folded hands he said, “What about my son?”</p>
<p>“What about your son?”</p>
<p>“My son needs your blessings.”</p>
<p>I said, “I am blessing him.”</p>
<p>He said, “No, with money. He is studying at school; he needs your money.”</p>
<p>I said, “That is great.” Then my stupid or compassionate heart had to come forward. My stupidity and my compassion are absolute synonyms; there is no difference. I said, “All right, I am giving you a hundred rupees for your son. I wish your son well. Let him become a good student.”</p>
<p>In my pocket I had kept about 500 rupees. I saw that I had used most of the money to buy books, so I had only 90 rupees instead of a hundred-rupee note left. I counted the rupees and said, “I am sorry. I told you 100 but I can only give you 90.”</p>
<p>He immediately objected, “Oh no, you said you would give me 100 rupees.” I said, “I have 90 rupees.” I did not want to take out my main wallet from my money bag. I wanted to use only the money that I had kept inside my pocket to spend buying books. This was my fate. I said, “I have 90 rupees. What is the difference? I am giving 90 rupees instead of 100 rupees.”</p>
<p>No, he wanted 100.</p>
<p>Then I became furious. I said, “Now look here, the time has come for me to call in the police. Enough!”</p>
<p>Immediately he brought my bags out of the car, took the money and disappeared. When I went inside the terminal, I asked a guard, “How much do they charge usually to go to College Street and come back?”</p>
<p>The guard said, “A hundred and twenty. But if you are kind, you can give them 140. Otherwise, it costs maximum 120.”</p>
<p>I told him I had paid 390. Then in Bengali he used a foul tongue, saying what a bad fellow this taxi driver was. What made me sad was not the man’s deception, but the fact that Mother Kali’s picture and Sri Ramakrishna’s picture were both in his taxi, framed and garlanded with fresh jasmine flowers. If he could behave like that, as a spiritual person, what could you expect from others? That taxi was my choice. There were three or four cars and I made the selection. Indeed, I found the right person!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The computer error</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The computer error" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The time came to go to the ticket office to check my ticket. The agent said, “Your name is not there in the computer.”</p>
<p>Inwardly I said, “Ashrita can never make a mistake! He is so smart. He will never fail me. How can Ashrita do this?”</p>
<p>The man went on, “Your name is not there. You cannot board the plane.”</p>
<p>I replied, “Definitely my name is there. I was supposed to reconfirm from Pondicherry, not from here. It is not a matter of reconfirmation. I have got the ticket. I am supposed to go from Calcutta to Madras without any difficulty.”</p>
<p>He said, “No, your name is not there. What can I do?”</p>
<p>I said, “Absurd!”</p>
<p>Then he took me to four different places, and they all said the same thing, that my name was not there.</p>
<p>I said, “Thank you. What is the matter? Now tell me what is there.”</p>
<p>He said, “On the ticket it says Ghose, but there is no Ghose.”</p>
<p>“How can it be that there is no Ghose?”</p>
<p>“We have Chose, but not Ghose,” he said.</p>
<p>It was clearly an error.</p>
<p>I told the man, “That must be my name, only instead of ‘G’ it has been written with a ‘C’. Is it my fault that it is spelt incorrectly?”</p>
<p>The man said, “It is not our fault. We can’t go against the computer.”</p>
<p>I was becoming exasperated. I said to him, “You cannot go against the computer? Look at my passport, and look at me. Is there any similarity?”</p>
<p>Then he said, “But your middle name is missing on the computer.” I said, “If my middle name is not there in the computer, what am I going to do? My middle name is Kumar, but if my first and last names are there, why do you need my middle name?”</p>
<p>Then he went on, “But here it is written Sri Chinmoy.”</p>
<p>I said, “This is my name.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so now your name is Sri Chinmoy,” came the reply.</p>
<p>Finally, I got disgusted. I never carry anything with me, but this time I had one newspaper article from the last day in Myanmar. There were pictures of me with their highest Buddhist monk and the Minister of Religion. The whole front page was dedicated to me. I opened it and said, “Look at this. My name is Sri Chinmoy. I do not need Ghose.”</p>
<p>He looked at the article and recognised my picture. What a rogue he was! My passport picture he did not value, but he valued the silly newspaper picture. Then he agreed, “Oh no, Ghose is not necessary.”</p>
<p>After such a long time he allowed me to board. I was laughing to myself, “My passport picture has no value, but the silly newspaper picture has value because I am with some big shot. This always happens.”</p>

<p>From Bangkok to Calcutta my ticket was executive class, but from Calcutta to Madras it was economy class. When I went to the gate, the same man who had harassed me at the ticket counter put me in the first seat of first class — now that I was a big shot. He was afraid that I would make complaints to higher authorities!</p>

<p>I arrived in Madras at eight o’clock in the evening of January 11th. It takes three and a half hours to reach the Ashram by car. Around eleven o’clock I reached home. A friend of mine who works at the Ashram car company drove, and my two brothers came. When I saw my brothers, I got a tremendous shock because age has descended upon them. But, strangely enough, in two days’ time they looked much, much better than when I saw them at the airport. When we arrived home around eleven, my sister Lily was so happy to see me.</p>

<p>Now my sad story starts: how unfortunate I am! I was not getting any sleep that first night, so around three o’clock in the morning I decided to go out for a walk. If you walk for about 200 metres, you come to the seaside, the Bay of Bengal, and there you can walk for one mile flat. I had a very good, very powerful meditation, while I was walking and walking. Nobody was there. Around four o’clock an old friend of mine who was out jogging saw me and he was very delighted and excited.</p>
<p>Everything went well. I was only 30 metres away from my house when a lady approached me. She said she was from Florida, near Miami. She wanted to have an interview with me. I said, “No, no, no! No interview at this hour; I am going home. Some other day I will give you an interview. I will be here for four days.”</p>
<p>Then the following day I went out at four o’clock in the morning to walk. Usually people go walking at six or six-thirty, but at four o’clock I left my house only to find that this particular lady was waiting for me! She lives near our house. She has been at the Ashram for 14 years, she said. She started following me. There is a Durga Temple only two houses away from our house. When we reached the Temple, I said to her, “Please do not follow me. I am in a meditative mood.”</p>
<p>Was she going to listen? I walked for about a mile, sometimes slowly, sometimes a little faster, in my own way. I was on one side of the street and she had to walk on the other side of the street, across from me. I said, “O God, is it my fate? I do not care. I know how to meditate, so I do not have to worry.”</p>
<p>Again I walked more than a mile, and I was coming back very slowly. Still she was following me. When I came to my house, only 30 metres away from the main street, again she said she wanted to have an interview. I said, “This is not the time. I shall see you on Sunday at 4:30 in the afternoon. Please do not bother me any more. I am giving you the time of the interview.”</p>
<p>On the third day at a quarter to four, I went out. I was sure she would not be there. I had made it very clear that I did not want to be bothered and I had even given her an appointment time. But as soon as I reached the main street, she was there! I said, “O God, this is my fate with this crazy Florida woman!”</p>
<p>This Florida woman’s friend had met me in Kathmandu. He came to see me three times, but Savyasachi saved me three times and did not allow him. Finally on the last day I agreed to see him for ten minutes. This is how the story started.</p>

<p>The day after I arrived in Pondicherry, I said, “Let me go and reconfirm my reservation and see if there are any problems.”</p>
<p>When I went there, it was the same story — Chose instead of Ghose. But the fellow who was the agent was a good friend of mine. He spoke to the Madras people in front of me. Madras and Calcutta both reconfirmed my booking, but in Bangkok they said my name was not listed. My friend was screaming at the people in Bangkok: “It is there under Chose. Change it, for God’s sake, in the computer!”</p>
<p>They would not do it. This went on for two consecutive days. The first day I spent an hour and a half; the second day I spent about 45 minutes. My friend was not deceiving me. He was screaming at them, “Why do you do this kind of thing?”</p>
<p>Then he told me, “The Calcutta people could have made the proper spelling change, but perhaps they wanted money from you.”</p>
<p>Finally he got them to change Chose to Ghose.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">At Sri Aurobindo’s Samadhi</h2><span property="dc:title" content="At Sri Aurobindo’s Samadhi" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Very peacefully I came down the staircase after visiting Sri Aurobindo’s room. As soon as I came down, one lady started screaming with joy: “Oh, Chinmoy, Chinmoy!”</p>
<p>I had completely forgotten her name. She said, “This is what greatness has done! Because you have become so great, you don’t remember my name, but I do remember your name.” Her name is Vishwabani. She deals with flowers. She said, “Now come here. I have flowers for you, and these flowers you have to offer to Sri Aurobindo at the <em>Samadhi.</em> ”</p>
<p>She gave me flowers, and she asked me the spiritual names of the flowers. I was only able to tell her “Protection” for one flower, and for another flower I was doubtful. It was either “Divine Love” or “Power,” but the red hibiscus for Kali has different varieties and I was not sure. I said “Power.” She said, “No, this is ‘Divine Love’, not ‘Power’.” Then she asked me the names of six or seven other flowers, but I had totally forgotten. Very seriously she told me the names.</p>
<p>How could I forget the spiritual names that Mother and Sri Aurobindo had given to the flowers? How many things I have forgotten!</p>
<p>Then she gave me some sandalwood incense. The incense sticks were at least four times as large as the ones in America. They were so thick! She told me, “Now, most devotedly go there and pray and meditate. The way you used to meditate in those days, go and meditate. Although you have become very great, I know, go and bow down most devotedly to Sri Aurobindo’s <em>Samadhi</em>.”</p>
<p>She is older than I am, so she commanded me. With such affection she was barking at me.</p>
<p>So I went to the <em>Samadhi</em> with the flowers. True devotion captured my entire being; it was absolutely overflowing. I meditated at the place where Mother’s message is written. The first two or three lines on the marble I remembered: “To THEE who hast been the material envelope of our Master, to THEE our infinite gratitude...” I had forgotten the rest. In those days I knew it by heart. Every time I used to bow down, I would recite it, sometimes in French and sometimes in English. Most of the time I used to do it in English because I liked the English version better.</p>
<p>This time I tried to recite it, but I had completely forgotten the words. So I looked at the marble inscription and read it out very soulfully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To THEE who hast been the material envelope of our Master, to THEE our infinite gratitude. Before THEE who hast done so much for us, who hast worked, struggled, suffered, hoped, endured so much, before THEE who hast willed all, attempted all, prepared, achieved all for us, before THEE we bow down and implore that we may never forget, even for a moment, all we owe to THEE.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Anton and Joseph, the rickshaw drivers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Anton and Joseph, the rickshaw drivers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Coming back, after visiting Sri Aurobindo’s <em>Samadhi</em>, I took a rickshaw. There was a flat rate of 20 rupees per hour. Perhaps for us visitors it was 20 rupees, while for others it would be 10 or 12 rupees per hour. We are all stupid foreigners to these drivers! My visit took about half an hour or forty minutes, and still I had 20 minutes left. My rickshaw driver’s Christian name was Anton. Anton was supposed to wait for me at the Ashram gate. He spoke absolutely perfect English, so there was no problem.</p>
<p>But when I came out to look for him, he was not to be found. Where had he gone? I was searching for him, but he was nowhere. An old friend of mine who was at the main Ashram gate was screaming like anything: “Anton, Anton!” But Anton did not come. Instead, a driver named Joseph came and told me, “Anton said something was wrong with his rickshaw, so I have come to replace him.” This driver was also a Christian.</p>
<p>I said, “Are you telling me the truth? Now I will be in your rickshaw, and Anton will appear.”</p>
<p>Joseph said, “No, no, Anton will not appear.”</p>
<p>I wanted to keep the rickshaw for another hour so that I could go to the market and see my friends. I told Joseph, “Now I would like another hour.”</p>
<p>Joseph said, “Anton asked me to take his money.”</p>
<p>I said, “As soon as I give it to you, Anton himself will come to take the money.”</p>
<p>He said, “No, no, no! You don’t have to give it to Anton; only give it to me.”</p>
<p>Then we went to the market.</p>

<p>When we got to the market, I said to myself, “Before I buy a few saris or God knows what, the best thing is for me to buy a small bag so that I can keep my stuff inside it.”</p>
<p>I found a big bag for 25 rupees, which is less than a dollar. I bought the bag. While they were wrapping it, out of the blue the Florida lady came! I am “Ghose,” but my ghost was chasing me. She came and stood in front of me. This time I could not bring myself to say anything. I do not remember whether I laughed at her or smiled at her. In the end, I just went away and entered into the main market. Perhaps she could see that I was very angry and, for once, she did not follow me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Nolini-Da’s birthday</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Nolini-Da’s birthday" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The 13th of January was the birthday of Nolini Kanta Gupta. He was my main boss. He passed away a few years ago. Among the disciples of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, he was the seniormost and, according to Sri Aurobindo’s brother, Barindra, he was Sri Aurobindo’s mind-begotten son. According to Tagore, Nolini-da’s contribution to Bengali literature is unique.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, at eight o’clock, Nolini-da’s youngest son, Robi-da, came to our house with Indian sweets. He and I had been very good friends. He thought that by this time I would have forgotten his father’s birthday, but I said to him, “Let us meditate together for a few minutes and offer prayers to the Mother and Sri Aurobindo to bless your father’s soul. Today is his birthday.”</p>
<p>He gave me a broad smile. By this time, he knew that I had remembered his father’s birthday. We meditated together and then we had a very deep heart-to-heart talk.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Inside Nolini-Da’s room</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Inside Nolini-Da’s room" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Two hours later, I went to Nolini-da’s room. Manoj, who now works in his room, had been my class friend, but Manoj was not there. Nolini-da’s bedroom and the adjacent room were both open and they were very beautifully decorated for Nolini-da’s birthday. When I arrived, the lady who keeps the rooms clean saw me. I was standing in the doorway, hesitating, because my friend was not there.</p>
<p>I did not know the lady at all, but she said, “Come in, come in,” as if she knew me.</p>
<p>I went inside and looked at Nolini-da’s picture. The lady began asking me questions about when I worked there as Nolini-da’s secretary. She was very, very kind to me. I had been told that you cannot take pictures in Nolini-da’s bedroom; it is forbidden. Pictures can be taken only in the front room. But the lady saw my camera and said, “Normally it is forbidden to take pictures here, but for you nothing is forbidden. You can go inside and take as many pictures as you like. I was told you used to work here.”</p>
<p>I showed her where I worked, on the floor right beside Nolini-da’s bed. The bed that is in the room now is very large and beautiful. The previous one, the one that Nolini-da had used, was half the size. It was very small and narrow. Sometimes Nolini-da used to take rest in his bed while I was working and sometimes he used to sit there.</p>
<p>Then I showed the lady all the files that I used to take care of. Nolini-da had about two hundred files of his writings and ashram activities. I had to know them almost all by heart.</p>
<p>Then the lady said to me, “Please take my picture.” At that moment a friend of hers came into the room and I took their picture together.</p>
<p>I was so happy to see the place where I had worked for years.</p>
