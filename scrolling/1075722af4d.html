<p>CHARU: Please ask him to excuse my inability. With a heavy heart I tell you this. My connection with the Government you know ...</p>
<p><em>(Biren comes out. Sisir Ghosh follows him.)</em></p>
<p>SISIR: My young friend, do not lose heart. I shall take you to somebody who will gladly receive him.</p>
<p>BIREN: <em>(Delighted)</em> Who, who is he?</p>
<p>SISIR: He is Motilal Roy.</p>
<p><em>(They now reach Motilal Roy's residence.)</em></p>
<p>SISIR: Aurobindo Babu whom you regard so highly is at the Ghat. Can you arrange for his secret stay in our town?</p>
<p>MOTILAL: Why this question of secrecy?</p>
<p>BIREN: The Government were planning to arrest and deport him. A timely warning came and, after a little concentration, he has got the commend from above to come here and remain in secret.</p>

<p>VASUDEVA: I am glad that you have come over here as I wished. It is high time you plunged deeper into Yoga. You will feel more and more that it is I who am doing Yoga within you. Now I want that nothing may stand in your way. Hence, my chosen place for you is Pondicherry, South India. There your concentrated Tapasya will hasten the descent of a force which will facilitate the descent of a far higher Force to consummate your work.</p>

<p>AUROBINDO: Pondicherry, Pondicherry.</p>
<p>MOTILAL: What do you mean?</p>

<p><em>(March 31, 1910. Srinivasachari's house, Pondicherry. Srinivasachari with his friend, Subramaniyam. Moni arrives from Calcutta. He presents an introductory note (2 x 2 inches) to Srinivasachari from Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: <em>(Reading the note most carefully)</em> My dear friend, I find it difficult to believe you. Aurobindo Ghosh has chosen Pondicherry for his stay!</p>
<p>SUBRAMANIYAM: Unbelievable, impossible.</p>
<p>MONI: I am shocked to see that you do not take this note to be genuine. It is in Aurobindo's own handwriting.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: Can anybody imagine that such a great national figure would come down to Pondicherry, a French pocket?</p>
<p>MONI: I give you my word of honour. If I am telling a lie, you may do anything with my life.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: You want simply a house for him?</p>
<p>MONI: Yes.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: Nothing further?</p>
<p>MONI: For the present, no.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: Then I, too, give you my word of honour that as soon as he arrives here I will arrange a house for him.</p>
<p>SUBRAMANIYAM: That's a fine idea.</p>
<p>MONI: <em>(Turning towards Srinivasachari)</em> Well, Sir, I think it would be better if you kept it ready for him beforehand.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: When is he coming?</p>
<p>MONI: On April 4.</p>
<p>SUBRAMANIYAM: And if he doesn't turn up?</p>
<p>MONI: Then you may do with me anything you like.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: The time is so short. I am thinking of giving him a public reception.</p>
<p>MONI: I beg your pardon. He is coming over here <em>(incognito)</em>.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: Where have you put up?</p>
<p>MONI: I am coming straight to you from the station. I don't know where to put up.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: Well, you will be in my house. <em>(He takes Moni into an adjacent room, and returns to his friend, Subramaniyam.)</em></p>
<p>SUBRAMANIYAM: He may be a spy.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: I don't think so.</p>
<p>SUBRAMANIYAM: Anyhow, it is better to be on one's guard.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: I shall be on the alert. But I must find a suitable house for Aurobindo Ghosh. Pondicherry will be blessed by his presence, be it long or short. But in this dilapidated town can I find an accommodation suitable for him?</p>
<p>SUBRAMANIYAM: You can have a talk with Shanker Chetty. His house is three-storeyed. He can easily spare the needed accommodation.</p>
<p>SRINIVASACHARI: It is a good suggestion. I will act on it at once.</p>

And now instead of starting with bits of fruit and suchlike things you'll take a full normal meal!</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Do Yoga and you will understand. You are aware that in the Alipore jail I fasted for ten days. I was then in the thick of Yogic practices. No doubt, I began losing weight. But I could easily lift above my head a big pail of water, which I could not do before.</p>

<p>BIJOY: Most gladly, and by all means. But first you come out successful. After all, life is very precious.</p>
<p>MONI: Not for nothing did Rabindranath sing, <em>"Ekla Chalo Re"</em> ["Walk your way alone"].</p>
<p>BIJOY: But not for long are you to walk alone. I shall dog you the moment I see a particle of success in your risky adventure.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(With a smile)</em> Moni, it seems you are putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p><em>(Bijoy bursts into a roar of laughter. Moni looks crestfallen.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Shanker Chetty's house. K.V. Rangaswamy Iyengar, the zamindar of Kodailam, comes to meet Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>K.V. IYENGAR: <em>(Bowing down)</em> I have come to place myself at your feet.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: How do you mean?</p>
<p>K.V. IYENGAR: My Guru while leaving us for his heavenly abode advised me to take spiritual help from you.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Me! How could he know of me?</p>
<p>K.V. IYENGAR: His words have come literally true.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: How?</p>
<p>K.V. IYENGAR: He said to me that a Purnayogi from the North would be coming to the South seeking refuge. Now that you are no more in the vortex of the country's politics and have come here for a life of seclusion, I am sure that you are that very Purnayogi.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(Giving a smile)</em> Is it so?</p>
<p>K.V. IYENGAR: I will come to you again with whatever help I can afford for your service. Pray give me your blessings. <em>(Bowing down he looks up at Aurobindo's face.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: My blessings are already with you.</p>

<p><em>(Subramanya Bharati, the greatest poet of Tamil Nad, visibly excited sweeps into Aurobindo's room.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Why so excited?</p>
<p>BHARATI: There is a grave reason for it. The British Government have conspired with the French Administration to have us, the political refugees, moved out of Pondicherry.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Well?</p>
<p>BHARATI: We must escape. Immediately or as soon as possible.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Where?</p>
<p>BHARATI: To any of the three places — Jibuti, Indo-China or Tripoli.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: "Mr. Bharati, I am not going to budge an inch from Pondicherry. I know nothing will happen to me. As for yourself you can do what you like."</p>
<p>BHARATI: Your stand bewilders me. No, it inspires me. I will follow you, irrespective of what others may do.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Rest assured, nothing will happen to us.</p>
<p>BHARATI: I truly feel that not only Pondicherry is hallowed by the touch of your feet, but the whole of South India. No mere sentiment, this.</p>

<p><em>(Aurobindo's house, 41, Rue Fran√ßois Martin. Time: evening. Aurobindo's and his associates.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter Biren, Aurobindo's cook)</em></p>
<p>BIREN: <em>(Addressing Aurobindo)</em> I have been here in your service for six months. Now I long to go home. But before that I must disclose my identity. I was employed by the Bengal Intelligence Department to keep watch over you and send reports on your movements. I mean you and your associates. To my extreme amazement, I have always received the kindest possible treatment at your hands. None of you have felt the least bit of suspicion about me except, I fear, Moni Babu, and that too very recently.</p>
<p>MONI: Why do you think so?</p>
<p>BIREN: You always dress well and look smart. But you chose to shave your head the very day I shaved mine.</p>
<p>MONI: How does that prove I suspect you?</p>
<p>BIREN: I have shaved my head of set purpose, to be easily identified by the secret police here, and you have shaved to foil my purpose and puzzle them. Anyway, that is immaterial. I now want to take leave of you. But before I do so, I must make a clean breast of what I was here for.</p>
<p>MONI: Can you satisfy us that you are a B.I. spy?</p>
<p>BIREN: What more proof can I give than an offering to you, my master, of all my savings from the Government pay?</p>
<p><em>(He brings out of his pocket a sum of Rs. 50 and places it at the feet of Aurobindo. Tears run down his cheeks.)</em></p>
<p>Sir, you have been all kindness to me. Be more kind to me and forgive me my gravest misdeed. <em>(In a choked voice)</em> If you do not, my life-long remorse will be my life-long death. <em>(In a trembling voice)</em> You, Sir ...</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(Compassionately)</em> I wish you well. We will forget all this. Love your country. Live a better life.</p>

<p><em>The guests are seated in rows and served with sweets. Aurobindo slowly passes by, facing each of the party for a moment. Amrita's eyes sparkle with delight. After the repast, the guests take leave of Aurobindo one by one. Amrita stays on.)</em></p>
<p>IYENGAR: <em>(To Amrita)</em> You would see Babu privately?</p>
<p>AMRITA: That's what my heart longs for.</p>
<p>IYENGAR: Then you'll have to wait some time more. Three important persons, Bharati, Srinivasachari and V.V.S. Ayer, are expected. Do you want to meet Babu with them or with the inmates?</p>
<p>AMRITA: Preferably with the inmates.</p>
<p>IYENGAR: If so, you must wait.</p>
<p><em>(As these three leave after paying homage to Aurobindo they glance at Amrita with a shade of curiosity in their eyes as if to know if he wanted to be one of Aurobindo's inmates.</em></p>
<p><em>Time: 8:15 p.m. Aurobindo at a table. Amrita goes into Aurobindo's Presence with folded hands, walks around him and finally stands in front for a moment, their eyes meeting. Aurobindo signals to an inmate to give Amrita a sweet Amrita withdraws from the Presence, visibly moved.)</em></p>
