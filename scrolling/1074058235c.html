<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I believe that we have to be integral. The spirit and the body must go together. If I have peace of mind in my inner life, then I shall not quarrel with you and fight with you. Nations, like individuals, are insecure. If one nation has peace within, then that particular nation is not going to challenge other nations. It is because we do not have an iota of peace that we quarrel with others, we speak ill of others, we find fault with others. Peace of mind gives us joy in boundless measure.</p>
<p>When I lift up these weights, I try to unite both the inner world and the outer world with my inner peace. I am a student of peace. Every day, since my childhood, I have been praying and meditating. From the life of prayer, I get peace and this peace gives me strength. My weightlifting is the manifestation of my inner strength. This is my soulful service that I have been offering to humanity.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> You are saying that weightlifting is the manifestation of an inner strength?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. Because of my prayer-life and meditation-life, God, out of His infinite Bounty, has given me inner strength. So this inner strength I am trying to manifest through matter.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> With a oneness-heart. I have lifted people from all walks of life to offer my oneness to them. We all belong to one family. In a family, somebody is a doctor, somebody is an engineer, somebody is a football player. But they are all brothers and sisters of the same family. So here also, on the strength of my oneness with people from various fields, I am lifting them up. My sole objective is to be of service to mankind.</p>

Is that sometimes a hindrance for you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, because I know that I am not the one who is getting the attention. I know that I am not the doer. If somebody offers me love or admiration, I know that it is my Inner Pilot who is receiving it. I am only an instrument.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> So it is not Sri Chinmoy?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not Sri Chinmoy. It is the One who, according to my receptivity, according to my capacity, is manifesting Himself in and through me. So if you speak highly of me, I know I am not the one who deserves it, I am not the right person. But there is Someone who has given me the capacity to draw your appreciation and that Person deserves the credit, not me. I am not the doer; I am only an instrument, a channel. So if you appreciate me, this appreciation is going directly to the Source and not to me.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> So it is a measure of how successful the Source has been?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, according to my capacity and receptivity. The One who is inspiring me and trying to manifest in and through me I call my Inner Pilot. Your appreciation directly goes to Him.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> You have had this special relationship with God since you were a child?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have been praying and meditating since the age of four. Now I am 57.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> So you have always known?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I came from a religious family and I was fortunate enough to follow in the footsteps of my brothers and sisters.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Well, you have been very gracious to meet with me and I want to thank you very much for taking the time. I wish you well.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The outer life and the inner life always go together. The outer running inspires us to dive deep within. Again, the inner running, which is prayer and meditation, tells us to keep the body in perfect shape. If the body is not fit, if the body is not in perfect condition, we shall not be able to wake up early in the morning and pray and meditate. So the outer life and the inner life go together. They are like the obverse and reverse of the same coin. We need them both in our day-to-day life for our inner and outer satisfaction.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I draw upon cosmic energy, universal energy. I meditate for a few seconds or a minute before I lift and from deep within I draw cosmic energy.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> How long does it take to develop that skill?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends entirely on God's Grace. Some seekers have developed it in ten or twelve years, while others may take a lifetime. It depends on the receptivity of the individual.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> What do you think the implications are, besides sporting excellence?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Being a Truth-seeker and God-lover, I feel that if we can pray and meditate daily, punctually and soulfully, then we are bound to acquire boundless energy. This boundless energy we get in order to help us with our prayer, in order to expedite our capacity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a very, very sad experience that the world is getting from some unfortunate, unaspiring athletes. We should not do anything that will destroy our lives sooner than the soonest. God gave us the body. Now we have to be strong in every way because inside the body is the soul. If we do not keep the temple pure, then how are we going to prepare the shrine? In this case, the body is the temple and the soul is the shrine. Some athletes are unfortunately showing the world the way towards the wrong destination. Their destination is destruction.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You must be very tired after lifting all that weight?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; You must be very tired after lifting all that weight?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am not tired at all. I will be able to lift quite a few more people.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Are you happy?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I get joy in serving mankind. All of us are serving mankind in a special way. Even now, you are taping this programme and thousands of people will be inspired from our conversation. You are asking me most significant questions and I am trying to answer your questions according to my inner awakening. So undoubtedly, this conversation of ours is going to help people who are longing for truth, light and bliss.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Forgive me to say, but you do not look like a weightlifter.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> True, very true! In my case, it is all God's Grace. I do not have the body of a weightlifter. Previously I was a runner. I never thought of lifting. But now God's Compassion has asked me to do quite a few things for His Manifestation in and through weightlifting.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Can other people, if they meditate, lift like you do?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely! If it is the Will of God, then anybody can easily be a weightlifter.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> How often do you meditate? Is it all the time?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I meditate for quite a few hours during the night. I have a few thousand students all over the world and I meditate mostly on them. Since my childhood I have been meditating and now my own meditation has become spontaneous. Even when I am in the hustle and bustle of life, I feel deep within that meditation is going on.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> What do you feel while you are lifting?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While I am lifting, I feel that divine Compassion from God is flowing in and through me and I try to become a perfect instrument. God is acting in and through me and I am trying to become a perfect instrument of His. While I am lifting, I feel that I am not the doer; I am only an instrument. An inner force, inner power, is operating in and through me and I try to bring it to the fore.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Many people find your weightlifting feats incredible.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My own human mind finds it difficult to believe! Again, I know that I am not the doer. Infinite energy is acting in and through me. In this way, I can silence the mind.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> How long have you been weightlifting?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My weightlifting career started four years ago, but I have been lifting up human beings only for one year.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> You are also a runner, of course.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I started as a sprinter. Then I became a long distance runner. As a sprinter, according to our Indian standard, I was something, but not according to the world standard. Here, in the West, I have run 22 marathons and two ultra-marathons. Then I gave up because my right knee was injured. I could no longer run. I wanted to do something to keep my body fit and so I began weightlifting.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Your runs are triumphant all over the world!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I encourage the inner running and the outer running. They must go together. When you have a good thought, a good inner feeling, that feeling is your inner running. Then, when you express that feeling outwardly, when you share your good thought with others, that is your outer running. The outer running always starts from deep within.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> I am attempting a 30-kilometre run soon. What advice can you give me?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I used to run long distance, I used to break each run into fragments. I did not think of the entire distance, which in your case is 30 kilometres. Whatever the distance is, try to imagine that you are not going to run such a long distance. If you are supposed to run a mile, feel that you are going to run a quarter. You can tell the mind, "I am not such a fool that I will run a long distance, oh no! Just a quarter of a mile." Then, after you have covered a quarter of a mile, you will find that you have more energy.</p>
<p>Like that, it is always good to fool the mind, to discipline the mind. Otherwise, the mind will put so much added pressure on us. Before we even begin, the mind will give us so many worries and anxieties.</p>
<p>But if we can play a trick on the mind, if we can wisely tell the mind that what we are doing is within our capacity, we can relieve the burden of the mind. Then we will have no anxieties or worries.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sri Chinmoy, why are you doing this weightlifting?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; Sri Chinmoy, why are you doing this weightlifting?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am doing it to inspire my brothers and sisters. This world belongs to one Person, God the Creator, and we are His children, God the Creation. Now I am in Holland. I have come to see my brothers and sisters here in Holland. I feel that if I can be of inspiration to them, I will be very, very happy. From weightlifting, I get inner joy, inner strength and inner peace, peace of mind. If you have peace of mind, then you do not quarrel with others, you do not fight with others, you do not declare wars. So that is why I do weightlifting.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Have you done any sports before in your life?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. I have been a sportsman all my life. When I was young, I was an athlete. According to Indian standards, I was a very good athlete. I was also a decathlon champion. I was good in sprinting, jumping, throwing and so forth. But that is all past history.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> There are a lot of traditional weightlifting techniques, but now you are using none of these techniques. So how can you do it?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In my case, it is a matter of inner inspiration. You will be surprised to learn that there was a time when I disliked weightlifting immensely. In India, I was a sprinter and I thought weightlifting would be detrimental to my running career. Here, in America, I ran for quite a few years and I inspired my students all over the world to run. My right knee became badly injured, perhaps from running, so I gave up running and then I got the inspiration from within to lift weights so that I can keep physically fit. That is how I started.</p>
<p>As you can see, I do not know any weightlifting techniques. I do not have the physique of a bodybuilder or weightlifter. I entirely depend on God's Grace. God's Grace acts in and through me in all that I do. Not only in my sports life, but in my literary career, in my art and in all my activities, I entirely depend on God's Grace, God's Compassion. He is the One who helps me, guides me and protects me. He does it through me and I just try to become a good recipient. I try to offer Him my own receptivity, and He performs everything in and through me according to my receptivity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You talk about God. In Holland, people will say we are Christians, so we have a Christian God. There are people in other countries who have their own God.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; You talk about God. In Holland, people will say we are Christians, so we have a Christian God. There are people in other countries who have their own God." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one God, but we use different terms. In Dutch you use one word. In Bengali, I use the word 'Bhagavan', in English, they say 'God', and in French 'Dieu'. Each language has a word for God, but it is the same Person. An individual may be called Mr. So-and-So, his children call him Father or Daddy, and his friends will call him by his first name, but he remains the same person.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Why do you think it is possible that we have wars between people and they all say they are fighting for their God? How is it that there is only one God and so many opposing sides?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is our misconception of God. God is all love. Let us say God is the Father and we are two brothers. If we are quarrelling and fighting, will our Father be happy? No. The Father will be happy only if his two sons are happy and peaceful.</p>
<p>So each religion starts with love of God. Is there any religion that will say it hates God or hates humanity? There is no such religion. It is only our misconception of God. Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Jainism — they will all say they love God. But if you really love someone, how can you make that person unhappy? If we say that we love God and we continue to quarrel and fight with one another, is it not absurd? We want to make our beloved God happy. We want to make our Father happy. Who wants to make his Father unhappy and miserable? Nobody wants. But in our actions, unfortunately, we are making God sad and miserable. No religion will advocate war, quarrels, fighting and an unhappy life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Let us return to the topic of sport. Let us say there are two sportsmen. They may fight each other, even if it is a friendly fight. It could be boxing, it could be wrestling. If both of them pray, would that be good?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; Let us return to the topic of sport. Let us say there are two sportsmen. They may fight each other, even if it is a friendly fight. It could be boxing, it could be wrestling. If both of them pray, would that be good?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. If they pray, then they will have protection from God and they will show their best capacities, but there will be no animosity involved. Suppose two boxers are fighting. Naturally, each one wants to win. On the one hand, they can bring to the fore their animal propensities, animal qualities, and destroy the opponent. On the other hand, each one can feel that this is an opportunity to transcend their own capacities. They can try to bring their hidden capacities to the fore. According to our philosophy, we are always trying to transcend ourselves, we are always trying to improve. So, while transcending ourselves, if we defeat someone, then it is not a mistake. But if we try to defeat someone by hook or by crook, by adopting foul means, then that will be a most deplorable mistake.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> I know quite a lot of sports people and some of them pray. They say, "Please, Father, let me win the world championship today." Sometimes they succeed. Is that prayer good?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That prayer is good, but it is not the best prayer. The best prayer is to say, "Let Thy Will be done." The Saviour Christ offered the entire world this most significant message, "Let Thy Will be done." I wish to tell you about another great sportsman, one of the greatest, Muhammad Ali. Everybody knows Muhammad Ali. He is a very close friend of mine. About ten years ago, before one of his fights, he meditated with me for about fifteen minutes. He is a Muslim, so he was praying to Allah and I was praying to God, but it is the same Person. We prayed and meditated together. That night he won the fight. My prayer was only "God, let Thy Will be done." Although Muhammad Ali is my close friend, I knew that whatever God wanted to do in and through Ali will be the best thing. When we offer this prayer to God, God does the best for us.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> It could also mean that he would have lost. That could have been the best.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely. In this case, God wanted him to win. That was the best from the spiritual point of view. But if God wanted to give him the experience of failure, then he would have gained a very significant inner experience in another way. Sometimes God gives us the experience of failure when He wants us to establish our inseparable oneness with our competitors. At that time, if our prayer to God — "Let Thy Will be done" — is sincere, then we are equally happy because we love God. The Person whom we love most knows what is best for us. So we pray to God to do His Will, not our will. Otherwise, at every moment we would pray to God, "Make me the winner, make me the best." From the highest spiritual point of view, that is a mistake. We should pray to God for His Will to be executed in and through us. That is the best prayer.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> I have been a professional sportsman and in my life several times I have had the feeling that I could do more than what I was actually doing. Does that sound familiar to you?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It has happened many, many times in my case also that I could not offer my best capacity. Many times I felt that I could have done far, far better in running, but I did not do it, could not do it. Even then, I was not unhappy because at the very beginning I had offered my soulful prayer to God, "Let Thy Will be done." My mind will say that perhaps I was forced to hold something back, but my heart will say no. I prayed to God for His Will to be performed in and through me. Whatever timing I did in the race, that was the timing God wanted me to show to the world at large. So I was perfectly happy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If sports people would like to meditate, how should they do it?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; If sports people would like to meditate, how should they do it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every morning, when they get up, before they enter into the hustle and bustle of life, they can pray to God to give them a peaceful day, a happy day. They can utter the words, "O Lord God, today do grant me a peaceful day." That is one way, the way of prayer.</p>
<p>The other approach is through meditation. You can try to make the mind absolutely calm and quiet. Focus your concentration right on your heart. Try to feel that only in your heart you exist and there is nothing else. Here you are envisioning your own inner existence, your own divinity. Do not have even an iota of thought. The mind must be calm, quiet and absolutely silent.</p>
<p>With prayer, we use words to approach God. We say, "My Lord Supreme, do make me a choice instrument of Yours so that I can please You and fulfil You in Your own Way." When we are in deep meditation, on the other hand, we feel that God is doing the things that are necessary to be performed in and through us. He will act in and through us. We just try to be a perfect instrument of His.</p>
<p>While I am praying, I feel that God is high in Heaven. My prayer is going up to Him. While I am meditating, the elevator is coming down. God the compassionate One is descending into my heart and He will do the needful. This is how we feel God.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Is it true that by praying and meditating anybody can become a better athlete?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is definitely true. It is like having another friend on your side in a tug-of-war. If the other person does not pray or meditate, then he will be all alone, whereas you will have your prayer-friend and meditation-friend on your side.</p>
<p>So many world-class athletes pray and meditate. Just last week, the great Olympian Carl Lewis came and meditated with me for about an hour or so. He has been my friend for several years. During the last Olympics in Los Angeles, he came and meditated with me at the hotel room because he felt the need. He knows that his prayer-life has helped him considerably. He has prayed and meditated with me many, many times.</p>
<p>When you pray and meditate, you increase your inner strength, inner capacities. If your capacity is increased from your prayer-life and your meditation-life, then you should do it. It is like having two extra friends to inspire you. We all want to have friends. Friends can be of great help to us in our hour of need. During sports, we desperately need friends to come to our rescue. So here, prayer and meditation are two excellent friends to help us.</p>
