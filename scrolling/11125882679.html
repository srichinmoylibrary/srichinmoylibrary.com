  <h2 id="page-title">Sri Chinmoy Lauf</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Sri Chinmoy Lauf" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The following day was our main race, the Sri Chinmoy Run. The disciples had found a very beautiful course around a lake with two or three small loops and one big loop. Zatopek was supposed to start the race. He was so enthusiastic, as if he were running himself. He called out, "Where is the gun?" He was screaming, "No gun? No gun?" We said, "We don't use a gun." Then his wife said, "You don't need a gun." When his wife said that, Zatopek said, "All right, I will clap."</p>
<p>The race was to start on a small bridge. There were a little over two hundred people on the bridge. They were standing under a big banner saying "Sri Chinmoy Lauf." "Lauf" means race. Zatopek was standing on one side. He started the race by saying something in German, ending with a final clap. When he clapped, everybody clapped, and the race started.</p>
<p>All the London disciples — even elderly women — were running. Our very good runners were also there. Among the disciples, Sundar came in first and then Janaka. But they were defeated by local Swiss boys. I was not feeling well and was running last, behind everybody. When I ran along the small loops, Zatopek was so excited. He was clapping like anything. His wife stood up also and was clapping and clapping, although I was running behind everybody.</p>
<p>Some of the girls who are useless runners kept taking shortcuts at the places where the monitors were directing them around the loops. I told them later that they were all rogues. If they were supposed to run around someone who was standing in one place, instead they cut across. They saved fifty or seventy metres on four occasions. I was so disgusted. On one loop, at least two hundred metres they didn't run. They took a shortcut. What were they doing? Just because they were third class runners, they felt nobody would pay any attention.</p>
<p>When it was over, Zatopek gave the prizes. I was so embarrassed. The first, second and third prize trophies were of the same size, with the same figure. Only it was mentioned on the trophy, "first" or "second" or "third." I said, "How can it be?"</p>
<p>X announced the winner's name and handed the trophy to Zatopek, who handed it to the person. To each person who came up for a trophy, Zatopek had something encouraging to say. He was very, very nice. There were also health food prizes — honey and other things — for the winners. Zatopek was so happy to see that we had health food for the winners. After he gave each person his trophy, he pointed to the health food so happily and said, "Take this. You select."</p>
<p>I thanked both Zatopek and his wife, and Zatopek spoke, appreciating us. Then he came up to me and grabbed my hand and said, "Our Guru, this is the best." That was his comment. The race and the atmosphere — everything — pleased him, so he said, "Our Guru, this is the best."</p>
<p>The Mayor of Zurich, who comes from Canada, sent his assistant to honour me. He came with a proclamation and he spoke so highly of me for about seven or eight minutes. All of a sudden, his wife, who was very tall — much taller than her husband — came and gave me a huge bouquet. She was smiling at me. The husband said, "She wants to offer you this bouquet." So I took it and I thanked her.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Signing autographs</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Signing autographs" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>After the race, people were all standing in a queue for Zatopek's autograph. Some people came up to me and asked me to autograph a small scrapbook. Some also came and asked me to sign their running numbers.</p>
<p>Everybody liked Abarita's book on Zatopek. It was in German and included conversations with Zatopek during Abarita's stay at Zatopek's home. Before they ran, and afterwards as well, many runners came up to Zatopek and asked him to sign the book. Carla was selling the book, and Zatopek and his wife were sitting together side by side, signing it. When there were people he considered important, he asked his wife also to sign. Otherwise, his signature was enough. Hundreds of people came and stood in line.</p>
<p>When the line began fading, I also came. Before me there were seven or eight people. But Abarita had to ask those people to let me go ahead of them.</p>
<p>When I stood in front of Zatopek with one of Abarita's books, he wrote, "With great admiration for the greatest Guru." Then he signed his name and he drew a picture of a javelin aiming at someone. Like me, he became an artist and illustrated his signature. When I sign, I draw birds. In his case, he drew a javelin.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The ball collector</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The ball collector" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Many times Zatopek had talks with Abarita about me and the Centre. When we went to play tennis, he came to watch us play. His wife went to see one of her students, who has now become a coach.</p>
<p>For over an hour, Zatopek was watching our games. There were no good players there, so I looked like a great player, defeating all the European disciples.While he was watching, four or five times he ran after the ball to collect it and give it to the person throwing balls to the server. He was enjoying the game like anything, but he never played.</p>
<p>Zatopek and his wife were very nice. Everything went perfectly well. They were so happy that they had come, and we were so happy to have them. They liked the disciples and they were very, very deeply moved.</p>

<p>The Director-General of the United Nations in Geneva, Mr. Luigi Cottafavi, is an Italian. For about forty-five minutes we met with him and talked all about different religions. We also spoke all about Hinduism and about India.</p>
<p>He was very nice and kind, and full of life and enthusiasm. Physically he was very tall and strong. There is a great difference between the Director-General in Geneva and the Secretary-General here in New York. The Secretary-General has luminosity; the Director. General has dynamic vigour.</p>

<p>In Geneva I met with the Vice President of the international Red Cross. He was very humble and modest. Our people sang the Red Cross song. It was a very soulful atmosphere that our singers created. Everything went well.</p>
<p>In Switzerland I also met with the Indian ambassador, who was extremely nice and very kind. Daily we went to three or four different places.</p>

<p>Visiting Einstein's house in Bern was an unforgettable experience. Before Einstein came to the United States, he had lived in these three or four small rooms. There are four floors and one has to walk up. It is a very old building. Einstein's pictures were there and different examples of his research work. Einstein became very soulful and spiritual in the evening of his life.</p>
<p>The greatest living authority on Einstein was there. He has written a book on Einstein. I don't know what the professor saw in me, but he went on talking and talking, literally not allowing me to come down the stairs. He talked all about Einstein's spirituality and this and that.</p>
<p>Finally he said, "Please, you have to write down something," so I had to write something in the guest book. They don't ask for an autograph; they ask for a few lines. It was a big page and while I was writing he was standing beside me and watching. I was so moved.</p>

<h2>The excited Cardinal</h2>

<p>As you know, on the 18th of June, at seven o'clock, I was supposed to meet with the Pope. At five-thirty they wanted me to be present. I came at five-thirty on the dot and stood not at the Vatican Gate, but about twenty or thirty metres away. A Cardinal was waiting for me but he could not see me, and he was very excited because he thought I was late. When he finally saw me, he took my papers and led me inside.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Pope arrives</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Pope arrives" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Inside the Vatican, there were ninety thousand people. They had all come to hear the Pope speak. Since it was summer, the audience was held outside, in a corridor. But the Vatican is so big that the corridor easily housed over ninety thousand people. The people were all excited that they were going to see the Pope.</p>
<p>Around a quarter to seven, the Pope arrived in his small van or car. His car was moving down a passageway, and he was blessing people from the car. Then, when he came out of the car and was making his way to his throne, he would go and bless one person, shake hands with someone else, pat somebody's shoulder and do all kinds of things. He was like an affectionate grandfather greeting his family.</p>
<p>There was a group of African singers wearing special uniforms. Sometimes they would sing and sometimes they would slap their face or head. It was a part of the performance. The Pope was so satisfied with them. He clapped and clapped and clapped.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Pope&#039;s speech</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Pope&#039;s speech" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The Pope read out his speech in, I think, seven languages. First one of the Cardinals said something in Italian, and then the Pope read out his message in English, French, German, Spanish and a few more languages. But before he read out his serious message in all the languages, he cut jokes and made everybody laugh. You can't imagine, for two hours or more, he only smiled and smiled and smiled. He would look to one side and smile and then to the other side and smile. He would all the time smile, bless people, talk and cut jokes.</p>
<p>Like the last time I was there to see Pope Paul, this time also I was put in the front row. Beside me were a Cardinal and two or three priests from Africa. They were also supposed to see the Pope. It was a private audience in the sense that the Pope would speak to each person personally. Behind me was another row; so there were two rows altogether.</p>
<p>The Pope's throne was very, very simple and his shoes were also very simple. He was in a white robe. Six or seven times during his talk he looked at me and smiled. I was sitting only ten or twelve metres away from him. He looked at me and greeted me six or seven times during his speech.</p>

<p>After the speech, it was time for the private interviews. Three or four black priests were ahead of me. The Pope came up to them and they all knelt down and kissed his ring.</p>
<p>As soon as the Pope came near me, I stood up and one of the Cardinals said, "He is Sri Chinmoy from the United Nations."</p>
<p>I gave the Pope Sanatan's plaque, which was so beautiful, and the pamphlet with the song about him. As I was giving him the plaque and the pamphlet, the Pope said, "You are from the United Nations."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, Father, I am."</p>
<p>Then he asked me, "Are you an Indian?"</p>
<p>Again I said, "Yes, I am."</p>
<p>Then he said, "India, India, India!" with such joy and enthusiasm in his face.He was absolutely beaming with joy.</p>
<p>He very powerfully grabbed my elbow with such affection, and looked at me as if I were an old forgotten friend or grandson. He was holding me firmly and talking to me, and he patted my shoulder seven or eight times.</p>
<p>Then he said to me, "Special greetings to your members. Special blessings to you. We shall continue together."</p>
<p>The words we exchanged were few, but he spent time looking at the plaque and appreciating it. I also showed him the picture of me with the previous Pope that was in the U.N. booklet, "Our First Ten Years." He looked at the picture and also at the pamphlet with the song about him.</p>

<p>Pope John Paul has tremendous warmth and he is very sincere in expressing affection. He is very sociable, very affectionate, very compassionate. He has sincere compassion and affection. He was beaming with joy and showed me tremendous affection, love and concern when he offered me his benediction.</p>
<p>The Pope has compassion on the human level, the physical level, which others can immediately see and feel. Pope Paul VI had compassion in a luminous, ethereal way. The previous day, I saw the soul of Pope Paul four or five times, filled with real aspiration. His psychic presence I saw and I felt most powerfully.</p>

<p>There is a funny story about our photographer-disciple, Giorgio. When the UPI photographer saw Giorgio there, he asked him to leave, saying he had no right to take pictures. Previously, Giorgio had asked me if I wanted pictures taken during the Pope's speech, and I had said yes. God knows where the UPI man was then, but Giorgio took three or four pictures of the Pope from over my shoulder.</p>
<p>When it was time for the private interviews, the UPI photographer came and told him to leave. Giorgio looked at me and I just smiled at him. So he gave a similar smile to the UPI photographer. The UPI man got mad and made complaints to one of the Cardinals. The Cardinal asked Giorgio to leave immediately, but he was not listening. He kept looking at me and I kept smiling at him. At least four times they insulted him, all in Italian. Still he didn't listen. He took four black and white pictures and four colour slides. Eight or nine pictures he took, and UPI took, I think, three.</p>

<p>The Pope has much more hair than I have. Once, the wind blew away his cap and four or five Cardinals ran after it, almost colliding. That was the time I was able to see. I said, "O God, so much hair!"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The meditation in Italy</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The meditation in Italy" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In Italy I was supposed to give a talk. It was in a small hall in a very big building. For the first time, perhaps, I went to give a talk in a track suit, but the audience didn't mind. There were about seventy or eighty people.</p>
<p>Indians, as usual, dominated the question and answer period. Three Indians did not allow anyone else to ask any questions. One question was about pressure in the third eye. Another question was about reincarnation. They went on and on.</p>
<p>Before that, a tall young man came up to me and introduced himself as one of the secretaries of the Italian Ambassador to the United Nations. He said he had come to our meditations at the U.N. five or six times and had enjoyed them very much. He couldn't believe that I came to such a small gathering to hold meditation and give a talk. He was very, very nice. Also he came to the meeting later.</p>
<p>The lady who organised the meeting had wanted to come to New York to see me and become my disciple. But instead of coming to New York, she went to Miami and met another Master and became his disciple. She was asking me, "Did I do the right thing? Did I find the real Guru?" So I said, "You did absolutely the right thing. You found the real Guru." She was so happy that she had found the real Guru and the real path.</p>

<h2>Marathon champion</h2>

<p>While in Germany, I met with the previous women's world marathon champion, a German girl, Christa Vahlensieck. Projjwal had invited Christa to get a trophy from me. You can't imagine how spiritually developed that girl is. She doesn't speak English, but she gave the sweetest smile each time we talked to her. She had come by bus from forty or fifty miles away. The disciples sang for her and we gave her gifts. Many pictures were taken. She enjoyed everything.</p>
<p>Christa is a very good runner. She is very short and her strides are also short. In 1978 she came to New York, but she could not finish the marathon. She said that the New York heat was unbearable and she was miserable. That was when she lost her world record; Grete Waitz broke it by seven minutes. Then, for one year she could not run because she was sick. Now she will be running a marathon in Britain. She was very, very nice and everybody liked her.</p>
