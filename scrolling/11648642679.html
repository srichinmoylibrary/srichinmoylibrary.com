<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If it is on the vital plane, it is all destruction. If it is on the psychic plane, then it is solid power, inner power, used for the awakening of Divinity in humanity and for the manifestation of Divinity in humanity. So it depends on the plane in which the joke is operating. If it is on the vital plane, then it is all dynamic destruction. If it is on the heart plane, the psychic plane, then it is solid power desperately trying to manifest God's Divinity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does God ever bounce checks?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does God ever bounce checks?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God does not have a bank. He has only money. He does not deposit His money because He feels that He has the capacity to protect His money Himself. For God, protection is everywhere; He Himself is protection. God also feels that He has the capacity to increase His money, or His achievements, in infinite measure. He does not have to depend on interest power. He has the capacity to increase the principal. Interest-power is nothing in comparison to the increase of principal. God is so powerful that He does not need the interest. He says, "No, I don't need it. I will just increase the principal."</p>
<p>So God does not use checks. He uses bills. His bills are not like a dollar or twenty dollar or hundred dollar bills. His bills are Compassion, Concern, Forgiveness, Pride and Oneness. In God's case, the highest bill is His oneness with humanity. Conscious, constant inseparable oneness is His highest bill. If the seeker can become aware of that particular bill, which God has given Him, then he becomes the richest person. If somebody gives him a false check, it is deception. But God does not believe in deception. He does not give something that is false. He will never give anything that will bring disgrace to Him. Unconditionally</p>
<p>He gives what He has and what He is: His oneness with His creation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day it changes. One day Nathan, one day Casey, one day Peter, one day somebody else; and that somebody else may be Bob himself. The biggest joke in God's creation is he who feels that he can do everything without being assisted by anybody, not even by God. In this world the biggest joke is he who feels that he can do even one particular thing without God's help. According to me, when one thinks that one can do something without God's help, he is the biggest joke.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God laughs the loudest when He sees that His instrument, His spiritual instrument, Jim, drives his wagon or his car without insurance, without registration and sometimes without even a license. So God says, "Here I have a creation. But look at the audacity of this creation! He does not believe in other creations of mine, which are insurance, registration, license and so forth. Look at his audacity; he does not believe in my other creations." Then God starts laughing. At that time His laughter becomes the loudest.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How far is the pole star from the sun?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How far is the pole star from the sun?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The pole star is quite near the sun. It is very close, not even one foot away. The sun is the heart and the pole star is the third eye, which is in the forehead. So you can see, they are not even one foot apart. Inside the heart is not one sun but many, many suns. Vivekananda had eighteen. You can also have one, two, three, God knows how many. Believe it or not, when I bark at you, all of your suns are eclipsed. But when I don't bark at you, when I show you my infinite Compassion, at that time those suns show me their brightness, light and delight.</p>
<p>The pole star is the star that guides, the star with vision. The third eye is vision and the sun is the creative force, the reality that has taken the pole star as its representative to manifest it. The heart-sun and the eye of vision are complementary realities. The sun is the source, the pole star is the course. The pole star needs the sun, the source. Again, the sun needs the course. So in this way they complement each other. If there is no source, there is no reality; and if there is no course, if the reality is unmanifested, then what good does it do?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why did God create flies?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why did God create flies?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God created flies so that the mind will not feel miserable. God tells the mind, "I have created something to compare with you. You can't stay in one place. You fly from one object to another. So I have created a friend for you. It is the fly, which is also restless, Oh mind, since you are not able to remain calm and quiet, then I will show you that you have a friend on earth: the fly. Then you will be able to enjoy its company, if not outwardly then inwardly." So God is very kind to the mind. He tells the mind to look around and appreciate the fly, for the two of them can become good friends. Again, there comes a time when the fly becomes tired and exhausted, and stops flying. At that time God again speaks to the mind about the fly: "If flies can remain calm and quiet, how is it possible that you can't do the same thing? Don't accept defeat. If the fly can do something in a positive way, then you should try to do the same thing and defeat it. So be calm and quiet and don't accept defeat."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why is there dust that we always have to clean up?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why is there dust that we always have to clean up?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to clean up dust so that we can learn to value the superior thing in us, the higher thing in us. In order to do something and become something, we have to go to the higher reality and not remain with the lower reality. Dust is a lower reality. It represents impurity. We know what impurity does: It destroys everything. From the lower reality we have to go to the higher reality. It is like going up the rungs of a ladder. From one rung we have to go to the next rung. In this case the ladder has quite a few rungs: first impurity, then purity, then divinity, then oneness. If we stay all the time on the impurity-rung, then how are we going to go on to the purity-rung? Some people are pure by nature, but they don't aspire. There are many saintly persons on earth who have a good heart: but they don't pray, they don't meditate. Their purity is not enough for them to realise God. Along with purity there must be a constant inner cry and aspiration. So the lower reality must be surpassed. Then only the higher realities will be able to guide us, shape us, mould us, perfect us and make us perfect instruments of the Absolute Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My favourite Indian joke is what happened the first day I came down from the highest type of <em>samadhi.</em> I forgot my name. I was trying to think of my name, but I couldn't remember it. Then it came to my mind that one of my school notebooks had my name on it. So I looked at the cover of the notebook and found my name. When I came down from that consciousness the second and third time, I had to ask my friends what my name was. My friends were my greatest admirers. They knew my realisation, so they didn't cut jokes with me.</p>

Because you are carrying such a heavy load, you deserve a little bit of joy and encouragement. The most effective way to relieve you of some of this weight is to make you laugh: laugh at the world, laugh at your stupidity, laugh at your responsibility, laugh at everything.
