<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Crucifixion is not the answer. Illumination is the answer. Let us say that today my mind is very bad. It is doubting and creating so many problems. So I destroy my mind. Then tomorrow I may start having problems with my vital. My desiring vital may be desperately trying to strangle my aspiration. Therefore, I destroy my vital. The day after tomorrow I may see that my body is extremely lethargic. It does not want to get up in the morning; it wants to remain always asleep. So I destroy my body. In this way, if I go on destroying, I will have nothing left. I will have no mind, no vital, no body — nothing.</p>
<p>Destruction is not the answer. The answer is transformation. We have to transform and transcend. If my body is lethargic, I will compel my body to get up. If my vital is destructive, I will compel my vital to be dynamic. If my mind is doubting, I will compel my mind to have faith.</p>
<p>Always we have to take the positive side. Instead of destroying the lethargic body, we will make it active. The destructive vital we will try to make dynamic. And in the doubting mind we will instill faith, implicit faith. Instead of destroying anything, we will only illumine and transform it. We will replace lethargy with wakefulness, destruction with dynamism, doubt with faith.</p>
<p>God has sent us here to do some special work for Him. Everything that we have and everything that we are is imperfect, but God does not want us to destroy ourselves. He wants us to transform ourselves and become perfect. He has given us the message of perfection. If something in us is imperfect, then let us make that particular thing perfect. Only then will God be pleased with us. God created us not for destruction but for perfection, so that He can enjoy satisfaction in and through us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between aspiration and desire?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between aspiration and desire?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we desire, we try to increase our capacities in order to challenge others, in order to defeat others, in order to lord it over others, and in order to make the world feel that we are a few inches — if not a few miles — ahead of it. Desire wants to say, like Julius Caesar: <em>Veni, vidi, vici</em> — "I came, I saw, I conquered.” I came into your domain, I saw you and I conquered you.</p>
<p>Aspiration is not like that. When we aspire, we cry not only for our own perfection, but also for others’ perfection. Aspiration will say, “What I have, I wish to share with you. If I have a good thought, I wish to share it with you. Again, if you have a good thought, I wish you to share it with me. Let us share our capacities and our realities with each other.” Aspiration plays the role of oneness, which is nothing other than perfection itself. Oneness is perfection; perfection is oneness.</p>
<p>Desire enjoys the sense of separativity: “You stay where you are; I will stay where I am, and I will try to show you that I am infinitely more powerful than you, infinitely superior to you. In every aspect of life I will show you that I far surpass you.” This is the message of desire. But aspiration will say, “If I have anything good, I will share it with you. If I have beauty, I will give it to you. If I have power, I will give it to you, because I am always eager to sing the song of oneness.”</p>
<p>Aspiration is always trying to establish its oneness with each and every individual, and to see only the good, divine, supreme qualities that each individual has and is. If aspiration discovers that I have an unlit quality or capacity, it will try to illumine it. Aspiration will never try to give that unlit quality to you. My difficulties and imperfections, aspiration will not hide; it will try to illumine them. But it will never offer them to you. When I am aspiring, I will pray to God, my Heavenly Father, to inundate me with light so that I can illumine my imperfections, limitations and undivine qualities.</p>
<p>Desire, on the other hand, secretly or openly will try to throw into you only bad qualities. If I have any wrong thoughts or wrong ideas, if I have anything that is undivine and destructive, openly I can’t give these things to you. But secretly my desire will try to inject them into you so that you will also bear the burden and suffer, so that you will carry the heaviest possible load and not be able to surpass me in any way.</p>
<p>Desire binds us; aspiration liberates us. Desire wants to lord it over others. Aspiration always wants to be one with others. Each time desire achieves its goal, another goal looms ahead; so desire is never satisfied. First it wants one house, then two houses, then three houses, and at the end of this road frustration looms large. But when we aspire, even if we get just an iota of light, we are satisfied, for we know that eventually we will be inundated with the infinite ocean of light. Right now we are wanting in receptivity. Once we get more receptivity and our inner vessel becomes large, larger, largest, at that time we shall definitely see and grow into infinite Peace, Light and Bliss. These are not mere words or ideas; these are realities that will one day be at our disposal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we be more attached to pleasing God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we be more attached to pleasing God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Instead of saying “attached,” let us say “devoted.” When something is good, we say we are devoted to it; when something is undivine, we say we are attached to it. For example, because we love our country, we devote our lives to the improvement of our country. Like this, if anything is good, we will devote our lives to that thing. In the same way, our soul is devoted to God-manifestation. When we start praying and meditating, we try to please God. That means we are devoted to a higher cause, the supreme Cause.</p>
<p>When we remain in the ordinary world, the unaspiring world, the desire-world, we try to please and satisfy only ourselves. But when we are in the aspiration-world, we try to please God. God is the root, and if we can please the root, then the trunk, branches, leaves, flowers and fruits will also be pleased. So let us devote ourselves to the root, to God. If we can please God on the strength of our heart’s inner cry, then we will see and feel inside us God’s Love, Concern, Light and Peace — all that God has and is.</p>
<p>How can we have this inner cry? We can have this inner cry in the same way that we can have the outer cry. When a child cries for food, no matter where his mother is, she will come running. The child may be on the first floor and the mother may be on the second floor, but the mother will come running because the child is sincerely crying to be fed. Similarly, if we cry sincerely for divine nectar, for light and delight, then God is bound to give it to us.</p>
<p>When the child cries, he has the unconscious hope that his mother will come and bring him food. In our case, as seekers, we are conscious. If we cry for peace, light and bliss, immediately we will get an answer. But our cry has to be sincere. When we cry inwardly, we have to feel a sincere need for God. When we have that inner need, then God, out of His infinite Bounty, will come and grant us the things that we need.</p>
<p>If we have a sincere, genuine inner cry, then all our problems will be solved. But if we do not have that sincere inner cry, then no matter how many years we live on earth, we will not find satisfaction, because true satisfaction means the perfection of our nature, the perfection of our life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I&#039;m trying to have faith in all that you are saying. But if it is true, why don’t I feel light and peace inside me?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I&#039;m trying to have faith in all that you are saying. But if it is true, why don’t I feel light and peace inside me?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are right in saying that if something is true, you will feel it within the very depths of your heart. But sometimes it may take a little time. You sow a seed. After a few months it germinates. In a year it grows into a sapling, and eventually it grows into a huge banyan tree. When you begin to take an interest in the spiritual life, you have only sown the seed. You may not see the results immediately. It takes time.</p>
<p>You <em>will</em> feel light and peace, but first you have to have faith. Inside you there are many organs: heart, lungs and so on. You believe this because doctors and others say so. Although you cannot see these things, you know that they are there. Similarly, in the inner world, if you do not see something right now, you cannot say that it does not exist. Within your inner body, there are many things which you may not feel, but which I am aware of, because I have prayed and meditated more than you have. You need to cultivate more faith in what I say and in what other Masters have said about the inner world. If you pray and meditate soulfully and cultivate more faith in what you have heard from spiritual seekers and Masters, then eventually you will see that they were right.</p>
<p>You have to start with faith — sincere, genuine, sublime faith. This faith is not going to mislead you. When you read a spiritual book, that book embodies light. While reading, you may not feel light inside the book right away, but still you do not discard the book. No, you have faith in the messages that the book contains. You meditate on the words and ideas that the book embodies, and eventually you do get light. Inside the book there is a hidden reality. If you believe in that hidden reality while you are reading, in the course of time you will get illumination. But you have to read the book in order to get the essence, the quintessence of the book.</p>
<p>Similarly, you have to pray and meditate before you will feel your own divinity. If you cannot feel your inner divinity right now, don’t be sad or upset. It takes time. Pray and meditate sincerely, and through your faith, your real divinity will one day loom large. If you do not have higher experiences or realisations as soon as you enter into the spiritual life, do not give up. Right now if you do not feel inside the very depth of your heart something divine, illumining, fulfilling and perfect, no harm. It takes time to acquire a free access to the inner world. But once you have free access to the inner world, you will see that it is flooded with light and delight.</p>
