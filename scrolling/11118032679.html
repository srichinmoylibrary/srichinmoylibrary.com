<p>Before the marathon in Flushing Meadow Park, I ran about 14 miles on Union Turnpike. I was running in the outside lane and Pahar was running in the middle lane, next to me. My road crew was following me in the car. A policeman came and said, "Run on the sidewalk!" So I ran a little bit on the sidewalk, but the sidewalk is much harder than the street and it hurt my legs. Finally I said, "Let the police come again," and we went back to the street. Then an old man and woman saw us running. The old man was barking, "Can't you see you are running in the street?" The old lady told her husband not to bother us.</p>

<p>He ran another half mile before making a turn. When he came back from the small loop, he was in first place â€” a hundred metres ahead of the runner behind him.</p>

<p>Databir went to the Super Runner store to buy me new running shoes. The owner, Gary Muhrcke, is an excellent runner who was the winner of the first New York Marathon. He knows me well. When he found out the shoes were for me, immediately he took off 20 percent.</p>
<p>Then Databir told him that I wanted to bring my weight down to 131 pounds to run the New York Marathon. Gary is five feet eight and a half inches tall and weighs 125 or 126 pounds. He said I should come down to 125 and then, to get strength, eat before the marathon and come up to 131. He also said I should not run more than 40 miles a week before the marathon. So I am listening to Gary Muhrcke's advice. I am trying to come down in my weight, and I will not run more than 40 miles a week.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The crazy lady</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The crazy lady" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Today the funniest thing happened when I was race-walking on 150th Street. On my way back, at about the 300-metre mark, a gentleman grabbed my elbow and said, "I have got to talk to you."</p>
<p>I thought, "O God, he is going to complain about the 300-metre mark on the street." That is the famous mark that a German lady has given us so much trouble about.</p>
<p>But the gentleman didn't mention the mark. He told me that his wife had gone crazy. He said, "You see the bus stop over there? She does not want to stand there. She wants the bus to stop for her about 40 metres away, not where the bus is supposed to stop. Three times the bus passed her but the drivers didn't stop, although she waved her hand and screamed."</p>
<p>He told me that the fourth time a bus was coming, to draw the bus driver's attention he stood in the street in front of the bus. The bus driver stopped and insulted and scolded him. While the bus was stopped, his wife entered into the bus.</p>
<p>I asked, "Now where is she going?"</p>
<p>He said, "She is going shopping."</p>
<p>I said, "How do you know she will not do some crazy thing while she is away? How do you know she will not stand at some place and expect the bus driver to stop for her?"</p>
<p>I gave him my very sympathetic ear, and he felt that I really was sorry for him. But he had faith in her and felt she would come back.</p>
