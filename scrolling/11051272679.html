<p><em>(Rama, Sita and Lakshmana are in the forest early in the morning. Sita is plucking flowers.)</em></p>
<p>RAMA: Sita, they say that flowers are beautiful, but I wish to say that you are infinitely more beautiful than any flower. The beauty of all the flowers put together is no match for your beauty.</p>
<p>SITA: Do you really think so, Rama? It is so kind of you to say it.</p>
<p>RAMA: They say that flowers have fragrance, but I wish to say that the fragrance of all the flowers put together cannot equal the fragrance of your heart.</p>
<p>SITA: O Lord, you are seeing me with your eye of unconditional appreciation, and not with the eye of a critic.</p>
<p>RAMA: My life should be at least a life of appreciation for you. Your life is a life of constant sacrifice for me. But my sincerity speaks, Sita. You are infinitely more beautiful, infinitely more fragrant than all the flowers of the world put together.</p>
<p>SITA: If I have a heart of gratitude, then that heart is for you, only for you, my Lord. Oh, look! Look at that beautiful deer! I have never seen such a beautiful deer! Never! It is so strikingly beautiful!</p>
<p>RAMA: Yes, it is extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>SITA: Look how charming it is, nibbling the grass. How soulfully it gambols and frisks. Look! It is multicoloured, and it has lustrous spots. I need this deer, Rama. I want it to be my deer.</p>
<p>RAMA: Is there anything that I will not do to please you, my Sita? I shall bring you the deer.</p>
<p>LAKSHMANA: Brother, don't go. That is the demon Maricha playing a trick. He can assume any form, and he has taken the form of this animal. He is deceiving us. That is not a real deer.</p>
<p>SITA: I don't believe you, Lakshmana. That is a real deer. I can see its beauty. I can feel the innocence of the animal. Rama, my Lord, chase it and catch it alive. If you can do that I will be so grateful to you.</p>
<p>RAMA: Lakshmana, I am off. Look after Sita.</p>

<p><em>(Another part of the forest. Enter the deer, followed by Rama, panting.)</em></p>
<p>RAMA: Ah! One moment the deer is near, and the next moment it is quite far. This moment I am about to catch it, and the next moment it is beyond my reach. This is indeed a mysterious animal. I have been running after it for a long time. Now I am tired, exhausted. Sita wanted me to bring back this deer alive if possible. But I find it is not possible to catch it. Well, I shall shoot the deer with my bow, but I shall not kill it. I shall wound it and then take it home to Sita. She will nurse and cure the animal.</p>
<p><em>(Rama aims his unfailing arrow at the deer. The deer falls down.)</em></p>
<p>DEER <em>(in Rama's voice):</em> Ah Sita, Ah Lakshmana! Ahhh Sita, Ahhh Lakshmana.</p>

<p><em>(Sita and Lakshmana, still at the same spot in the forest.)</em></p>
<p>SITA: Listen, Lakshmana! Your brother is in danger! He is crying, "Ah Sita, Ah Lakshmana." He needs you! Go to him!</p>
<p>LAKSHMANA: Mother Sita, I cannot obey. My brother asked me to look after you. If I leave you alone here he will be extremely displeased with me. I assure you, my brother can never be in danger. There is nobody who can defeat him in fighting. He is all-powerful. I am sure that Maricha is playing a trick on us.</p>
<p>SITA <em>(angrily):</em> Lakshmana, you have come into the forest, and you are making everybody feel that you are my husband's greatest friend, his dearest brother. But you are a rogue, a rogue. Rama is in terrible danger, I feel it. And you don't want to leave me. Why? You have some immoral interest in me. If your brother dies, you are hoping to have me, you brute!</p>
<p><em>(Lakshmana covers his ears with his hands.)</em></p>
<p>LAKSHMANA: O Mother, be calm, please. Do not speak such awful words. Nobody in the world is like Rama. His life is quite safe. The voice that we have heard can never be the voice of my brother. It is a trick of that demon Maricha. Rama has posted me to look after you here. How can I disobey him?</p>
<p>SITA: Yes, Maricha is imitating Rama's voice and you are imitating Rama's character, his heart of wisdom and illumination. You rogue! You impostor! You fool! You have all darkness, all filth, all ignorance in your mind and in your heart! Leave me alone! You can't obey me even when your brother is dying? I know, I know what your secret intention is. I tell you, your dark dream will never be fulfilled. Go! You have your wife, Urmila. Why did she not come with us? Then she could have been with her husband. Why are you bothering me? Who has asked you to come here? Before I let you touch me, I shall throw myself into the River Godavari.</p>
<p>LAKSHMANA: Mother, I shall have to disobey my brother, then, in order to obey you. I am disobeying my brother to please you. Please be alert. I am marking a ring for you. Please do not go outside the boundary of this ring. This ring is the ring of protection.</p>
<p>SITA: Protection? I do not need your protection. You go and protect your brother. He needs your protection. He is dying, and here you are wasting time, delaying, so when you go there you will see that he is no more. Well, no harm. If he is gone I shall join him in the other world. This life of mine is not to be with you. You brute, you unthinkable creature, deceiving the whole world by pretending to be devoted, faithful, unconditionally surrendered to your brother! <em>(Lakshmana, shedding tears, draws a ring.)</em></p>
<p>LAKSHMANA: Mother, I go.</p>

<p><em>(Lakshmana is walking through another part of the forest in search of his brother.)</em></p>
<p>LAKSHMANA: O God, you know my heart. I adore Sita as my own mother. I have never even seen her face. I always keep my eyes on her feet, on the dust of her feet. Such adoration I have for her, such devotion! And she insults me. Is this my fate? The world is full of misunderstanding. Are all women of this type? No, it cannot be. My Urmila was shedding bitter tears when I left the palace with my brother. She wanted me to remain with her, but I came here to please my brother and myself. But who is pleasing her? O Urmila, the world will not know of your inner suffering, your divine sacrifice. But my heart of love will know. My heart of gratitude will know what you are doing in silence, through your tears, with your magnanimous heart. Eternally your Lakshmana will be grateful to you and proud of you. My outer life is not near you but my inner life is with you and for you.</p>

<p>SITA: O Saint, my husband is in danger. I have scolded his brother mercilessly, and he has at last gone to help him. He did not want to listen to me. He thought that I would be in danger here.

<p>RAVANA: Mother, you know that you are not in danger here. I am a saint. I have come here just to console you. I feel sure that your husband will come back safe. He is a great hero. Now Lakshmana is with him. Even if he is in danger, he will come back, Mother.</p>

<p>RAVANA: Threaten as much as you want to. Do you know that the sun subdues its scorching rays the moment I face it? The rivers suspend their flow the moment I stand in front of them. The forest foliage ceases to wave the moment I glance at it. Before me, your Rama is smaller than a puny insect.</p>
<p>SITA: You wretch, you rogue, you brute! What else can I expect from a <em>rakshasa?</em> Death is the only punishment you deserve, you braggart, and you will get it very soon. In your destruction the world will have a new life, a life of aspiration and perfection.</p>

You can't imagine the words she used. She literally forced me to come to you. The last thing she said was that she would throw herself into the River Godavari if I did not come to save you, so I came.</p>
<p>RAMA: Lakshmana, you did the right thing.</p>
<p>LAKSHMANA: I have listened to her and not to you, Brother. Now we may not see our dearest Sita again.</p>

<p><em>(Rama, Lakshmana and Sita return to Ayodhya after they have been in exile for fourteen years. Bharata receives them with boundless joy and love. There is a long procession as every person in the Kingdom comes to receive them. The whole Kingdom is in the seventh heaven of delight.)</em></p>
<p>BHARATA: Rama, you have come back. You have kept your promise. If you had not kept your promise, if you had broken your pledge, you would not have seen me here on earth in the land of the living. <em>(Touches Rama's feet.)</em> Here is your Kingdom, Brother. Now, as before, I shall be your loving brother and slave. I submit totally to your will.</p>
<p>RAMA: Bharata, you have shown your heart's magnanimity and your soul's nobility. You could have easily kept this Kingdom for yourself. You were the King, in accordance with Father's wish.</p>
<p>BHARATA <em>(interrupting):</em> No, never! Father's wish was that you would be King, not I. You fulfilled Father's promise to my undivine, hostile mother. Her undivine desire compelled you to suffer much. It doomed you to fourteen years of misery, and I suffered as well. Now the darkest night is over; it is all day. The light of joy, the light of progress and achievement has dawned at last. O Rama, you have come to fulfil Father's dream. Father's lofty hopes for you will now be manifested in this Kingdom on earth.</p>
<p><em>(The members of the royal family are all around. Urmila, the wife of Lakshmana, bows down to Rama and Sita, and then to her husband. While touching Lakshmana's feet, she sheds tears.)</em></p>
<p>LAKSHMANA: Urmila, why do you weep? I have come back to you. Today should be a day of enormous joy.</p>
<p>URMILA: My Lord, I am not weeping tears of sorrow I am shedding tears of joy. Your body left me, but not your soul. Your soul stayed inside my heart. Now I have your body and soul together with me again.</p>
<p><em>(Urmila sings.)</em></p>
<p><em>Nayane, nayane, gopane, gopane,</em><br /><em>Shayane, swapane, madhu jagarane,</em><br /><em>Jibaner dole, maraner kale</em><br /><em>Taba prema lila amar bhubane.</em></p>

<p>In secrecy supreme I see You.<br /> You live in my eyes,<br /> In my sleep, in my dreams,<br /> In my sweet wakefulness.<br /> In the stupendous mirth of life,<br /> In the abysmal lap of death,<br /> You I behold.<br /> Your love-play is my world.</p>

<p>URMILA: If you had remained here at the palace you would have done your human duty to me. But your soul wanted you to do your divine duty, which was to serve your dearest brother, Rama. He is all Divinity. He is the incarnation of <em>Dharma.</em> You left me to be of service to him. You have come back again only to be of service to him. But your presence gives me enormous joy. I shall have you around me. I shall be with you. When it is a matter of serving, the Divine comes first and foremost. You did the right thing. You are doing the right thing. And in your sacrifice my glory looms large. In your feeling of oneness with the divine Rama, my oneness with the divine Rama shines.</p>
<p>RAMA: Urmila, your silence when we left for the forest was deeply appreciated and admired by me. You sacrificed your husband in silence. Your life of silent sacrifice has touched the very depths of my heart. Your sacrifice springs from your divine wisdom. Your soul-stirring philosophy is absolutely correct. The Divine comes first, and not the human. I see your life of oneness with your husband, your life of inner wisdom. You are all for the cause of my divine manifestation on earth. Urmila, feel my heart's enormous delight and my soul's transcendental pride.</p>
