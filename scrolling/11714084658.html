<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything has to depend on prayer and meditation. Again, outer therapy is also of supreme need. Then, if you can take minor stretching exercises to strengthen the calf, it may help. But if the exercises create more pain for you, then I advise you to go to a therapist. Of course, the most important thing is the inner prayer. But it is like a boxer using two hands. With one hand you cannot do everything. God created medical science. You should take as much help from medical science as possible, and at the same time you have to think of our spiritual science, which is prayer and meditation. They have to go side by side. First, of course, since we are spiritual people, we have to give preference to the aspiration-aspect of life, and at the same time we have to give considerable importance to medical science. God is also operating in and through medical science.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does the New Millennium mean something for everybody on earth or just for those who are using a particular calendar?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does the New Millennium mean something for everybody on earth or just for those who are using a particular calendar?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The New Millennium is meant for everybody. When the light descends, it is like the morning sun, it is for everybody. No matter how bad we are, no matter how good we are, we receive the same light. The sun is for everybody, irrespective of our character. But then comes the question of our receptivity. Some will get up early in the morning, look at the rising sun and pray and meditate. Naturally they will get much more benefit, while others will enjoy their sleep. Again, there will be people who will be praying or doing things, but without caring for the sun's arrival.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the New Millennium starts, it is bringing new hope, new promise. But we have to know how wide we can keep our heart's door open to the light. The light is descending, but we have to cultivate receptivity. According to our receptivity, we are going to receive blessings from the New Millennium. Exactly like the sun, it is for all. But if one country or one individual is more receptive than the rest, then naturally that country or that person will receive much more.</p>
<p>Newness is definitely going to descend from Above with the arrival of the New Millennium. But it may be difficult to separate the oldness from the newness because we are so tied to our oldness. When newness appears, we may not value it. Since we are not familiar with it, we may take it as something very strange and we may not take as much help as we should from the newness.</p>
<p>Again, the calendar will say that the New Millennium is not in the year 2000; it is in the following year, 2001. But for me, the New Millennium has already started. The New Year's Message that I gave is not only for the year 2000. It applies to the following year as well, or even to quite a few more years. This time God's Hour has seriously struck. Sometimes in a theatre, a bell rings to indicate the end of the intermission. After three minutes it rings again, and after that nobody is allowed to come inside. In our spiritual life also, the warning may come once and then it may come again. But at times there is no second warning. Therefore, as soon as the first warning comes, we have to wake up. We must not wait for the second warning to arrive. We must wake up and run, run, run. We must run to the class to study.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: The other night you spoke about our plays that we perform for entertainment here on the Christmas trip. What can we do in our plays to please you more?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: The other night you spoke about our plays that we perform for entertainment here on the Christmas trip. What can we do in our plays to please you more?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What do I know about this kind of thing? Most of the time I do not even understand your English. How fast you speak! The only thing I can say is that sometimes when you are performing, it is not strictly spiritual. If it is innocent, then you are safe. But sometimes when you sing or do things, I see that from the very, very strict spiritual point of view, you are touching the unaspiring vital. Of all the parts of the being, the vital is the one that you have to be so careful of. The mind is the worst, true. But the vital is right below the navel, and a few inches above it is the heart. The vital quite often tries to steal the wealth of the heart. The vital is a thief, but it pretends to be a saint. It has two aspects: a dynamic aspect and an aggressive aspect. Unfortunately, we human beings do not know how to differentiate between them. Sometimes when you think that you are being very dynamic, you are not being dynamic at all. It is aggression. When there is dynamism, there is bound to be light, inner light. When there is aggression, there is no light. It is all darkness. It is as if ten elephants are fighting somewhere.</p>
<p>The other day some of our girl singers were imitating famous singers. They know they <em>can</em> enter into that consciousness, but once they enter into the consciousness of those famous singers, perhaps it will take a long time for them to come back to their own original consciousness. Again, who knows? I enjoy innocent skits, but on that day the songs were not so appropriate.</p>
<p>You are all so talented. I sincerely mean it. But when you touch the border of the vital, it is not helpful to your spiritual life. The vital is a very dangerous place, and at the same time its territory is very wide, unlimited. It is so vast, like the ocean. If you touch water, whether it is here or one thousand miles away, you will get the vibration or consciousness of water.</p>
<p>On the twenty-fourth of December, Christmas eve, when the Germans were singing with such simplicity, soulfulness and tenderness, I invoked the Saviour Christ. Everything can be done either in a mechanical way or in an ultra-modern fashion or in a simpler than the simplest way. Jesus Christ was simplicity incarnate. He was a carpenter's son. How simple, how humble he was! He was always giving us the message of simplicity and humility. Simplicity and humility cannot be separated. On that occasion, the German singers proved that you can sing these carols in a very simple way, without vital exuberance.</p>
<p>Most of the time when the boys' aphorism group performs, whether others get benefit or not, I get benefit, because that is my life — this devotional way that they perform most of the time. If people are sincerely watching and not making fun, they receive so much. When that particular group performs in New York, how much devotion they generate and how much disciples who are sincere seekers can benefit. I have written so many stories and plays where devotion can be expressed.</p>
<p>Three things I like. The first is devotion, which is the fastest speed. Then comes surrender, which carries you to your goal. Then this devotion and surrender need a foundation. That foundation is obedience. If there is no foundation, there can be no superstructure. Again and again I am saying, never take the word 'obedience' lightly. If your Master asks you to bring him a glass of water, immediately you have to bring him water. Immediately if you do not bring it, what will happen? Your mind will say, "Oh, he has told me to bring him a glass of water. Let me see if there is a beautiful flower. After all, he is a spiritual man, and my devotion will increase if I give him a beautiful flower. Silly water is not going to increase my devotion."</p>
<p>You can say that your today's disobedience is very minor, negligible, but I am seeing that if disobedience starts today, then you will get the results after thirty or forty or fifty years. Even before you joined the path, your inner being often told you to do something or not to do something. Before I came into your life, you did exist. Tomorrow when I kick the bucket, you will still exist. This matter is between you and your inner guide. At the age of five if you realised that something was wrong, you cannot say that just because for twenty or twenty-five years you have been doing the same wrong thing, that means it is not wrong. Unfortunately, this is what happens. At the age of five we started doing something wrong, and then at the age of forty we say, "I have been doing it all along, so it cannot be wrong." But no, this wrong force is only increasing and increasing in strength and power. Then when you are forty-five or fifty years old, it may act like a volcano.</p>
<p>Most of you joined the path at the age of seventeen, eighteen or twenty. But you have to know how many things you did contrary to your conscience prior to that. Just because you have now entered into the spiritual life, those things are not nullified. It is not automatic. For that you have to pray and meditate, meditate, meditate. You have to gain peace, light and bliss. Then only will you be purified.</p>
<p>If you just forget about all the wrong things that you have been doing for thirty or forty years, is it not going to tell upon your health or do something destructive in your life? Perhaps the hour has not yet struck. Perhaps the hour will strike when you are sixty years old. Let us say you started smoking at the age of ten. Then you go on doing it for twenty or thirty years, thinking that nothing is happening. When you are sixty, you will get the results of your smoking in the form of serious health problems. For forty or fifty years you may not be affected. But when you are sixty, you will see what has happened because you have been smoking for so many years. This happens in the spiritual life also. Once we know that something is harmful to our spiritual life, then we must not do it.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that once you have been on the path for many years, all the things that you wanted to conquer — jealousy, insecurity, impurity — if you have not conquered, then you feel it is impossible to conquer them. You have been fighting and fighting, but neither side is winning. Then you say, "All right, forget about it. Let ignorance win." When ignorance wins, it takes away your strength. Then you become its slave and ignorance utilises you for its own purpose. All the things that you wanted to conquer — jealousy, insecurity and all kinds of wrong forces — are forms of ignorance. First we try to come out of ignorance. But when we see that ignorance is stronger than we are, we surrender. Then ignorance gets us back and we become its soldiers. This is happening in almost all cases.</p>
<p>Because today we are doing something wrong and afterwards nothing happens, we think we can continue. We say, "I was a fool. I thought it was something harmful. Since nothing is happening, God's Hour did not strike." Recently I said that the Hour of God accepts no excuses. When that Hour of God will come, we do not know. The Hour of God we have forgotten about. That is why we continue doing the same wrong thing with so much confidence. We say, "I was mistaken. I thought that I was doing something wrong. If I am really doing something wrong, then how is it that I am not being punished?"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You were talking about the New Millennium and how, like in the theatre if you do not go inside at the third bell, then you cannot go inside any more. So for this New Millennium, God&#039;s Hour has struck. Can you speak more about this?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: You were talking about the New Millennium and how, like in the theatre if you do not go inside at the third bell, then you cannot go inside any more. So for this New Millennium, God&#039;s Hour has struck. Can you speak more about this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Hour has struck. Either you accept the divine in you or the undivine in you. They are both there. The undivine comes with such temptation. It is so beautiful, so glittering, so charming. Then you say, "How can it be undivine?" The divine, on the other hand, is very simple. So you turn towards the one that is charming and beautiful. Then afterwards you will say, "My God! This is such deception!" When Ravana came to kidnap Sita, he came as a saint. Then he showed his true form, how bad he was. When the hostile forces attack, they always come in a very charming form. We have to be so careful to dive deep within and see which forces are good and which forces are bad. Undivine forces can take a most beautiful form.</p>
<p>Most of you know the story of what happened when I was seventeen or eighteen years old. Usually I started meditating at seven minutes past two and continued for two or three hours. Once while I was meditating, a hostile force took the form of Lord Vishnu. It was most beautiful! It was absolutely Lord Vishnu's form. I was sitting cross-legged on my bed under a South Indian mosquito net. On my right side on the wall I saw Vishnu. How beautiful he was! For me to see Lord Vishnu was a tremendous thrill! But I had read and I also knew that when the cosmic gods or goddesses come in such an extremely beautiful form, you have to determine whether they are real or not. You have to exercise utmost purity from your central being. If your purity is less than those forms, then they are divine. But if your purity is stronger, more powerful, then they will be destroyed.</p>
<p>When you see a cosmic god, immediately you are supposed to touch his feet, but I did not do it. I brought forward my purity from my central being. Immediately the form of Vishnu burst. A thunderous sound it made! From across the street people came to see what had happened. Upstairs there were six or seven people, and downstairs there were people also. They all came rushing because they knew something had happened.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You said that when the New Millennium comes, the newness that can help us may take a form that we may not be able to recognise.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: You said that when the New Millennium comes, the newness that can help us may take a form that we may not be able to recognise." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our heart will recognise it if we have purity. Purity is the judge. If one is pure, extremely pure, that person will recognise it. Purity is the x-ray machine — physical purity, vital purity, mental purity, psychic purity. Nothing can stand against purity. Some people think that purity is something silly, feminine. Some people feel that we become pure just by changing clothes. But our mind is also like a dirty, filthy dress. We have to throw it away and put on something new. Then we become pure. Purity starts always in the consciousness.</p>
<p>The New Millennium is coming. For me and for my disciples it has already started. This New Millennium embodies hope and promise. You have to use your adamantine will-power and at every second choose either light or night. But night can come in a very charming, fascinating form. You have to know whether it is real light or night that is tempting you. People who are really innocent will get an extra supply of divine concern and divine power. But there are many who only pretend to be innocent. Somebody may be a rogue, but he will pretend to be innocent.</p>
<p>The New Millennium requires utmost seriousness. Whether we take God seriously or not, God is going to take us seriously. We may think that God is like our grandfather. No. From now on He is not going to act like a grandfather. He is going to be like a strict magistrate. He will use His Justice-Light. Compassion-Power He has used, Tolerance He has used, Concern He has used. But there is another aspect of God that we have not seen.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Lord Shiva is full of Compassion. If you give him only one leaf, that one leaf is enough to please him. To other cosmic gods you have to bring lots of beautiful and fragrant flowers. Lord Shiva's name is Ashutosh. 'Ashu' means 'speed'. So Ashutosh is one who is quickly satisfied. Other gods can take twenty years to be pleased. But in twenty seconds you can please Lord Shiva. Again, when he is angry, when he starts his thunder, which is his destruction-dance, he destroys everything. It may take only ten seconds to please Lord Shiva, but if the same Lord Shiva is displeased for one second, he can destroy us. Then to rebuild our spiritual life-energy may take twenty years.</p>
<p>This is Lord Shiva. On the one hand, he is kinder than the kindest. No cosmic god can come near him in terms of compassion and gifts. He can tolerate us indefinitely. If he is pleased with us, in the twinkling of an eye he can give us the vast ocean. But if he is annoyed, then there is no mercy. That is the aspect of God which we will see in the New Millennium.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: There is one line in the New Year&#039;s Message that is not clear to me. It says, &quot;Either we bind and blind the old world and retire, or we embrace the new world of the forward march.&quot; What do you mean by &quot;bind and blind the old world&quot;?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: There is one line in the New Year&#039;s Message that is not clear to me.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The old world blinded us and bound us. The old world tortured us, kept us in a lower than the lowest consciousness and punished us. The old world means anything unspiritual. So now if we want to have a tit-for-tat attitude, we can say, "You tortured me for so many years. Now that I am seeing the light, shall I bind you, shall I blind you, which you have been doing to me for years?"</p>
<p>The new world has come. The dawn of the new light has entered. Shall we go towards the light or towards the darkness that has punished us for millennia? Now the golden light has appeared right ahead of us. Shall we waste our time?</p>
<p>If we are wise, we will say to ignorance-night, "Forget about what you have done, whatever has happened between you and me." Ignorance-night has tortured us for centuries. Now we can bind it, we can blind it because the beckoning hand has come. Now we have so much power. Shall we waste our time destroying the one who wanted to destroy us, or shall we go and become the ocean of light, the ocean of peace, the ocean of bliss? We have to make the choice. Let us run towards Infinity's Peace, Light and Bliss.</p>
<p>In that line also I use the word 'retire'. It is like two boxers who strike each other mercilessly. Then they retire. It is all over. They do not want to play any more. If I have the capacity now to come out of darkness, shall I go and attack darkness? In that case, both players will have played, and they will have become exhausted. You defeated me; I defeated you. Now we are exhausted. The game is over.</p>
<p>Instead of that, with the new power that I have received, I can embrace the new world. I always say that with a knife we can stab someone or we can cut fruits to share with others. If somebody has stabbed me, then in return I can stab that person. But no, I will not do that. Instead of stabbing that person, I will throw away the knife.</p>
<p>If we are wise, then we will say, "Forget about what the old world has done to me." We are seeing that a new dawn has entered and we are not fools. We shall enter into the New Millennium — the new world of the forward march.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When you scold us, how can we accept it cheerfully?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When you scold us, how can we accept it cheerfully?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Recently I gave one prayer: "If You really love me, then prove it by scolding me." Even if we are not doing anything wrong, this prayer can be applicable because God knows that the next moment we may do something wrong. We may not have the vision to see it, but God does. Therefore, we can pray to God, "Please scold me. In the next moment I may do something wrong. So the best thing is if You scold me now so that I do not make that mistake."</p>
<p>When I scold you, seventy per cent of the disciples, if not more, do not take it properly. Outwardly they may say, "Oh, I am so grateful to you." Then they go home and say, "I have done so many good things in my life! Only one thing I have done wrong, and he is scolding me so mercilessly!" The other thirty per cent will be sincerely grateful to me because I pointed out their weakness or their shortcoming.</p>
<p>Recently I was scolding one of my main guards. You know how much I love him. On that day I barked at him like anything. Finally he said, "Guru, this time I am not the culprit, but I am sure I have done many, many other things wrong. Therefore I deserve your scolding." This was his divine attitude. Then, just a few days ago, another disciple did something wrong and he was challenging me. He was arguing with me face to face. There was no end to it. I was scolding him, and he was justifying his actions. But did he do the right thing? Look at the first one's divine attitude. He did not do it. Somebody else gave me the wrong information. Then he said, "I am not the culprit, but I am sure I have done many other wrong things or I am going to do something wrong." This was his divinity speaking. The other one got so angry! It is our divine attitude that will save us.</p>
<p>When a disciple becomes angry with me, it is the outer expression of inner arrogance. This arrogance comes when you lead an undivine, vital life. First it starts with disobedience. Then it becomes defiance. After defiance comes arrogance, insolence and betrayal. Disobedience ends only with betrayal. The whole thing starts with disobedience. Disciples who are unspiritual will argue with the Master. They will find fault with the Master. Everything that the Master is saying is not correct according to them. Those who are spiritual will not see anything wrong in the Master's advice, even when it applies to something in the outer life which they know far better than he does. They see that there is something very high, very deep that he is expressing in this way to test their faith in him. In hundreds of ways the Master tests the oneness of the disciples.</p>
<p>You all know the famous story of Lord Krishna and Arjuna. Lord Krishna said, "This fruit is not black; it is white." Then, the next moment, he changed the colour. Each time Lord Krishna said that the fruit was another colour, Arjuna agreed with him. Others were saying that Arjuna was either an idiot, a rogue or a flatterer number one. Yudhishthira and others, once they said the colour of the fruit, were not going to change their opinion. But each time Krishna changed, Arjuna changed. That is why others were saying that Arjuna was a flatterer of the first water or a rogue. But Arjuna was right. He said, "If I see the reality, whatever it is, in my Lord Krishna's own way, through his heart, through his eyes, then only will I realise God. For me, morality or reality is on this level. Who cares whether it is black or white or green or any other colour? If he wants me to see it as red, I will see it as red. Then only will I become inseparably one with him. Otherwise, what kind of inseparable existence do I have with my Master?" That is why Arjuna became the dearest disciple of Sri Krishna — because of his inseparable oneness.</p>
<p>If the Master says, "This is cold water," even if it is hot water, if you are wise, you will say, "Who cares if it is hot or cold? I want to be one with him inseparably. I will take it as cold water." Ordinary people will laugh at this approach. They will say that you are either a flatterer or a rogue. Those who say that it is impossible are in the mind. But our philosophy is to go beyond the mind. If you go beyond the mind, then you can establish your oneness with God's Will. If you want to be one with God's Will, then do not keep your own will. After all, what do you want — His Will or your own will? If you want your own will, then why did you accept the spiritual life? Who forced you? Who bound you? Who went to your house and dragged you? Who put chains around your legs and then brought you? You have your freedom. With your freedom you can say, "No, it is hot water." Then see how far you can go.</p>
<p>If the Master says it is cold water, it may be to examine how much inseparable oneness you have with his will. You may tell the Master, "I love you only. I want to fulfil you only in your own way. Let my will be your will." Then the Master may say, "My will says it is cold water." Then you may say, "Oh, he is an idiot. I am seeing that it is hot water!" Then you go your own way. Yes, it is hot water, true. But at that time do not say that you want to have inseparable oneness with your Master's will.</p>
<p>Here is the problem. The Master says one thing. You say the opposite because your mind is saying you are one hundred per cent right. On which level? On the level of the mind. But you have to go infinitely higher than that level. Otherwise, it is better not to accept spirituality. If you accept spirituality, only pray to God, "I want to see through Your Eyes. I want to feel through Your Heart." Everything has to be experienced in His own Way.</p>
<p>We pray to God, "I want to please You in Your own Way." Then, when God's representative comes, we say, "I want to please you in your own way only by not listening to what you say because my mind is saying you are wrong." If that is the case, then you stay with your great mind. But why torture your outer life by being in the Master's boat? Go your own way.</p>
<p>At every moment we are being examined. The way Arjuna had to change his mind, we have to change our minds. Each of us is a lump of clay. The Potter is constantly changing us. You may say, "Oh no, no, no! Why is He doing this?" But He has the liberty to change us because afterwards He is the one who will make us into something beautiful. So the real disciples are the ones who have the determination or the will to see things the way the Master sees them. These disciples are the ones who will pass the examination. Otherwise, if you choose to exercise your own freedom, you may be right in your own way. But I wish to say that if the Master has reached the Highest, if he embodies the Highest, and if the disciple does not try to see everything in the Master's own way, then that disciple is in trouble.</p>
<p>The message of the Saviour Jesus Christ was "Let Thy Will be done." He could easily have said, "I am suffering so much! The torture that I am going through in the crucifixion — how can it be Your Will?" But instead he said, "Let Thy Will be done." He became one with God's Will. That is why he became the Christ.</p>
<p>If your Master pinches you, you will say, "Oh, I thought you were a most kind-hearted person. How could you pinch me?" We judge the Master with our very limited mind. Forget about the Master. Your own highest divinity you are judging with your lower than the lowest intelligence or knowledge. Knowledge cannot go beyond a certain level. We can read thousands of books. A book can only prepare us a little to go to the Highest. A book can never take us to the Highest. A book can inspire us, like a guide. A guide shows us the way, but he is not the goal. So book knowledge shows us the way, but knowledge is not the goal. It is wisdom that can go higher than the highest, farther than the farthest, deeper than the deepest. Our wisdom will say that our highest divinity is always right.</p>
