  <h2 id="page-title">The Avatars</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Avatars" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What criteria can we use to identify an Avatar?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Once Vivekananda went to East Bengal, and there many disciples of different Masters came to him, begging him to go and visit their Master whom they claimed to be an Avatar. They would say, “Please come and see my Guru. He is undoubtedly an Avatar.” And the next moment another one would say, “My Guru is an Avatar. I know it. Please come and see him.” So he said that in East Bengal the Avatars grow like mushrooms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the Western world the word “Avatar” is not understood. Perhaps it will take quite a few years or even centuries to understand the word “Avatar" — forgive me for being so frank. There are some words that are so meaningful and so significant, and in the spiritual consciousness they are so difficult, that an ordinary person will never understand them. The word “Avatar” is one of those words, perhaps the most difficult word. You know how to spell it, but to realise the highest nature of the Avatar one must become almost a spiritual saint.</p>
<p>The difference between a Yogi and an Avatar is like the difference between an infant and a mature adult. One has to be on a very, very high standard of spiritual consciousness in order to get even the faintest glimpse of an Avatar. Sri Krishna was an Avatar, but only five persons recognised him. Sri Ramakrishna was an Avatar, and very few recognised him. The Christ was an Avatar, but very few people knew him. But even these Avatars are not of the same standard. You can recognise someone who is an inch or a few inches higher than yourself. You can recognise a sage, a saint or a Yogi. But a Yogi is infinitely superior to a sage or a saint. Yogi means one who is united with the highest. But an Avatar is a direct descendant of God, an incarnated portion of God which constantly operates in the Highest and in the lowest at the same time. The Yogis maintain a certain high level, and there they operate. If they go down from that level in order to raise humanity, they cannot function well and sometimes they are caught there; then they are lost. They maintain a certain level of consciousness and when others can approach that level, they can help them. In the case of an Avatar, he can remain in the Highest and in the lowest together, but when he operates at the lowest level, he is not affected by it.</p>
<p>An Avatar is a human being. He talks, eats and cuts jokes. But when he enters into his Highest, he goes far beyond your vision’s height. If you ever have even a little glimpse of the higher worlds to which an Avatar has a free access, you will feel that your whole life will be an object of complete surrender at the feet of your Master. Even if the Master kicks you or throws you out of his Centre, you will remain faithful to him, because you have received something from him that you know you will never be able to get from anyone else on earth.</p>
<p>When there is an Avatar on earth, he embodies the consciousness of all the other Avatars who have come into the world. When Sri Ramakrishna was on his deathbed and Vivekananda, his dearest disciple, was doubting him even at the last moment, at that time he said, “He who is Rama, he who is Krishna, in one form is Ramakrishna.” In the East it is easier to believe that Rama is inside me, Krishna is inside me, Ramakrishna is inside me, and other Avatars are inside me. In the West, unfortunately, we know only one Avatar, the Christ. Either we accept him or we reject him. If we accept him, then, according to the Church, there can be no other spiritual Master for us; but if we reject him, then perhaps we will pay attention to some other spiritual Master!</p>
<p>The Christ, the Buddha, Sri Krishna and all the great spiritual Masters came from the same divine Source. If we say that Christ is the only Saviour, then immediately one of Krishna’s disciples will say, “No, Krishna is the only Saviour.” Here the problem starts. We should feel that the Supreme is the only Saviour. It is He who entered into the form which we call Christ. He entered into the form of Krishna, into Ramakrishna, and so on. In that way we are all going to the Supreme. The ultimate is the Supreme. Like us, Krishna the Buddha and all the Avatars have come from Him, and we all have to go to Him.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not at all necessary to differentiate. They have come at different times, but they are all one. They are all God’s children in different forms. In this incarnation you have a name, and in your previous incarnation you had some other name. Even in this incarnation your mother calls you by one name, your husband by another name, your children by some other name, and perhaps we call you by still another name. But yet you are the same person. The spirit is one, but the forms are different. God is the Universal Spirit, but He is assuming different forms. Christ took a human body, human form. The Buddha has taken, Sri Ramakrishna has taken, Sri Krishna has taken, everybody has taken human form. When a soul enters a body, that soul has to manifest inner divinity. The great spiritual Masters manifested, but still you have not manifested. So in spirit we are all one, but in forms we have become many. In this way there can be a divine game.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between the consciousness that the Buddha attained and that which the Christ attained?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between the consciousness that the Buddha attained and that which the Christ attained?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Forgive me for saying this, but to know what Jesus Christ achieved or did not achieve will not help you in the least. What matters is whether you are trying to grow into the very image of the Christ. Only that will help you. To know what the Christ achieved, what the Buddha achieved, will be of no avail to you. Only if you are trying to grow into the Christ’s consciousness or the Buddha’s consciousness, will that help you. Again, there comes a time when you have to go beyond even that. You have to feel that God took a particular soul and brought it into the world with an outer form. He called one Christ and another one Buddha. God wanted those particular souls to play the role of the Christ and the Buddha. He wants you to play the role of somebody else.</p>
<p>God wants to play in and through everyone in a unique manner. These great souls have played the role of divine lions let us say. Now God wants you to act like a tiny insect. By acting like lions, they have fulfilled their roles most satisfactorily. In your case, if God wants you to be an insect, then if you play the role of an insect most satisfactorily, God will be highly pleased. He will not ask you, “Why didn’t you play the role of a lion?” He asked you to play the role of the insect, and He does not expect you to do otherwise. Each soul has to play his own role. The Christ, the Buddha, Sri Krishna — they have played their roles successfully just because they were God’s conscious instruments. They are still playing their roles inwardly on earth. Now we seekers have to play our roles. If we do not play our roles, then God will remain unfulfilled and unmanifested.</p>
<p>In India some spiritual Teachers tell their disciples: “Don’t use the terms ‘Infinity’ ‘Immortality’ and ‘Eternity.’ Just think of where you are.” I am telling you the same thing. Do not bother yourself with the Christ’s consciousness or the Buddha’s consciousness. Deal with your own consciousness. Are you aspiring? If you are, then God is most pleased with you. In no way am I trying to discourage you or anybody. But out of curiosity you want to know quite a few things, and these things eventually stand in your way. Right now, if you think of the goal that they have reached, you will be totally lost.</p>
<p>In India many people have gone mad by thinking all the time of the Buddha’s realisation, Krishna’s realisation or Ramakrishna’s realisation, instead of starting the real way, by meditating. By thinking constantly of Krishna’s realisation or the Buddha’s realisation, they convinced themselves that they had attained Krishna’s consciousness or the Buddha’s consciousness. When they thought they had attained that consciousness, they became insane. There were many in Bengal who had physical strength, vital strength, mental strength, so they just thought all the time of Vivekananda until they felt that they were another Vivekananda. Then, when they were examined or tested, when they faced the world, they found that they were the most insignificant creatures.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life it is always better to make progress step by step. When you have gone high, very high, then you will be able to see the Buddha’s consciousness and the Christ s consciousness. But right now it is useless for you to think of these things. It will only confuse you.</p>
<p>The marathon race is more than twenty-six miles long. At the moment the starter fires the gun, if the runner thinks that after twenty-six miles he will reach the goal, he will be totally disgusted. “I have to run twenty-six miles!” he will think; then he will just give up. No, while he is running, he has to think that he is covering a quarter mile, a half a mile, a mile, and so on. If he thinks that he has to reach the goal all at once, the moment he starts, he will be disheartened. He will say it is impossible. If a kindergarten student thinks of his Master’s degree while he is learning the alphabet, then it is impossible. If he thinks he has to get his Master’s degree as soon as possible, he will just go crazy. But if he feels that now he is in kindergarten, tomorrow he will be in primary school, then high school and so on, then he will have constant inspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is only the Avatars who don’t take so many incarnations. But there are some exceptions, even among spiritual Masters. Look at the Buddha. He went through so many incarnations in the animal life and the human life. But other spiritual Masters did not go through so many; they did not want to enjoy this world so many times.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A portion of the Avatar’s inner consciousness will know, but his conscious mind may not know. Only when the mind receives some light will he be able to know, and for that human incarnation is necessary. Unless you know something with the mind, you cannot be aware of it consciously. In the animal consciousness there is no mind.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What will happen if followers of the Christ or the Buddha or other great ascended Masters meditate with you?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Christ and the Buddha are spiritual Masters of the highest magnitude. I happen to be a spiritual Teacher also. Now spiritual Teachers, if they are really spiritual, are absolutely one. They come from the same family. Once Sri Ramakrishna told his beloved disciple Vivekananda, “He who is Rama, he who is Krishna, in one form is Ramakrishna.” Once one becomes a realised soul, one becomes part and parcel of the universal Reality. The disciples of the Christ and disciples of the Buddha, if they are true disciples, will have no problem meditating with me in the public meditations, for I am not taking them away from the Christ Consciousness or the Buddha Consciousness. On the contrary, on the strength of my own divine inseparable oneness with the Buddha and the Christ, I can help them reach their Beloved.</p>
<p>I am here on earth as a messenger boy. I tell the staunch Catholics and votaries of other great ascended Masters that they need to go through the secretary in order to approach the boss. If they want to have an appointment with the Master, they must take help from the servant or secretary. It is the servant who will open the door for you, and the secretary will make the appointment. These people can take me as a secretary or a servant. After helping them to approach their Master, my role is over. I will never disturb their interview. Again, if someone is a very close disciple of the Christ or the Buddha, if he had a most intimate connection with these Masters in a previous life, then he may be able to go directly to them. If you are most intimate with the boss, then you don’t have to take help from his servant. But these cases are very, very rare.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How does your path differ from that of Sri Ramakrishna?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How does your path differ from that of Sri Ramakrishna?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All paths ultimately lead to the to the same goal, and both Sri Ramakrishna’s path and my own path are the path of love, devotion and surrender. But there are some subtle differences. Sri Ramakrishna said that you do not have to read any books; he said that all will come from within. Sri Ramakrishna did not care for the mind at all. He said, “No mind! Just cry, cry!” It is true that the supreme Wisdom, the supreme Knowledge, comes from within. But since God has given us the mind, I feel that we have to utilise it to some extent by reading inspiring and uplifting books written by the real spiritual Masters. But again, the mind is imperfect and I wish my disciples to go beyond the mind. Sri Ramakrishna’s path and our path will never run into any conflict. He is a very great spiritual Master and I have utmost love and admiration for him. I have written a play and quite a few articles about Sri Ramakrishna. A few years ago, for Vivekananda’s Centennial, I wrote twelve articles on Swami Vivekananda and Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>I have never said that our path is superior to somebody else’s. No, far from it. But if you want to know the differences, I can find some little differences. I appreciate Sri Ramakrishna’s love, devotion and surrender. But I also say that we have to use the mind to a certain extent. Vivekananda, his dearest disciple, utilised the mind when he came to the West. Vivekananda was intellectually a giant. So there is always a compromise. Sri Ramakrishna did not care to study and he could hardly even write his name. But he embodied the highest Truth.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna used to worship Mother Kali, the Divine Mother. He used to adore the Highest in the feminine form. He used to feel the Divine Mother in his own highest consciousness. But he would not allow his disciples to mix with women. He told his male disciples to shun women. He really felt that this was best for his disciples. Most of our Indian spiritual Masters have asked their men disciples not to mix with women at all, and they have asked the women disciples not to mix with men. But in my philosophy, I say that men and women are both God’s children and they have to go together. One complements the other. But again, there is no basic difference between my path and Sri Ramakrishna’s. There are only subtle differences.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between your path and the Sufi path?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between your path and the Sufi path?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Sufi light and the path that we follow are similar. The Sufi path is a path of love, and ours also is a path of love. I am not well-versed in Sufism, but I can tell you about our path. In our path, the divine lover tries to become inseparably one with the supreme Beloved. But it will be a mistake if we say that we always remain a divine lover and the Beloved always remains the Beloved. The lover divine and the Beloved Supreme play hide-and-seek and change their respective roles. The lover cries for the Beloved then the lover becomes the Beloved. When the lover cries for the Beloved and the Beloved gives him a smile, the lover’s satisfaction dawns. He is fulfilled. Again, when the Beloved sees that the lover is crying for Him, for their total oneness, at that time He is satisfied and fulfilled. But this cry that He wants to see in the lover is not the cry of inferiority. No, it is only the feeling of inner oneness expressed in another form. It can be expressed through smile and also through cry. The cry and the smile are like the obverse and reverse of the same coin. When there is a cry from the earth-consciousness and a smile from the Heaven-Consciousness, God the Revealer is complete and God the Fulfiller is complete.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Are you aware of what is happening simultaneously on all planes?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Are you aware of what is happening simultaneously on all planes?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I can be aware of what is taking place simultaneously on all the planes, but it usually is not necessary. However, I always have a general idea of what is happening on all the planes. It is like a house. If I am in one room, then I am aware of everything that is happening there; but I can also have a general idea of what is taking place in the other rooms. But if I am working on a particular plane in order to help my disciples, I am more aware of what is going on on that plane.</p>
<p>When it comes to my disciples’ lives, is there anything in which I am not involved? If one disciple suffers because of the conduct of another disciple, eventually it is I who become the sufferer. “I am not involved ”. These are the words I use, but in actuality it is I who suffer. I say, “Don’t bother me, don’t bother me,” but when something goes wrong, I know how much I suffer. My suffering is absolutely unbearable when a disciple sincerely suffers.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Some disciples live a long way away. What is the significance of their coming to see you and being in your physical presence?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Some disciples live a long way away. What is the significance of their coming to see you and being in your physical presence?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, the disciples who come from a distance to see the spiritual Master are acting with divine wisdom. The Master is in the physical and the disciple is in the physical. Most of the time our physical consciousness has to be convinced of what is happening. In the inner world we experience peace, light and bliss, but when we open our human eyes, our earthly eyes, we do not see anything. Then we feel miserable. But if we can experience the same truth — the same peace, light and bliss — with our outer senses, then we get boundless joy. The spiritual and the physical must play together wherever possible. If the disciple is at a distance, he should make it a point to see the Master as often as possible because the Master’s physical presence helps to convince the disciple’s physical mind. Otherwise, the physical revolts. Then it becomes a deplorable case of out of sight, out of mind. If the disciple has firmly established his inseparable oneness with the Master, only then is it altogether different. But if circumstances permit the disciple to come to the Master, then he should always come.</p>
<p>The necessity here is very simple. The possessor of infinite light, peace and bliss has to be seen with the physical eyes if it is at all possible. If we appreciate the paintings of an artist in the museum, then if we see the artist, we get tremendous joy. If we see a poet whose poems we have all along appreciated and admired, we get additional joy. Capacity and the possessor of that capacity, the creator and the creation, both give us joy. We are extremely happy when we observe the creation of God: trees, rivers, sky, mountains, all of nature’s beauty. But what is the aim of our appreciation? In the creation we want to see God the Creator, the Possessor and Source of the beauty that we see all around us. So the disciple should come to see the Master if he feels in the Master all the divine qualities. When he prays and meditates, he experiences these capacities and qualities of the Master inwardly. But if he sees the Master on the physical plane, face to face, then he experiences these qualities outwardly as well.</p>
<p>Again, this does not mean that for twenty-four hours a day he has to be in front of the Master. On the physical plane some of the disciples live close by me, while others live at a distance. Those who live nearby undoubtedly get additional opportunities to make progress. Inwardly and outwardly if an individual can become close to the Master, then he makes the fastest progress. But people who live a far distance are lucky in some ways because they do not go through some of the sufferings which the disciples who are nearer endure. If I smile at a particular disciple and not at you, immediately you may become a victim to jealousy. Right now, even if I look at your own wife, if you do not have a feeling of oneness, immediately you think, “Guru gave my wife a broad smile, but he didn’t smile at me.” Then you become jealous. If you are one with her, then of course you will feel that you have also received a smile from me. If you are developed spiritually, your oneness gives you complete satisfaction. But if you are in Australia, then you cannot see if I am smiling at someone else. So to be in the physical presence of the Master can be a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Another advantage or benefit of being away from the Master is that inwardly you are practising spiritual life and trying to establish an inner connection with him. Then, when you see him on the physical plane, at that time you will have the golden opportunity to convince your physical mind of what you inwardly feel so strongly already.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I believe that there is only one Saviour, and that is Jesus Christ. So how do you fit into the picture?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I believe that there is only one Saviour, and that is Jesus Christ. So how do you fit into the picture?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All right; your Saviour is a very great man. Since he is a great man, naturally he has some servants. Let us say that I am his servant. You do not know where this great man lives or how to approach him, but I do. Although I may be only his servant, I know where the Master lives, where he is seated and what he is doing, and I can take you to see him. You cannot see him without my help or the help of another one of his servants.</p>
<p>Do you think that you can just knock at the door, and the Master himself will come and open the door for you? No, the Master will not answer the door unless you have a very, very powerful inner connection with him. But I will come to the door. I will look at you, and if I am not pleased with your sincerity or your aspiration, then I will know that he will not have any interest in seeing you. But if you please the servant, I will go and tell the boss that somebody very nice wishes to see him. Since I am so pleased with you, naturally he will say, “All right, let me see this man whom you are talking about.” So I will bring you to him, and then my role is over.</p>
<p>But what if the great gentleman who is Christ scolds you at that time? When I take you to him, he may say to you, “You fool! Two thousand years ago I had one name and one form. Do you think that I will continue with the same name and the same form forever? Two thousand years ago I came in one body, in one consciousness. Do you think that I cannot change?</p>
<p>“You change your body repeatedly; you change your apartment every few years. You have to change. Have I no right to change? For two thousand years shall I continue with the same form, same body, same name, same garment, same consciousness? I should and I must change. To do so is to progress. I have changed my body: I have changed my name. Your soul knows that this person who calls himself my servant is representing me on earth. The name may be different, the form may be different, the consciousness may be different: but the Source is the same and the capacity is the same. He represents my real reality on earth. So why do you have to make your job more difficult by trying to approach me in Heaven when you can easily approach my brother who is on earth, and inside him find me?”</p>
