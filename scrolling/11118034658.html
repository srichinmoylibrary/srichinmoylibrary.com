<p>A few months ago I was running three miles in a park near Union Turnpike. At one point I threw off my hat, and X ran and picked it up. Today when I was running a one-mile race in Eisenhower Park, my hat fell off. Like father, like daughter: Y immediately ran and picked it up.</p>

I did not know outwardly that today Niriha had taken a videotape of my running to show Craig Virgin at the New York Marathon clinic so that he could analyse my style. I was answering his question, and he was solving my problems! This is how things go together in the soul's world.</p>

<p>For one week before the race, the New York Marathon creates such a sensation in New York City. Everybody knows that sixteen thousand people will run. There will be a sea of people flooding the streets.</p>
<p>Of course, since we are not the organisers, we are full of joy and excitement instead of suffering from headaches. Someday we should have sixteen thousand people in one of our races!</p>

<p>This week I ran along the New York Marathon route twice, going by car to different sections of the course. The first time, we went from the start to the thirteen-mile point so that I could run all the hills. Between the eighth and ninth mile is the worst hill. It is 1,200 metres long.</p>
<p>When I was in South Brooklyn, between the third and fourth mile, I saw a Puerto Rican gang that had been challenged by a black gang. The blacks were coming from behind me, and the Puerto Ricans were coming toward them. There were about four or five on each side, and I was running in between them!</p>
<p>The blacks had on the proper uniform â€” all black. I was wearing a dark navy blue sauna suit that also looked black.</p>
<p>One of the Puerto Ricans showed the blacks such a big knife! I just smiled to myself and kept running, because I knew that the knife was not meant for me. The boys on the road crew also saw the knife. Dhanu got the shock of his life. What an experience!</p>

<p>When we returned to the New York Marathon route on the second day, I started at the 17-mile point and ran to the 26th mile, again running only the hills.</p>
<p>Central Park was the worst. As soon as I entered the park, there were only hills going on, going on. During the marathon, once you come to Central Park you think you can heave a sigh of relief because you are almost finished. But O God, there it is all hills!</p>

<p>This year the water stations in the New York Marathon were peculiar. They didn't put them at every mile.</p>
<p>During the marathon people are always very nice. The spectators always give out oranges, ice and donuts. At one point this time it seemed that people were giving out tissues. At first I couldn't understand why everybody was grabbing the tissues. Then I saw what they were. They were sticks of gum.</p>

<p>They were very nice. They were giving the runners water and juice. Unfortunately, their fingers were inside the water. Twice after taking water from them and thanking them, I started running without drinking because the water was so filthy. Each mile I drank water from the water stations, but not the water that children were giving out.</p>

<p>I was so surprised that at least twenty people recognised me during the marathon. Even from the second mile people recognised me. My number was not listed in the marathon book because I got it late, and I was wearing something over my Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team singlet. Even so, at one point two or three black girls recognised me and called out, "Guru!" They were not my disciples.</p>
