<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You do not have to waste your precious time on earth to prove something which has no value in your life. Only you have to prove that you are a projection of God’s transcendental Vision. God’s transcendental Vision projects each and every human being. You can use the word ‘projection’ or ‘manifestation’. Spiritual seekers and spiritual Masters have to prove in their own life that they are a projection of God’s transcendental Vision. They do not have to prove it to others, but in their own life of aspiration and dedication they must prove it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, philosophy is dry. This is what we hear from people, and also this is what we have heard from our forefathers. Philosophy on the mental level is dry, drier, driest. But philosophy on the heart-level or psychic level can be very, very sweet. It is how we express philosophy that is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>Philosophy means love of wisdom. A man of wisdom can express his wisdom with bombastic words and sesquipedalian sentences, and make the person who is listening to him think that philosophy is extremely complicated. Again, if a grandfather is speaking to his grandchild, that same sublime philosophy he will be able to speak about in a few words, with such affection and concern. When philosophy is expressed with affection and concern, it can become very, very soft, tender, sweet and thrilling. But when we use the mind to express something — whether it is philosophy or any other subject — that subject becomes dry because the mind embodies dryness. Since the mind embodies dryness, whatever comes from the mind will automatically be dry. But if the heart expresses the same truth, then definitely it can be thrilling.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely. Not only have some people received a promotion from philosophy to spirituality, but they have eventually become spiritual giants. Sri Aurobindo himself said that he began as a poet; then he became a philosopher; then he became a spiritual aspirant and then he became a great spiritual Master. Vivekananda was also deeply immersed in philosophy. In his student days, he studied Western philosophers in great depth. He used to argue with people extensively based on his philosophical knowledge and wisdom. Then he turned to spirituality. Similarly, there are many who had a philosophical background at the beginning, and then they entered into spirituality and became great spiritual figures.</p>
<p>In my case, poetry, philosophy, spirituality and yoga — everything — went together, so that I could become a jack of all trades, master of none! When I was young, poetry entered into my life, and by the age of twenty-two or twenty-three, I had studied almost all the Western philosophers. By the age of twenty-five I knew a considerable amount of Western philosophy. But now I pray to God to remove even the little I remember of Western philosophy from my mind. Now I pray to God: “Do not keep philosophy inside my mind. Keep only spirituality.”</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Eastern philosophy, specially Indian philosophy, tells us: “Dive deep within. You will discover a springboard. If you jump on the springboard, you will be able to go high. Dive deep within in order to climb high, higher, highest.” This is the Eastern way of philosophy.</p>
<p>Western philosophy does not urge us to follow that way. Western philosophy is like a troop of marching soldiers. It tells us: “Go forward, forward.” Western philosophy starts with physical, vital and mental strength. But Eastern philosophy, Indian philosophy, starts from something deeper. You can call it the heart or the soul.</p>
<p>So Eastern philosophy dives deep within in order to climb up high, higher, highest. Western philosophy tells us to go forward or, on rare occasions, to go upward. But it does not dive inward like Eastern philosophy. This is the great difference.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The contribution of philosophy in the process of evolution is considerable. Although philosophers cannot prove the existence of the other world, they have spoken about it. When we feel that this world is full of suffering and there is no way to reduce it, then we can find tremendous consolation in philosophy.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there are still millions and billions of truths that have not been expressed outwardly, but they will definitely be expressed at God’s choice time. It is not that man will never be able to express them outwardly, no. It is simply that there are countless secrets which God does not want to be revealed untimely. If you do anything untimely, you will not get the proper result. If you eat a mango that is not ripe, you will not get the same delicious taste. It is not sweet at all. There is a choice hour for everything. When the time comes, God will reveal the truth. No truth in God’s creation will remain unrevealed or unmanifested. The truths that are now hidden or kept safe in the inner worlds, at God’s choice Hour will come to the fore, and they will be able to express themselves. But now if they are revealed, they will create serious problems for man’s present understanding of truth and light.</p>
<p>There is a time for everything. If we do something untimely, instead of giving us illumination, it will only create more confusion. We know that a little child may eventually get a Master’s degree. But now he is ready only to learn the alphabet. Knowing that one day he has to study higher courses, will you bring him the Ramayana or the Mahabharata to read now? His parents may say, “If he studies the Ramayana and Mahabharata, then he will become a great pandit. The whole world is there inside these two sacred books.”</p>
<p>But now that little child is not ready. His receptivity is so limited. He knows only the letters A and B. If the parents compel him to study those big books, they will not be doing the right thing. Similarly, only when God asks them to reveal those secrets will the cosmic gods and others who are holding the truths inside us unlock the doors. Then we will be able to utilise those sublime truths or secrets in our day-to-day life for our own purpose.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the ultimate limit of philosophy?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the ultimate limit of philosophy?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When philosophy comes to a point where it can say, “I do not know, I cannot know,” that is the ultimate limit. It is when a philosopher is sincere enough to say, “I do not know and I cannot know because whatever the mind has, I have got from the mind. Now the mind does not have anything more in stock for me.” As long as the mind says, “I know, I can know, I will be able to know,” then it has not yet reached its limit. The ultimate limit is when the mind confesses: “ I do not know, and I will not be able to know the unknown or the unknowable because the method that I am using is not good enough for me to enter into another world.”</p>
<p>We often say that ignorance is bliss. In this case, it is absolutely true. When I confess that I do not know the unknowable, that even the unknown I cannot know, then I have reached philosophy’s ultimate limit. At this point, philosophy has to throw itself into the infinite ocean of wisdom and say, “I am throwing myself because I know nothing.” That is the ultimate height. At that time philosophy does not remain philosophy as such. It becomes spirituality. It surrenders to something unknown or unknowable. That unknown is a reality. When we enter into that world, we discover that it is full of light and bliss. But in the beginning we have to take it as the unknown and unknowable.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can philosophy prove God’s existence?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can philosophy prove God’s existence?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Nobody can prove God’s existence for each and every human being. You can prove God’s existence for a handful of individuals by saying something or by doing something divine, but you will not be able to convince each and every human being. Somebody will show some miracles, and then he will say to others that he has proved that God exists. Others will say, “What has God to do with that miracle?” Then a third party will come and say, “I do not know if it is a miracle or not. I do not need miracles. I need only God.”</p>
<p>Many people believe in God when a miracle takes place. The Saviour Lord Jesus Christ performed forty-six or forty-seven miracles. By showing miracles, how he drew the attention of so many people, thousands and thousands of people! Other spiritual Masters also have done it. Again, sincere people will say that miracles are like fireworks. They go up only to come down or disappear.</p>
<p>Aside from philosophy, there are many branches of life that try to prove God’s existence. All the branches of life together will not be able to prove God’s existence. God’s existence can only be proved by spirituality and yoga. Through spirituality and yoga we experience oneness with God, oneness with God’s Will. Usually people who try to prove God’s existence do not do so on the strength of their oneness with the Divine. They feel they have the capacity to prove it with mental arguments and so forth. As they say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Similarly, God’s existence can be properly proved only by those who have realised God. God will tell the God-realised souls to show God’s existence only to those seekers who are eager, extremely eager. God’s existence is not shown by talking, but by becoming. If somebody has already become God-realised, then that person has the capacity to help others become God-realised.</p>
<p>If you use spirituality, then God’s existence can easily be proved the way Sri Ramakrishna proved God’s existence to Vivekananda. When he was a teenager, Naren (Vivekananda) went to so many places, asking, “Have you seen God?” He used to go to all spiritual figures and religious people in the Bengal area. He would ask each one the same question, “Have you seen God?” They would answer, “Oh no, no, no, I have not seen God.” At least they were sincere.</p>
<p>Then, when he came to Rabindranath Tagore’s father, again Naren asked, “Have you seen God?” Tagore’s father answered, “No, I have not seen God, but I can see that you have the eyes of a yogi. You will be able to see God.” Tagore’s father was a very spiritual person. By virtue of his own spiritual height, Tagore’s father saw the potentiality, the capacity, the future Vivekananda in this young boy’s eyes.</p>
<p>At last Naren came to Sri Ramakrishna. When he asked, “Have you seen God?” the Master answered, “Yes, I have seen God. I can see God more clearly than I see you right in front of me.” Then Naren became Sri Ramakrishna’s disciple.</p>
<p>Naren begged Sri Ramakrishna to give him very high inner experiences. A few months later, Sri Ramakrishna touched him and granted his wish. Naren was transported to a very high state of consciousness. As he felt himself going into that state, Naren cried out, “Oh, what are you doing? What are you doing? I have my father. I have my mother. I have to take care of my family.”</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna said to Naren, “For so long you have begged me for this experience. You wanted to know if God exists, and you wanted higher experiences. I am giving them to you.” Then after two or three hours Sri Ramakrishna took that experience away and Naren became once more the same human being.</p>
<p>So to prove God’s existence, the only way is spirituality, not philosophy.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, but not the philosophy of the mind. If you take philosophy as a way of life, then that way of life has to come from your inner aspiration and inner guidance. When your inner guide tells you something, then you must take it as something most important in your life. Your inner guide will tell you how to live on earth and be of service to God and to mankind.</p>
<p>If you take the word philosophy and put it inside your heart, then you will see that the philosophy of the heart, the inner philosophy, is absolutely necessary and extremely important.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, no, no. When a realisation comes to us through our inner aspiration, although we may express it verbally, it is not considered philosophy. It is only an expression or revelation of our inner experience. First we become aware that we are the embodiment of peace, light and bliss and all divine qualities. Then we reveal these qualities. It is like a seed which germinates and becomes a plant. Then it becomes a tree. Then it produces flowers and fruits.</p>
<p>In the same way, our inner realisations come slowly, steadily and unerringly from our aspiration or through our aspiration. Then, when we express them, it is not philosophy. We are only trying to offer the reality that we have felt or that we have grown into, not in terms of philosophy, but in terms of a particular language. No philosophy is involved there.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us speak about the power of philosophy. I strongly feel that in former times — thirty, forty, fifty or even one hundred years ago — people studied more philosophy than now. Nowadays people spend all their life in exercising their supremacy: how we can go and drop a bomb on your country. Now people are not inspired by philosophy, they are no longer interested in philosophy.</p>
<p>Anything under the sun, once it has come into existence, will last. But sometimes it only prospers in a few places. In those days there were the Greek philosophers. Now where is that Greek spirit? There were many philosophers in the Renaissance era. Where can we find another galaxy of immortal philosophers like those?</p>
<p>I do feel that philosophy as a subject will last, but the question is whether people will give it the same kind of importance as they gave it one hundred or two hundred years ago. Now we do not give philosophy the same importance. Poetry has suffered the same fate. In those days the world used to give more importance to poetry. Now the world gives more importance to music. Every kind of music has become important. You can see how many people are drawn to music, whether it is spiritual music or devotional music or classical music or rock and roll. Music draws people because music is closer to us. Some music stimulates our vital. Some music brings to the fore our own divinity. But the music-world has become more prominent than any other means that we use to express our divinity.</p>
<p>So philosophy will continue to remain for two hundred or four hundred years, but the question is, how much power will it have at that time? That is another subject altogether. But philosophy will not be deleted from the tablet of world history.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Western philosophy says, “Truth there is. You can see the Truth.” Eastern philosophy says, “No doubt, Truth there is. One can not only see the Truth, but also feel the Truth and become the Truth.” Western philosophy does not go that far. Western philosophy says, “Truth is there, somewhere high, very high. It is accessible, but not always.” Eastern philosophy says, “Truth is always accessible. Truth can be achieved, and then one can grow into Truth.” Here Eastern philosophy has made bold to say that one can become Truth. Western philosophy has not come so far.</p>
<p>Again, just to say that the Truth exists — either on this earth planet or in some other world — is one of the great contributions of Western philosophy to the evolution of mankind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The philosophy of the mind can only satisfy the mind. This satisfaction is not real satisfaction at all because the mind is always dividing and dividing and multiplying and multiplying, doing all kinds of addition and subtraction. But the philosophy of the heart is only oneness, oneness, oneness. There you do not count or multiply or subtract. Only you try to become one with a particular reality. In that way you can satisfy your entire being.</p>
<p>The mind will look at a brick wall and immediately start scrutinising it. It will calculate how many bricks were needed to make this wall, what quantity of sand and so forth. But the heart does not calculate. It will only look at the wall and try to identify with it. This is the difference between the philosophy of the mind and the philosophy of the heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a single philosophical reply that will answer all questions?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a single philosophical reply that will answer all questions?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we adopt the approach of Ramana Maharshi, then we can say, “Who am I?” That is the most significant question and at the same time the most significant answer. For me, “Who am I?” is not only the question of questions, it is also the answer of answers. When you ask the great spiritual Masters, “Who am I?” then the question is answered also. Ramana Maharshi’s philosophy was always to ask, “Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?”</p>
<p>“Who am I?” is a question. Again, “Who am I?” is also the answer, because immediately the answer comes, “Who am I not?” The positive and negative always go together. The question is coming as challenging, but inside the question is the answer: Is there anything that I am not? Is there anyone that I am not?</p>
<p>Ultimately, all the questions that philosophy asks can be reduced to “Who am I?” Then the reply comes spontaneously, “Who am I not?” The question and the answer may be found at the same place.</p>
