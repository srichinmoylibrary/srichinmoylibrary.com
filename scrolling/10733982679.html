 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What is the difference between an ordinary learning situation and spiritual study?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The life of a dedicated student and the life of a dedicated seeker are similar. A student goes to a teacher and the teacher teaches him. Similarly, a seeker goes to a spiritual Master and learns from him the subject of God-realisation. In the outer life, a student goes to school. There he sees his teacher in the physical and his teacher also sees him in the physical. Then the teacher and the student fulfil their mutual tasks of teaching and learning. But this is all done on the physical plane. But in the case of a seeker and a spiritual Master, the teaching and learning can take place outwardly or on the inner plane, or on both planes. The teacher can inwardly offer the message of how to concentrate, meditate and contemplate. He offers the message to the soul, if he has to do it inwardly, and the soul conveys the message to the mind, to the vital and to the physical of that particular seeker.</p>
<p>As an ordinary student we need a teacher on the outer plane to expedite our journey. The books are all available, but when we buy the books and start reading, we are not convinced by what we read; or we do not completely understand it. But when we go to a teacher, the teacher explains the thing and we are convinced. In the spiritual life also there are many spiritual books that may give us inspiration. But real aspiration grows when we go to a spiritual Master who can teach us inwardly or outwardly how to aspire. The teacher convinces the seeker of his own aspiration. Otherwise, doubt may at any moment assail him. He may get a very good, very high, sublime experience; but doubt may enter into him and convince him that it was all rubbish, just sheer imagination. Again, he may have some mental hallucination and think that he has achieved absolutely the highest possible realisation. But afterwards his life will again become a life of frustration. If there is a spiritual Master, he will immediately tell the seeker whether his experiences are founded on reality or on falsehood. In this way the student gets constant help from the Master so that he can run the fastest toward the goal, without having any misconceptions about his progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can an individual be consciously surrendered without having first realised the state of being that allows him to be freed from all effort?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can an individual be consciously surrendered without having first realised the state of being that allows him to be freed from all effort?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A seeker can and must first surrender totally and unconditionally to God if he is to get realisation. If he cannot or does not do this, then he cannot get realisation. If I study hard, then I pass the examination. But if I don’t study, then how am I going to pass the examination? In the spiritual life study means to offer oneself devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally to the Supreme. Study is self-study, total self-giving. If I don’t study in this way, then I won’t get the result.</p>
<p>You can ask who helps and guides the seeker, who gives him the necessary capacity. We pray and meditate and this is what you call personal effort. But if we go deep within we realise that this personal effort is also a form of Grace. Grace and personal effort go together. God is on the third floor and I am on the first floor. With my personal effort I come up to the second floor and with His Grace God comes down to the second floor. There we meet together, and realisation takes place.</p>
<p>But if we are sincere, we have to know that it is God who has given us the necessary power, strength, capacity and willingness to come up from the first floor to the second floor. Otherwise, why are relatives and friends still fast asleep while we are so anxious and eager to go up and see the Face of God? It is just because God’s Grace has entered into us and awakened us. When our hour has struck, God has come and lifted us up and He Himself has descended, and the two eternal friends are meeting together. So I wish to say that personal effort is necessary, but if we are totally sincere, we will feel that this personal effort also is due to God’s unconditional Grace.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What do you mean by the Face of God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What do you mean by the Face of God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Face of God is our own highest, eternal Reality. The Face of God is the Reality which is Eternity, Immortality and Infinity. It is Reality in its purest form. Infinity, Eternity and Immortality are vague concepts to most of us. But if we say ‘face’, immediately it becomes something vivid for the physical mind. Our physical mind is convinced when we give a form to Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. If we say ‘face’, then immediately we know that there is somebody who has this face. The face may be beautiful or ugly, but at least it has some reality. If there is no face, then it is very difficult for us to comprehend the Reality which is revealed and expressed as Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.</p>
<p>When we speak about the Face of God, it is a matter of belief. When I am in my highest consciousness, my students enter into me or into themselves, and the Face of God is a reality for them. They feel Bliss or Peace in boundless measure. It need not even be my students. When I hold public meditations in New York, hundreds of people come and in their meditation they feel Peace, Light and Bliss in boundless measure. At that time a sense of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality looms large in their life of aspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to sacrifice our existence to God devotedly and soulfully, with no reluctance. If we want to see the Face of God, if we want to grow into our real Reality, then we have to offer God constantly all that we have. If we have an iota of love or concern for God, we have to give it devotedly and soulfully. This kind of self-giving is possible only when we regularly pray and meditate. Otherwise, our life is one of possession, not giving. But when we pray and meditate, at that time we try to minimise or diminish all our wants. Peace is found not in possession, but in constant renunciation. We renounce our limited self and enter into our unlimited Self. This unlimited Self is God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does one always use a mantra for initiation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does one always use a mantra for initiation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One need not use a mantra in order to initiate. There are various ways of initiation. The traditional Indian way is to offer a mantra or perform some religious rite. But there are other ways to initiate as well. A spiritual Master can initiate someone by simply placing his hand on the head or the heart of the seeker. But there need not even be any physical contact. The Master can initiate through the third eye. When he uses his third eye, he makes the disciple feel that he has established a conscious bridge between himself and the seeker. Again, there need not be any formal initiation at all. The Master’s total acceptance of the seeker is as good as initiation. But whether he initiates inwardly or outwardly, the message of the Master is always this: “I accept you, my child, as my own.” Each individual Master has his own way of initiating a disciple. All are right, provided that the seeker has found the Master that he is meant for.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, acceptance in any form is called initiation. The Master accepts everything that the disciple has and is, and he offers to the disciple everything that he himself has and is. If the disciple is impure, if the disciple is ignorant, the Master accepts all his ignorance and impurity as his own. The seeker’s achievement, his reality, his existence, the teacher accepts as his own. First he accepts; then by the Grace and Light of God, he transforms. He accepts someone as his own — both his weaknesses and his capacities — then he tries to increase these capacities and transforms these weaknesses into strength unlimited.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What do you think is the greatest obstacle in achieving God-surrender and God-realisation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What do you think is the greatest obstacle in achieving God-surrender and God-realisation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The greatest obstacle need not be the same for each individual. Somebody’s greatest obstacle will be doubt; somebody else may have fear as his greatest obstacle, and a third person may have insecurity. All these difficulties can be overcome by using only one weapon and that is love.</p>
<p>Let us take obstacles as imperfections. A child plays in the playground and gets covered with mud and dirt. His whole body is dirty, but the child does not feel that he is dirty. He just runs to his mother, and she cleans him. It is the bounden duty of the mother to get soap and water and clean the child. If the child feels that because he is dirty his mother will scold him, insult him and strike him then he will not go to her. But he does not feel that. First of all, he does not consider himself dirty. Then, when he runs to his mother, he is aware only of her love. He feels that his mother is his all. At every moment he has a free access to her.</p>
<p>If we have doubt, if we have fear, if we have other undivine qualities or imperfections, like a child let us run toward our eternal Father. He is there to purify us, to illumine us, to liberate us, to give us what He has. We have a free access to the eternal Father. But if we use our physical mind, we will feel, “Oh, God will be displeased with us. God will not accept us because we are so dirty, so imperfect, so impure.” The physical mind immediately separates us. It makes us feel that we are all imperfection while God is perfect Perfection; so how can we go to Him? But if we feel that God is our very own, that God is all Love for us and we are all love for Him, then we just go and sit before Him and place ourselves at His Feet. At that time, there is no obstacle.</p>
<p>We have to feel that what God is, we also are. That very thing we are right now, but we are not aware of it. We have to feel that God has created us and He wants us to grow into His very image. We have a mind which separates us; but we also have a heart. When the heart comes to the fore, immediately we feel tremendous joy, relief and satisfaction. We feel that God is ours. When we use our heart, we claim God as our very own on the strength of our oneness. When we use the heart, there is no obstacle which cannot be surmounted. As a child has established his oneness with the mother, even so we can also establish our oneness with God on the strength of our spontaneous love for Him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you possibly explain if there is some ground for unifying Karma Yoga and the Yoga of renunciation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you possibly explain if there is some ground for unifying Karma Yoga and the Yoga of renunciation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Karma Yoga is dedicated service. When we practise Karma Yoga, we try to make all our work a true dedicated service to the Supreme. In ordinary work we immediately expect something in return; we expect success or fortune or advancement. An ordinary human being will not work if he knows that there will be no success at the end of his work. But when one practices Karma Yoga, he works most devotedly; he serves most devotedly and soulfully without caring for the result, as such. He knows that the result will come in the form of either success or failure. He accepts both success and failure as an experience. Also, he feels that this experience is not actually his; it is the experience of God. When the seeker goes deep within, he sees that God Himself is the doer, He Himself is the work and He Himself is the result. When he is just a beginner, he feels that God is the giver and he is the receiver. But when he becomes advanced, he feels that God Himself is always acting in and through him and experiencing Himself in and through him.</p>
<p>“Thou hast the right to act but claim not the fruits thereof.” Lord Krishna has given us this message in the <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em>, the Song Celestial. The Upanishadic Seers have also said: “Action does not cleave to a man.” Action cannot bind us if it is divine action. If it is undivine action, immediately the result binds us. If we get success, immediately we feel that this success is not enough; if we get failure, immediately we want to give up.</p>
<p>The Upanishadic Seers have also said: “Enjoy through renunciation.” Now what do we actually renounce? We renounce the things in us that do not want to aspire, that do not want to reach the Goal or carry us to the Goal. Again, when we enter into the very breath of renunciation, into the very core of renunciation, we see that there is no such thing as renunciation. Renunciation is really transformation. If my leg is dirty, I don’t cut off my leg; I do not renounce it. No! I clean it; I transform it. If we see something that is dark, unlit, obscure and impure in us, we don’t have to discard it; we have to transform it. Night has to be transformed into light. But we cannot transform night all at once. We have to go to light first and bring some light into our system. Then the darkness in us will be transformed into light. That is God’s Dream, which we have to fulfil and transform into a reality. This is the message of Karma Yoga.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The physical body is like a temple, a shrine. If there is no temple, where will the soul, the living deity, remain? From the highest point of view, the physical body is needed for the manifestation of the divine reality on earth. If we stay on earth in the physical, we get the opportunity to manifest the divinity which the soul embodies. When the physical aspires consciously, the physical receives light, peace and bliss from the soul and then tries to manifest these qualities on earth in humanity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is difficult but not impossible. When we use the intellectual mind, constantly we are scrutinising things. But we are never satisfied. We doubt others; we even doubt our own existence with our intellect. The intellect is like a sharp knife that is constantly trying to see what is in something. It cuts the thing into tiny pieces and then tries to see what is inside the tiny piece, to see if there is any reality there. It tries to see the reality in its smallest form. But the heart wants to see the reality as an infinite expanse of Light and Delight. The heart first identifies with the reality; then it expands its own existence. We have to see reality as a whole; then only shall we be satisfied.</p>
<p>We have to know that the soul stays inside the heart. True, its vibration, its consciousness, permeates the whole body; but its actual existence is inside the heart. So if we go to the source, to the place where the soul abides most of the time, it is very easy to feel its light. But if we remain in the mind and wait for the soul’s vibration to reach us, it is much more difficult.</p>
<p>Eventually we have to bring light into the mind, into the intellect, into the lethargic body, everywhere. Light has to permeate every part of our existence. But it is infinitely easier to get light if we go to the heart first and then bring light from the heart to the mind.</p>

<h2>Question: How does one meditate?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two principal ways to meditate. One can either silence the mind or one can empty the heart. When one silences the mind, the divine Reality, the highest Reality, can flow in and through the mind. When emotional desires and wrong movements from the vital are emptied from the heart, then the heart is ready to receive Peace, Light and Bliss in abundant measure. So by silencing the mind or by emptying the heart one can have a good meditation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do you feel that man has to suffer on earth?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do you feel that man has to suffer on earth?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No! Human beings are not on earth to suffer. On the contrary, human beings are on earth for illumination. We have to know that our Source is God, who is all Love, all Light, all Satisfaction. He is not suffering; He is all Bliss. Thousands of years ago the Vedic Seers offered us a most significant message: “From Delight we came into existence; in Delight we grow and at the end of our journey’s close, into Delight we shall retire.” Suffering is not the ultimate Reality. The ultimate Reality is Bliss. Sometimes we go through an experience which we call suffering. But eventually we will arrive at Delight, and this Delight is our real Reality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If God is everywhere, what is the purpose of evolution?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If God is everywhere, what is the purpose of evolution?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is present in the mineral kingdom, in plants, in animals, in everything. God is omnipresent. God is also in the process of evolution. From the world of Silence the transcendental Spirit descended into the mineral kingdom which He created. When the Spirit descends, we call it involution and when the Spirit evolves from inconscience and goes up again to the Source, we call it evolution. From the mineral life, God within us evolved into plant life, then into animal life and now into human life. From human life it has to evolve into divine life. Now we are human beings, yet we are still half animal. We quarrel, we fight, we kill, we do many undivine things. But we also have the aspiration to become divine, to serve God in mankind, to become one with the world at large. As seekers, as lovers of Truth who pray and meditate, we are to some extent divine. So God has evolved in and through us from the mineral kingdom to the plant kingdom, from the plant kingdom to the animal kingdom and from the animal kingdom to the human kingdom, Now God within us is trying to evolve into a divine being. He has started climbing the tree right from the foot. He will be satisfied only when he has reached the topmost branch.</p>

Why does a spiritual Master like yourself get a cold and have to suffer?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Today it is from pure negligence. I came here today an hour before my talk and I went to buy some books in spite of knowing that I was catching cold. If I had been careful to be more warmly dressed, then I would not have caught cold. But, I don’t take this cold as punishment or suffering. I take it as an experience. I did something; now I am getting the result of my action.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I am sick, it is not negligence. Sometimes I take diseases from the wrong forces of my disciples. I know the way to throw these diseases into the universal Consciousness, but usually I do not do it immediately because it is better for my disciples to see and feel what kind of suffering they are causing me by cherishing so many wrong movements. But an hour ago I did something wrong, so why should I fight when the result comes to me. Since I allowed myself to catch a cold in a natural way, let it be cured in a natural way.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If we are part of God, why do we leave our Source in the first place and come to earth?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If we are part of God, why do we leave our Source in the first place and come to earth?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are part and parcel of God the absolute Supreme. We are totally and inseparably one with Him. But we have come from the Source in order to take a conscious part in God’s cosmic Game. God is the eternal Player and we are participating in His cosmic Game. We have come into the world as representatives of God for the sake of manifestation. In order to manifest the divine within us, we come back to earth again and again. Inside us is strength, but if this strength is not utilised, we do not feel satisfied. Inside us is love, but if this love is not offered, we remain unfulfilled. Inside us is service, but if this service is not rendered, it does no good at all. If we do not manifest on earth what we have inside us, then our divinity is all in Heaven; it is all in dreamland, let us say.</p>
<p>But why do we come down the cosmic Tree when we could have stayed on the top of that Tree? It is because it is God’s Plan. God did not want to remain as one. He wanted to become many. He was one, but He thought He would like to enjoy Himself in infinite forms and shapes. That is why He created us. The song of multiplicity He is singing. It was for His own supreme Satisfaction that He made Himself into many forms. Seekers are consciously trying and non-seekers are unconsciously trying to arrive at the same satisfaction. Unless and until our divinity is manifested, we are not satisfied and we do not or cannot regain our Source.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The goal of the seeker is to please the Supreme in His own way. The real seeker will only try to please God in God’s own way. Then if God wants to give that particular seeker Light, Bliss and Peace so that he can offer it to mankind, that is up to God. The real seeker will only try to please God in His own way. His goal is not to have a little Peace or Joy or Love. He wants to reach the Highest and let the Highest decide for him how or what he can offer to the world.</p>
