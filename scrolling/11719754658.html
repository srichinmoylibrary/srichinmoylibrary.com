<h2>The Master's fragrance</h2>

<p>When a saint or a holy man meditates at the foot of a tree for a few minutes, if later you sit under the same tree and your consciousness is good, then you are bound to feel tremendous purity and joy. There is a funny Indian story. A slave wanted to sit on the king's throne. He felt that the king was enjoying everything so much and everybody was listening to him. So he went and sat on the throne. Immediately all the world's worries, anxieties, curses and other problems attacked him, because the king was a victim to all the undivine forces. But if you sit on the throne or chair of a spiritual Master, you are bound to feel something. Naturally you won't sit on his chair without taking his permission.</p>
<p>The spiritual Masters all the time embody Peace, Light and Bliss. If your consciousness is high, you are bound to feel these qualities. There need not be any flower inside the meditation room: If the spiritual Master meditates well, then you don't need flowers, you don't need incense, you don't need candles; but all the qualities of flowers, incense and candles you are bound to feel. When your consciousness is high, you even can smell a kind of fragrance around a spiritual Master. Consciously he may not offer this fragrance, but it is your own aspiration-power, that, like a magnet, has pulled it from him. But if your consciousness is not high, you won't feel anything.</p>
<p>I am a spiritual Master. When I go to a bookstore, if the owner of the bookstore is in a high consciousness, I tell you he will look at me. Even if there are forty or fifty people in the store, he will look at me. It is not because he has my books or has heard something about me. It is because of my spiritual consciousness. When I go into bookstores, immediately there is something that I offer. And some of the owners feel it.</p>
<p>So when our consciousness is a little high, we receive when the spiritual Masters move around. Here I am speaking and some of the seekers are receiving more than others. Why? Everybody is hearing the same thing, but receptivity is not the same for all the seekers here. The expressions, thoughts, ideas and light are distributed equally here. But according to their receptivity, some are receiving more than the rest.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The power of thought</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The power of thought" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Someone has written me a note: "Sometimes I feel that you are my enemy. Sometimes I feel that you are my friend." He speaks on behalf of all of you. When you think I don't fulfil your desires, naturally I am your enemy. He told me that sometimes he feels like leaving the Centre. I scolded him like anything. That is a thought, a very powerful thought. When you think you are going to leave me, rest assured that one step you have already taken. You take a few more and you are gone. People who have left always started with one step. When you think you have already taken one, then it is easier to take a few more. Then it becomes a one-way street and you can't come back.</p>
<p>So if you have the feeling, even in the mind, that you are going to leave, I wish to tell you that one thought is enough. You can create a thought-world that is so powerful that you are finished. Thought itself, I tell you, you have to take as poison. If you drink poison, you die; one part of your consciousness is affected. Spiritual Masters say one bad thought is like a whole world. One bad thought, a lower vital thought, is enough to destroy a whole day. You have to know whether you have allowed it to enter your mind or gone further and actually cherished it. And again, one divine thought is enough to keep the whole day cheerful.</p>
<p>All spiritual seekers and Masters have come to the conclusion that one impure thought is enough to destroy the consciousness and one pure thought is enough to illumine the consciousness. The impure thought can be doubt, suspicion, meanness, lower vital desire, insecurity. In my eyes, doubt and suspicion are worse than insecurity. Whatever defect you have, that is your worst enemy. If one has insecurity, then that is his worst enemy. Doubt is the worst enemy of all, that is true. But if somebody does not have doubt, but he does have jealousy or insecurity, then that is enough for him: that is the worst enemy for him. And when one keeps getting the same disease over and over, it becomes very powerful.</p>
<p>When someone's enemies are already inside him, he has to fight very hard. If the thought is already inside, it is difficult. But it is not impossible. No, never! Throw it out. Once you throw it out, remain always alert so it doesn't enter into you again. It usually strikes the forehead; the thought-world comes just here and strikes the forehead. Feel that you are a fort and somebody is coming and striking you. Just don't allow the wrong thought to enter. But you not only allow it to enter, you usually go further: you cherish it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Sincerity and obedience</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Sincerity and obedience" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Sincerity is of paramount importance in the spiritual life. But sincerity has no value unless it is lasting. Suppose you have done something wrong and you tell me. Your sincerity I appreciate. But then you have to take the next step, and that is called obedience: You will not do it a second time. Otherwise, if you keep doing the same thing wrong over and over again, and each time you say, "I have done it," then your sincerity becomes a mockery. You blow your own horn, "I am sincere," but what kind of sincerity is it?</p>
<p>If you do something wrong, you should tell. But then you have to listen to me and not do it again. Insincere people I can do nothing with. I am helpless. Sincere people give me the opportunity to take them one step forward. But then obedience is necessary. If obedience is there, each second you can jump, jump. Hundreds and hundreds of things you will do to make the fastest progress.</p>
<p>If you are a little afraid of me, then tomorrow you will have a little obedience. Until you have established your total identification with me, a little fear is good — not destructive fear, but constructive fear: "I will see Guru's sad face if I disobey him." This kind of fear is good. If you feel you are all love and concern for my mission, then my sad face will be much more powerful than my angry face.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Cherishing something unconsciously</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Cherishing something unconsciously" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Many times I see that the disciples are cherishing something unconsciously. If you are cherishing something unconsciously, your mind is not aware of it. But there comes a time when you get the results of what you are cherishing in the form of pleasure. At that time you are not disgusted; you like it. You are getting a kind of joy or pleasure or comfort, but you do not know why you are getting it. It is not that consciously you have done something. But still you are getting the after-effect. The consciousness of the action you are getting. The fruit is at your disposal, and you are eating the fruit voraciously, like a greedy person. When you get the result, you could say, "This very thing I did not want. Although it looks delicious, I know the after-effect is poisonous." But what do you do? You become clever. You eat it consciously, and then you simply say you are not to blame. You say you didn't do it; you didn't want the fruit but somebody brought it. "It came to me. I am not responsible." But you are eating it consciously.</p>
<p>The first time that you eat, immediately you say, "I am not the culprit. Somebody has stolen something and left it in my room." Nobody says that you stole it, but the very fact that you are eating it or you are using it, is enough for you to be the culprit in the inner world. Consciously you have not gone to anybody's house to steal. But when you enjoy it, you open up the door. And the next time somebody throws this thing in front of you, you are again ready to utilise it. It is something alluring, something tempting. Unconsciously you are cherishing the thing when it is placed before you.</p>
<p>Somebody places doubt inside your mind. You cherish it, and doubt itself becomes wisdom for you. When you have doubt, immediately you feel it is not doubt; it is a proud wisdom. Everywhere in the world, when people doubt, they feel they are very wise. They feel that other people are credulous. They say, "Look at their stupidity!" Just because they themselves don't believe in something, they feel they are wise. This is their self-imposed wisdom, that they are cherishing. But if we live the spiritual life, we go deep within and we try to believe. God is for believers. When we believe in something twenty times, if we are deceived, God will forgive us. If I believe you, and again and again you deceive me, God will forgive me. But if I doubt and you doubt and the world doubts without rhyme or reason, then no progress will ever be made. If you doubt, you have to feel that you are not entering into the game. If you believe, you <em>are</em> entering into the game, although you may lose if somebody has deceived you. But if you doubt, you don't even enter into the game. And then what can you do?</p>
<p>Enter into the game and see; maybe somebody will teach you how to play. Enter into the game and see your fate. If it is good, naturally you will win in the battlefield of life. If it is bad, then feel that you have Eternity at your disposal. But if you don't play at all, if you stay off on the sidelines, thinking all the time that the game is too dangerous, then how are you going to win in the battlefield of life? At that time there is no game, no fun. "If I play football, something will happen to my foot. If I throw shotput once, my fingers may be ruined." There is no end to fear. Life is always illumination. It comes only to those who are brave, who face life, not to those who are afraid of life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Telling secrets to the master</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Telling secrets to the master" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>It is the worst possible crime to keep secrets from the master. If someone keeps a secret from me, he is digging his own grave. I am not happy to know about your secrets. Knowing your secrets means only knowing your weaknesses. If I become happy to know your weaknesses, then I am the worst possible fool. But if you tell me outwardly, I get the opportunity to work on you before the situation becomes too powerful, before the weakness becomes an incurable disease. When you tell me a secret, it means you are unburdening your life.</p>
<p>Especially if you are having vital or emotional problems, you should tell the Master. If you do, a big heavy load, a dead load, you throw off from your shoulders. And now you can breathe in properly. You should have implicit faith in the Master. If you feel the Master will expose you, tell twenty individuals, then the best thing is to keep it a secret and suffer to the end. But you have to know that a secret is weakness. Keep a secret and you are only cherishing a weakness of life. And if you try to hide your personal and emotional problems, you have to know that these things are absolutely weaknesses, nothing else.</p>
<p>Even if the Master tells others about your weaknesses, he is not doing it out of malicious pleasure. He is doing it because he feels that they can learn from your mistakes. Whatever weaknesses you have, they also have. You have entered into the spiritual life to transform your weaknesses into strength and perfect your life. So please don't cherish these things. Just throw them into the Master. Then, what he does with them is his business. You have to have that kind of faith in the Master.</p>
