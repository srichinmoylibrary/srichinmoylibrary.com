There seems to be an aspiration which expends all its effort in the direction of rising, but it seems that there is also a time to accept and be still and let the influence of the higher forces come in." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They go together. If we aspire sincerely, then the higher forces are all the time descending. At that time the divine forces can enter into us properly. If we don't aspire, then the doors are all closed. Let us say that the divine Grace wants to descend into us, but we have kept all our doors closed. Now naturally the Grace cannot descend, since our heart-door we have kept closed. Then the time comes when we want the divine Grace to enter but we have just opened one mental window. Just a tiny window we have kept open and the door is still quite firmly bolted from the inside. It is so hard to open. But when we sincerely aspire, at that time we keep our heart's door wide open, our mind's door wide open, our vital's door wide open. All the doors we keep wide open. Aspiration is going up and the doors are all open, so the divine Grace is descending into us.</p>
<p>So, acceptance means that we allow the divine Grace to descend fully into us without being hampered. That is the best way. When we sincerely aspire, we open up the heart, vital, mind and every other part of the being. At that time, we tell God or the higher forces, "Now I want to become an open book. I don't want to remain a concealed book, a sealed book. I want my life to be an open book. You can read it. There I have written everything wrong. Whatever I have written is absolutely wrong. Now you enter into my existence and correct it, rectify it. Please make a new book of your own, a new life of mine." So when aspiration goes up, real acceptance comes.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I renew my aspiration?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I renew my aspiration?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can renew your aspiration by realising only one fact. That fact is that you are no longer the boss of your body, vital, mind, heart and soul. There is somebody else who is the boss and that is your Guru. The Supreme is your Guru. Previously you were the boss. That is why you ordered your vital to do this, your body to do this, your mind to do this. Now you have to feel that the Supreme in me is the boss. Now you have to constantly refer every important matter to the higher authority.</p>
<p>When you feel that you have to solve your problems, then you can never renew your aspiration. If you feel that it is your problem, if you feel that it is you who are suffering and you who can alone solve the problem, then you are creating more problems. But when you feel that all your problems can be solved only by me, then you are safe. A higher authority means a more illumined person. Previously you thought that you had more illumination than your physical body, so that is why you ruled your body. Now you have to feel that you do not have that capacity. When a higher reality rules you, then automatically you can aspire, because you want to grow into the higher reality. So you have only to be the servitor and not the boss. If we see that there is nobody more illumined before us or around us, then we don't aspire. We have to see that there is someone who is an inch higher than us and that our actions depend on his will. In that way we can increase and not just renew our aspiration. Renewal is not the right word. If our aspiration has been eclipsed, our inner sun can easily come out of the clouds provided it gets the sanction of a higher authority.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Since everything will happen at God&#039;s Hour, why bother to aspire?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Since everything will happen at God&#039;s Hour, why bother to aspire?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here you are making a mistake. At God's Hour everything will come, true. At God's Hour everybody will realise God. Cats, monkeys, dogs, elephants — all will realise God at God's Hour. But if we follow this philosophy, then human beings are in no way better than monkeys. If we wait for that kind of God's Hour, then God-realisation will take a million years. But if we have conscious aspiration to expedite our spiritual progress, then God's Compassion comes down and illumines us.</p>
<p>Everybody will eventually realise God, that is true. Tom, Dick and Harry will one day realise God. We believe it; this is our human faith in God, which is wonderful. This is the certainty that faith will give us. We know that we will realise God one day. But if we want to realise God today or tomorrow or the next day, then aspiration comes into the picture. For aspiration, a spiritual Master is required.</p>
<p>Mere faith in something is not enough. I have a disciple who is a good driver. I have faith in his driving; it is so wonderful that I have faith in his driving. But just by having faith in him, do you think that I will be able to learn to drive? Millions of times I have sat beside him, but I will not be able to learn how to drive just by sitting beside him, even if I have faith that he is a wonderful driver.</p>
<p>So our human faith in God's Promise is also like that. One day we will realise God, but that day is no day at all if we don't aspire. God knows when that day will dawn, in the bosom of Eternity. If we aspire, if we sincerely want to learn how to drive, then we will find someone to show us how to drive. Similarly, in our inner life, the spiritual Master can show us how to approach God. Aspiration is required in our spiritual life in order to get the best results in the quickest way.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can maintain continuous aspiration only by feeling that there is someone who needs you infinitely more than you need yourself. If somebody is in need of you, then naturally you will try to help that person out. That person is the Supreme Himself. When you feel that He needs you, then your sympathetic heart goes toward Him.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Cry, cry. Think of a child. A child knows how to cry. Because he feels the need of a toy, he cries. In our case also, if we need God, our Divine Toy, then we must cry. A child is not satisfied until he has his toy. In our inner life also, we must cry. We are here on earth for thirty, forty, fifty or sixty years, but if we do not get something at once, then we feel that we should not take our aspiration seriously. We have to know that the thing that we want is all-important; then only we will value it. Our human difficulty is that we do not take anything seriously. We hope for name and fame, but if we see that we must climb up a tall tree in order to get what we want, then we lose interest. So, in the spiritual life also we want God, but before we realise God, we have to do a few things. If we feel inwardly the value of God-realisation in our life, then the so-called hardship that we go through is nothing. If we value the goal, then we are bound to walk along the path. What actually happens is that the road is long and arduous but, if we constantly keep the goal in our view and walk along the road, then we will reach our destination. If we really value the goal and cry for the goal, then there will always be some way for us to reach the goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Lately I&#039;ve been conscious of a number of obstructions in my outer life.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Lately I&#039;ve been conscious of a number of obstructions in my outer life." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that time cry, cry like a child. The other day at the United Nations I gave this meditation: "In the outer life, he who cries is a lost child." Somebody is crying. That means he is lost or something is wrong with him. "In the inner life, he who does not cry is a lost child." In the outer life, he who cries is a lost child; but in the inner life he who does not cry is a lost child. So when the problems of the outer being stand as an obstruction, cry inwardly. That cry is not for name or fame. That cry is for inner illumination. When the outer being is an obstacle, it means that the sun, the inner sun, is eclipsed by fear, doubt, anxiety, worry or some other negative force. Right now the sun is overcast, but it is bound to become visible again. The inner sun is covered by what? By ignorance, doubt, anxiety and worry. But consciously if you pray or meditate to bring the inner sun, your own illumined sun, to the fore, it will get strength and it will come forward. Now you have to know whether you want it or not. If you want the inner sun to come to the fore, then it will come forward. When the sun comes, at that time doubt disappears, fear disappears, everything undivine disappears.</p>
<p>So either you have to bring forward the inner sun or you have to be satisfied with fear and doubt. How can you bring to the fore the inner sun? When you pray to the Supreme and meditate on the Supreme, always pray that the illumined part inside you, the illumined being or the inner sun, will come to the fore. Then you will see that there can be no obstacle. You are unable to walk along the street if the street is very dark or full of obstacles. But if the road is all illumined, then you can walk, you can run, you can go as fast as you want to. In the inner life also, if you think positively, if you think of Peace, Light and Bliss, then naturally your inner sun will come to your rescue. But if you don't pray and meditate, then all obscure, undivine, impure forces will always come and bother you.</p>
<p>The very tendency of ordinary human life is to unconsciously cherish the undivine forces. But consciously if you can treasure your aspiration, your love for God, your love for Truth and Reality, then these undivine forces cannot attack you. They will feel that they are not wanted. In this world everybody gets disgusted if he is not wanted. If the wrong forces see all the divine forces inside you, then they will say, "Oh, she does not care for us. Why should we go on showing her our constant compassion if it is ignored?" Ignorance also has its pride. First ignorance wants to grab you, torture you, keep you under its jurisdiction and say that you belong to ignorance. But then you show ignorance that you are becoming friends with light. Then ignorance will use all its power to keep you away from light, but it finds that you don't care for its power. Secretly you have made friends with light. You have been staying with ignorance but you do not care for ignorance. Secretly, secretly you have been all the time appreciating your new friend, light. So ignorance says, "Why should I keep this person who is my enemy? He is all the time making friends with light. Secretly he is going to the light, secretly on his own he is hiding and praying to God for Light." Then ignorance will be disgusted with you. Ignorance will say, "It is beneath my dignity to keep her. If she stays with me, then she has to fight for me. Otherwise it is like a soldier who is asked by the commander to kill the enemy, but instead of killing the enemy, which is light, he kills the commander instead." So the commander, ignorance, becomes afraid and says, "No, no, I don't need you. I can't tell you what to do anymore. Go away." It is always like that. People get disgusted when they work very hard for someone and then that person does not listen to them. They say, "All right, go your own way." So ignorance also has its own obscure, impure way of operating. Although you will see that it is leading you toward destruction, ignorance tells you, "I have done so much for you and you are so ungrateful." How clever ignorance can be!</p>

<h2>Question: How can I be assured of making good progress if my past was not at all aspiring?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Suppose for seventeen years you smoked, drank and took drugs, but today you are no longer doing these things. You saw what was bad and cut it off, like the part of a fruit that is rotten. Now the obscurity and impurity are going away from your consciousness and again you are becoming luminous. Today you are crying for perfection. Previously you were all imperfection; now you are fifty per cent perfect and your perfection is increasing. Now you are getting solid experiences; you are growing into light. So why do you have to worry about your obscure and impure past? Only think of the future. I always say, "The past is dust." Do not look backward. Only live in the immediacy of today and grow into the golden future.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Try to keep a direct contact with my inner being. In that way you can make the fastest progress. Try to have a telephone connection so that your inner being can respond to my inner being. While you are meditating early in the morning and looking at my picture, please try to converse inwardly with me. Try to enter into my heart or into my third eye. Every day empty yourself into me. If you have fear, if you have doubt or anxiety or worries, just throw it all into me. Think of me as an ocean into which you can throw your garbage. Just throw anything that comes into your mind. Then your mind will be filled with the divine Light by the Supreme in me. At that time you will make the fastest progress.</p>

As the couples live in the same building, in the same apartment, similarly they are living in the same house, let us say the same spiritual house. One house is their spiritual house and one is their earthly, human house. When you come to a spiritual Centre, it is your spiritual house. You have a spiritual family, as you have a human family. Your friends, your relatives and the members of your family comprise your human family. When you follow a spiritual path, the members of that Centre or community become your spiritual family.</p>
<p>Now, how can couples aspire if they don't follow the same path? It becomes difficult. You will say that your path is by far the best and your husband will say, "No, it is impossible. My path is best!" There will always be a tug-of-war. You will claim that yours is by far the best and he will claim that his is by far the best, which is absurd. But there comes a time when you make progress. At that time you feel that if he is following another path, that means that he is more satisfied with his path than with your path. And if you follow a path, you have to know that your path is better for you than your husband's path. Now when you make considerable progress in your spiritual life, divine wisdom dawns. At that time you do not enter into competition. If he says that his path is far better, by far the best and no path can be compared with his path, inwardly you may laugh; but outwardly you will have compassion for him. Inwardly also you will have compassion. You will say, "Yes, it is better. It is best for you, but not for me. For me, my path is the best." So when we make considerable progress in the spiritual life, we say, "Yes, you are right. Your path is by far the best for you and my path is by far the best for me."</p>
<p>So let us not quarrel about the path. Only let us think of progress: how fast I can reach my destination with my own aspiration and how fast he can reach his goal with his aspiration. Again, there is no competition, only you have a goal of your own. Actually there is only one goal, but you have selected a particular path, a road. You have to reach your destination, the sooner the better. Why? You know that when you reach the goal it is called God-realisation. But even then the game is not over. Then comes God-revelation, which is more difficult. After God-revelation comes God-manifestation, which is most difficult. So in one goal there are three tasks. First, with utmost aspiration, inner cry, regularity and punctuality, you reach the goal. It is a lifelong task. And then you feel that your task is not over. God will say, "I am glad that you have passed the examination. You have completed your course in one field. But again, there is something more: God-revelation. Then comes God-manifestation." So we cannot waste time. Here we are not competing with anybody else, but we have to feel that we are trying to transcend our own limitation. While following our own path, our own capacity we are transcending, transcending. We are increasing and transcending. If it is ignorance, we are transcending it; if it is knowledge, we are increasing it.</p>
<p>Husband and wife can easily follow the same path. It is like four hands, four eyes, four legs: everything is double. The husband should feel that the wife is dearest to him just because God has made her the dearest to him, and the wife also should feel the same. God should be in between, not as a third person but as the bridge, the connecting link. Always the husband is coming to the wife through God the Bridge and the wife is coming to the husband through God the Bridge. This way God connects them. The golden link is God. He connects both husband and wife. If they follow the same path, then it becomes infinitely easier. But if they do not follow the same path, then my request is not to argue. Neither the husband nor the wife should emphasise his or her own path as the best path. Only say, "Mine is best for me; yours is best for you. Let us not fight. Only let us try to transcend our limitations, let us try to purify our existence, let us try to please God in His own Way." If the husband by following one path wants to please God in God's Way, then he is doing absolutely the right thing. Similarly, if the wife is following her own path and she feels the necessity of pleasing God, which is absolutely necessary in every path, then she is also doing the right thing.</p>
<p>In my path, in everybody's path, God comes first. That doesn't mean that we have to discard the husband or the wife. It is a matter of choice. Between husband and God, God has to come first. Between wife and God, God has to come first. That doesn't mean that God is asking you to get rid of your husband or to get rid of your wife, far from it. But if necessity demands that you make a choice, if your husband or your wife is not allowing you to fulfil your inner cry, at that time you have to know who comes first: God. In this incarnation you have got someone as a partner for your life. But who knows what connection you had? Perhaps you had practically no connection with that person in a previous incarnation. Who knows what will happen to him or to you in your future incarnations? But with God, your connection is eternal. He brought you into the world. After seventy or eighty years you will leave this body. Then again, after some time you will come back. At that time, who knows who will be your lifelong partner?</p>
<p>But the eternal Partner is God. So we have to establish our oneness with Him, since we know it is He who is our eternal husband, eternal wife.</p>
<p>Again, temporarily, on the way, if God wants to unite two souls as husband and wife, well and good. But if there is any conflict, if the wife is standing in the way of the husband's spiritual progress or vice versa, then what will God say? Will He say, "You stay together. I shall wait for you for Eternity"? No. He will say that whoever is ready should run to Him. God is our eternal Father, my Father, your Father, everybody's Father. Now if one child is ready, if one child is more than prepared to run and the other child wants to sleep, will God say, "No, since both of you are brothers, you should sleep as long as the other one"? No. He will say, "You are up; now go to school, inner school. You are sleeping, so you continue to sleep. When the time comes, you will get up." He will not ask the one who is more advanced or more it illumined to wait for the other one. For him, God is ready to wait. If one is not awakened, God is there to wait. But God will not ask the other one to wait for him. God will say, "You are awakened. You run towards Me. It is I who am awakened inside you. You come towards Me and reach Me, your Goal. The other person is My responsibility." God will say that it is His problem to take care of the other person, not ours.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now the thing is, dearest daughter, where is the future? Is there any such thing as future? I use the term "here and now," or "the immediacy of today." The future we think of as something ahead of us. But in the spiritual life the future is not ahead of us; the future is inside us. The past, present and future of a spiritual person are inside him. A seeker like you embodies present, past and future. It is all there inside you.</p>
<p>A tree has three branches, let us say. The past is the lowest branch, the present is the middle branch and the future is the top-most branch. Even when you observe from the foot of the tree, easily when you look up you can see the first branch, the second branch and the third branch. Now it is up to you to climb up to the first one or to the second one or to the third one. So think of your future in that way. This is your life-tree. In your life-tree, the past is already there, the present is already there, the future is already there. Now you have climbed beyond one branch, the past. You are sitting on the present branch but you are not satisfied with the present one because you feel that still there is a higher one. Just because you were not pleased with the previous one, the past, you thought that still there was one higher, so why should you sit on the lowest one? So you said, "Let me climb up to the higher one." Then you came up.</p>
<p>Now you are on the present one. Now you feel that still there is one higher than this one, so you climb up. But it is the same life-tree that has three branches: past, present, future. If you remain as the life-tree constantly evolving and offering flowers and fruits to Mother Earth as a token of your love or as a spiritual gift to Mother Earth, then eternally you will remain in her consciousness, in her heart.</p>
<p>So please feel that you are the life-tree, the cosmic life-tree with three branches: past, present and future. It is up to you to decide where to remain. You can remain on the first branch, the lowest branch, all the time thinking of your childhood, your friends, your neighbours and what happened to you at the age of six or ten. That you can do. Again, you can think of your immediate necessity, which is God realisation. What will you do right after realisation? You will reveal God more powerfully, more soulfully, more effectively. This will be your aim. So think at every moment of the life-tree, the cosmic tree. You have three goals. The first goal already you have passed. Now you have reached the second goal. But you feel that still there is a higher goal than the goal that you have already achieved and attained. So if you cry, if you cry desperately for the third goal, then you will reach it.</p>
<p>Each time you reach a goal, even while you are in the process of reaching the goal, you manifest. Movement itself is manifestation. While you are moving, at that time you are manifesting. While you are moving in the present, you are manifesting. And while you are moving in the future, you will be again manifesting.</p>
<p>How will you know what to do in your next incarnation? You will always know because it is not like earth-knowledge. Earth-knowledge you forget, but inner knowledge you don't forget. Inner knowledge can be recovered after five years, ten years or much longer. I had my realisation in my previous incarnation. For all spiritual Masters, if they had realisation in their previous incarnation, it takes a few years to get it back. For me it took twenty years to revise the realisation-book, but I didn't forget totally. Here on earth there are many things that we can totally forget. We have forgotten what we ate even the day before yesterday. We don't remember whether we ate Italian eggplant or Indian food. We can search our memory, but we have forgotten because here it is the physical mind that is operating. But if the soul is operating in and through us, then if at the age of four a significant incident took place, or even a most insignificant incident, we will be able to recollect it because everything is recorded.</p>
<p>I wish to say that the future is not something ahead of us; it is something inside us. The past, the present and the future are like the first rung, the second rung and the third rung of a ladder. Two rungs we have climbed up. Now, to reach the third one is only a matter of time. We can feel that the life-tree which we are climbing is our very existence. The cosmic life-tree is nothing other than our own life. God's eternal Life is our life, our eternal Reality. When we believe that, we become that Reality itself.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the best way to meditate so that we can be spiritually strong? And if we become spiritually weak, how can we regain our strength?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the best way to meditate so that we can be spiritually strong? And if we become spiritually weak, how can we regain our strength?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, there are two ways in which you can keep from losing what I give you. One way is to believe in what you get. You value your material wealth, your money-power. If you have one hundred dollars in your wallet, then you value that money and you are always on the alert so that nobody will snatch it away from you. Now spirituality, spiritual wealth, is infinitely more valuable. Suppose you have received a very high experience in your spiritual life. I gave you a most soulful, most sincere and most powerful smile that gave you abundant joy. Now that inner wealth you will try to treasure. How can you treasure it? By valuing it. You have to value your inner experience as you value your material power, only you have to value it infinitely more. If you value something, then you will never lose it. On rare occasions if you are unguarded, then a robber can take your money. Otherwise, most of the time you do not lose what you have. Then the time comes when you can properly use your money.</p>
<p>There is another way to retain your spiritual wealth, to keep it forever. That is by assimilating it. Once when you get something from me, the real in you will value it. If you get a soulful inner experience, take that experience as a beautiful flower. Then on each petal of this flower you can write the word "gratitude." If you see the world "gratitude" around the entire flower and on each of the petals you also see your gratitude, then this is the strength, the boundless strength, the magnetic power to pull what I wish to give you and to keep the experience lodged inside your heart. When you value something, then automatically your gratitude-flower comes forward. If you start eating gratitude-food daily, then you will never lose anything that I give you.</p>
<p>Again, if you do lose something, do not think that you can get it back tomorrow or at some other indefinite time, whenever you please. Do not leave it for the future. If you feel that you have lost something which you have received, then immediately sit down and concentrate on it, meditate on it, contemplate on it until you get it back. It has to be like the Buddha's determination: "Until the time I get illumination, I am not going to move." The Buddha's illumination was infinitely more important than an ordinary seeker's achievement, but the light that you receive when you regain your experience is most important for you. If you lose something, then you must say, "I am going to get it back. And once I get it back I will not lose it again. No matter if it takes an hour or two hours or three or four, I will remain here until I get it back." I assure you that if you are sincere, then new experience, new divine wealth or spiritual wealth will never be denied you.</p>
<p>Suppose you have got a very solid experience from me. This solid experience can come in different forms. It can come as clarity, purity, security, peace, delight, light or satisfaction. If you have lost security or purity or your sense of perfection, what will you do? In your case, I assure you, the maximum it will take is twenty minutes to get it back. Twenty minutes of your one-pointed concentration, meditation and contemplation will be enough to get it back. During this twenty minutes, you have to feel that you as your individual self do not exist. Only oneness with your Guru exists. You can't say, "This does not exist, that does not exist, nobody exists." You have to feel that you yourself do not exist. If you feel that you don't exist, it doesn't mean that no one else exists. At that time you have to feel that you have what I have and that you are what I am. Then, in twenty minutes I will be able to give you back what you lost. If you have lost anything, any divine quality or any divine experience, whether it is security, divinity, purity, perfection, light, delight or satisfaction, then give me twenty minutes and I will get it back for you. You may get it back in one minute or two minutes or so, but a maximum of twenty minutes it may take to get it back, provided you have concentration, meditation, contemplation only on your Guru. You have to feel that your Guru <em>has</em> what you have lost and your Guru is what you have lost.</p>
<p>Suppose you have lost security. Then immediately feel that your Guru has it. If I <em>have</em> security for you, then I <em>am</em> that security as well. If you have lost purity, then you have to say, "Guru <em>has</em> purity and Guru is purity." If you have lost some perfection, then you say, "Guru <em>has</em> that perfection and Guru is that perfection." Look at my picture and repeat, "Guru has and Guru is." The thing that you have lost, I have; and I am also that very thing. So you will see that in twenty minutes I will return to you what you have lost.</p>
<p>It also depends on the individual. Some of you will take two days, some will take even two months. But in your case, I am telling you that in twenty minutes you will get back everything that you lost. It may happen also that you will not only get back what you have lost, but you may get even more. But that is not your main concern now. The main thing is to get back what you have lost and to build it up again. Let that very quality be the foundation-stone of your aspiration. If you conquer your loss, then you will definitely get back the quality from me.</p>
