<p>From 13½ inch biceps at long last I have come to 15 inches. I hope you people can see it.</p>
<p>I may not have giant muscles, but I do have greed. Today I did more than 100 repetitions with 400 pounds alternating my right and left arms. I am doing them so fast. It is like a jackhammer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since I came back from India a few days ago, my tiredness is killing me. A long journey definitely weakens the muscles.</p>

<p>All my daily lifts I will do up to the maximum so that the guests can see my progress, plus I want to show some new things. In the old days, I lifted pumpkins and all that. If you can come up with new ideas, I will be very happy.</p>

<p>Today, on Unmilan’s birthday, we started our long-cherished-dream contest. A few days ago I lifted up 90 pounds from the ground. So Agraha took my weight and age into consideration and he has made a chart that tells what each one of the guards has to lift to make it equivalent. Savyasachi is the luckiest. He only has to do 106 pounds, but poor Prabhakar has to do 184.</p>
<p>From the ground these boys had to bring the weight up over their shoulder. For three seconds they had to keep it in the air and then they had to bring it down carefully. They were not allowed to drop it. We started with Savyasachi who is by far the strongest and by far the best featherweight. He took a three-second rest on his shoulder, but then he was able to lift it into the air. He is the only one who succeeded.</p>
<p>When it came to Pulak, instead of Pulak Viscardi, I said “Pulak Discardi” — because he was so weak. Kailash did very well. He had 127 pounds and he was able to bring it to the top of his head. Ashrita, Udar, Durdam, Bishwas, Bipin and Prabhakar also did well, but they could not hold it up in the air for three seconds. Now people see how difficult this lift is.</p>

<p>When I was about to lift 270 pounds in each arm for the second time this morning, all of a sudden the light went off. My exercise room became all dark. Then, after four or five minutes, the light came back on, but I forgot to turn on the video machine again to do my lift. It was my highest lift, but because I did not turn the machine back on when darkness disappeared, nothing came out. Alas, alas!</p>

<p>Today in one of my weightlifting prayers I spoke about triumphing over self-doubts and world-criticism. I was about to do the clean and press and I was planning to try 50 pounds in each arm. So self-doubt was coming, “Will it go up?”</p>
<p>Then there was a plane passing very low over my house and making so much noise. That noise was disturbing my concentration. So this was the world-criticism. Instead of criticising the plane, I triumphed over it, and I was able to lift 50 pounds with both arms and do 63 presses once the dumbbells were in the air.</p>
<p>If I can lift up 70 pounds from the ground with each arm simultaneously then I will feel really strong.</p>

<p>This morning, after so many months, I lifted 300 pounds in each arm simultaneously. Can you imagine — 600 pounds is talking! For months and months, 600 and I were not on speaking terms. What was I doing? This proves there is such a thing as God’s Hour. We have to have patience. At what point God will give us the wisdom to go forward, we do not know. Now my dumbbells are one inch further apart. That one inch has made so much difference.</p>

<p>My grip has really improved to hold this much weight in one hand.</p>

<p>Since last night I have had a cramp in my right side in the region of my waist and it is still there. First I tried to use my seated calf machine, but it was out of order. The force that I was applying was exactly the same force that I used to use every time, but today 900 pounds and 1,000 pounds were failures. I feel that one of the plates has slipped somehow.</p>
<p>Then I tried to lift 200 pounds in each arm simultaneously. I was so disgusted with my first attempt. The dumbbells did not move, they did not talk even. Today is my day of misery.</p>

<p>Today I had so much pain in my left knee in addition to the stiffness of my body. But when you are in the battlefield, you cannot disappear. Even if your shield has gone, you have to fight.</p>
<p>Whose body is perfect? Nobody can say that his health is perfect — nobody! In my case, I am dragging my left leg because of my knee problem. Then the other day, while trying to lift 2,000 pounds in the standing calf raise, such a sudden, sharp pain I got on the left side of my buttock.</p>
<p>Now it is only two weeks to my weightlifting performance at York College. I have to be very careful. Perhaps God wants me to take rest!</p>
