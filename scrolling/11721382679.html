<p>At the nursing home, I went to visit a lady who is our family friend. It was at her place that I met our great Ashram sage, Anirvan, when I was very young. She is twenty years older than I am. Her younger son is extremely close to me.</p>
<p>As soon as I went there, she said, "Chinmoy, Chinmoy, Chinmoy, come and bless me. I need your blessingful presence."</p>
<p>I said, "Oh no, I cannot bless you. I am praying to the Mother and Sri Aurobindo to bless you."</p>
<p>Then she said, "Let me see how soft your hand is."</p>
<p>I knew she was playing a trick on me. Her son was there in the room, and he said, "You should allow my mother to touch your hand."</p>
<p>So I gave her my hand. She immediately grabbed it and put it on her head.</p>

<p>I also went to see another old man who was there. He said to me, "Ah, who are you?"</p>
<p>I said, "Chinmoy-da. Do you remember me? I came to the Ashram in 1944, and it was you who taught me how to ride a bicycle."</p>
<p>Then he said to me, "I taught you how to ride a bicycle. Now you are teaching the whole world how to run!"</p>
<p>So that incident he did remember, but when I first stood before him, he could not recognise me!</p>

<p>The main doctor took me from one patient to another, introducing me. One fellow was the funniest. He is now an old man, but in his youth he was very, very strong. The doctor said to him, "This is Chinmoy-da."</p>
<p>"Who is it?" the old man asked.</p>
<p>"Hriday's youngest brother," the doctor replied. Then the old man said to me, "How are you, Hriday? And how is Chinmoy? Oh, I am sorry. Chinmoy is long dead!"</p>

<p>Every day I went at least four or five times to see my sister. I would arrive at eight o'clock and spend an hour or so. I would return at 10:30, and again at 12:30 and six or seven o'clock. When I first arrived in Pondicherry, she could not get up from her bed, but when I went there the following morning, she was ready to walk. About fifteen metres she walked and sat on a chair to chat with me properly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, as she was talking, she said that she did not like the garments that the nursing home had given her to wear. The petticoat was no good and she did not like their nightgowns. I said, "You do not have to worry. I will go and buy some for you."</p>
<p>Immediately I went to the market. I have never bought petticoats before. My sister said that they had to be light and they had to look nice. I went to six or seven stores, begging them to give me very light ones made of cotton or silk. With greatest difficulty, I got six petticoats and six nightgowns, but not from one store. Happily I brought them back to my sister.</p>
<p>But she liked only two nightgowns and one petticoat. Then she said, "Take the rest back to New York."</p>
<p>I said, "I do not take petticoats for the girls."</p>
<p>She said, "No, you have to take them. I do not like them."</p>
<p>Then I told her, "As soon as I go back to New York, I will find light ones, nice ones, and I will immediately send them to you."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The callous nurses</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The callous nurses" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>How callous some nurses can be! My sister wanted to eat at six o'clock, but they do not give food until seven. When I saw that she was so hungry, I tried to talk to the nurses, but they ignored me. I called them, saying, "Sister" or "Hello," but they just passed by me.</p>
<p>I said, "This is too much."</p>
<p>The following day I went to the doctor. The doctor was very kind and full of admiration for me. The doctor got furious: "What can you do with these people? We have some Ashramites here but the rest of the nurses are from outside. They are paid nurses. The paid ones are so bad."</p>
<p>Recently, I sent from New York seven or eight kinds of vitamins for my sister, as well as eggnog, which the Mother took for three years. Three hours before the Mother passed on, the last thing she took was eggnog, according to one of her assistants.</p>
<p>This time I gave more vitamins and eggnog to the doctor, and he assured me that they would give them to my sister. Then I discovered that for two days they did not give anything to my sister. I asked her, and she said, "No, no, they have not given me anything."</p>
<p>When I told the doctor, the doctor got furious. He asked one of the nurses in front of me if she had given the vitamins and the nurse admitted she had not given them. The doctor said to me, "We can only get angry with them. If we fire them, we will have nobody."</p>
<p>One nurse said that they gave the vitamins inside some milk, but my sister did not take the milk. They said, "Is it our fault she did not drink it?"</p>
<p>I said, "Can you not tell my sister when you are giving the vitamins that they are from her brother?" The main doctor told the nurses, "Definitely you have to say these things are from Chinmoy-da."</p>
<p>So they agreed they would tell my sister. Now they do mention it. Three different things they give, and each time my sister knows that it is coming from me.</p>
<p>The two main doctors are so nice. They have such love and admiration for me, but some nurses were so bad!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Glimpses of the other world</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Glimpses of the other world" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I was begging them to keep my sister in the nursing home. Lately for ten days Lily remains in the nursing home, and then for five days or so she goes home. Over the last few months, five or six times she has done this. I begged the doctors, only if she is much better should they allow her to go home. The problem is that as soon as she feels a little better, she fights with the doctors, and then she goes home. At home her condition gets worse. Then they bring her back to the nursing home.</p>
<p>Some days my sister and I would be talking together in a normal way. All of a sudden she would say, "Ah, it is so beautiful, I can see such a beautiful room with flowers, and Hriday and Ahana are there." She would say that my brother and sister, who are no longer alive, were already talking to her.</p>
<p>I would say, "No, they are not here. I do not want that place, I do not like that place."</p>
<p>One moment she is all right, and suddenly she will see my brother Hriday and sister Ahana and a beautiful house filled with flowers. She is having a glimpse of the other world. Otherwise, she is quite normal, but weak.</p>

<p>One day my sister had a fight with the maid, not the nurse. When I went to visit her, my sister made complaints that the maid had struck her. I asked the maid what had happened.</p>
<p>The maid said, "At two o'clock in the morning, she wanted to get out of her bed. I did not want her to get out. Where would she go at that hour? I was not allowing her to get up, so she struck me."</p>
<p>I said, "But my sister is telling me that you struck her."</p>
<p>The maid said, "In order to keep her in the bed, I slapped her three times." I was in between the maid and my sister; both had complaints against the other.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The out-of-order phone</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The out-of-order phone" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>During my entire visit our home phone was out of order. I had to go to a booth outside in the street to place calls. There you have to stand in a long queue. People were making phone calls to Calcutta, Bombay and other places. You can give them the number you want or you can dial it yourself, and it is absolutely as if you are dialing a local number. It is called ISD. Immediately you get a connection, but you have to wait your turn in the queue.</p>
<p>So many times we went to the telephone office to ask them to repair our phone. Then one day one of the men where I made ISD calls said, "Just give them twenty rupees."</p>
<p>I said, "Twenty rupees? Is that all? I am going there immediately."</p>
<p>I went to the office and gave them fifty rupees. They promised it would be fixed. On other days when I went there, they said in a vague way, "Yes, we shall do it."</p>
<p>After some time I tried to call home to see whether they had kept their promise, but the phone was not working. Again, I went to the office. Finally they sent a repair man the day I was leaving. I gave him another forty rupees as soon as he came. I said, "Now start working."</p>
<p>He started, and in ten minutes he fixed it. Then I called the manager in Madras. I said, "Our phone is always out of order."</p>
<p>The manager said, "What do you do?"</p>
<p>I said, "My brother goes to the office here and gives them some money. Then the phone works for two weeks and stops. Then again he goes to the office and gives them money."</p>
<p>The manager said, "That is the mistake your brother makes."</p>
<p>I said, "That is what we have to do. If my brother did not give them any money, God knows how many months they would take."</p>
<p>Everywhere in the Madras-Pondicherry area, the telephone workers disconnect the phones deliberately so that they can get some tip. How horrible they are!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My eternal friendship with the rickshaw world</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My eternal friendship with the rickshaw world" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Now comes the story of my eternal friendship with the rickshaw world. My brother said, "You have so much money. For God's sake, do not argue with the poor rickshaw-wallahs."</p>
<p>I said, "I promise I will not argue with them. I will tell them, 'Whatever you say'."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I would say to the rickshaw-wallahs, "Whatever you say, I will give," they would say, "No, you have to tell."</p>
<p>What could I do? I said, "Last time I gave you ten rupees per hour. This time I am ready to give you fifteen rupees per hour, and each time I hire you, it will be for two hours. So I will give you thirty rupees."</p>
<p>The rickshaw-wallahs were overjoyed: thirty rupees they would get. I told them, "Now, only do me a favour and do the right thing."</p>
<p>Usually four or five rickshaws would be right in front of my house. I would say, "I need only one," but each day at least four would be waiting. Then I had to choose among them. When I chose one, I got the 'blessings' from the others. They would say nasty things to me, and they were ready to beat up the one that I chose. But how could I take four rickshaws?</p>

<p>This time I was saved from two very serious accidents while I was riding in a rickshaw. Once a bicycle came and dashed against the rickshaw. I thought that we would fall down, but the cyclist fell down instead. I told the rickshaw-wallah, "Stop! Let us see whether he is hurt."</p>
<p>He said he would not stop because the cyclist was the one who had dashed against us, and he went on.</p>
<p>The second incident was absolutely the most dangerous. As usual, I was sitting in a relaxed way and my right knee was outside the rickshaw. A motorbike was coming directly towards us on the right side. I thought, "O my God, my right knee will be finished!"</p>
<p>The motorcycle stopped within one foot of the rickshaw. If the driver had come a little closer, my right knee would have been smashed. Luckily, nothing happened and I was saved.</p>

<p>Another day I took a rickshaw early in the morning. A man followed us screaming that he was the owner of that rickshaw. He was asking the rickshaw-wallah to give him twenty rupees. The driver said, "No, I have just started."</p>
<p>The owner said, "Yesterday you did not give me the money. You have to give me twenty rupees at least. Otherwise, I will not allow you to use the rickshaw."</p>
<p>Already I was one mile away from my house. I said, "I am supposed to give the money to the rickshaw-wallah. Instead, let me give the money to you."</p>
<p>But the rickshaw-wallah, the one who was pulling me, said, "No, if you give him the money, he will not give it to me."</p>
<p>There was a fight between the owner and the rickshaw-wallah. The owner did not want him to drive the rickshaw. Poor me! I was completely lost between the two. I was ready to give the money. The one who was driving was asking me not to give the owner money, but the owner wanted to have money from me. I said, "I really do not know what to do."</p>
<p>Finally the owner went away, hating this fellow, and we continued on to the nursing home. When I came out after two hours, I gave the driver his money. I had said that I would give thirty rupees, but then I would always give the drivers forty rupees to make them happy.</p>

<p>It would take ten minutes to bring me to the nursing home, and the rickshaw-wallah was supposed to wait for me. I booked the drivers for two hours. One day I took a rickshaw to the nursing home, and before I went upstairs, I said to the driver, "Please stay here."</p>
<p>The driver said, "Definitely I will wait."</p>
<p>I saw my sister, and we talked and talked for half an hour. Then the nurses said that they had to bathe her. I said, "Then let me go out, and afterwards I will come back."</p>
<p>The weather was so unbearably hot. It was the coldest season, they said, but for me it was so hot. When I went down, there was no rickshaw. I walked for about half a mile in the hot sun looking for a rickshaw, and eventually I found another one, so I got in. I said, "Now drive me to a place where I can get something to eat."</p>
<p>On this trip I did not eat at home. My cousins were so sad and upset. I said it was difficult for me to eat at home because my sister was not there. I used to take idli or masala dosa and tea at a particular restaurant. The driver was taking me there. After we had covered practically a mile and a half, the driver that first brought me saw us and started screaming, "I am your driver. I am coming back to get you."</p>
<p>I said, "Now, look here, already a mile and a half I have covered. What were you doing?"</p>
<p>The man said, "I was hungry. I went to eat."</p>
<p>I said, "You were not supposed to be there waiting for me?" Instead of replying, the first driver began screaming at the second, asking him to leave so that I could go into the first rickshaw. I said, "I am not going into your rickshaw.You have fooled me."</p>
<p>There was a real fight between the two. Then the first one said, "Now you have to give me ten rupees, since I brought you to the nursing home."</p>
<p>I got so mad. I said, "I am going to give you five rupees. You brought me, but it was only a ten-minute ride, so I am giving you five rupees." I was so mad that I had to walk so far in that heat.</p>
<p>I gave him the five rupees. We did not go even twenty metres, before the first driver came again, saying, "It is false, false! It is no good, no good." He gave me back my five rupees.</p>
<p>I said, "All right," and I gave him another five rupees. I threw away the 'false' coin that he had returned. Then the driver came down from his rickshaw and collected the first coin.</p>
<p>I said, "I knew it was not false. You wanted to have ten rupees. For God's sake, take your ten rupees!"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The story continues</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The story continues" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I went to the restaurant to eat. I ordered rose milk, masala dosa and tea. The street was right in front of me, not even ten metres away. I saw that there were many drivers keeping their cycles and rickshaws at that place. The restaurant gave me very fast service. In three or four minutes they gave me the food, and another ten minutes I took to finish my meal. I ate very happily.</p>
<p>When I went back to the rickshaw, the fellow told me his sad story: he had gone out to eat. When he came back, somebody had taken away the cushion or seat of the rickshaw. People were saying that the place was illegal, so the police had come and taken it away.</p>
<p>I looked at the seat inside the rickshaw. Now it was a hard surface, and it was so uneven. I said, "I will not be able to sit there. I am giving you the money because the seat is gone. I will find another rickshaw."</p>
<p>He said, "No, if you do not go with me to prove that I was waiting for you, the police will not give me my seat back."</p>
<p>I said, "What am I going to do with this fellow? He is begging me. If I do not go with him to the police station, he will not get the pillow back."</p>
<p>The police station was out of my way. It was God knows where! We were driving and driving, and I was being tortured because of the hard seat. I have such a bad back. Sometimes I tried not to sit; I stayed two or three inches above the wood because it was hurting me. And in three places there were nails! Usually the pillow covers everything. This is how I was enjoying my journey.</p>
<p>I decided that since the police had taken the pillow away, whatever the police charged, I would give the money to the driver. He also had a bald head. I said, "Poor fellow."</p>
<p>We went to the police station and asked the police for the pillow. The police scolded and insulted him: "As if we have nothing else to do than to bring your pillow her!" Then I spoke to the police chief. He said, "No, we do not do this kind of thing."</p>
<p>Some people had told the driver that the police took it away, but it was not true. Then I was begging him, "Please, this time take me to my house."</p>
<p>For another fifteen minutes we drove on, and I could not sit because it was all wood and nails. He did not get his pillow. I think the other fellow, the first driver, followed us and removed the pillow to punish me because I did not wait for him. When we reached my home at long last, instead of thirty, I gave the driver fifty rupees. I said, "God knows when he will get his pillow."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Lord Krishna&#039;s favourite flower</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Lord Krishna&#039;s favourite flower" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day when I was in a rickshaw going home, a lady said to me, "Chinmoy-da, stop, stop."</p>
<p>I could not recognise her. She asked, "How are you?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am fine."</p>
<p>She said, "No, you are not fine."</p>
<p>I asked, "Why?"</p>
<p>She told me, "Because I can see. Your eyes are red and something is wrong with you."</p>
<p>I said, "I have got a little fever, but there is nothing wrong."</p>
<p>She had a few flowers. She gave me one flower which was the most favourite flower of Lord Krishna when he used to meet with the gopis. She said, "Here, this is Krishna's most favourite flower. If you take it and put it on your head, then you will be all right."</p>
<p>I said, "Even now I cannot recognise you."</p>
<p>She said, "You cannot recognise me because you are so great. How will you remember? Do you remember Kanak?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>She said, "I was very young. You were so fond of my uncle. Do you remember my uncle?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes. I was so fond of Joganananda."</p>
<p>She told me, "I was one of his nieces. Now do you recognise me?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, where are Bokul and the others?"</p>
<p>She said, "They are all out of the Ashram. They are not here. They got married, this and that, but I am still here. I remember you. You take this flower and you will be all right." So I was very nice to her. In those days she was so thin, but now she has become extremely fat.</p>

<p>I had gone another half a mile, when another girl called out: "Chinmoy-da, stop, stop!"</p>
<p>I said, "I am sorry, but I do not know you."</p>
<p>She said, "You do not know me, but I know you. I work with your cousin Soma at the Ashram press. I have read some of your books. You were brought up here. You are such a great man. I have been begging her to bring me to your place, but she will not listen. She says she comes to your place and she does not see you. You are such a big shot, you do not speak to people."</p>
<p>I said, "Fine, fine. Whatever my cousin has said is true."</p>
<p>She said, "I want to speak to you."</p>
<p>I said, "I am sorry, but I am very busy with my sister."</p>
<p>She said, "All right, since I have seen you, I am very happy. Now I can feel that I have seen a really great man."</p>
<p>She never saw me at the Ashram when I lived there. She came afterwards.</p>
