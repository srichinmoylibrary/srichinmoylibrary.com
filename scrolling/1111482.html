  <h2 id="page-title">Sri Chinmoy Lauf</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Sri Chinmoy Lauf" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I was in Switzerland in June 1980, the Olympic gold medalist Emil Zatopek and his wife came to visit us.</p>
<p>On the second day of his visit we had a Sri Chinmoy Run. The disciples had found a very beautiful course around a lake with two or three small loops and one big loop. Zatopek was supposed to start the race. He was so enthusiastic, as if he were running himself. He called out, "Where is the gun?" He was screaming, "No gun? No gun?"</p>
<p>We said, "We don't use a gun."</p>
<p>Then his wife said, "You don't need a gun."</p>
<p>When his wife said that, Zatopek said, "All right, I will clap."</p>
<p>The race was to start on a small bridge. There were a little over two hundred people on the bridge. They were standing under a big banner saying "Sri Chinmoy Lauf." "Lauf" means race. Zatopek was standing on one side. He started the race by saying something in German, ending with a final clap. When he clapped, everybody clapped, and the race started.</p>
<p>All the London disciples — even elderly women — were running. Our very good runners were also there. Among the disciples, Sundar came in first and then Janaka. But they were defeated by local Swiss boys. I was not feeling well and was running last, behind everybody.</p>
<p>When I ran along the small loops, Zatopek was so excited. He was clapping like anything. His wife stood up also and was clapping and clapping, although I was running behind everybody.</p>
<p>Some of the girls who are useless runners kept taking shortcuts at the places where the monitors where directing them around the loops. I told them later that they were all rogues. If they were supposed to run around someone who was standing in one place, instead they cut across. They saved fifty or seventy metres on four occasions. I was so disgusted. On one loop, at least two hundred metres they didn't run. They took a shortcut. What were they doing? Just because they were third class runners, they felt nobody would pay any attention.</p>
<p>When it was over, Zatopek gave the prizes. I was so embarrassed. The first, second and third prize trophies were of the same size, with the same figure. Only it was mentioned on the trophy, "first" or "second" or "third." I said, "How can it be?"</p>
<p>John announced the winner's name and handed the trophy to Zatopek, who handed it to the person. To each person who came up for a trophy, Zatopek had something encouraging to say. He was very, very nice. There were also health food prizes — honey and other things — for the winners. Zatopek was so happy to see that we had health food for the winners. After he gave each person his trophy, he pointed to the health food so happily and said, "Take this. You select."</p>
<p>I thanked both Zatopek and his wife, and Zatopek spoke, appreciating us. Then he came up to me and grabbed my hand and said, "Our Guru, this is the best." That was his comment. The race and the atmosphere — everything — pleased him, so he said, "Our Guru, this is the best."</p>
<p>The Mayor of Zurich, who comes from Canada, sent his assistant to honour me. He came with a proclamation and he spoke so highly of me for about seven or eight minutes. All of a sudden, his wife, who was very tall — much taller than her husband — came and gave me a huge bouquet. She was smiling at me. The husband said, "She wants to offer you this bouquet." So I took it and I thanked her.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The rainy race</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The rainy race" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>At the Pan American Masters Games in September 1980 I was supposed to join in the 100-metre dash. Just before the race, it started raining. Many others didn't run because of the rain, but I wanted to show off. At the race they had starting blocks. During my 20 years of competing in India, I had never used starting blocks. I lost my balance at the start and I was last. God wanted me to have this experience.</p>
<p>Once upon a time I was first — for 16 years. But here, there was at least a 50-metre gap between the first runner and me. The audience was enjoying the fact that there was such a gap between us.</p>
<p>On the board it was mentioned, "Sri Chinmoy, Puerto Rico." The Puerto Rican disciples were so delighted. I had said that I was not going to run the 400-metre dash, but they didn't listen. My name still appeared on the board: "Sri Chinmoy, Puerto Rico."</p>

<p>After the race, a thin, tall black man came up to me and said, "Guru, don't you remember me? The other day I ran 800 metres with you."</p>
<p>Then I recognised him. He was in the Randall's island race in New York City. I had told Danny to videotape him. I said, "Yes, you ran extremely well. I was far, far behind." He is national champion in his age category. He was so happy to see me. He couldn't believe that I was in Puerto Rico. At Randall's island he ran a 2:10 and my timing was three minutes. But in India in the 800 metres I had stood first.</p>
<p>In half an hour again he came up to me just to chat. In the Pan American Games he defeated everyone in the 800, but in the 100 he didn't get a place. So, he said nice things and I said nice things.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A Puerto Rican runner</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A Puerto Rican runner" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>On the plane coming back from Puerto Rico I was sitting in the first seat of the front row. One of the stewardesses said, "Please let me take the bag that is in front of you until the plane is in the air. Then I will bring it back."</p>
<p>So I gave it to her. Then there was an announcement that the plane would be delayed for twenty minutes. When I went to the stewardess to get some books out of the bag, a tall man came and stood in front of me and said, "Master, Master, why didn't you run yesterday in the half-marathon?"</p>
<p>I said, "I couldn't do the 400-metre dash. How could I have done the half-marathon?"</p>
<p>He said, "Your races are so good because they are held early in the morning. I always enter your races. Early in the morning I run."</p>
<p>There the half-marathon was held at three-thirty in the afternoon, so he didn't run. And he is Puerto Rican! Puerto Ricans are accustomed to that kind of heat.</p>
<p>So you see, if you start races early in the morning, there will be at least one person who will be happy and grateful.</p>
<p>He said, "Your students, your disciples, are so good."</p>
<p>Another stewardess happened to be there and she said, "Because the Master is good, the disciples are good." Then she said, "Master, I have been to your meetings quite a few times, but now it is different. At the meditations you are very distant. It is good, but you are somewhere else. Now you are talking."</p>
<p>I said, "At that time I meditate."</p>
<p>She said, "Yes, that's why you are so distant."</p>

<p>Yesterday while playing tennis I saw a woman running very slowly. I am sure she was going at a twenty-minute pace, at least. She had to lose about forty pounds, but she was going on, going on. You should have seen how slowly she was running! I was admiring her patience and perseverance.</p>

<p>This morning I was running twelve miles down Main Street to Northern Boulevard. Hundreds of people were waiting for the bus on Main Street; I could hardly run. Then I saw two lame men who were walking with canes, one after the other. I said, "God, I can't blame You anymore. I can't make complaints to You about my running anymore." How could I make complaints to God when I was running so many miles and these two men were walking with canes?</p>

<p>Today I was playing tennis and Chetana was running at the Jamaica High School track. At times she was so clever. Whenever she came near me, she started running faster. Then, when she was on the other side of the track, she went so slowly that she looked like she was walking. I didn't envy her speed.</p>

<p>Two-mile races are my favourites because I am always able to finish them. I enjoy running a two-mile race but for a one-mile race I don't have the speed. Out of fifty two-mile races we are having this year, at least thirty I will run.</p>
<p>In the last race, as I was approaching the turnaround point I saw Karabi and Cathy. They were only twenty metres ahead of me. It was tempting to try to catch them! But it's easy to forget that you have to run another twenty metres before you even reach the turnaround!</p>
<p>Then I was going back on one side and Hashi was coming on the other side. My ego went so high! I also saw Nayana and a few others behind me. Then I saw Chameli very far behind. I said, "You! In the 26-mile New York Marathon, you smiled at me and after 17 miles you went ahead of me." She was smiling in this race also.</p>
<p>For most of the race I was a little ahead of Gayatri. Because of my fever I never had any energy. When Gayatri went ahead of me, I didn't have any power left. I made a sincere surrender to her.</p>

<p>Today I was watching the Seven-Mile Reversible Race in Central Park. Two middle-aged men were running. I was standing at the side watching when they passed by me. I think their timing was better than my best timing for seven miles. Suddenly, both of them turned around and said, "Sri Chinmoy!" They did not ask me, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?" No! They were saying, "Sri Chinmoy!" They were so surprised to see me. When they first passed by me, they did not recognise me. Then, after three or four steps, they turned around and greeted me.</p>
<p>Then a black woman came up to me and said, "Sri Chinmoy, do you have the time?" I could not tell her the time. I was wearing my yellow stopwatch which does not have the regular time. So she smiled at me.</p>

<p>After the race a tall, thin gentleman came up to me and said, "Do you remember me, Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>At first I thought, "How am I going to remember who he is, even though I am looking at him?" Then I remembered that his name was John Graham. He was formerly with the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. It was he who wrote a letter to the U.S. State Department arranging for my talk there last year, and I thanked him deeply.</p>
<p>He said, "I was glad to be of help to you." He told me his timing for the seven-mile race. It was about an eight-minute pace. My timing is better for seven miles, but I didn't tell him.</p>
<p>Before he left the U.S. Mission, I gave him an interview after one of our meetings at the United Nations. During the interview he had asked me how he could bring forward and utilise his power. So I had given him an answer and he had remembered it. He had even memorised some of my words and he quoted them to me.</p>
<p>After he left the U.N. he went to India to give lectures on "How to change the world." He was at Gandhi's ashram. For seventeen years he has been in politics. Now he has learned about spirituality and he is a real seeker. Still he is giving lectures. His theme is always "How to change the world."</p>

<p>Tom Curtin did so well in the Seven-Mile Reversible Race. Out of 500 people he stood tenth, and he was sixth in his age category. He never smiles, but today he came up to me smiling and said, "Guru, I stood tenth."</p>
<p>I said, "I am so proud of you."</p>
<p>He said, "I am getting a trophy, but I have to wait an hour for it."</p>
<p>I told him, "You should wait for it."</p>

<p>Tony ran twenty miles in Central Park and then he ran with me for three miles. When we came to the hill, he said, "Guru, this is 'heartbreak hill.' " But he had already run twenty miles. Still, his speed was quite good. I ran five miles altogether.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday I was running back from a four-mile run. A fat old man stopped me and said, "You are still running! You don't want to grow old."</p>
<p>I wish to say that people who aspire will never become old. They will always remain children in the Heart of our Beloved Supreme.</p>
