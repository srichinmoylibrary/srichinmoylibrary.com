<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The sadness that you are feeling is quite natural, because you were in a higher world and then you had to come down to this practical world, to the earthly level. At that time, worries and problems of the world entered into you. But if you meditate for a few years, these worries will not stand in your way, because by that time they will be overcome. Then, when you come down from your meditation, you will have tremendous peace, poise, joy and love for humanity. When you have tremendous love for humanity, at that time you will not feel exhausted. Right now you have boundless love for your child. But there is no end to our love. After you have meditated for a few years, you will have much more love for your child because you will feel the presence of God inside him. Right now you do not feel the presence of God inside your child all the time. If he is naughty or if he breaks something, then you don’t think that the God inside him is operating. At that time you are exasperated. You simply say, “No, no, this is not God; this is the devil incarnate.” But there will come a time when you will see God inside your son all the time, no matter what he does or what he says. That will be your own progress. It is only a matter of time. Then, when you come down from your meditation, you will not feel drained. On the contrary, if you meditate well, there will be no pulling and no pushing. Right after your meditation, when you enter into the ordinary life, you will be able to maintain the same joy, delight, peace and poise.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part V: Questions and answers on meditation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part V: Questions and answers on meditation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Is it important to meditate only at our shrine at home, or can we try to meditate wherever we are?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life there is a gradual progress. From a little child we become twelve or thirteen years old; then, when we are eighteen or nineteen or twenty-five, we reach our capacity in physical strength. Similarly, when we first launch into the spiritual life, we have to be very careful. We have to meditate in front of our shrine in our room. In addition, we should have a fixed hour for our meditation and we should always be punctual. A tree starts out as a seed then it becomes a tiny plant, then a tree. When it becomes a huge tree, it is not so easy to destroy. But when it is a tiny plant, it can easily be destroyed, so we put a fence around it to protect it.</p>
<p>When we are just beginning to follow a spiritual path, we should meditate at home, alone, in front of a shrine. If we have a Master, we should keep the Master’s picture on the shrine, and also candles and flowers to purify our consciousness. Also we should burn incense for purity. And if we have a Master, we will come and meditate with the other disciples of our Master. Then only will we gain strength.</p>
<p>But after we have meditated very sincerely for several years, we will develop some inner strength. At that time, while we are walking along the street or riding in the subway, our inner being will be strong, unimaginably strong so that we will not be affected at all. If we are advanced, while we are driving the car we will be able to meditate. Nothing will distract us. While we are in the subway, there will be thousands of people around us, but we will not be affected.</p>
<p>So we have to know what our standard is. If we are beginners, absolute beginners, then everything will stand in our way. If there is a noise, immediately it will distract our attention. But when we are strong, nothing can bother us. So before we are strong, it is better to meditate at home before a shrine with flowers, so that we can get purity and devoted feelings and aspiration. Then we will strengthen our inner nerves and our inner muscles.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can you ever tell if you are going to have a good meditation before you start meditating?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can you ever tell if you are going to have a good meditation before you start meditating?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In your class at school, I am sure that you are a brilliant student. Again, there are some students in your class who do not do well at all. Similarly, in the Centre, the disciples who are meditating in front of me are all sitting in the same class. Some are good, some are very good and some are excellent. Again, some are bad, some are worse, and some are absolutely the worst. How have the good students become good students? It is because they have been meditating for a long time. You are a good student at your college because you study at home. Some of your friends do not study at all; that is why they do not do well at school. In the spiritual life also, you have to know that some students meditate almost every day. They meditate without fail, morning, noon, and evening. When they meditate with all their heart and soul, God is pleased with them and gives them some divine capacity so that they can meditate well every day.</p>
<p>Good students are bound to know whether they are going to have a good meditation or not. But bad students who do not meditate naturally will not know. Somebody who has meditated many years is like an expert runner. He will know that he is going to win the race, because he knows that he has the capacity. How did he become the best runner? He practised hard. Some of you are praying and meditating most sincerely, while others are not. The sincere disciples will get from God additional capacity, and with that capacity they can know that they are going to meditate well.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it bad for someone to fall asleep after meditation if he is meditating at three or four in the morning?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it bad for someone to fall asleep after meditation if he is meditating at three or four in the morning?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it is not bad at all. If you have to sleep after meditation, you can go to sleep, but if you can continue meditating until five and not go to sleep, that is infinitely better. But something is better than nothing. If you can meditate for an hour, then you can assimilate the results of your meditation afterwards. But if you go immediately to sleep after meditating, and if you get up at nine or ten o’clock, then there may be more difficulty. Between six and seven in the morning, your consciousness becomes agitated by your own vital forces or the aggression of the earth. So the agitation from the earth’s consciousness or from your own lower vital can come into the results of your meditation, which you had earlier.</p>
<p>So you have to be very careful. Suppose you have meditated from two to three. Then you can sleep again from three to five. Then again you should wake up. Otherwise, the agitated consciousness of earth can create a disturbance.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know what kind of thoughts you are talking about. You cannot confuse divine thoughts and progressive thoughts with destructive thoughts. If you have some divine thoughts, then you can build your spiritual palace on these thoughts. Again, thought can only take you so far. But when it is will-power, you have to know that this will-power has tremendous strength. Will-power comes directly from the soul; it is the soul’s light.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, if you go deep within, you can easily know. There are various levels of the mind, starting with the physical mind. We have the intuitive mind, the overmind, the supermind and so forth. So you have to know from which plane you are operating. An ordinary human being does not know, but a spiritual man knows from which plane he is operating. Whenever he does something, he knows whether he is doing it from his physical mind, intuitive mind, higher mind or overmind. So in your case, if you want to act from the intuitive mind, let us say, then by your aspiration you should be able to stay there all the time.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I keep my hands raised and folded, it means that I am invoking peace, light and bliss for my disciples and for the seekers. And also I do something else. With my inner cry I try to lift up my disciples, that is, to raise their consciousness. On the one hand, I look up and bring down the infinite Grace and Compassion of the Supreme. On the other hand, with my fervent prayer, my inner prayer, I try to raise the consciousness of the disciples. I do two things at a time. I bring down and I lift up. I bring down peace, light and bliss and I lift the disciples up so that they can climb up with me.</p>
<p>Inside me is the consciousness of all the disciples. The consciousness of the disciples within me is like a mounting cry rising to the Highest. So when I invoke the Supreme with folded hands, the aspiring consciousness which I have with the disciples goes up and the realised consciousness which I have with the Supreme comes down and they meet together.</p>
<p>When I meditate, when I invoke the Supreme with my hands folded, my sincere disciples are all inside me, so I raise them to the Highest with my own inner power, with my intense inner capacity, as far as they can go, according to their receptivity. And at the same time, I have the capacity to enter into the Highest, whom I call the Supreme. So from Him I bring down all divine qualities. I act like a beggar at that time. With folded hands I pray to the Supreme: “Please give my Your wealth for Your spiritual children.” Again, I ask the disciples here: “Please come up, let us see the Father, our eternal Father.” I am in between. My disciples are all younger brothers and sisters, so I carry them to our Father, to our Source, the Absolute Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In some cases, the consciousness has generally gone higher. Even when they are not meditating, they are doing something else spiritual, and their consciousness remains high because they have established something permanent in the spiritual life. In other cases, only during the time of meditation, at the height of their meditation, has the consciousness gone higher. In the first category, the consciousness is raised during meditation and also during their normal activities. I am very grateful to them. They go up in their morning meditation and start the race. Then they continue running during the day. They work all day, and even at night, instead of watching television or listening to the radio, they work for the mission. They are constantly sacrificing and doing selfless service.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation and gratitude are two different things. Meditation is like turning on a machine. You have gone to a printing press and turned it on, but you have not put in paper or anything. The machine is running and running, but nothing is coming out. The machine can run forever, but if the Supreme does not put anything into the machine, then you do not get any result. Again, if God has placed paper inside the machine and the machine is printing, then because of the result you offer your gratitude. If you do not get anything then you will not offer any gratitude. So in meditation you turn the machine on, but in gratitude you feel that God has done something within you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to raise your consciousness is through inner cry. Then, in order to maintain your consciousness there on the highest level, you have to establish considerable purity in the vital. First, with you inner cry, your aspiration, you go up; then, through purity in the vital you will be able to stay there for good.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation depends on the individual standard. If you are a beginner in the field of meditation, you will meditate in one way and if you are advanced, naturally you will meditate in a different way. It depends on the individual standard, on the progress you have made.</p>
<p>For a beginner it is better to start with concentration. Otherwise, the moment you start meditating, millions of uncomely thoughts will enter into your mind. You will not be able to meditate for one second, whereas if you concentrate, you challenge the wrong thoughts entering into you.</p>
<p>Concentration gives us the capacity of intensity, and meditation gives us the capacity of vastness and sublimity. If you feel that you are to some extent advanced, then without concentration you can enter into meditation. Try to make your mind calm, quiet and vacant. Allow no thought into your mind, and then feel you are an express train which is constantly running and running, not stopping at any station. In meditation, try to feel you are a train running very fast towards your destination, and your goal is constantly transcending its own limit. Each time the train reaches the so-called goal, feel that it is only the starting point for your further goal. This is meditation. But for the beginner, instead of meditation, it is advisable to start with concentration.</p>
