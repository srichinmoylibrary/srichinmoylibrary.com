  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we remain happy in the face of obstacles?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we remain happy in the face of obstacles?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Make progress. Just because there are hurdles, will you give up the race? Between you and the goal there are a few obstacles, but you have to overcome them. If you say, "I don't want to overcome the obstacles, but I want to reach the goal," how can you expect to do it? If you are just at the starting point, you have to be prepared to encounter difficulties. When you have to cross a difficult hurdle, You will see whether you really want to reach the goal or not.</p>
<p>This is not actually a test; but if you do not encounter any obstacles, you will not value the goal. If God comes and stands in front of you at this moment, you will not value Him; nobody will value Him. In order to value Him, you have to work and strive and struggle for Him. God can come and give you realisation immediately, but you will not know how to value it properly. One great spiritual Master had a nephew who used to serve him in every way. When he gave this nephew just an iota of his own realisation, the nephew immediately said, "You and I have become one now in spiritual height." He felt that there was no need for him to serve his Guru anymore. In your case also, if you are not prepared, you will not value God. The goal is God. You have to make full inner preparation. What I call preparation in the real spiritual sense, your ordinary mind will call an obstacle.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the physical plane, yes; on the mental plane, no. Suppose you have a very bad headache or cold. If you have a good meditation, you will actually have real inner happiness while on the outer plane you may still have a headache. If your happiness is very strong and powerful, it can either take away the physical ailment, or take away the unhappiness that that ailment is causing you on the outer plane. Again, a physical ailment can be transformed into happiness itself if you have happiness in your inner world. If you are very strong, you will be able to transform physical misery.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible. Everything is divinely or undivinely contagious. Not only does the sadness or depression of others affect us, but their happiness also can easily enter into us. It is not only possible; it is inevitable. If you stay with a bad person, his badness is contagious. If you stay with a good person, his goodness is also contagious. Why do birds of a feather flock together? Because consciously they help each other. Your husband does not follow the spiritual life, but your very presence will give him joy in a very small measure. If you are happy, then eventually he also can become happy. But if he tries and cries, then he will have happiness sooner.</p>
<p>Sometimes, some of you come here feeling very unhappy. But after you mix with your spiritual brothers and sisters and meditate with me in your spiritual home, then you become happy. We try to create a spiritual atmosphere, and from that atmosphere you get happiness. You didn't have happiness, but some individuals had it. By mixing with them, you have caught their happiness, like a contagious disease.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are unhappy, then pray to the Supreme for happiness. If you have restlessness, then pray for peace of mind. If you have a pain in your leg, you do not pray to God to cure your head. Your head is all right, so you pray to God to cure your leg. Here also, your disease is unhappiness. What you need to cure it is happiness. In peace of mind there is happiness, true; but peace of mind belongs to a different category. When your whole being is restless, when you can't meditate even for a fleeting second, when you are full of worries, anxieties and negative qualities, then what you need is peace of mind. If you do have real peace of mind, then naturally happiness will also be there.</p>
<p>You have to know where you are most affected and take care of that place first. Then afterwards you can examine the entire being. If your finger is hurt, take care of your finger. Afterwards, you can take exercise to improve the condition of your whole body. If your whole body is in perfect condition, your finger won't hurt. But when you are suffering at a particular place, try to administer medicine there.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For a few minutes after you wake up, for four or five minutes, don't get up; just meditate in bed. Before you leave the bed, it is always advisable to think of the Supreme for a few minutes. Then get up and do your proper meditation. But you have to be sure you get up in three or four minutes. Otherwise, you will just go back to sleep and you will say that you have meditated for two hours.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are happy, it will help you to a great extent. If you are unhappy, you won't make any progress at all. On the contrary, you will be marching backwards. Real outer happiness is not self-deception. It does not come from wasting time and indulging in pleasure-life. Real outer happiness is something totally different. It comes from inner joy and inner satisfaction.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. If you are happy, share with your near and dear ones. But first see if they are receptive, if they want to receive from you. Out of jealousy or for malicious reasons, they may not want to accept your happiness. Then it is a mere waste. And if you see somebody who is really hostile to you, or with whom you do not have any inner affinity, it is useless to try to share happiness with that person. Do share, but only if others are receptive. If not, then you are only wasting your inner wealth. They are not going to get any benefit, and you are going to give away some of your own happiness. When happiness is received, light and knowledge will increase. When it is not received, nothing at all is gained.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Guru, sometimes when I don't see you for a long time and I sit down to meditate on your picture, I feel there is a block that does not let me feel your love and concern that is flowing to me. I feel that you are displeased with me and that you have reason to be so.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Perfection is very good, and it is something that I deeply appreciate. But what happens is that you give more value than you should to a perfection that is beyond your capacity. You see that you may have a little impurity, a little jealousy, and you are discouraged. But you have to know that total perfection is beyond your capacity right now. It is like this. A child can learn A, B and C in one day. But it is beyond his capacity to learn from A to Z in one day. If he tries, he may get the A, B and C part, but then all the rest will make no sense. In your case, what happens is that you start to push or pull for what you consider perfection, but that perfection is twenty steps ahead of you. You have covered already a great distance, and you see your goal in front of you. So you think that you should be able to reach it at once, although you may be tired and your capacity is limited. But, like a runner nearing his goal, there is a limit to how fast you can go. Like a runner, you must be careful not to fall just before you reach the finishing line.</p>
<p>The block that you see does not come from me, and it does not come from you. It is a hostile attack that wants to take you away from my life and separate you from my love and my light. Forces like this want to make you unhappy. You set up a standard and say that only if something is done in this way is it perfection. But it is not good to allow your mind to calculate your progress or shape your goal. Your mind says that if you have this experience, then you will call it light; if you have another experience, then you will call it peace or power. But light itself is power. Peace is power. If you had real peace, then the atom bomb could drop down right next to you and you would not hear it. Certainly that kind of peace is power. In each thing is found all. So do not try to put everything in a certain place or call it by a certain name. Do not try to give reality a certain shape or form. Do not wait for the mind to be convinced; do not wait for the mind to measure your progress or your goal. The Supreme will show you reality according to His Will.</p>
<p>There are different ways to score a goal in a game. In soccer you can use your left foot, or your right foot, or your head. You should let God make the decision as to whether you will use your right foot or left foot or head. Before you aim, invoke the Presence of the Supreme's Eye. Then the mental sense of perfection will not enter. Then the mind will not say, "Only if you do this, or experience this, are you achieving perfection."</p>
<p>You must let God's Grace take you to the goal. Put all importance in the Compassion and Grace of the Supreme. If you don't try to shape your goal or measure the distance ahead of you, and if you let the Supreme act in and through you, then your goal and your soul will meet together. The Supreme's Grace will be able to work inside you and the Supreme's Grace will achieve everything for you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Although I am sure that this is my path and I get intense joy in my heart from my devotion to you, sometimes I feel a strong longing for a quiet, monastic life. Where does that longing come from, and if it has a negative origin, how can I best overcome it?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Although I am sure that this is my path and I get intense joy in my heart from my devotion to you, sometimes I feel a strong longing for a quiet, monastic life. Where does that longing come from, and if it has a negative origin, how can I best overcome it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In your case, this longing for a monastic life comes from the jealous, deceptive vital — not from the frustrated vital, no, but from the deceptive vital. Right now your heart is getting boundless joy from your devoted selfless service at the Centre because you are working very, very hard to please me. Because your heart is getting such joy, your vital is jealous and is trying to convince you that there is much more joy somewhere else. It is telling you that you must go to a cave in the Himalayas in order to meditate and realise God. This is a very ancient path. It was your path once, but it is not your path today. It is not necessary; it is not correct today.</p>
<p>If austerity and self-denial were the way to realisation, then you ought to cut off your arms, then your nose, and your ears and your legs. You should cut off limb after limb in order to realise God. Then we would say: "He has really achieved self-denial." It is the same with the old kind of monastic life. If you go and sit in a cave in the Himalayas, do not think that realisation will be waiting for you like a ripe fruit which you can just go and eat. No. This is not possible today.</p>
<p>Perhaps if someone is living a very materialistic life — like those people who say, "Eat, drink and be merry!" — and one wishes to change, then it would be good to lead a monastic life for a very brief period. But that is all. One must strike a balance. One need not build a Taj Mahal in order to meditate every day; but it is not necessary to go to a cave either. Today one should live in a small apartment or a house — very simple, but not austere.</p>
<p>So what you are experiencing is just your vital trying to pull you away from your chosen path because it is jealous of your heart's progress. Everywhere we see this. The father is jealous of the son's progress. First the father teaches the son. But after some years the son goes to a university and gets a degree. Then he can teach even his father. So you must change your teacher. Up until now, you have been a very devoted student of your mind and vital, and now they are jealous of your heart's joy. You must tell them to become one with the heart or else you will have no need for them. You have to use everything in a divine way. Instead of using your legs to kick somebody, walk five miles to do that person a service. Instead of slapping someone, caress him, and so on. Force the other parts of your being to become one with your heart and enter into its boundless joy at having accepted our path.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are different approaches. Some individuals make progress little by little. At each stage, they try to embody or manifest on the outer, material plane whatever they have inwardly acquired or achieved. These follow a prescribed course, step by step. Others wish to attain the Goal without any effort. In particular, they do not like the aspect of service on earth for humanity. They do not like the path; they only long for the Goal.</p>
<p>In your case, you have followed our path for some years and have made gradual progress. When you follow our path and have made some progress, the hostile forces — even the deities — bring down the Goal right in front of your head. It is a kind of temptation, let us say. It is like a parent who brings a toy which is up near the ceiling right down before the child's face. When the child grabs for it, the parent pulls it away thinking that the child will not value it. But a day comes when the child grows taller and gets a ladder that reaches the ceiling and he is able to get the toy by himself.</p>
<p>You have to understand this kind of temptation on three planes: the vital plane, the mental plane and the psychic plane. You have to know the difference between the formations of the vital, mind and heart. Temptation in the vital is deception. Temptation in the mind is illusion. But temptation in the heart is ultimately illumination because the heart sees through the illusion and the fantasy of the mind and envisions the Reality itself. The heart will only feel gratitude to the Supreme for bringing the Goal in front of it without any effort on its part. The heart says, "Supreme, I thank You because, out of Your infinite Compassion and Concern, You have given me the vision of my Goal.</p>
<p>What can you do when the Goal is in front of you? You may try to grasp it; that is the human reaction. The divine reaction is to be ready to drink the Nectar, but to wait for God's chosen Hour. At God's choice Hour, the illusion of the mind and the deception of the vital have to go. At that time, the heart knows that the Goal is being offered by the Supreme Himself.</p>
<p>When you have the vision of Nirvana in your mind, you take a mental delight in everything. You may say: "Oh, how divine! Everything is full of such peace, light and bliss, and I will have it all at my disposal." But with the heart it is a different story; there is no mental fantasy in the heart. In the heart you don't think; you just grow into the Goal. You don't think about the Goal; you just do what is necessary to achieve it without looking and measuring how far you have to go. For you know that the Goal is always inside you. So when the vision of the Goal comes to you, forget about the mind and the vital. Immediately change teachers and go to the heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, I wish to share with you an experience I had a few weeks ago. I was taking a bath in the river near my house when a voice seemed to call out my name. As I searched for the direction of the sound, a Christ-like figure was sort of delineated in my mind. My heart welcomed the vision by saying, &quot;Brother Jesus, I do not need you; your brother Chinmoy is my Master.&quot; At this time, the figure in my mind turned into a black bird of prey and flew out of my mind, sounding off its belching screams.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, I wish to share with you an experience I had a few weeks ago.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This was a hostile attack. Since the vision turned into a black bird, that is the proof. What was present in you was not the Christ but a hostile force that took the form of the Christ. Your aspiration protected you and made you say that you had another Master. When you told him that there was no need for his help, since Chinmoy was your Master, my brother Jesus, the real Christ, would have blessed you and smiled at you on the strength of his oneness with me.</p>
<p>This can also be seen in another light, as a test. Even though I never test my disciples, it could be seen as a test of sincerity, strength and faith in your own Master. In your particular case, it was not a test, but your faith and sincerity came to the fore in rejecting the assistance of one particular Master because you had one already. I repeat: the real Christ, on the strength of his inseparable oneness with me, would have blessed you for your sincerity and faith in me.</p>
<p>Experience is a remover of doubt. Sri Ramakrishna on his deathbed had to reassure Vivekananda and purify his doubting mind. He said, "He who is Rama, he who is Krishna. in one form is Ramakrishna." Vivekananda cried bitterly, but his doubt vanished. This was a test. I do not test. I try to inspire and bring forward the soul in silence. In your case, the soul was to the fore and was able to deal with this particular experience.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. In your case it was true. He came to fill you with his love and light. He didn't vanish because of your ego. He left because his mission was completed. If he had stayed longer, your mind would have started saying, "Those are not his eyes, those are not his ears. That is not the colour of his hair."</p>
<p>This experience took place because you focused your devotion on the picture of the Christ that you have in your room. And perhaps the artist who painted it never even saw the Christ! This I have said as a joke, but it is very serious.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does evil exist or is it in our minds?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does evil exist or is it in our minds?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First we have to know what evil is. Society has created good, bad and evil. In some religions, close relatives can marry. For them, it is good. In our society, it is bad. Killing the cow is evil for Hindus. Muslims will say, "Why? You can eat goose, chicken and so forth, and you cannot eat cows?" We say we love the cows so much because from the cow, light came. It is the symbol of Mother-Earth. For us it is good.</p>
<p>Each one has his own way of interpreting something. If somebody uses his mind to determine the nature of something, and if that particular thing does not give joy or satisfaction to the mind, then the mind will consider it evil. But the heart will say, "No, no! Something which gives no joy is not necessarily evil, only it has less light."</p>
<p>Anything that has been created by God has light. Your soul has light and a chair also has light. The only thing is, your soul has more light. If I turn off the light in this room, you may not see any light at all. As soon as you see darkness, then you say it is evil. But spiritual people don't use the term 'evil'. They say, "What it is, is less light."</p>
<p>The moment the mind declares something to be evil, the mind itself becomes dark. For example, if I say, "He is very bad," immediately that kind of bad consciousness enters into my mind. But if I say, in a positive way, "He can be better," or "He can also be good," then those good qualities enter into me. Here my declaration does not have the same destructive power as when I speak negatively.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The real inner light and the Master's light are the same. Where did you as a seeker steal the light? From your Master. The problem is that sometimes you are not able to utilise your inner light. You have it locked within, but you have misplaced the key. The Master secretly searches and helps you find the key, but he does not tell you that he did this. The Master, by serving you, is pleasing the Supreme. What you should ask is whether what you feel is the inner light is real inner light, and how you should use it.</p>

What is that state of clearness?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At night, nature is fast asleep and everybody wants to sleep. Your children are sleeping. They are not making a noise. This is the time spiritual people use for their work, since it is the best time to create. At night, nature is helping you with her peace. You are getting additional power. So you have to be very wise. Create at night when the forces are best for you.</p>
<p>The feeling of being old signifies wisdom. You have wisdom at that moment, whereas others don't have it. A certain maturity has given you wisdom and the sense of being an experienced, wise soul.</p>
