<p>This morning I was walking at St. John's University. Two women were also walking on the track. I was wearing some Nike shoes. One lady said to me, "I love your shoes! Are they comfortable?"</p>
<p>"They are very comfortable," I replied.</p>
<p>The other one said, "Every day I see you wearing a different pair of shoes. Do you run a sneaker store?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, no, I do not."</p>
<p>Then I asked Databir, "Do you have any brochure?" Usually Databir keeps brochures about our activities in his car, but today he did not have any. I wanted to show these two ladies that I was not the owner of a sneaker store!</p>

<p>Today I was walking near my house and I saw a lady talking to her friend. This lady was fatter than the fattest. As soon as she saw me, she took one step forward and said, "Hi!"</p>
<p>I also said, "Hi!" and I raised my hand.</p>
<p>Then the lady was telling her friend, "I have been seeing this gentleman for twenty-nine years. He has been working so hard for the improvement of the world."</p>
<p>She was speaking very loudly, so I was hearing everything. I have seen this lady perhaps four or five times, but she has been seeing me for twenty-nine years. How does she remember the exact number of years?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My Adventures In The Snow</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My Adventures In The Snow" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Yesterday the funniest thing happened. I went out for a walk at six o'clock in the morning. There was snow everywhere. At one point an old man opened up his gate. The gate was blocking the sidewalk. I approached the gate and then I started to cross into the street. The old man saw me and said, "No, no. The street is very dangerous. Please stay on the sidewalk. I am closing the gate." He begged me not to leave the sidewalk. Then he closed the gate. I was very happy.</p>
<p>I continued on my way. When I walk alone, I have very, very good meditation. I enter into the other world, my real world. Suddenly, I saw the soul of one disciple coming for blessings. Then I took three or four steps and raised my head. I saw that somebody was standing on my left side. I turned around and I saw that it was this same disciple. He was standing with folded hands. I said to him, "Your soul came to me just four seconds ago!"</p>

<p>The other day I was coming back from my walk and I saw Karabi and Snigdha. They were running on the sidewalk. I greeted them and they greeted me very nicely.</p>
<p>On that day, the weather conditions made it dangerous to walk on the street. Since I saw these two girls running on the sidewalk, I was absolutely sure that the sidewalk was not slippery. Otherwise, how could they run? They were literally dancing when they ran. So I went about two hundred and fifty metres in the same direction, walking very confidently. Then, oh God, I lost my footing and I was about to fall down. These two girls passed the same way running only a few minutes before me and nothing happened. Then I came walking and I lost my balance!</p>

<p>He said, "Yes, Sri."</p>
<p>Then I said, "Has Agraha spoken to you?"</p>
<p>He replied, "No problem, no problem! You look fine, you look great!"</p>
<p>I am so grateful to Coach Hart. He is the one who has given me written permission to walk on the track at St. John's.</p>

<p>This morning I went with my guards to the Armory to walk and jog. I was walking on my toes and doing sidesteps, crossovers and other exercises. The boys were watching me in silence very devotedly. One older lady who happened to be there came up and said, "It is so quiet here — like a library or a church!"</p>

<p>This morning I went to our Runners Are Smilers race. I walked the two miles in 38 minutes and 56 seconds. Unfortunately, my knee was extremely painful. In the afternoon Saroja made a special compress for me. I gave her the recipe. It consisted of eggplant, cabbage, onion, cauliflower, squash, pumpkin, avocado, mango, mushrooms, ginger, garlic, tamarind paste, chili and a few spices. She blended them into a paste and then heated them together to make a poultice. I really feel that nature will help me.</p>

<p>From time to time I go to Queensboro College to walk. I have two 'disciples' there. They are elderly Japanese ladies. They observed me for a few days walking on my toes and then walking backwards. Now they have started doing the same thing. They also walk forward and backwards on their toes. They have become my perfect disciples!</p>
<p>The one that is much older is a hunchback. She tries to imitate the younger one. The younger one can walk backwards ten metres or so. Then she starts jogging backwards. The old one tried to do the same, but she stayed in the same spot. She was jogging, but she was not going anywhere.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A Frightening Episode</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A Frightening Episode" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Today a frightening episode took place. Pulak took me to St. John's University to walk around 9:15. We were trying to enter into the sports ground through a particular gate. We saw that there were three or four police cars plus a special truck at that entrance. The policemen were standing outside their cars and they were blocking our way onto the track. They were quite serious. Something was definitely happening.</p>
<p>We went to another gate, but we were feeling very uneasy. I asked Pulak to go and talk to the boss of some construction workers who were also there. I said, "Go and ask that man if I can walk." Even though I have written permission from the University authorities to walk, I wanted to make sure.</p>
<p>Pulak went and spoke to the boss, who said, "Definitely you can walk or run. Do whatever you like. The place is under construction, but if you want to try, you can."</p>
<p>I entered into the stadium and began walking. I did one round, two rounds, three rounds. Then I saw that the policemen had raised their guns. Two of them were talking on walkie-talkies and a special truck had driven onto the lawn which is used for discus, shot-put and hammer. The policemen were all aiming their guns at the tent near the tennis courts. It seemed that something was going to happen.</p>
<p>When I finished my fourth round, I saw that two of the policemen, instead of aiming at the tent as they were doing previously, were now looking through their guns at the track where I was walking! God knows what they were doing. They were watching something. I was the only one walking there and there were a few innocent construction workers on the side.</p>
<p>I know that people can do crazy things, so I quickly walked away and came to the gate. The man who gave me the permission asked, "What is happening?"</p>
<p>I said, "I do not want to be killed. You can see that there are police with guns everywhere."</p>
<p>Then the construction boss himself left the place with me. When I came out, he followed me and brought four or five other workers.</p>
<p>This was the experience we had this morning. The men with guns were not even twenty metres away from me. I was in the third lane and they were right beside the track, on the outside of the fence. What were they doing? First I saw that they were facing the tent. Then, on my fourth round, I saw that they were looking at the track. I said, "This time it is too dangerous." This was my St. John's experience today!</p>

<p>This morning I walked one mile in 16 minutes and 28 seconds. Afterwards, I became extremely tired. My sister always tells me, "Forget about everything else. Keep only your health. Your health is your only concern."</p>
<p>Our Indian scriptures say health is our religion. Health is the code of life. Village people walk two miles to market, but city people are in trouble. I strongly feel that after the age of 40 or 50, you have to spend a minimum of three hours a day doing exercise and taking care of your health.</p>

<p>Early in the morning I was inspired to go out walking on the sidewalk here in San Francisco. After I had walked for 33 minutes, whom did I see? Garima. Then I had such an experience. I saw one man. He was not a vagabond. He was quite well dressed, but he was lying down on the sidewalk, munching something so happily. I prayed to God to make me as happy as that man.</p>
<p>I came and stood right in front of him, not even one metre away. I said to him, "How I wish I could lie down in the street like you! You have peace, you have joy. How I wish I could exchange my life with yours."</p>
<p>He did not say anything. He was in his own world of happiness.</p>

<p>This morning I walked all the way to my garage, in spite of my leg pain, to bring the car, only to find that I had forgotten to bring the garage opener. I had my license, but the opener was missing. So I came back to my house.</p>
<p>The second time I went there, I found that I had forgotten the keys to my car. So I had to come all the way back home again.</p>
<p>Finally, the third time I went to the garage, everything was in order and I was able to bring the car. This all happened because I had a high fever.</p>
