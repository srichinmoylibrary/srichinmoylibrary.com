SCA 694-702. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 9 March 1993.</p>
<h2>Question: When I am aware that an undivine quality is manifesting itself in and though me, how can I illumine it?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can illumine an undivine quality only by invoking more consciously and more devotedly the Compassion of our Lord Supreme. If Compassion descends, then the undivine forces, undivine qualities, will not be able to manifest themselves. On the contrary, they will be transformed and illumined by the Compassion. What we need is more Compassion from God, and this Compassion we will get only by shedding tears of gratitude to God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Are love of sport and natural talent enough to win, or must an athlete develop a ‘killer instinct’?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Are love of sport and natural talent enough to win, or must an athlete develop a ‘killer instinct’?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Natural talent and love of sport do help us considerably, but they are not enough. We need special Grace from God to be successful. Otherwise, many times various forces come and stand in our way, preventing us from being successful. So God’s Grace is of paramount importance. God’s Grace is like an unseen Hand, but when we get the result, it becomes seen and visible.</p>
<p>Carl Lewis is an example. He has unparalleled talent, talent in infinite measure. His love for his sport is also absolutely genuine. But what happened? Before the Olympics in 1992, some illness or some force attacked him and he did not do well at the Olympic trials. Outwardly we have no idea why he could not qualify in some of his events at the trials. On the one hand, we can say that it was because in this particular case God’s Grace did not come. But, on the other hand, who knows? It is true that God’s Grace always helps us considerably, but in some cases the help that we get may not please us in our own way. Who knows what kind of lesson God wanted to give Carl Lewis in the Olympic trials? We can say that God’s Grace is absolutely necessary for us to be successful, but our way of success may not be God’s Way of success.</p>
<p>We have to abide by God’s Decision in our success and failure. We are so happy and proud that Carl Lewis took his failure in a very divine way. Many great athletes do not take the right attitude when circumstances do not favour them, but Carl Lewis accepted his defeat in a very spiritual way.</p>
<p>So along with our natural talent and love of sport, we also have to invoke God’s Grace through regular prayer and meditation. Only then can we succeed, not only in athletics but also in our inner life of aspiration and outer life of dedication.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What does ‘chastity’ mean exactly and why is it necessary?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What does ‘chastity’ mean exactly and why is it necessary?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Chastity means inner purity, inner beauty. If we enter into our heart-garden, there we see the heart as a flower and we see that this flower has tremendous fragrance. If we see a flower, first we appreciate the beauty of the flower. Then if we see that that flower has fragrance, we appreciate that flower more.</p>
<p>Here, inner beauty is chastity. If we are pure, then we feel that our inner beauty expands and our inner fragrance increases. In the spiritual life, we try to please God as much as possible. If there is a way to please God more, then we try to adopt that particular way. The necessity of chastity is not only my philosophy. Other Indian spiritual Masters as well as the Saviour Christ have given so much importance to chastity because they know that if we have chastity, then we can make very fast progress. Chastity, inner beauty and inner purity expand our divine reality.</p>

Will God welcome her in the same way when she goes to Heaven?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You know well what happens if you accept the spiritual life and give up. If we start a course and then do not complete it, how do we get the diploma? In life, everything we start that is good, we have to continue until we have reached the destination. After accepting the spiritual life, if you give up and then expect the same treatment from God after leaving the body, it is not possible. As in human life, if we study a course, we have to complete the course in order to get a degree. If we accept the spiritual life and then give up, then how can we get the same kind of peace, light, love and bliss from God?</p>
<p>If we aspire, if we cry for God, if we pray and meditate, naturally we shall please God much more than otherwise.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it bad to doubt God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it bad to doubt God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we doubt God, it becomes more difficult for us to receive good things from Him. Now the question comes, do we want anything from God or not? If we really need something from God, then do we not have to please Him? God does not mind if we doubt Him. But if we have faith in Him, it will be easier for Him to give us what we actually need.</p>
<p>God is beyond our doubt and faith. If we doubt God, it does not affect Him. But if we love God and if we have faith in Him, then it becomes infinitely easier for us to receive His Love, Affection, Compassion and Joy. If I need ten dollars but I doubt that my friend has any money at all, then how am I going to get money from him? I will not even ask him because I do not believe that he can give me ten dollars. But if I have faith that he has a hundred dollars or even more and that he will definitely give me something since I am asking him, then definitely he will give it to me. Similarly, if we doubt that God exists, or if we doubt what He has to offer us, then we will not ask Him for any of His divine qualities. If we doubt that God is good, why should we ask God to make us good or to make us happy?</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Cheerfulness and wisdom-light are inseparable. If you have wisdom-light, then naturally you will be cheerful. You have to be cheerful in order to be always ready to receive God’s Light. If you are eager to receive God’s Love, Light and everything that God wants to give you, you will get them sooner than otherwise. Again, if you are cheerful, that is the height of your spiritual wisdom. So wisdom gives us cheerfulness, and cheerfulness itself is wisdom.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What are the limitations of science and technology?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What are the limitations of science and technology?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Science and technology are in the mind. Anything that is in the mind right now is limited because the human mind is not trying to consciously expand or enlarge itself. There <em>are</em> minds that are extremely illumined or illumining, but these minds are rarely to be found on earth. On the whole, the mind that we live in is ordinary. It is full of doubt, fear, anxiety and worry — full of limitations. Since science is in the mind, then definitely these limitations are visible, for science is constantly doubting its own creation or doubting its own achievements.</p>
<p>If we live in the heart, it is all constant self-expansion. The heart is like a divine child looking at the rising sun early in the morning. It receives light in abundant measure. The limitation of science and technology is their incapacity to receive infinite light from Above because they are bound by the mind, which is quite often confused and self-contradictory.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Inner Pilot is our Lord Supreme, and the soul is the representative of the Inner Pilot, of our Lord Beloved Supreme. The ego is inside the vital, inside the mind and inside the physical. These three are supposed to be good instruments of the soul, but they are not. Unfortunately, consciously and deliberately they try to mix with undivine forces such as jealousy, insecurity, impurity and so forth.</p>
<p>The way the soul is the representative of God, even so, the body, vital, mind and heart are also supposed to be the representatives of the soul. But in most cases, the body, vital and mind are not willing to be the representatives of the soul. The soul is conscious of God’s Love and God’s Compassion. In this way, the soul is fulfilling God. The body, vital, mind and heart, on the other hand, are not fulfilling the soul because they are not aware that the soul is the direct representative of God on earth.</p>
<p>A boss must listen to his own boss, but we do not do that. That is why we suffer so much. The highest Boss, God, is loved and respected by our immediate boss, the soul. But when it comes to pleasing our immediate boss, we do not. That is why we are full of sufferings.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To simplify your life, just think of yourself as a four-year-old child. Try to imagine the way he thinks of reality. If you have to form a sentence, instead of twenty words, just use three or four words. If you have to talk to someone about a so-called complicated matter, see how you can simplify it. No matter with whom you are talking, you have to feel that you are a child and that person is also a child. Always try to have a childlike consciousness and to see each and every human being as another child. When a childlike quality comes into your life, everything automatically becomes simple.</p>

 <p>
SCA 703-705. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 6 October 1993 in Tokyo.</p>
<h2>Question: You said recently that this year will be difficult. What should we be careful of? What should we pay attention to?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Anything that brings down our consciousness, anything that is negative, discouraging or disheartening, we must reject immediately. Otherwise, no matter how many years we have been on the path, there is no guarantee that we are going to make very fast progress. It may not be possible even to stay on the path. Either we have to go forward or we will be pushed backward in the spiritual life. We cannot stand still at one particular place.</p>
<p>In the ordinary life, we walk a certain distance and then we take rest. Then again we go on or else we stop for some time. But in the spiritual life, we cannot stay indefinitely at the same place. The undivine forces pull us back.</p>
<p>Once upon a time many of you showed promise to be spiritual, to be excellent disciples. Once you have made fast, faster, fastest progress, God expects you to continue at the same speed. But when, through lethargy, you allow wrong forces to enter into you and you cherish those wrong forces, thinking that those forces are real and that what you were doing before is unreal, then you go backwards.</p>
<p>At every moment we have to be careful. The life of temptation attacks a spiritual person infinitely more than an ordinary person. Ordinary people have a certain standard. They are ready to walk at the speed of an Indian bullock cart. They feel that once they have started, that is enough. The goal is there and they have Eternity at their disposal to reach it. But spiritual people cannot behave in that way. Once they have started walking along the path sincerely and seriously, and if they have already shown their speed — extremely fast speed — then they cannot stop or slow down and allow ignorance to enter into them. Ignorance means the unaspiring life, the undivine life. They cannot return to that life because they have already made a solemn promise to the Supreme, inwardly and outwardly, to be His choice instruments, and the Supreme believed them and gave them His inner Assurance, inner Joy, inner Pride and many, many divine qualities.</p>
<p>So these people cannot slow down or stop because they have already made a very solemn promise. On the way if they become tired and start thinking that this is the time to enjoy retirement, then they are totally mistaken. For a real spiritual person, there is no retirement. Spirituality is a one-way street, not a two-way street. Once you have seen the light, either in yourself or in your Master, if you consciously and deliberately enter into darkness, then you may lose everything.</p>
<p>Those people who have taken the spiritual life seriously should be very, very careful, because God trusts them, God depends on them. If they fail God because of their unwillingness, lethargy and other undivine forces that they are consciously or unconsciously cherishing, then unfortunately God will not tolerate them, even if once upon a time they did much for Him. If you have done much for God, God expects you to do much more. He is our Beloved Supreme. If we fail Him, He will either withdraw totally or He will dispense divine retribution, divine punishment.</p>
<p>What I am saying applies only to those who have been following the spiritual life for a very long time, who have had very high experiences and who have done much for God. Those who have just accepted the spiritual life do not have to worry because they are just blossoming. If they can blossom happily, cheerfully and willingly, there will be no problem for them. But if they can be consciously aware of the forces around them and consciously, regularly and faithfully try to move forward in their spiritual life, then they will make very fast progress.</p>

Always there should be real feeling, plus utmost simplicity, purity and serenity. Sometimes for various reasons, inner and outer, I sing in a different way, so I should not be imitated. When I play the esraj, most of the time I choose slow songs because for me they appeal more to the heart than fast songs. But occasionally people are falling asleep. At that time fast songs are needed to wake them up. Otherwise, most of the time slow songs touch the very depths of the aspiring heart more. From time to time one can play fast songs to give a kind of mental or vital thrill, but for the heart, usually slow songs are infinitely more effective. That does not mean that you will discard the fast songs. But while the seekers are in a meditative consciousness, it is better to sing slow songs.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If somebody continues to walk along the spiritual path, can that person at the end see the Supreme?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If somebody continues to walk along the spiritual path, can that person at the end see the Supreme?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely. Otherwise why are you taking the trouble of walking along the path? If there is a starting point, there is also a destination. But while running towards the destination, some people get tired. When I used to run marathons, quite a few times I completed the race. Again, a few times after covering only a few miles, I had to give up. My destination was twenty-six miles and a little more. But after eleven miles I had severe cramps, so I had to give up.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life also, if one is prepared to go to the end, definitely he will be able to see the Supreme. But again, even when you see the Supreme, that is not the very end. It is a new starting point. Suppose you are coming from a long distance towards a huge palace. The owner of the palace may be at the door or in one particular room, hiding somewhere. You look for him here, there, here, there. Finally you see him in one room. But the same person can come out and be at the gate of the palace or even two hundred metres or four hundred metres or one mile away from the palace. He knows the way you are walking or running to come to the palace, so he can do you a big favour. If he sees that you are very sincere, then he will come a long way to receive you. He can receive you long before you reach the palace; he can receive you inside one of the rooms; or if he sees that you are not fully ready, he can hide in one room and then you will have to go through thousands of rooms before you finally find him.</p>
<p>It all depends on how ready you are. The goal is to see the Supreme. Otherwise, what is the use of praying and meditating? Definitely when the hour strikes you will see Him, you are bound to see Him, because that is the goal of each and every seeker. But where He has fixed the goal, you have no idea. It can be right in front of you or millions and billions of miles away from you. When the time comes, you will be able to see Him at the place where you are supposed to see Him: inside your heart, inside your soul, inside your mind, inside your body, above your head or in some corner of the world.</p>
<p>When the hour strikes for you, definitely you will see Him. Not only will you see Him, but you will grow into Him. We see a flower, but that is not enough. We have to become the beauty of the flower; we have to become the fragrance of the flower. Then only are we perfect. Anybody can see the flower, but who can have the purity and divinity of the flower-consciousness, plus the fragrance, which is Immortality? So to see the Supreme is the first step, and then to grow into the Supreme will be the ultimate Goal of each seeker. Again, once we reach the ultimate Goal, again we will have to start on a new journey.</p>
