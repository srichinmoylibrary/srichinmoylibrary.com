<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely! If a spiritual person wants to realise God overnight, like taking instant coffee, at that time a philosopher will come and say, “You fool! How can you realise God, the most difficult subject on earth, overnight?” In this way, the patience of a seeker can be helped by a philosopher. The philosopher will say, “Take your time. To accomplish anything takes time. How can you expect to realise God in the twinkling of an eye?” When a philosopher gives this kind of advice, it can definitely be of great help to a spiritual person. Suppose a spiritual person has been praying for years and years, and now he is becoming impatient because he is not having even a glimpse of light. A philosopher will encourage him to exercise more patience, perseverance and other divine qualities.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The philosophy for the New Millennium will be: do not see faults in anybody’s life; do not see the faults in your own life. Only force yourself to see all the good things you have done, all the good things you are planning to do and all the good things that others have done. In the next millennium, the goal of philosophy will be only to see the light in oneself and the light in others. Then only will you be able to expedite the arrival of world-peace and world-oneness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God’s most important philosophy is to see, feel and become. First see where the Truth is. Then feel the Truth and become the Truth. When you become the Truth, you will be able to see and feel the Truth everywhere, wherever you are. God’s most important philosophy is to consciously become aware of what you eternally are.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does God like philosophy?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does God like philosophy?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Since God has created everything under the sun, there is no aspect of His creation which He does not like. Parents can bring into the world somebody very smart, very great and innovative. Again, if a child is blind or deaf, do the parents hate him? On the contrary, the parents show him the same compassion and affection. Whatever God has created, he is bound to like. Philosophy is a creation of His, so He has to like His own creation.</p>
<p>When we create something, on the mental level we may make comparisons. The mind may say that one thing is not as beautiful or as perfect as another thing. But the heart will take what we did in the beginning, what we are doing now and what we will be doing in the future and place them all together, like three children in a family. In the same way God will place philosophy, religion and spirituality together as inseparable creations of His.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does philosophy ever come from the illumined mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does philosophy ever come from the illumined mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, philosophy can come from the illumined mind, but usually it comes from what we call the subtle physical mind or the subtle vital mind. These are very complicated spiritual terms. It is only the illumined mind which has the capacity to envision the supreme reality.</p>
<p>Many philosophers have written most sublime things which have come from their illumined mind. Our great Indian philosopher, statesman and President, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, was one of those. He wrote many immortal things from his illumined mind, but when it came to spirituality and yoga proper, he did not enter into those deeper subjects. He saw the reality, but he could not become the reality. To become the divine reality, spirituality is the only answer. In order to establish our oneness with the supreme reality, we must go beyond the illumined mind and enter into the heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We will no longer want or need philosophy when we really do not want to remain in the confines of the mind. Right now we cherish our little mind-cottage. When we see with our mind’s eye, we see only a limited portion of reality. The mind-created philosophy cannot see the entire reality at a glance. It is satisfied with seeing reality little by little.</p>
<p>Only when we cherish the freedom of the unlimited will we no longer need philosophy. For that, we must be prepared to go far beyond the domain of the mind and enter into the realm of the heart. When we are no longer satisfied by staying inside the mind-cottage and we have a great hunger to become the reality itself, we will be ready to enter into the heart. The heart not only sees the entire reality at a glance but, on the strength of its identification, it becomes one with the limitless reality itself. At that time, we do not need any mind-created philosophy.</p>
<p>When the call of spirituality comes and if the seeker answers or accepts the call with utmost sincerity and purity, then he can dive into the sea of spirituality. When you enter into the sea of spirituality, you can swim and swim to your heart’s content and finally say good-bye to philosophy once and for all.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind’s philosophy is: we are here, but God is somewhere else.</p>
<p>The heart’s philosophy is: God is there, high in the skies. Again, God is also here, inside the heart of His creation.</p>
<p>God’s Philosophy is to support everything and everyone that is in His creation. God’s Philosophy is to support all the philosophies that man can ever imagine.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Stronger than philosophy is religion. Stronger than religion is spirituality. Again, stronger than spirituality, in a specific sense, is yoga. Spirituality can be something very vast and at the same time vague. But when it comes to yoga, it is very one-pointed.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The real inner progress, the heart’s progress, does not depend on the study of philosophy. Philosophy encourages us or stimulates us, but the real inner progress, love of God or implicit faith in God, philosophy does not or cannot supply us with. For that, spirituality must come into being. So philosophy as such cannot bring about spiritual progress because real spirituality is far beyond the domain of philosophy.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything is a degree of truth. Such being the case, philosophy is also a degree of truth.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A great philosopher will talk and talk about God. But a good seeker does not talk, because his prayers and meditations are all consciously directed towards God. So a good seeker is infinitely more important to God than a great philosopher, because the seeker is trying to establish his oneness with God prayerfully, soulfully and eternally. A great philosopher is talking about God in a particular language that is called philosophy, but he is not eager to have direct contact with God. He does not care to see God, to feel God, or to grow into God-consciousness.</p>
