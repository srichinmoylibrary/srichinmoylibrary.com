<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life our most precious wealth is surrender. We are born with surrender, so that no one is without this wealth in infinite measure. But unfortunately, some seekers are unable to use this wealth.</p>
<p>Sometimes we can have infinite wealth, but this infinite wealth may not be worth much. We cannot feel that an infinite amount of cotton is the same treasure as an infinite amount of gold. Naturally, even a small quantity of gold will be more precious than an inflate amount of cotton.</p>
<p>In our path, surrender is the most effective key to open the door of the Eternal. This surrender has to be vigilant, conscious and constant. Before each action is performed, while it is in the process of being performed and after it has been completely performed, the seeker has to feel the living breath of surrender. To whom? To the Inner Pilot.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the meaning of conscious surrender?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the meaning of conscious surrender?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The meaning of conscious surrender is to surrender our ignorance to our light, our imperfect nature to our perfect nature, our undivine consciousness to our divine consciousness. We have to know that although the feet and the head are in the same body, there comes a time when we see or feel that the feet are in deep ignorance, whereas the head is in light and delight. If the feet want to enjoy the light and delight that the head is enjoying, then they have to surrender their existence to the head. But before surrendering, the feet have to feel that they are part and parcel of the head. Similarly, when our lower consciousness is aware of the fact that it is part of the higher consciousness, the higher existence, then we can try to transform our lower nature into our higher nature.</p>
<p>It is like climbing up a tree: we have to climb up from the root at the bottom of the tree. When we reach the topmost bough, there we get the most delicious fruits. But if we don't start at the root, if we don't climb up right from the ground, then how are we going to get the fruits? While we are on the ground we have to know that there is fruit at the top.</p>
<p>Conscious surrender means awareness, awareness of our highest existence or our most aspiring part and awareness of our lowest existence, our least aspiring part. The moment our lowest existence surrenders itself to our highest existence, the lowest becomes completely one with the highest.</p>
<p>When earth surrenders, the unaspiring qualities in us surrender. To whom do they surrender? To Heaven. What is Heaven? Heaven is our aspiring part, our illumining part.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we surrender to the Supreme?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we surrender to the Supreme?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us say that as a child, when you were about three years old, you used to always listen to your mother. Perhaps you don't always listen to her now; but when you were a child, there were many things your mother asked you to do or not to do. Did you do anything wrong at that time by listening to her? No. Your mother asked you not to touch fire and you believed her. If you had touched the fire, it would have burnt your hand. But just because you were obedient and you surrendered to your mother's will, you escaped being burnt. There were many things she asked you not to do and you didn't do them. As a result you were saved.</p>
<p>You have to have this same kind of faith in the spiritual life. You need to have a childlike simplicity and sincerity to tell you that your spiritual Master, like your mother, will not disappoint you or deceive you. You are now a child, a baby in the spiritual life. You have to feel that if you can have the kind of implicit faith which you had in your childhood, then you will again be fulfilled. When you were a child, the moment you saw that your mother was not near or around you, you felt helpless. A child needs his mother around him all the time. In the spiritual life also, we have to know that when we need the inner guidance, the guidance of the Master, we are safe. When we miss or lose that inner guidance, we are unsafe. Your spiritual Master will not deceive you; your Inner Pilot will not deceive you. No! Surrender comes only when one has faith in somebody else, when one has more faith in that particular person than he has in himself.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Master and you practise meditation, then you have to go deep within and feel that the inner voice knows far better than you do. Unfortunately, the seeker is very often misguided. Sometimes the voice of the vital resembles the inner voice of the soul. Then the seeker is mistaken and he suffers, thinking that he is listening to the soul's dictates.</p>
<p>You can also become a child just by unlearning. Ignorance and darkness have taught you many things which you have now to unlearn. A child knows practically nothing; he knows only how to love his mother and that is more than everything for a child. Everyone has to unlearn things that the mind has taught him.</p>
<p>So when we pray, when we meditate, the first thing we should do is to get rid of doubts, suspicions and other negative qualities. You have faith in your arms so that you can strike someone or you can fight with someone. That is your limited capacity. But if you can have faith in somebody else who is much stronger than you and if you can please him, then naturally he will be able to use his strength for you. In the spiritual life also, if you can please your inner being, your soul, your Inner Pilot, your spiritual Master, with your limited capacity, then you will see that the object of your adoration is bound to give you something far beyond your imagination. If you please your parents when they want you to do something, then if you ask them for money or for some other material help, immediately they will give it to you. They will give it to you because they have much more money than you have, much more capacity in various fields. But if you don't please them, then they will give you nothing.</p>
<p>When a child comes running to his father with a nickel he has just found in the street, he says, "Look, Father, I have found a nickel!" The father is so happy that his son has come to him. The child's sole possession, his only wealth is a nickel. With this nickel he could have gone to a shop and bought candy or used it in some other way, but he didn't do it. Instead he came home to his father with this little nickel. Naturally the father is pleased and gives the child a quarter or dollar instead of the nickel. The father sees that his child has the heart to give what he has: he gives his best possession without any hesitation.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life also, you give a little aspiration, which is your nickel, during your prayer or meditation for a few minutes early in the morning. Then immediately the spiritual Master will invoke so many things for you: Peace, Light, Bliss, Joy and Delight. But you have to give an iota of your aspiration, for five minutes or half an hour of meditation in the morning. When we feel that in order to learn something we have to give something of our own, then we will see the result.</p>
<p>God will never be indebted to us. We do have a little capacity; we meditate on God for a few minutes each day. But are we exercising this capacity or not? The moment He sees that we are regular in our meditation, that we are sincere and earnest and that we have accepted this approach to the spiritual life wholeheartedly, God showers His boundless Compassion on us in the form of Light, Delight and Peace. So give to God what you have: your childlike faith and inner cry. If you can give Him your inner cry and have implicit faith in Him, then surrender will automatically loom large in your life of aspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Surrender itself is an art, the supreme art. How will you learn this art of surrendering? It is through gratitude. Right now you want to surrender your existence to the Supreme. There are many in your spiritual family who do not even have the word 'surrender' in their spiritual dictionary; but in your dictionary you have now discovered the word 'surrender'. So you should be grateful to the Supreme. At last you know that surrender is the key, whereas your sister or brother disciple has nothing to do with surrender.</p>
<p>Others will feel that "Might is right," but in your case right has become might. If somebody asks, "What is your right?" you will say, "My right is to surrender to God and become His chosen instrument, His chosen child." The moment you have the feeling that you are chosen, you try to develop the capacity to express your gratitude to the Supreme, to the Inner Pilot, for His inner guidance. Then automatically surrender comes. You feel that with the inner guidance you are everything and without the inner guidance you are nothing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can have grateful surrender to the Will of the Supreme if you can just feel that not only is He doing everything for you, but He has already done everything for you. We show our gratitude to someone who has done something for us or who is going to do us a favour in the long run. Every day, while you are offering your gratitude to the Supreme and your surrender to the Will of the Supreme, please feel that everything that is fulfilling, everything that makes you a perfect instrument and an immortal divine soldier of the Supreme, has already been done for you.</p>
<p>When you think of grateful surrender, please feel that everything has been accomplished by the Supreme, for you and in you. When you read the book of universal knowledge, you have only to turn the pages; the book has already been read by the Supreme. It is His book and He has also given you the knowledge. The only effort you have to make is to turn the pages and feel that the Divine Supreme has already read the book. He has not read it for Himself; He has read it only for you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When we surrender unconditionally, are we conscious of the fact that we are surrendering?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When we surrender unconditionally, are we conscious of the fact that we are surrendering?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know that there are different types of surrender. One is partial surrender or limited surrender. This is the surrender of mutual good, giving and taking, compromise. If I give you fifty percent, you give me fifty percent. Or if I give you thirty percent, you give me seventy percent. I give you something, you give me something; I surrender to your will, you surrender to my will. In each case we make a bargain. But there comes a time for unconditional surrender. In unconditional surrender there is no expectation. Even if I don't give you anything, you give me one hundred percent of what you have and what you are. This is the type of surrender that a real disciple makes to his Master.</p>
<p>The first time one sees a spiritual Master, if he gets real joy, then he knows that this is his real Master. From that day he tries to make total surrender with joy. He says to the Master, "To the end of my life, until I breathe my last, I shall offer you my devoted love and surrender." Even if the Master does not look at him, even if the Master intentionally, deliberately speaks ill of him, saying that he is the worst person on earth or the worst disciple, he will not mind. He says, "Let my Master not give me happiness. Let him not give me anything. On the contrary, let him speak ill of me at every moment." If he is ready to be a disciple and remain a disciple even if he gets no smiles or flattery or appreciation from the Master, then that disciple has made unconditional surrender.</p>
<p>In this world if we give someone five thousand dollars, tomorrow he will be kind to us. But whether we give five thousand dollars or five million dollars, it is all material wealth. Today we give it; tomorrow it is all gone. But spiritual wealth which is love, devotion and surrender, is infinitely more fulfilling.When a disciple offers his purest love, purest devotion and purest surrender to the Master, it can never be lost. The Master gives him everything in boundless measure. If a disciple gives a little love, a little surrender to the Master, then the Master surrenders to him wholeheartedly. The disciple may surrender to his Master once in a blue moon or once in six months. But the Master surrenders to all the whimsical thoughts, absurd ideas and imperfections in the disciple. The poor Master goes on surrendering to the disciple's doubt, to his fear and to his limitation. When it is a matter of surrender, who has made surrender to whom? It is the Master who has made surrender to all the disciples. Each disciple made surrender on the lucky day when he accepted his Master and that is enough for him; but in the Master's case, his surrender has to be constant.</p>
<p>Why does the Master make this unconditional surrender? Who wants to remain indebted? In this world only a fool will remain indebted. If you give something to someone and he does not give you anything in return, he is a fool. The disciple gives his capacity of surrender to the Master. This is why the Master gives his unconditional surrender to the disciple.</p>
<p>Total surrender means surrender according to one's capacity. One disciple has the capacity to surrender for four hours a day. Another has the capacity to make surrender for one hour a day. Another may have the capacity to surrender for only one second a day. Each has his capacity. But if he uses that capacity for one second, then total surrender he is making for one second. Those who have not accepted the spiritual life don't make even that one second of surrender in twenty years or during their whole life. So the Master will be pleased even if one second is the maximum capacity for a disciple. But if a disciple can give surrender for four hours, ten hours, or twelve hours and if he can keep this surrender as long as he is alive, then he can become the most perfect disciple. And this means that he will become the most perfect manifestation not only of his Master but of the Absolute Supreme.</p>
<p>When we have made total unconditional surrender to the Supreme, at that time we become totally one with Him. When a vessel is empty, it makes a sound. But when the vessel is full to the brim there is no sound; it is complete. Right now we are struggling and struggling, but when we are surrendered it is as if we are in a flow of consciousness.</p>
<p>When a runner begins to run he exerts his limbs to the limit. Then after a few minutes his movement becomes very spontaneous. When he doesn't run spontaneously he loses his coordination; then he feels that he is exerting the right hand, the left hand, the right shoulder, the left shoulder, all separately. But when he is running the fastest, he will feel that he is not running at all. His movement becomes automatic and he feels that there is no exertion. The legs, the hands and the shoulders spontaneously work together. Although his movement is very fast, it is as if he were doing nothing at all. Real surrender is like that.When we make our total unconditional surrender to God, we feel that we do nothing, absolutely nothing; we have become. When we become something, at that time we don't do anything. Action ends the moment we become. The act of our surrendering is being transformed into manifestation. Action ends the moment we become. The act of our surrendering is being transformed into manifestation. Action does not remain as action; it becomes the manifestation itself. When we make total surrender, we grow into the real divinity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I integrate the process of surrender in my whole being, in my body, in my mind, in my vital, in my heart, in my soul? How can they all come forward to the Supreme&#039;s Will?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I integrate the process of surrender in my whole being, in my body, in my mind, in my vital, in my heart, in my soul? How can they all come forward to the Supreme&#039;s Will?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Feel that there is a ladder right in front of you. The first rung is the body, the second rung is the vital, a little higher is the mind, then a little higher is the heart and then finally comes the soul. You have to remember all the time that there are five rungs in the ladder, not one rung. You have to feel that even if you reach the first rung, you will not be totally safe: you may fall down. You have to continue to climb up step by step and then only can you use your surrender.</p>
<p>When you place your foot on the first rung, look up to see if there is anybody to lend you a hand. Just place your foot on the rung that is the body and look up. Immediately you will see that somebody from above is pulling you. He will pull you up to the vital step. Then again look up. Again his hand comes and pulls you to the mind-step, the mental plane. Each time he will see your sincerity. He will notice if you are looking up or not, if you want to go higher or if you are satisfied where you are. If he sees that again you want to go one step higher, he will pull you to the heart-rung, then to the soul-rung.</p>
<p>This is how you will integrate surrender in the entire being. First with your inner aspiration you try to feel that inside your gross physical body there is Peace, there is Light, there is Bliss, there is Energy. Never think that in the body there is nothing. We have put all kinds of doubts into our physical being, but there also, amidst all kinds of silly nonsense, there is a diamond. That diamond is the soul. Right now it is covered by all kinds of rubbish as the diamond is covered by coal. But if we empty our inner vessel, we immediately see the diamond.</p>
<p>In your case, to integrate your surrender is to make yourself feel that there is not a single portion of your body where God or Light or Truth does not exist. Just touch your finger: immediately you have to feel that God is there. Just touch your knee, God is there. Don't think, "Oh, God cannot be in my leg, in my foot. He will remain deep inside me." Do not neglect the physical, thinking that the physical is integrally one with the vital. Do not neglect the vital, thinking that the vital is integrally one with the mind. No, everything has its own place. Without the physical you cannot do anything. If you are sick, then you cannot work or meditate, no matter how much you want to. The necessities of the physical are of paramount importance. Again, if you don't have the dynamic urge of the vital, you will never be able to do anything. And if you don't have the mind, you are lost, because the mind tells you where to go and what to do. Then you have the heart which tells you what is pleasing and satisfying. Each member of your family must cooperate with you and with each other. When all the members of your family cooperate with one another, divine Light illumines your entire being.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you have a complacent attitude, you have the feeling that everybody is massaging your feet. You feel that the world is at your feet and you are getting joy by becoming its Supreme. You will feel that your joy is the result of something you have done. You have run two miles so you lie down and say, "I am exhausted: I deserve a rest."</p>
<p>But when you have real surrender, you feel that you are in a position to touch and massage everybody's feet and this will give you the greatest joy. At this time you will never feel that you deserve something. You will only feel that you have not yet finished your task. Still you have not served enough, or you have not yet expanded your consciousness.</p>
<p>When we have a complacent attitude, we feel that we deserve recognition and many other things after we have done something for only two hours. But when we have surrender, there is a cheerful expansion of our consciousness and to this expansion there is no end.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Surrender and humility cannot be separated, although they are not one and the same thing. They can never be separated because one feeds the other. If you are really surrendered, then you are humble. If you are really humble, then you must also be surrendered.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: At times, when praying and mediating on surrender, I am moved to copious tears. I feel that these are tears of frustration.

I feel that these are tears of frustration. How can I aspire for and concentrate on surrender without becoming so emotional?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am sure you know that when the soul expresses its joy with tears, it means that the soul is expressing its deepest gratitude through the physical being. In the soul's joy, there can be no frustration. There you feel only a vast and total oneness with the Highest on the strength of your surrender.</p>
<p>At times, however, during your meditation and prayer, you feel the uncertain drive of your yet-uncontrolled emotional vital. Since you have a few times experienced the tears of your soul's joy, which are a kind of divine Light, the frustration that lies in your unlit emotional vital cannot last for long. Again, if your prayer is flooded with purity and your meditation is surcharged with luminosity, even in the domain of the gross vital you will have, instead of frustration, a partial sense of psychic realisation in the form of the heart's spontaneous joy. The spontaneous joy of the heart will easily enable you to meditate on total and integral surrender. So please try to illumine your emotional vital through your soul's light. Once the limited emotional vital is illumined, it enters into the boundless sea of all-achieving and all-fulfilling Surrender.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, could you explain the differences between dependence and surrender?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, could you explain the differences between dependence and surrender?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First I must say that there are two types of surrender. One is the surrender of the slave to the master. He surrenders unwillingly; he is afraid that his master may punish him or do anything at all with his life. He surrenders out of fear.</p>
<p>The other type of surrender is to feel that our darkest part is surrendering to our brightest part, our unlit part is surrendering to our fully illumined part. Let us say that my feet are in darkness and my head is in light. My feet are surrendering to my head knowing perfectly well that both the feet and the head are parts of the same body. This is the surrender of oneness. One enters into surrender knowing well that the brighter part is equally his.</p>
<p>We have to know what kind of dependence a seeker has. Some people are clever; they depend on the spiritual Master or on some higher authority, but only with a motive behind their dependence. They say, "We belong to a spiritual Master who has ten million disciples and we feel that if we can depend on his love, his affection, his smile, his grace, then we will become very, very great. People will appreciate and admire us." These people depend on the Master for some kind of recognition. Since this is their inner motive, their dependence is very bad.</p>
<p>But there is another type of dependence: a child's dependence. An innocent child feels that his father and mother will do everything for him. He feels that he is helpless. When the child feels that he is helpless, immediately the mother herself comes. The child has the sincere inner conviction that he cannot budge an inch or do anything without his mother's help, so the child gets the mother's help. If the disciple also feels that he entirely depends on the Master's grace, his dependence is founded on a higher plane. If one depends in this way on the Master's will, affection and love, then he can make the fastest progress.</p>
<p>But if one has an independent will and wants to remain independent of the Master's will, then that person has to take full responsibility for his own will. Some people make the Master feel that they depend on him today, but tomorrow they can function perfectly without him. Perhaps for one day they will depend on the will of the Master hoping that their desires will be fulfilled. To depend on the Master with that kind of motive is all wrong.</p>
<p>To have true dependence, one has to feel that he is hopeless without the divine Grace of the Supreme. This kind of dependence helps us immensely. Some of my disciples feel that if they leave me even for one day, they will be totally lost, like children in the desert. Those who have that kind of sincere feeling will make real progress. They are dependent, but not like beggars. They depend on the higher light.</p>
<p>When they depend on me, they feel that they are depending on something higher which belongs to them. Some are not fully aware or don't have the conviction that this higher part is also theirs. But if their dependence is based on the conviction that they do have something higher than they actually are now on the physical plane, then they are going to make very fast progress.</p>
<p>If we have a free access to that higher plane and feel that that higher plane is also ours, then naturally we can depend on the higher plane. In that sense dependence is very good. Otherwise, most of the time people are telling a lie when they say they depend on God's Will or they depend on the Master's will. By saying this they only try to draw the attention of other disciples. They say, "Oh, Guru has said to do it? Then we will do it." Yet inwardly, two hundred times they have refused to do it. Outwardly they may do it, but with utmost inner unwillingness. So this kind of dependence is not good at all.</p>
<p>If your dependence is absolutely sincere, if you feel that without the help of the Supreme you cannot breathe, then this is surrender. When you breathe in, you depend on your life-breath. If your life-breath goes away, then you don't exist. Similarly, if you can feel that you are totally depending on the Will of the Supreme, which is far more important than your life-breath, then this dependence is true surrender.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a conflict between the heart and the mind in our efforts to surrender?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a conflict between the heart and the mind in our efforts to surrender?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very often it happens that it is the vital or the mind that causes conflict. Someone came to me the other day because he was getting pain in the chest near the heart. I told him that his vital and mind are on one side and his heart and soul are on the other side. There will come a time, for him and for others like him, when the heart and soul will allow a compromise. Who wants to fight all the time? The vital and mind are unruly children and they are not under our control. So after some time the heart and soul allow the vital and the mind to go their own way. They say, "All right, let us make a kind of compromise. What can be done?"</p>
<p>But again, there comes a time when the heart and soul of a seeker will not care for any compromise because they also have their strength. The soul is infinitely more powerful than the vital and mind, so the soul and the heart challenge and fight the vital and the mind. They say, "Now this time we really want your complete and permanent transformation. No compromise; we have to win."</p>
<p>At the time of this conflict, the mind has to surrender to the will of the heart and soul. The real aspiring heart has no will of its own because it is constantly crying and aspiring to reach the Highest. The heart's aspiration is already at the root of the tree, which is realisation. But until the mind is illumined, it will also cry; it will cry until it constantly cries with the heart.</p>
<p>The heart will never leave the mind behind. We have to allow the heart to capture the mind and not allow the mind to doubt, suspect or delay the progress of the heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can you surrender when your vital does not want to?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can you surrender when your vital does not want to?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Think of your vital as a tennis ball. The tennis ball is in your hand. You have played with this ball for some time and you are very familiar with it. Usually you throw it against the wall and it comes back to you. But now all of a sudden you feel that you can throw it very hard and very far. Feel that you have thrown the ball out into the sea. That sea is the sea of ignorance. Just throw your vital there and forget about it. Also feel that you do not know how to swim. The sea of ignorance will take care of your vital. You just remain in the heart. The best thing is not to think of your vital; don't even think that you <em>have</em> a vital. But if you see that you do have a vital, throw it immediately into the sea of ignorance. Then forget about it and remain in the heart. That is one way.</p>
<p>There is also another way to control the vital so that you can make surrender. Each time you are tempted, observe the fulfilment that you get from your vital as you do the thing that you are tempted to do. Do what you want to do, but then be an impartial judge. The moment you become an impartial judge, automatically your divinity will come to the fore. Your soul will give a mark of zero out of a hundred to your vital demand. But if you don't become a judge, then you quickly become one with your action. You listen to the vital and your very willingness to accept the vital's demands is your surrender. When you become the judge you give zero out of a hundred to your action. Again, when you are ready to stand in judgement, you have to feel that there is something superior to your action which has inspired you to become the judge. The action you have performed, but you are no longer one with the action. When you become a judge, at that time you are totally separated from the action, you are a neutral party. Since you are neutral, whether your action is good or bad you will think that somebody else has done it, not you.</p>
<p>A judge has two parties to deal with. He himself does not belong to either party. When you become the judge, immediately you will see that the two parties are the vital and the heart; two members of the same family are both claiming you. The vital is claiming you as its very own and the heart is also claiming you as its very own. It is up to you to be partial to one of them. Immediately you will say, "O my heart, I want you and not my vital." In that way you separate yourself from the vital the moment you become the judge. You put the heart on one side and the vital on the other side. In this way you can make your surrender.</p>
<p>Ultimately it is the heart that will win, never the vital. And when the heart wins, the heart will illumine the vital; it will not destroy the vital. Our heart never destroys anything, it only illumines. If the vital is impure, then it will be purified; if it is unlit, then it will be illumined. Nothing is ever destroyed, it is only transformed-transformed and illumined.</p>
