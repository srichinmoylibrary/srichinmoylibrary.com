<p><em>(Vishma is lying down on a bed of arrows made by Arjuna. Arjuna and Krishna have come to pay him their last respects. Vishma suddenly bursts into tears.)</em></p>
<p>ARJUNA: Krishna, Krishna, please tell me why my grandfather is shedding tears? He has read and studied the Vedas. He has read and studied all our Indian scriptures. He knows perfectly well that death is not the end. Why, then, is he afraid of death? It was he who told us how to kill him, despite the fact that he was our adversary in this war. Who else on earth would tell his opponents how to kill him? He has shown the world the zenith of the heart's nobility and magnanimity. His soul is the height of sacrifice. O Krishna, is there anything on earth that you do not know? Tell me, O Krishna, what can I do for him? I will do anything for my grandfather. We lost our father when we were quite young. Vishma replaced our father with his constant love and concern. His sacrifice for us was unparalleled. Now, Krishna, do tell me why he is crying and weeping.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: I do not know, Arjuna. You can ask him. He will tell you.</p>
<p>ARJUNA: Grandfather, please tell me why you are weeping. What can I do for you?</p>
<p>VISHMA: My child, I am weeping not because I am afraid of death. I am shedding bitter tears for one simple reason: because your Pandava family has suffered so much. The Kauravas have been torturing you right from the beginning. Krishna is the Lord of the Universe, yet your suffering has no end. I do not know how it is that you have suffered so much when Krishna has been with you all the time. How is it possible for him to observe your suffering? His heart is all love and concern for you. I do not understand his game; that is why I am shedding tears.</p>
<p>KRISHNA <em>(smiling):</em> O Vishma, O man of wisdom, my mystery is unfathomable. You know that my heart has been suffering with Arjuna's family. My soul is one with them. Both my divine existence and my human existence are one with them.</p>
<p>VISHMA: O Lord, you are dearer to me than my life itself. You made a solemn promise that you would not take weapons, that you would not fight, yet twice you left your chariot to kill me. On the third day and on the ninth day of the battle, you came out of your chariot to kill me. I was so filled with joy, for it was by you, my Lord, that I wanted to be killed. To die in your presence, to be killed by your weapons, means to go to Heaven immediately. Nothing can be more glorious than to be killed by the Lord Himself. O Krishna, when you came out of the chariot to kill me, I wanted to embrace you in the battlefield, but Arjuna pulled you back into the chariot. Arjuna, you have done me a terrible disservice.</p>
<p>ARJUNA: I wanted Krishna to keep his promise, Grandfather. He promised he would not fight, that he would only be my charioteer.</p>
<p>VISHMA <em>(to Krishna):</em> I know, Krishna, that you are now with me. The end of my life is fast approaching. You have many times blessed me, O Krishna, with your divine presence. But this time please bless me in a different way: place your ever-compassionate hands on my head, and let this blessing of yours carry me into the highest plane of Peace.</p>
<p><em>(Krishna blesses Vishma. Vishma sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Shanti shanti hridaye shanty</em><br /><em>Parane shanti raje</em><br /><em>Chira manohar kanur banshari</em><br /><em>Dyuloke bhuloke baje</em><br /><em>Ghor danaber hingshar chhaya</em><br /><em>Andhar nishar agyana-maya</em><br /><em>Hariye phelechhi amar e tanu</em><br /><em>Mana prana antare</em><br /><em>Akuti amar taba kripa nire</em><br /><em>Nirabadhi santare</em></p>


<p>Peace, Peace,<br /> Peace within my heart reigns supreme.<br /> The soul-stirring flute of Lord Krishna<br /> Is being played in my Heaven<br /> And on my earth.</p>
<p>The destruction-shadows of dark demons<br /> And the ignorance-delusion of sombre night<br /> Lie long-buried in the depths<br /> Of my body, mind, heart and life.<br /> My aspiration-flames ever swim across<br /> The expanse of Your Compassion-Waters.</p>

<p>KRISHNA: Vishma, the world knows about your supreme promises and supreme sacrifices. To fulfil your father's desire you did not marry, you did not take the throne. The Kauravas supported you. Morality-bound, you fought for them. The human in you fought with the human, the undivine. The divine in you fought with the divine for the divine. The human in you fought against the Pandavas. The divine in you told the Pandavas how to kill you. Arjuna has listened to your advice, and now you are dying. Your life is now a matter of a few hours. I offer to you all my heart's boundless Love, Peace and Bliss. Here on earth you are immortal, and there in Heaven you are immortal. Your promise is the pride of Mother Earth and your sacrifice is the pride of Father Heaven.</p>

<p><em>(Utanka's ashram. Utanka is meditating.)</em> <em>(Enter Krishna.)</em></p>
<p>UTANKA: Krishna, Krishna, you have come. I am so happy, so delighted, so grateful. Give me some news.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: News? Have you not heard about the Kurukshetra battle?</p>
<p>UTANKA: No, I have been praying and meditating here all the time. I have heard no news. I do not know anything about the Kurukshetra battle. What happened? Tell me, Krishna, tell me.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Oh, it's a long story.</p>
<p>UTANKA: But tell me what has happened.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Utanka, all one hundred brothers of Duryodhana were killed on the battlefield.</p>
<p>UTANKA: Duryodhana's brothers killed? What had they done?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: You know that they were very unspiritual, very undivine. You know how they tortured the Pandava family and me all the time. You know that.</p>
<p>UTANKA: I know, I know, but that doesn't mean that they had to be killed. Who has killed them?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: The Pandavas, with the help of their friends.</p>
<p>UTANKA: I can't understand this. Tell me, were you there?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Yes, I was there. I was Arjuna's charioteer. I did not fight.</p>
<p>UTANKA: You did not fight, but your very presence was a great help to them. You gave them inspiration and strength. Krishna, I shall curse you. You are responsible for ruining such a big family. I am sure that many, many, many people were killed.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: True, many people were killed and Yudhishthira is now the King of Hastinapura. He is a very pious King. You know he and sincerity go together, he and purity go together, he and all virtues go together.</p>
<p>UTANKA: I don't deny it. He will make a good King. But so many people were killed, so many people from the Kaurava family were destroyed. You have just seen it. What kind of news are you giving me, Krishna?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: I tried my best. I went there personally to avert the war, but the Kaurava princes wouldn't listen to me. They mocked me. They insulted me.</p>
<p>UTANKA: Now, I see. That is the reason you entered into this battle, because they insulted and mocked you. Why didn't you tell me that that was the reason?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: No, that is not true. It was not because they insulted and mocked me, but because I saw that the time had come for them to be destroyed. In every way I tried to prevent the battle, avert the war. I asked that they give the Pandavas only five villages, but they wouldn't do it. So it was the Will of God that they be destroyed.</p>
<p>UTANKA: Will of God! Will of God! It was the will of Krishna the rogue! <em>(All of a sudden.)</em> Wait, Krishna, wait!</p>
<p>KRISHNA: What is wrong?</p>
<p>UTANKA: I hear a message from within. Allow me to concentrate on it. <em>(He concentrates.)</em> Ah, Krishna. I shall not curse you, but you have to fulfil my desire.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Let me know what your desire is.</p>
<p>UTANKA: My inner voice says that you showed your Universal Form to Arjuna before the Kurukshetra battle. Is it true? Is it true? I have been longing to see the Universal Form in you for such a long time, Krishna. Krishna, I shall not curse you. Please, please show me your Universal Form.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Oh, Utanka, all right. I don't want to be cursed by you. I shall show you my Universal Form.</p>
<p><em>(Krishna shows his Universal Form. Utanka touches Krishna's feet.)</em></p>
<p>UTANKA: O Krishna, I have seen in you an infinite sky; hundreds of suns, stars, planets; all the creatures and human beings. They are all taking birth, living and dying within you, under your supreme guidance. Inside you all the universal forces are functioning. O Krishna, forgive me! Forgive me, O Lord of my existence, O Lord of the world.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: I have forgiven you, Utanka. I didn't want to be cursed by you. That is why I have fulfilled your desire. Now, do you have any more desires to be fulfilled?</p>
<p>UTANKA: O Krishna, after seeing your Universal Form, can there be any other desire?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Think it over. I have much to do at home. Is there anything else you want before I leave?</p>
<p>UTANKA: O Krishna, since you are all-powerful, all-loving, please give me one boon.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: What kind of boon do you want, Utanka?</p>
<p>UTANKA: This place is a dry desert. There is no water here at all. I wish to have water. Please supply me with water, O Krishna.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: That is very easy. Whenever you want to have water, just think of me and water will be supplied.</p>
<p><em>(Utanka, with deepest gratitude, touches Krishna's feet.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Utanka is very thirsty, and there is no pure water in the house. He invokes Krishna.)</em></p>
<p>UTANKA: O Krishna, fulfil your promise. I need water, pure water. Let me see if you come, or how the water will come.</p>
<p><em>(Immediately, a Chandala (undertaker) comes forward with a glass of water and offers it to Utanka.)</em></p>
<p>UTANKA: You untouchable! How dare you come to me with water! True, I am thirsty, but I will never take water from an untouchable. Get away from here! I don't need you. I will die of thirst before I drink anything that you have touched.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Chandala)</em></p>
<p>UTANKA: O Krishna! You rogue! True, I wanted water. I am practically dying of thirst, but did you have to send an undertaker, an untouchable, with my water? This is how you insult me. I don't need that kind of water. Either bring me the water yourself, or I don't need any water from you. I shall manage my life as I did before you gave me that boon, you rogue. <em>(Enter Krishna.)</em> Krishna, you didn't keep your promise. You didn't give me water, at least not pure water that I could drink.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Water! I sent Indra himself to you, not with water, but with divine nectar.</p>
<p>UTANKA: Indra?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Yes, in the garb of a Chandala. He wanted to test you, to see whether you have conquered the feeling of superiority and inferiority, purity and impurity, whether you have gone beyond that after having seen my Universal Form.</p>
<p>UTANKA: You know, Krishna, that I am a Brahmin. I thought that he was a Chandala. He came in that garb. How can I drink water from a Chandala? Why did he deceive me?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: He did not deceive you, Utanka. He came to see whether you had really gone beyond caste. Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra and Chandala all go together. They are all in the Heart of God, in the Heart of the Supreme.</p>
<p>UTANKA: O Krishna, forgive me. Now it is too late. What am I going to do? What can I do?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Utanka, I have forgiven you. From now on whenever you are in need of water, you will be supplied with water in another way. You invoke me and with my occult power, I shall form clouds in the sky and cause rain. Then you will have no dearth of water. This plot of land will always have enough water. And the clouds that form in the sky will be called <em>Utanka megh</em> from now on. In the future, those who stay in this land, when they see these rain clouds, will call them <em>Utanka.</em></p>
<p>UTANKA: Krishna, you are all forgiveness. You are a constant miracle. You are constant joy. You are constant fulfilment. This ungrateful heart of mine is at your compassionate feet.</p>

<p><em>(The cartman has reached his destination. Enter Krishna and Arjuna.)</em></p>
<p>ARJUNA: What are you going to do with all these flowers? It seems to me that you have already brought a few cartloads of flowers here. What a huge pile of flowers I see! What are you doing with so many flowers?</p>
<p>MAN: I have no time to speak to you. I am now employed in serious business. I can speak only to one person on earth, and that is Bhima, the second Pandava.</p>
<p>ARJUNA: Why?</p>
<p>MAN: Don't argue with me. He is the greatest spiritual seeker of all. When he meditates just for a minute or two before his meals, saying, "O Mighty Lord Shiva," he offers thousands of flowers to the Lord. His concentration is most intense; his meditation is most sincere. Look, in his family he has a brother named Arjuna, who only offers one flower at a time to Lord Shiva. He just shows off, meditating for hours. God alone knows when Arjuna will come to realise that his meditation, his power of concentration, is nowhere near his brother Bhima's.</p>
<p>ARJUNA: Krishna, enough humiliation! You are humiliating me in every way! Why do you humiliate me so badly?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: This is not humiliation, my dearest Arjuna. This is illumination. I am teaching the world through you. I wanted to teach you that it is not how many flowers you offer or how many hours you meditate that counts, but rather your power of concentration, your power of dedication. You pray to this god and that god. You want to please all the gods. You collect many flowers and offer them to Lord Shiva one by one, for two hours every day. Each time, while offering a flower, you utter the name of Lord Shiva. You think that, since you offer many flowers to Lord Shiva and the other gods for so many hours, you are the best seeker. This is your pride, O Arjuna. It was my boundless love and compassion for you that wanted to shatter your pride. O Arjuna, again and again I tell you, you are my dearest disciple, my dearest friend. You have established your eternal oneness with me.</p>

<p><em>(A scholar is walking along the street. He sees a Brahmin holding a copy of the Bhagavad-Gita and weeping.)</em></p>
<p>SCHOLAR: O Brahmin, your eyes are swimming in a sea of tears. My heart is all sympathy for you. I clearly see that you have been unable to understand the teachings of the <em>Gita.</em> But I shall gladly help you. Tell me, where do you find it difficult? Which particular <em>shloka</em> don't you understand? I shall explain it to you.</p>
<p>BRAHMIN: There is a special reason why I am weeping.</p>
<p>SCHOLAR: Yes, I am sure you have a special reason. Why don't you be frank with me? Tell me straight away which particular <em>shloka</em> you find difficult to understand.</p>
<p>BRAHMIN: You will not understand me. You will not believe me.</p>
<p>SCHOLAR: I <em>will</em> understand you. I <em>will</em> believe you. Tell me why you are weeping. I have not much time, for I am now on my way to my school, where my students are waiting for me. Please don't waste my time. Please tell me.</p>
<p><em>(Brahmin sings.)</em></p>

<p>I am a fool, they say.<br /> Am I, am I a fool?<br /> I go to my inner School;<br /> God's Eye my eternal Day.</p>
<p>To help my Lord in His Play,<br /> To found His Smile on earth,<br /> My divinely human birth.<br /> Yet I am a fool, they say.</p>

<p>BRAHMIN: I am weeping, I am weeping because . . .</p>
<p>SCHOLAR: Please don't waste my time. Don't weep, don't weep. Just let me know what you can't understand and I shall immediately help you.</p>
<p>BRAHMIN: I am weeping because I see the Lord Krishna right in front of me. No matter which page I turn to, I see Arjuna's charioteer, Krishna. These are my psychic tears. I see my Lord in all the pages. I see Sri Krishna in His chariot. That is why I am shedding tears. It is not that I do not understand the teachings of the <em>Gita.</em></p>
<p><em>(The scholar bows to the Brahmin.)</em></p>
<p>SCHOLAR: I have studied the Gita hundreds of times. I have taught thousands of people the Gita, but none of them have said that they have seen Lord Krishna. They haven't seen even a spark of Sri Krishna's light. I have personally talked and talked about the Gita. I have taught and taught the Gita, but I have never seen Sri Krishna on the pages, or before my eyes in a mental vision. I have never felt his presence deep in my heart. (Pauses.) O Brahmin, forgive my arrogance, forgive my impertinence. Today I am not going to school to teach. Today is the end of my teaching career. Today begins my life of aspiration, my life of the inner cry. From now on I shall only pray to Krishna instead of explaining Him. Instead of speaking about Him I shall meditate on Him, and like you, I am sure, one day I will be able to see Krishna, my beloved Lord. My life of outer teaching now ends, and my life of inner searching begins.</p>
