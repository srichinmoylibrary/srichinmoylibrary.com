<p>Consul General Lakhan Mehrotra of the Consulate General of India in San Francisco, a man of illumining vision and a rising sun of Tomorrow’s Dawn, speaks most soulfully of U Thant’s spiritual presence with these significant words: “It was a matter of the greatest privilege for me to have met Mr. U Thant, Secretary-General of the United Nations, in 1963 and 1964 when I was myself posted in New York at the Consulate General of India. I was deeply impressed by the spiritual glow which seemed to emanate from the personality of the Secretary-General. I had known him for several years as a devout Buddhist and as one who carried something of the Buddha in him in terms of sympathy for the suffering humanity. But one had to see him to believe what was preserved of the spiritual strength he carried within himself. His passing has been a great loss, particularly to us in Asia who had known him as one sincerely anxious for the liberation of regimes under colonial rule. It was only right and proper that among the many distinctions with which Mr. U Thant was honoured, he should have received the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding.”</p>

<p>New York’s untiringly dedicated Mayor Abraham Beame remarks on the former Secretary General’s adeptness in piloting the world-boat: “In stormy times, he was an island of calm in a sea of controversy. His meditative ways helped him to maintain the neutrality so necessary to sustaining the confidence of differing nations.</p>
<p>“The people of our own nation always respected his ability to mediate differences among the nations, and we always admired his desire to attain justice for all.</p>
<p>“The City, which is proud to be the home of the United Nations, will always revere the memory of the Burma-born schoolteacher who guided the world through a particularly turbulent decade in its history.”</p>

<p>U Thant’s service to the United Nations and his dream for mankind will forever flourish, irrevocably affirms Donald Keys, a very good friend and genuine well-wisher of U Thant. Mr. Keys, who is U.N. Representative for the World Association of World Federalists, declares: “U Thant was one with the soul of the United Nations, which is the soul of mankind. He lived and worked for the enlightenment, freedom and unification of mankind in all that he did. Out of his own divinity he created a bridge between humanity and the Supreme — the Father of us all. His service to man is not ended with his passing, because it will persist forever, proceeding out of his own spiritual stature. It is only universalised, transformed to a greater and more powerful dimension. The touch of sadness in his going comes from his own sadness that he was unable to serve more, do more, to be received more fully by mankind. We will all endeavour to take up more effectively the little part that we may play in realising his dream of human enlightenment and liberation.”</p>

<p>Jose D. Ingles, Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, said, “Although U Thant stepped down from the high position of Secretary-General soon after the silver anniversary of the Organization, he remained its living symbol, and was affectionately called ‘Mr. United Nations’. His death marks the close of an era in the life of the United Nations.”</p>
<p>The world knew U Thant as the Secretary-General. Some devoted friends and admirers called him “Mr. United Nations.” The seekers called him a giant apostle of peace. God called him His Manifestation-Fulfilment son.</p>

<p>In silence U Thant adhered dauntlessly to his wise principles. It happens that sometimes when one is unyielding and forthright, one loses friends, dear ones and even the world’s good will. But in the case of U Thant, the story is otherwise during the ten years that he so successfully piloted the United Nations-Boat.</p>
<p>Bradford Morse, Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs at the time, has offered us abundant light and convincing assurance on this matter: “Both in the political crises which occurred during his time as Secretary-General and in the development of the economic and social work of the Organization, he displayed courage and total dedication to the United Nations in disregard of any private interests or even of his own physical well-being.”</p>
<p>Something more that Mr. Morse tells the world is quite soul-stirring: “Many of us here became his devoted friends. We admired, above all, his humanity, his respect for human dignity and his complete integrity. To me, U Thant was a personal friend whose wisdom, kindness and generosity I shall never forget. We shall all remember him as a man who gave himself unstintingly to the cause of peace, progress and justice in the world.”</p>

<p>Peace is a universal hunger. Each individual needs peace right from the cradle to the grave. When the young generation acquires peace, the teeming problems of the world will not remain problems any longer. The young generation will unite the old and the new with its dynamic achievement: peace.</p>
<p>Peace spreads, peace flows, peace becomes, peace is. In the domain of the vital, peace spreads. In the domain of the mind, peace flows. In the domain of the heart, peace becomes. In the domain of the soul, peace is.</p>
<p>Peace spreads its illumining beauty. Peace flows with its satisfying delight. Peace becomes perfection. Peace is Immortality’s infinite treasure.</p>
<p>U Thant the peace-educator teaches us: <em>“One of the great tasks of education all over the world is to educate the young for peace because, on the question of peace, no man of good will can be neutral.”</em></p>

<p>U Thant the wisdom-bestower is unique in presenting us with his soul’s largesse: <em>“We have already begun to realise that in modern war there is no such thing as victor and vanquished: that there is only a loser, and that loser is mankind.”</em></p>
<p>We are all aware of the undeniable fact that war results in victory and defeat. But this is a surface experience that covers our human mind and our human life. The inner experience is totally different. In the inner world, war is an immediate experience of separativity, and separativity is nothing short of tremendous loss in the world of oneness. Oneness alone can feed humanity’s eternal hunger and bring about satisfaction. Those who cherish the body-reality’s separation-consciousness are deplorable losers in the process of God’s evolution in and through mankind.</p>

<p>Before the dawn of civilisation and after the dawn of civilisation, what the world saw and has always seen has been an endless series of fights, battles and wars. Humanity could have easily avoided the destructive experiences of the hoary past if it had longed for a higher vision and a deeper reality.</p>
<p>U Thant the reality-dreamer says to us: <em>“In the wake of the most catastrophic war in the history of mankind, humanity had a new vision: it saw the glimmer of dawn of a warless world.”</em></p>
<p>Humanity’s preparation depends on humanity’s willingness. Humanity’s willingness depends on humanity’s consecrated surrender to God’s Will. A oneness-world either in the near or in the distant future is not only possible and practicable, but inevitable. A oneness-world expedites God’s Hour, and it is only in God’s Hour that humanity’s agelong hunger drinks in Divinity’s Nectar-Delight.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the fruit of the Immortals is for mortals, too, for God the finite reality and God the Reality infinite are inseparable. Together they are heading towards one goal: satisfaction in perfection.</p>

<p>Happiness: where is it, if not in the core of an integral life?</p>
<p>Happiness: what is it, if not an expansion-vision of an integral life?</p>
<p>U Thant, the exponent and embodiment of an integral life, affirms: <em>“Pure intellectual development unaccompanied by a corresponding moral and spiritual development will lead mankind from one crisis to another. Moral qualities of friendship, humility and the desire to understand the other point of view are as important as intellectual excellence.”</em></p>
<p>On the earth plane, an integral life is the glad unification of intellectual, moral and spiritual fulfilment. An intellectual life need not be an expansion of a dry, aloof and superior feeling. Love of intellect, in its purest sense, is a life that desires to see the reality in its minute and subtle details. In the skies of the mind, this yearning itself is a higher step towards the ultimate heights of the Beyond.</p>
<p>Morality does not mean a life-torturing needle. Morality does not mean a constant vigil over the animal in us. Morality is an illumining reality that takes us from a lesser goal of confusion-bondage to a greater goal of perfection-freedom. Morality is not the rope that strangles us; it is the rope that saves us.</p>
<p>Spirituality is not an act of withdrawal from world activities. Spirituality is not hallucination-reality. Spirituality is not something that has a liking for Heaven and a constant dislike of earth. No! Real spirituality is the conscious awareness of God the Creator and God the creation. It is the feeling of constant oneness with God the One and God the many. It is the continuous transcendence of the animal into the human, of the human into the divine and of the divine into the supreme Reality.</p>
<p>If we view life as a unified experience of an intellectual reality, moral reality and spiritual reality, then this world of ours can be nothing but satisfaction-happiness in God’s cosmic Play.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">U Thant the task-giver</h2><span property="dc:title" content="U Thant the task-giver" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>U Thant the task-giver asks two questions that can not only keep us on the alert constantly but also fulfil us eventually: <em>“Every man or woman should not only ask himself or herself what he or she is going to do in the world, but also ask, ‘Will there be a world in which I can live?’ ”</em></p>
<p>Satisfaction of the individual is undoubtedly a most significant achievement. No doubt it is a form of perfection. But the individual has to ask himself whether, with this perfection, he can remain outside the world-boundary. The answer will always be in the negative. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that the world in which we live also be perfect.</p>
<p>As we strive for our individual perfection, even so we shall strive for the collective perfection and the perfection of the world-body. Perfection has to loom large simultaneously in the individual soul, in the collective soul and in the world-soul. This is the only thing that we are supposed to accomplish here on earth and we shall, without fail, accomplish it.</p>

<p>Revolution, inner and outer. The outer revolution quite often leads to destruction. The inner revolution is our constant cry for illumining progress, which is derived from the heart of freedom.</p>
<p>Freedom is humanity’s choice. Freedom is Divinity’s choice. With freedom, humanity ultimately grows into God the transcendental Vision. With freedom, Divinity ultimately grows into the universal Reality.</p>
<p>U Thant the freedom-revolutionary tells us: <em>“The revolution brought by science and technology to the developed nations is a revolutionary extension of human freedom. Freedom is choice. Freedom is the ability to act.... ”</em></p>
<p>Science and technology help us walk along a particular road of freedom. Spirituality helps us walk along a different road of freedom. But before we walk along the freedom-road of science and technology, science and technology advise us to look around and grasp the secrets of the world’s beauty-reality. Before we walk along the freedom-road of spirituality, spirituality advises us to dive deep within and unveil the world’s soul-reality. If we abide by their wise advice, we please the science and technology world with our dedication-service and we satisfy the spirituality world with our aspiration-cry. Dedication-service leads us to the Reality that we are supposed to grow into. Aspiration-cry leads us to the Reality which we eternally are.</p>

<p>Teacher and student. The teacher prepares; the student completes. The teacher begins; the student ends. The teacher is the vision in reality; the student is the reality in vision. The teacher helps the student climb; the student helps the teacher spread.</p>
<p>“Self-giving is delight.” So says the teacher. “Receiving is delight.” So says the student.</p>
<p>When giving and receiving can be accomplished cheerfully and unconditionally, seed the teacher and fruit the student fulfil each other.</p>
<p>U Thant the education-lover sees student and teacher as two eternal friends: <em>“...the teachers are the true architects of minds, and the students are the true builders of peace. If the teachers instruct the younger generation in the ways of peace, not only will their work succeed, but the basic idea of peace in our time will triumph.”</em></p>
