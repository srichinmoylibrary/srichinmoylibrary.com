<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to offer a soulful prayer to the Inner Pilot of Cebu on the strength of my heart's oneness with each citizen of Cebu.O Inner Pilot, Supreme Pilot of Cebu, You have given us simplicity in our lives. You have given us sincerity in our minds. You have given us purity in our hearts. You have given us many, many good qualities out of Your boundless Compassion-Light.</p>
<p>Now we pray to You only for one thing: poise, poise, poise â€” inner poise in our central being. We feel that once we can establish ourselves in the beauty, light, delight, power and fragrance of inner poise, at that time all the divine qualities that You have already given us out of Your boundless Bounty will supremely and completely blossom.</p>
<p>Right now the divine qualities that we have are not enough to make us absolutely perfect citizens of the world. But if once we can swim in Eternity's sea of infinite inner Poise, then we are bound to arrive at our destined Goal. At that time our lifeboat will definitely arrive at the Golden Shore of the ever-transcending Beyond.</p>

Each individual in this beautiful place I regard as my own, very own.

He has done us a great favour by allowing us to be associated with this International Airport. For that, to the Manager and Engineer here, I am offering my deepest gratitude.</p>

<h2>Question: Is this your first time in Dumaguete?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I came to Dumaguete for the first time 23 years ago. At that time I gave a talk at Silliman University to the medical students. In my talk I said that spirituality and medicine must go together because our goal is the same: to conquer disease, ignorance and, finally, death. God is inside spirituality and He is also inside medicine. In a tug-of-war, when there are two persons on one side and only one person on the other side, the side that has two persons will definitely win. So spirituality and medical science must join together on one side in the tug-of-war. Since only one enemy stands against us â€” disease â€” we are bound to win.</p>
<p>God is inside you, inside me, inside everybody. No matter what you are, no matter what I am, deep inside us is the same God. In a family, one person may be a lawyer, one may be a doctor, one may be a military man and one may be a politician, but each one has the same father. So the more people in our world-family that we can get on our side, the easier it will be for us to fight against disease and death.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do you notice many changes on your return to Dumaguete after so many years?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do you notice many changes on your return to Dumaguete after so many years?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I see that the inner, spiritual qualities of Dumaguete have been kept intact, and for that I am so happy. Again, modernism and scientific development also have entered. On the one hand, that is good, but sometimes we surrender our inner qualities, our heart's qualities, when we develop the material life. Then we lose the most precious thing in life.</p>
<p>I am so happy that in Dumaguete you have kept a balance between them. You have kept your spirituality and, at the same time, you have adopted modern, scientific ways. I am seeing that you are able to derive benefit from technology and, at the same time, keep your precious qualities of the heart.</p>
<p>Some countries, unfortunately, become very hungry or greedy. They want only outer development, outer achievements, material success, material prosperity. They neglect their inner qualities; their simplicity, sincerity, purity, humility and other good qualities they lose or destroy. They know what they are destroying, but they do not care. They feel that people have only outer eyes, and they want only outer appreciation and admiration. You do not know at this moment whether I am having a good thought or a bad thought, whether I am thinking well of you or inwardly criticising you. But if you see me wearing a nice suit or something very gorgeous, then immediately you admire and appreciate me. Outer appearances can easily fool us.</p>
<p>If we allow modern technology to lord it over us, it can and will, but at the same time we may lose our heart's main quality, which is love. The call letters of your radio station are LUV â€” love. Our philosophy is love, devotion and surrender. We start with love. In everything we do, we try to express our love of God. We love both God the Creator and God the creation and feel that He is not only high in Heaven, but also here on earth. He is not only above us, but also within us and around us.</p>
<p>Again, we have to know there are two kinds of love â€” human love and divine love. Human love is all possession. Divine love is expansion. With human love we are only thinking of loving and being loved by one individual. Divine love wants to love everybody â€” the whole creation. Human love is very limited. If you are born in Dumaguete, your love will be confined only to Dumaguete. But if your love is divine, then it will spread throughout the length and breadth of the Philippines and enter into the farthest corners of the globe. Divine love, which thinks of God first, is all-pervading, like the boundless ocean.</p>
<p>Through your radio station, you are using your love properly. Because of your radio station, so many thousands and thousands of people are getting joy every day. If you didn't have this station, they would have only talked to the members of their family. Their love and their wisdom would be confined only to their own tiny house. But you are bringing to them the message of something far beyond their domain. You are bringing the message of universal love and oneness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How did you start your crusade?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How did you start your crusade?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We call it a pilgrimage. Pilgrims are people who have new dreams and want to envision new realities in life. We are not discarding the old dreams, but we feel we have to take a new step. I have already covered a certain distance, let us say, but now I want to take a second step, a third step and a fourth step. It is the pilgrim in us that wants to enjoy new adventures with love, purity, simplicity and humility. We use the term 'pilgrimage' because we go to various parts of the world with affection, love, concern and the feeling that the rest of the world is part of our own family.</p>
<p>A tree has quite a few branches. For us, each country is like a branch of a tree. We don't have to spend the rest of our lives on one particular branch. Like a bird we can fly from one branch to another and let the beauty, purity and fragrance of each branch enter into us.</p>
<p>The great philosopher Socrates said, "I am not an Athenian; I am cosmopolitan." We also feel the same. We claim the whole world as our own. Since we claim the whole world to be our home, each year we visit new countries and share with them our heart-power, joy and feeling of oneness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My students will run, and I will be running inside their devoted hearts. I have run marathons quite a few times, but now my knees are injured and I find I can run only on soft surfaces like a cinder track or grass. But I shall run in and through my students. They are my inspiration, my joy and my pride. I am their spiritual father. When the father grows old and can no longer run, he still inspires his children to run because he knows that running is good.</p>
<p>Here we are running for world peace. I started this movement about ten years ago and I am behind it. God, our Inner Pilot, gave us the inspiration to serve Him in this way. There are so many ways to serve God and love God, but He wanted us to serve Him by bringing peace to the fore. This world of ours has everything save and except peace. Politicians try to bring about world peace. Peace-dreamers and peace-lovers try to bring about world peace. Each one has a different way. You have one way, he has another way, I may have still another way. But we are all aiming towards the same goal.</p>
<p>We are seekers. As seekers, we will always try to do the right thing for humanity because we feel that all human beings are our brothers and sisters. So as a seeker, I will try to be of service to you by bringing peace into your entire being, and definitely you will also do the same for me.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are countless people on earth who love war, as long as other people are being destroyed. People like to watch boxing, but they don't want to be boxers themselves. At a distance people like many things.</p>
<p>The animal propensities are still dominating us. If ninety per cent of the people wanted peace and only ten per cent wanted war, then the face of the world would be totally changed. In their hearts people may want peace, but unfortunately the aggressive vital and uncompromising mind are still dominant.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can you give us a message for the people of Dumaguete?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can you give us a message for the people of Dumaguete?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My message is very, very simple. When we talk about God, immediately we think of Heaven; God is somewhere high, higher, highest. We do not feel God's Presence on earth. Often we say that God is everywhere, but as soon as we start praying, we look up to the sky. If God is everywhere, then we have to see Him here on earth as well-inside you, inside me, inside nature.</p>
<p>Dumaguete's beauty, simplicity and purity are inspiring me far beyond my imagination. About an hour ago I was telling my students that Dumaguete is paradise. If I did not have responsibilities â€” as you know, I have students all over the world â€” I would have stayed here in Dumaguete for at least another month because it reminds me of the Indian village where I was born. I was born in a village in Chittagong, which is now part of Bangladesh. Previously it was in India. Dumaguete is exactly the same as that village, especially when it comes to nature's beauty. The only difference is that some buildings here are modern. The same simplicity, the same serenity, the same purity I see all around.</p>
<p>These divine qualities are Dumaguete's contribution to the visitors who come here like pilgrims from various parts of the world. In our case, some of my students are from America, Australia, England, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Canada, Sweden, Hungary and other places. For us life is a tree and all the countries are branches. If there were no branches, if there were only the trunk, then nobody would call it a tree. There have to be branches as well as flowers and fruits.</p>
<p>When we visit a different country, we feel we are climbing up a different branch of the life-tree. Here in Dumaguete the branch is offering us such beautiful flowers and most delicious fruits â€” particularly the life's simplicity and the heart's purity. These two things are of paramount importance, and for that we are very, very grateful to the people of Dumaguete and very, very proud of their natural achievements.</p>
<p>So in one sentence I can say that the simple life, the pure heart and the inquisitive mind of Dumaguete are, for us, genuine blessingful gifts.</p>

<p>I am extremely happy to be here and to be blessed by the immortal souls of Madame Blavatsky, Annie Besant and Krishnamurti: the source and its branches. There are many giants who have offered light to the world at large. But when I think of and meditate on Madame Blavatsky, Annie Besant and Krishnamurti, I am all appreciation and admiration for them. You are carrying their light throughout the length and breadth of your beloved country, the Philippines. For that I offer you my heart's deepest joy, my heart's deepest love and my heart's deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>Now I wish to say a few words with regard to your most blessingful award, your unparalleled award. You are blessing me today with an honour that far surpasses anything I could have imagined either in my life's desire-world or in my life's aspiration-world. It is an honour that I do not deserve in the least and, I am sure, that I will never deserve either in this incarnation or in any future incarnation. It is something that I will never deserve but which I shall always treasure here on earth until I breathe my last.</p>
<p>With utmost humility, with utmost sincerity, with utmost soulfulness, I wish to pray on behalf of all of us to the Lord Supreme to bless us with a millennium of dreams that will elevate the consciousness of humanity and make each and every human being supremely perfect. I am praying to God to bless each and every individual each day with a new dream of world peace and a new dream of world harmony.</p>
<p>As long as we love the desire-world, either consciously or unconsciously, our dream will be to possess the world. As long as we live in the world of desire, our dream will be of boundless material wealth so that we can exercise our supremacy and lord it over others. We feel that by being above others or ahead of others we shall be able to derive satisfaction. But this is a deplorable mistake. We will never find satisfaction by either possessing the world or being possessed by the world.</p>
<p>Again, if we live in the world of aspiration, we will cherish other sweet and beautiful dreams. Our dream will be to become conscious and sleepless God-lovers and God-servers. Our dream will be to love and serve each and every human being so that God can constantly manifest His own ever-transcending Dream and Reality in and through us. As seekers of the ultimate truth, we will dream only of realising, revealing and manifesting our Beloved Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>Right now we are a finite existence, but we are trying to become one with God the Infinite. We are tiny drops, but when we consciously throw ourselves into the ocean of God's Infinity, at that time our finite existence becomes part and parcel of the Infinite. Only then do we get true satisfaction. True satisfaction we get not by possessing the Infinite but by becoming one with the vast, immense, infinite Reality that has been given to us by God the Creator and which is enjoyed by God the creation in us. True satisfaction lies in becoming one with God's infinite Existence and then revealing and manifesting God's Dream on earth.</p>
<p>If every day we pray to God to bless us with His Infinity's Love, Infinity's Harmony and Infinity's Peace, needless to say, God will definitely listen to our prayer and make us not only His choicest children of the millennium but also His Immortality's Satisfaction Delight. Right now we are invoking God the Infinite to liberate us from our finite existence. But a day shall come when God the Infinite will be pleased with us because we lovingly, soulfully and unconditionally represent His own Infinity. At that time God the Immortal will begin playing His Role in and through us by immortalising the Infinity that we have already become.</p>
<p>God the Infinite will be immortalised by God the Immortal â€” not for a million or a billion years, but for Eternity. God's Immortality in us will have neither a beginning nor an end, for it is a birthless and deathless Dream that embodies the most illumining and fulfilling Reality â€” a Reality that will be sung by the universal Consciousness and appreciated and loved by the transcendental Consciousness of the highest Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>So today's dream shall fly high, higher, highest in the firmament of Light and Delight and eventually grow into God's immortal Satisfaction-Light, which is constantly transcending its own Infinity. This is our dream of today, but tomorrow it shall become the Reality that God the Immortal has for us and that God the Immortal is in us.</p>
<p>My utmost affection, love, joy and pride I am offering to the members of the Theosophical Society here, to all those who are serving the Society and also to all those who are dreaming of the Millennium. Let us offer our hearts and souls and dedicate our lives to being part and parcel of the divine Millennium, which every day, every hour, every minute and every second is growing and glowing in the hearts of all human beings who are trying to manifest the Song of the Absolute Supreme.</p>
<p>We all came into the world to love Him, to please Him, to manifest Him and to fulfil Him in His own Way. This is our only satisfaction. So let us delay no more. Let us fulfil our God-ordained task lovingly, cheerfully, soulfully and, finally, unconditionally. The satisfaction that the world desperately needs will come only from our love of God and our service to God in His own Way.</p>
