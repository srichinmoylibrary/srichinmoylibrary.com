<p>Sri Ramachandra was walking past the palace of the ancient sage and philosopher, Gautama, when he heard a cry from the earth beneath his feet. Looking down he saw the frail frame of a woman in the dust. As he helped her up her body became alive and she cried, burying her tears in his feet. "O Rama!"</p>
<p>Rama said, "What have I done? Please tell me what I can do for you. Forgive me!"</p>
<p>The woman said, "I am Ahalya. I was the wife of Gautama, the sage. My body has lain here for hundreds of years because of the curse Gautama put on me. I was unfaithful to him when Indra tempted me. I was left here to feast on the wind, and all my beauty was taken from me."</p>
<p>Rama said, "What can I do for you?"</p>
<p>"You have already done it, my Lord. You have touched me. Now I am pure. Now I am pure. You have saved my life. Now please tell me what I can do for you?"</p>
<p>Rama said, "What you will do for me? You are free from your sin. That is what gives me most joy. So from now on, remain in your beauty. Never be unfaithful. Lead a life of purity, as you lived before you were married. Please go back and regain your purity, regain your spirituality, regain everything that you had.</p>
<p>"Physical beauty should be an expression of inner beauty. Physical beauty must not attract others. On the contrary, physical beauty should only inspire others to become friends with their own inner beauty, which is all light. Physical beauty must not be a hindrance. Physical beauty must not lord itself over others. Physical beauty should be an added thing to the inner beauty. It should be a true expression of the inner beauty, which reflects the Divinity and Immortality within us. Inner beauty and outer beauty must go together, fulfilling each other. Inner beauty is self-giving. Outer beauty is Light-spreading."</p>
<p>Ahalya fell down at Rama's feet and offered her heart of gratitude to him. Rama blessed her and said, "I accept your gratitude-heart. Take my blessingful joy and pride."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Ashwasen tries to avenge his father</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Ashwasen tries to avenge his father" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a snake-like man named Takshaka. Agni begged Arjuna and Krishna to destroy the forest, Khandava, where Takshaka happened to live. They listened to his request and destroyed whoever and whatever was living in the forest.</p>
<p>Takshaka and his wife were killed, but their son Ashwasen, who was just a little baby at the time, escaped. Indra, who was guarding the forest when Krishna and Arjuna began their destruction, created a great gust of wind which compelled Arjuna to swoon for a few seconds. In this brief time, Indra helped Ashwasen to escape.</p>
<p>Ashwasen grew into a mature boy. In the battle, when Karna, the great hero of the Kauravas, was fighting against Arjuna, Ashwasen entered into Karna's arrow in the form of a snake. Karna, however, was not aware of this. Even as the arrow was being aimed at Arjuna, Krishna could see that it was a most dangerous arrow. When Karna shot the arrow, Krishna pressed Arjuna's chariot one foot down into the earth. The arrow pierced Arjuna's golden crown, totally destroying it, but Arjuna was quite safe.</p>
<p>Ashwasen, the snake, came to Karna and said, "It was I who entered into your arrow to kill Arjuna. Now please use me once again."</p>
<p>"It is beneath my dignity to use the same kind of arrow twice for Arjuna," said Karna. "I will not use it."</p>
<p>"If you don't want to use my help inside your arrow, then let me go and kill Arjuna myself," pleaded Ashwasen. So Ashwasen went and tried to kill Arjuna, but he was killed by Arjuna instead; for Arjuna was an infinitely superior archer.</p>
<p>This is what Krishna, the Knower of everything, the Knower of all, can do. Had Krishna not been in Arjuna's chariot, Arjuna's head would have been cut to pieces by Karna's arrow. So the Lord will always take care of His dear ones.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Sangya&#039;s marriage to the Sun God</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Sangya&#039;s marriage to the Sun God" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Vishwakarma was a great sage. He asked his daughter, Sangya, to marry the sun, Surya. She was very happy and very proud to marry him. But alas, a very short time after their marriage, she became frightened to death whenever she saw her husband. He was extremely luminous and powerful. His brilliance and power tortured her, and she was unable to go near him.</p>
<p>So she created a lady exactly like herself and called her Chhaya. Then she left the lady with Surya and went back to her parents' house. Her father was extremely annoyed with her. He said, "How can you do this? How can you deceive your husband? He is so kind, so good, so great."</p>
<p>"But Father, what can I do? He is too powerful. His heat kills me. As soon as he comes near me, I die from his excessive heat."</p>
<p>Vishwakarma said, "You should be very proud of him. You should ask him if there is a way to keep his heat from torturing you. He is so powerful. You must go. I don't want you to come back to stay with me. After getting married, it is absurd to leave one's husband and come back to one's parents. Now you must go. I will not keep you with me."</p>
<p>So Sangya left her father, but she did not go back to Surya. She took the form of a female horse and roamed around the earth.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Surya looked everywhere for his wife. He knew that Chhaya was not his real wife, so he searched for Sangya. Finally he came to know that she had taken the form of a horse and was roaming around. Surya also took the form of a horse and found her. He said, "I am so sorry that my heat tortured you. I am taking human form again. You also please take human form again. Let us remain happily married. I will not hurt you with my heat. I will reduce my heat and power to keep you. You were so beautiful, so kind to me once upon a time. I want you to be happy. Let us go home."</p>
<p>Sangya went home with Surya. He kept his promise to her and reduced his heat and power, and they lived together peacefully and happily.</p>

<p>Surya, the sun god, and his wife, Sangya, had twin sons. Their names were Ashwini and Rebant, but everyone called them by one name — Ashwinikumar. They were extremely beautiful and looked very much alike. They became great physicians and were known as heavenly physicians. They could cure incurable diseases. Some people said they were not actually human beings, but were really Indra and Varuna. Others said that one was earth and the other Heaven. They were also called day and night, and the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>Three times a day they would leave Heaven and go to earth to watch what was happening there. They would shower earth with their love, concern and compassion. All this they would do secretly in their glowing white chariots.</p>
<p>In many cases the human physicians on earth would not be able to cure their patients. Medical science often fails. The two brothers would hear the crying families and secretly descend to earth to save the sick person. The doctors would sometimes be pronouncing the patients dead when the brothers would save them. No one could understand what had happened, but the families would dance with joy that a miracle had taken place to save their loved ones.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Alakshmi gets married</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Alakshmi gets married" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Lakshmi, the cosmic goddess, was very divine, but her older sister, Alakshmi, was totally undivine. The ocean was turned and emptied and from its floor came the undivine Alakshmi, wearing a garland full of blood. Her clothes also were stained with blood. Every part of her was covered with blood.</p>
<p>No one dared to marry the dark, ugly-looking woman; not the cosmic gods, not the demons, not even the asuras. Because she could not find a husband she was very sad and mad. She wondered, "Who will marry me?"</p>
<p>But the great sage, Duhsha, who devotedly practised austerities said, "It is my will that I do everything that nobody else can do. So, if no one wants to marry Alakshmi, then I will marry her. Not because I love her, but because nobody dares to marry her. If necessity demands, I will love her too. Right now I am only marrying her because no one else will, but if I feel like loving her, I will love her too. But let me first marry her, at least."</p>
<p>So Duhsha married Alakshmi and she was extremely happy. She wore dirty, filthy garments and adorned herself with jewels made of iron. She was the cause of all unfortunate things that happened in the family and always caused calamities. She smeared her entire body with a sandal paste made of pebbles and stones, and always carried a broom in one hand. She was ugliness incarnate and unkindness incarnate. Her very face was destruction. Her eyes and every part of her were destruction incarnate.</p>
<p>Duhsha said, "Well, I have passed my first examination; I married her, which no one else could do. But I don't even want to sit for my second examination. I don't want to love her. I don't want to love her."</p>
<p>He lived with her for a few years and then prayed, "O God, save me. It is not always advisable to go against the current. When most people do things in one way, it is advisable to follow their way and not try to do things differently in order to win appreciation and admiration from them. No, if others are doing the right thing, I should also do the right thing. I did not do the right thing by marrying this undivine woman, to say the least. So let me get rid of her and return to my spiritual, austere life. I shall enjoy only divinity in its purest form."</p>
<p>So Duhsha threw Alakshmi out of his house. She cursed him saying, "You will be destroyed."</p>
<p>Duhsha said, "Good. But I will be destroyed by someone else other than you. I am ready to be destroyed, but not by you. And if I have spiritual power, occult power, yogic power, then let us see who can destroy me. Needless to say, you cannot."</p>
<p>"No, I cannot destroy you, true, but there will be someone to destroy you someday, somewhere, somehow."</p>
<p>He said, "Let us wait and see who that person will be. But for now at least let me get some joy in my life. You get out of my life and let me get joy, joy, joy. I need joy in my life."</p>
<p>So Alakshmi had to leave her husband.</p>

<p>Dronacharya was the archery teacher for the Kauravas and Pandavas. In those days, Dronacharya was matchless in archery. Dronacharya had a son named Ashwatthwama. He was named Ashwatthwama because as soon as he was born he started neighing like a horse, and "Ashwa" means horse. Dronacharya was extremely fond of his son. Ashwatthwama learned archery from his father and became a great hero.</p>
<p>Ashwatthwama's mother was the sister of another great archer, Kripacharya. Kripacharya also helped Ashwatthwama, as well as the Kauravas and Pandavas, in archery. It was also Kripacharya who had requested Dronacharya to teach the Pandavas and Kauravas after him. They were very close relatives.</p>
<p>Ashwatthwama learned many secret ways to use the bow and arrow and soon became an expert.</p>
<p>The Pandavas were in the forest because of Arjuna's and Yudhishthira's defeat in a game of dice with Duryodhana and the Kauravas. Ashwatthwama knew that Krishna was very fond of the Pandavas, especially Arjuna. So he thought, "This is the time for me to go to Krishna and get something from him."</p>
<p>He went to Krishna and said, "I am giving you my most powerful weapon, the Brahmashira. It can kill anyone when it is used against them. Will you not give me your Sudharshan Chakra disc in return? Will you not trade with me? I would be so grateful."</p>
<p>Krishna said, "Wonderful! I am ready to exchange. Please take it."</p>
<p>Ashwatthwama tried to lift the Chakra disc up, but it was impossible for him to lift it.</p>
<p>Krishna said, "Young man, you cannot even lift my weapon. How are you going to use it?"</p>
<p>Ashwatthwama was embarrassed and ashamed. Krishna smiled at him saying, "Be satisfied with what you have and fight against others with the help of your weapon. My weapon is too heavy for you."</p>

<p>In the battle of Kurukshetra, Ashwatthwama and his father, Dronacharya, took the side of the Kauravas. When the Pandavas killed Dronacharya, Ashwatthwama was enraged. He was smitten with grief and anger and wanted to kill all of the Pandavas immediately. He begged Duryodhana to give him a chance to be the commander of the Kaurava army. Duryodhana gave him the chance.</p>
<p>It had been agreed that at night they would not fight. But Ashwatthwama, his maternal uncle, Kripacharya, and a few others that night entered the tent of the sleeping Pandavas. Ashwatthwama killed Draupadi's five sons. Then he and the others quickly ran away.</p>
<p>What they did was unthinkable. At night they were not supposed to fight; yet Ashwatthwama and his soldiers came like cowards and killed five innocent human beings.</p>
<p>Ashwatthwama went back to the Kauravas' tent and bragged like anything. Kripacharya and the soldiers who had secretly accompanied him also bragged. They said, "It does not matter how we kill, but that we kill. Who cares whether we use divine means or undivine means? Our objective is to kill. These are our enemies and although we promised that we would not fight at night, in war who cares for rules or promises? Our main promise is to kill our enemies. So we have fulfilled our main promise. Who cares to keep the other promise about only fighting during the day?"</p>
<p>All of those who went into the Kauravas' tent danced with joy because of their victory.</p>
