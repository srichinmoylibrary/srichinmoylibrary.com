  <h2 id="page-title">The Lightning Call</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Lightning Call" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I arrived in Calcutta after leaving Pondicherry, I wanted to phone my family. My sisters and brothers had driven me to the Madras airport, and then they had to make the three-and-a-half-hour drive back to Pondicherry. So I was worried about them. I felt sorry, because going and coming back came to seven hours of driving altogether. For me, it was only an hour-and-a-half plane ride from Madras to Calcutta. So after about three hours I started phoning Pondicherry to see if they had gotten back all right.</p>
<p>The operator said that the Pondicherry line was out of order and that it could be that way for two or three more days. Quite often when I try to call from New York, the operator says that the Pondicherry line is out of order. The first day I believed the operator. The second day when I tried to call, again the operator said that it was out of order. I said, "O God, what does the government do if it has to make an urgent call?"</p>
<p>The operator said, "Oh, the government has a special line that is used only for lightning calls. If you make a lightning call, you have to pay eight times more."</p>
<p>I said, "Look here, I am willing to pay eight times more."</p>
<p>The operator said, "Eight times more? Are you sure?" I said, "I have the money, so please do it."</p>
<p>So the operator made the lightning call around one-thirty in the morning, but nobody answered. My mind was worried that perhaps something had gone wrong. One is allowed to try a lightning call only twice, and then the call is cancelled. They made the second call a half hour later and still there was no answer. What had happened was this: the Calcutta hotel operator had put through the lightning call, but the rogues in Madras had used a wrong number. All the time I thought that something had gone wrong with my family's phone. It turned out that our phone was all right, but the Madras operator was putting me through to a wrong number.</p>
<p>The following day I tried to make another lightning call two times, but again it didn't go through. Whenever the call does not go through, you don't have to pay; but you always get a scolding from the operator. The operator barks at you because a lightning call is only supposed to be made by very rich or great people. They did not feel that I was rich or great enough.</p>
<p>My family couldn't call me because they didn't know at which hotel I was staying. Finally, I called my house in New York. Since nobody there had heard from my brothers and sisters, I said, "That means that everything is all right. If anything had gone wrong, they would have called New York." From New York one of the girls tried calling Pondicherry, but she had the same fate. She could not get through. Finally, she sent a telegram to my family asking if everyone was all right.</p>
<p>The next day I told the operator that I had been trying to call Pondicherry for three days. She put in another lightning call, and in two minutes the call went through. My brother answered the phone and I immediately said to him, "Why have you not been answering the phone?"</p>
<p>At the same time he said to me, "Where is your concern for us? Why have you not called us for four days? One of us has always been near the phone, worrying."</p>
<p>I said, "I have tried to make lightning calls twenty times."</p>
<p>So everything was all right. The first day when they didn't answer, I felt that perhaps my sister was tired and exhausted from travelling, and therefore she didn't hear the phone ringing. It turned out that my brother was there, but the phone line was not working at all. For three days the Pondicherry line was not working. I said, "What kind of worries the telephone can create!" I was blessing the telephone like anything.</p>
<p>I was so happy that I finally got through to Pondicherry that I called the hotel telephone operator. I had heard her say her name, Mrs. Dasgupta. She was Bengali, but we started talking in English because telephone operators always prefer to speak English. She told me, "You asked for a lightning call, but I did not make a lightning call. I have a friend in Madras and I told her to make it a special call without saying it was a lightning call." It would have cost me six hundred rupees, but now I had to pay only one hundred ten rupees. So I was very grateful to her.</p>
<p>I put a hundred rupees in an envelope to give her, and then I went downstairs to the hotel telephone office. The place was so dirty! I stood at the door and said, "I would like to speak to Mrs. Dasgupta." So many people were working there. How could I go in and give her the envelope when there were so many other girls around? I said to the guard, "Can you ask her to come here?"</p>
<p>The guard came back and said, "They are asking you to come in."</p>
<p>I said to myself, "I am in trouble now. I can't just give her this envelope in front of everyone."</p>
<p>So I gave her a copy of the small "Galaxy of Luminaries." When she saw my picture with the Pope, she could not believe it. She said to me "Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am Bengali. Why?"</p>
<p>She said, "But when you talked to your family, it was not in Bengali."</p>
<p>I said, "I come from Chittagong."</p>
<p>She said she could not understand a word of our Chittagong dialect.</p>
<p>I said, "This is what you do? You listen to people's private conversations?"</p>
<p>She said, "Oh no, I just wanted to see if you got through to your party. Then I heard something very peculiar." Then she added, "You don't have a Chittagong accent."</p>
<p>I said to myself, "Not in vain did I stay at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. There I spoke real Bengali."</p>
<p>Then she started appreciating my Bengali. I didn't have the heart to tell her how many books, poems and songs I have written in Bengali. Then she said, Is your mother alive?"</p>
<p>I said, "No."</p>
<p>She said, "The person who would have been the happiest to see this picture is not alive."</p>
<p>I said, "I lost her when I was quite young."</p>
<p>She said, "I am so sorry that you have lost your mother. She would have been the happiest person.</p>
<p>I said, "There is something called Heaven, so she can be proud of her son from Heaven."</p>
<p>She was very moved. Then I gave her the envelope and said, "This is a gift."</p>
<p>I thought she would show false modesty and say, "No," and I would have to insist. But she just took it and thanked me. Inwardly I said, "You deserve it! You saved me from paying for a lightning call."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Flight To London</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Flight To London" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>What an adventure this trip to Scotland was! So many things went wrong in the airport, on the plane and in the hotels.</p>
<p>After the disciples saw me off at Kennedy Airport, I went to the British Airways lounge. Can you imagine? About forty people were standing because there were no seats left in the lounge.</p>
<p>Finally we entered into the plane. An orthodox Jewish man was sitting in the seat beside mine. He had a little cap and a long beard. His seat was on the aisle and mine was at the window. When I came and stood in front of him, he didn't want to move or get up so that I could get to my seat. It was only with greatest difficulty that I was able to sit down.</p>
<p>After ten or fifteen minutes I thought, "Let me start writing poems." But I could not find even one ballpoint. I had put six ballpoints into my bag, but at that time I could not find even one. I searched here and there. I said to myself, "How can I ask this man for a ballpoint? God doesn't want me to write poems." So I read for hours on the plane and I didn't write even one poem. Towards the end of the trip, the stewardess gave out immigration cards for us to fill out. I could have asked the stewardess for a ballpoint, but often it is so hard to get their attention that you lose all your inspiration. I said to myself, "At the airport I will fill it out!"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Drink</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Drink" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>During the plane ride the steward came to me and said, "What would you like to drink?"</p>
<p>I said, "Tomato juice."</p>
<p>In ten minutes' time he brought me something that looked like tomato juice, but it smelled like wine. I was half in the dream world, but I asked myself, "How could it be tomato juice? Definitely this smells like wine."</p>
<p>Fortunately I smelled it first before drinking it.</p>
<p>I said to the steward, "This can't be tomato juice. I asked you for tomato juice."</p>
<p>He said, "Oh no, you asked me for . . ." and he said the name of a drink that started with the letter 't'. He said the name at least twice, but still I didn't know what he was saying. He didn't say, "Sorry!" or apologise in any way. He acted as if it was my fault. Finally, though, he did bring me some tomato juice.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Begging For A Ballpoint</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Begging For A Ballpoint" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In the London airport hundreds of people were standing in a queue. I saw one of the airport people sitting at an empty desk reading a newspaper. He had three ballpoints in his shirt pocket. I said to him, "Excuse me, may I use your ballpoint for a minute?"</p>
<p>He said abruptly, "I don't have one!" And I was looking at the pens in his pocket when he said it. I have never seen such a rogue.</p>
<p>There was such a big line; at least a hundred fifty people were in front of me. I thought, "When I get to the front of the line, they will want to see this card filled out. Since I am wasting my time here, let me ask someone else." I asked another employee who was nearby, but he said, "When you get to the front of the line there will be someone to give you a ballpoint." I could see that he also had three or four, but he didn't want to give me one.</p>
<p>After fifteen minutes I reached the front of the line. I said to the lady who told you which booth to go to, "I don't have a ballpoint." She answered, "I am sorry, I don't have one. Otherwise, I would give you one." In her case, I saw that she really didn't have a ballpoint.</p>
<p>Then I saw a middle-aged Indian man sitting with his head in his hands. He was just a passenger waiting for someone. As you know, I have told many stories about Indians who acted like perfect rogues. But my Indian brothers can be of help to me also. I asked this man, "May I borrow a ballpoint?"</p>
<p>He said, "Of course, of course!"</p>
<p>He had a huge bag with so many clothes in it, and he started searching and searching through all his things. It took him two or three minutes to find one. So this is the difference between Englishmen and Indians. I said to myself, "Indians quarrel and fight, but in the time of need they will always try to come to each other's rescue with a big heart." I used the pen and returned it to him and thanked him. Inwardly I felt sorry that he was still brooding.</p>
<p>When people at the airport or other places are mean to me, I forgive them and God forgives them. It is just human nature. Then when I tell the stories, I get joy. I tell them in a cheerful way.</p>

<p>After I gave the customs people my immigration card, I put my things on a trolley and went to the place where they check tickets. The lady looked at my ticket and said, "Wrong place!" There were two airlines whose names started with the word "British," and I had gone to the wrong one. But the lady wouldn't tell me where to go. She was so rude! Then one of the porters grabbed my shoulder very affectionately and said, "Do you see the bookstore over there? Just behind it is the booth that you want."</p>
<p>I went there and showed the lady my ticket. She told me which terminal to go to, but I couldn't hear her. So I said, "Excuse me, sorry, but I could not get what you said."</p>
<p>The lady said, "I told you!" and she wouldn't speak to me again.</p>
<p>Another porter happened to be nearby. He told me, "She said terminal three." He was so nice to me.</p>
<p>You can either take a taxi or walk to terminal three. I walked. The route was all zigzag, like a serpent, and it took me ten or fifteen minutes to get there.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The New Disciple</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The New Disciple" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I was about to enter the plane — I was only ten or twelve metres from the door — a young girl looked at me, smiling, and said, "Guru!"</p>
<p>I couldn't imagine who she was. She said, "I am a new disciple."</p>
<p>I said, "You are a new disciple?"</p>
<p>She said, "I have been your disciple for only three weeks. I am a Zurich disciple. My name is Emily." She grabbed my instrument case and wanted to take my bag also. She spoke English fluently. She works for Air France, and she was taking the same flight to Scotland. She carried my bags right to my seat. She was going on standby. But she told me that she would have no trouble getting on the plane.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Plane Ride To Scotland</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Plane Ride To Scotland" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In the airport I had gone to a bookstore and bought three ballpoints so I wouldn't have to be a beggar anymore. On the plane one of the stewards asked me to fill out a form that I would need to enter Scotland. Emily was five or six metres behind me. When she heard that I was supposed to write something, she came running with a ballpoint even before I could get my own out of my bag. So this is the difference between disciples and non-disciples!</p>
<p>Hannelore, Robert and four or five other German disciples were also on the plane, but they didn't know beforehand that I would be on the same flight. The disciples were so happy and delighted to be on the plane with me. Emily sat behind me and the other disciples had seats near me, although no one sat right beside me. None of the disciples talked. They were absolutely silent, sitting and meditating. The American girls, on the other hand, will talk about their breakfast, their running, their shopping-everything-when they fly with me.</p>

<p>Around three o'clock in the afternoon we were supposed to leave for the concert in Dundee; Shantishri was going to drive. I was sitting downstairs in the hotel waiting for Janaka and Janani, who were late. As soon as I saw them, I jumped up. I had a blue bag and a tote-a-tune with me, but because I was in a terrible rush, I left the tote-a-tune.</p>
<p>Shantishri had been driving for only three or four minutes when I realised that my tote-a-tune was missing. She drove back to the hotel and I went to the chair where I had been sitting. But the tote-a-tune was gone. One of the porters said, "I saw it," and gave me a full description. But he said that he had not taken it. What could we do? It was getting late, so we had to leave for the concert. Then Shantishri had to drive seventy or eighty miles per hour because we were so late.</p>
<p>The following day the police came and searched everywhere, but they could not find the tote-a-tune.</p>

<p>The next day before I went running, I left a fifty-pence coin and two ten-pence coins in my room to see if the chambermaid was honest. I did this deliberately to test her. When I came back from running, I saw that the fifty-pence coin was gone, but the two ten-pence coins were left. So deliberately I did it and deliberately I got a slap.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Silver Ballpoints</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Silver Ballpoints" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I first got to Scotland, I told the disciples my stories about not having a ballpoint. I told them how bad the British are and how good the Indians are. They all felt miserable. They said, "Those people were not disciples. What can you expect from them?"</p>
<p>After the last concert, the British disciples performed scenes from <em>The Son</em> for the other disciples. They brought down the actual atmosphere of the play — even the Christ's consciousness and Mary's consciousness. No other performers have done it so perfectly. The director was Charana. Their costumes were also excellent. At the end of the play I appreciated them like anything.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Charana presented me with a set of three silver ballpoints. He said, "We have heard your ballpoint stories, so we are presenting you with these."</p>
<p>Then I entered into a small room near the stage to speak with two disciples for a few minutes. When I left the room, I very nicely left the ballpoints in the room. Later I realised that I didn't have them, but I did not remember where I had left them. I said to myself, "The ballpoint story will never end! Fortunately, the disciples found them. They were not supposed to go into that room, but after I left they went there to see if I had left anything. The following day they brought the ballpoints to me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Forgotten Gifts</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Forgotten Gifts" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I was packing to leave Glasgow for London, the two zippers on my bag broke. The disciples put my things in a garbage bag, but not everything fit. So I took out some expensive, very nicely wrapped candies that I had bought as gifts. I had already eaten a few.</p>
<p>Shantishri drove me to the airport, and again we were in a terrible rush. It was a fifteen-minute or half-hour drive. Then I realised that I had left behind a wristwatch that I had bought for X. It had a football game on it. So I asked Shantishri to go back to the hotel to get the wristwatch.</p>
<p>When she reached the hotel, forty minutes after we had left, everything was still in my room. Not only did she find my wristwatch and the expensive candies but also many other gifts that I had bought for people. I knew that I had forgotten the wristwatch and the candies, but I had no idea about the other things. There was a football that I had bought for Tejiyan's group and some other items. I had left my door open, but nothing was taken.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Indian Taxi Drivers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Indian Taxi Drivers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In London I went shopping in the Indian district. When I was finished, the store owner called a taxi company to send a taxi for me. The taxi came and I saw that the driver was a real rogue. He and his friend, who was another rogue, were sitting in the front seat. I told the driver where I was going, and then I said, "It has to be a flat rate," because they looked like such rogues.</p>
<p>Immediately they said, "Five and a half pounds."</p>
<p>I said, "When I came to this store from the hotel with an English taxi driver, it said seven pounds on the meter. Why are you asking for only five and a half pounds?"</p>
<p>The driver said, "Because you are an Indian and you look like a saintly person. Otherwise if you had not been an Indian, we would have asked for twelve pounds and driven here, there, everywhere."</p>
<p>I said, "I will give you seven pounds. But definitely you are going to take me to the right place? Are you sure you know the place?"</p>
<p>They said, "Yes, we know the place. We have been driving for so many years."</p>
<p>The whole way there they were talking about their relatives in America. They did bring me to the right hotel and let me off at the right place. I had told them that I would give them seven pounds, but when they stopped in front of the hotel I gave them eight pounds.</p>
<p>I said, "You people can be nice and I can also be nice." Then I told them, "Don't deceive people anymore!"</p>
<p>They said they would try, and they will.</p>
<p>Sarada Devi had this kind of experience with a dacoit [robber] once. When she called him "Father," the dacoit became like her father. The following day he let her go.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Missing Porters</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Missing Porters" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I was leaving the Kensington Royal Gardens Hotel to catch the famous plane, the Concorde, I waited for the porters for fifteen minutes. The porters were not coming, so I had to bring down three heavy suitcases myself. As soon as I came down, two or three porters came running towards me to help me take them to the car. But before that, when I really needed them, they never appeared.</p>

<p>On the way to the airport, the taxi driver started talking about this and that. I asked him about his father, who was in the army. Then I said, "During the Second World War, where were you?"</p>
<p>He said, "I was not born."</p>
<p>I looked at him. He was so huge. Everything about him was bulging, but he was fifteen years my junior.</p>
<p>He said, "My father was in the army in Germany, Hungary and Austria — but not in India. My parents waited until after the war to have children because they felt that if they had children during the war, the children would be defective. So I was born in 1946."</p>
<p>I was saying silently, "True, you are not defective but you are very fat!" He was extremely nice, though. He drove very fast to save me, since I had been delayed at the hotel.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Concorde</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Concorde" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The Concorde is quite small. The windows are very small and there are only two seats in each row. A middle-aged man was sitting beside me. As soon as he sat down, he said, "I hope you do not mind if I put my legs a little bit on your side." Throughout the trip he was sitting with his foot on his knee, and his leg bent towards my seat. Then he turned on the light and went to sleep with his hands over his eyes. He turned on the light, and then he wouldn't open his eyes! He wouldn't eat anything. After an hour I turned out the light. All of a sudden he woke up and said, "Where did I lose my ballpoint?"</p>
<p>Everywhere there are ballpoint problems! He was telling the stewardess that he had a silver pen. The stewardess was begging the person behind him to look for it. Then they found that it had rolled two seats behind. So the man got back his pen and he was very happy.</p>
<p>When we were about to get out of the plane, the man started looking for his passport. He couldn't find it, so he said, "That is interesting." He was banging everything around, searching here and there. Everybody was standing up in the aisle, waiting for him to find his passport. He was blocking everybody.</p>
