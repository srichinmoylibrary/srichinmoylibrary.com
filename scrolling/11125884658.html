<p>My paintings were exhibited in a very beautiful museum in Bonn. Many dignitaries were there, including a Harvard professor. She was a very nice elderly lady who liked the paintings very much.</p>
<p>The curator came up to me with a guest book and said, "Please, you have to write something; you have to sign this."</p>
<p>"Write something" means what? I wrote a full page, and he was very happy. He is a professor also. It was a very good experience.</p>

<p>We also saw the Mayor of Cologne, who gave us a proclamation and very nice gifts. He was so nice. Three or four times he talked about me, all from his heart — what he was feeling about me. Then there was an immediate translation by a lady who had been in New York for only three years. But her English was excellent. When I spoke, she translated for me.</p>
<p>Of all the twenty or thirty mayors that I have seen, this German Mayor was the one who touched most deeply the very depth of my gratitude-heart.</p>

<p>On Father's Day I asked all of my disciples to meditate once for each year that they had been with me. I am sure they listened to my request. On Father's Day I composed a song. It was translated into twelve languages. The best was an African language. Devadip translated it into Spanish and Haridas arranged it.</p>
<p>I also composed a song on France — "Vive la France." The European disciples enjoyed it very much and now they are learning it.</p>
<p>I gave a name to Projjwal's printing press: "Perfection-Glory." There I composed a song dedicated to his press.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I visited my former coach, Saumitra, a German runner who coached me in India. Now he is head of a school which has three or four thousand students. He is the father of three sons and he does not run anymore. He has lost a lot of his hair, but nobody can defeat me in losing hair. He looked at me and I looked at him. In silence we talked about our hair.</p>
<p>I spent an hour and a half with him. What a moving experience! We talked and talked and talked about many, many things. He gave me the greatest surprise. In 1958 I had given him a small album with some pictures. Also, I had composed two songs about him. One was sung in front of the head of the ashram by two hundred athletes. He has kept that song plus the other song I had composed, one of my pictures and the album. Projjwal had sent him a photograph of me running a marathon. He has kept everything like a treasure. I had totally forgotten about the album and the pictures, but he has preserved them under lock and key in a cupboard with his most valuable things. He brought them to me with such concern and care.</p>
<p>We discussed many, many things and gave each other tremendous joy. His wife is extremely spiritual. When he was in India, he was not yet married.</p>
<p>Our old friendship we revived. At one point I said, "You were an excellent coach but I was a hopeless case."</p>
<p>He said, "I never told you that you were a hopeless case. It is all your mental creation!"</p>
<p>I said, "I could not learn your way."</p>
<p>He said, "But that does not mean you were hopeless. In your own way you did so well."</p>
<p>That was Saumitra.</p>

<h2>Pan American games adventure</h2>

<p>I am telling you about my adventure at the Pan American Masters Games. As you know, I was invited to go there to offer a short meditation. Also, I was requested to dedicate one of my songs to the Pan American Masters Games. So, the good singers sang the "Run and Become" song extremely well for a tape and I dedicated that song to the Games.</p>
<p>There were quite a few thousand spectators. Some young men used coloured flags to say "welcome," "thank you" and all kinds of things — as in the previous Pan American Games. It was quite beautiful and charming.</p>
<p>The speaker read out ten or twelve lines about me in Spanish and then I was escorted by a lady to the platform. Uttama followed me. I was not supposed to inaugurate the Games; I was supposed to hold the opening meditation after the inauguration. The Governor himself was supposed to inaugurate the Games, but God knows what happened. The Governor was delayed for some reason. So the official said, "Sri Chinmoy will offer us the inaugural benediction."</p>
<p>I went to the platform and Uttama said a few things. He thanked all the celebrities and then introduced me. I meditated for about two or three minutes, facing the audience. Then I turned around and meditated on the people who were showing the coloured flags. Afterwards I spoke for a few minutes, thanking them and bringing down the Supreme's Blessings for the athletes.</p>
<p>Thousands of people were there, but they remained in pin-drop silence. I told them I was dedicating one of my songs to the soul of the Pan American Masters Games and they played the tape over the loudspeaker. It sounded extremely good. It was simply marvellous.</p>

<p>After the inauguration, we were in the march past. You laugh, at times, at our marching on Sports Day. But if you laugh at our marching, then you would have perhaps jumped and danced if you had seen them marching. The musicians in the band were really good, but nobody paid attention to the drum. Everybody had his or her own inner drum.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The grace descends for the mayor</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The grace descends for the mayor" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>After the march past, the Mayor of San Juan was supposed to speak. We were standing in the field and the Mayor was taking a little time to start speaking. O God, from Heaven real Grace descended. There was a real downpour, and I was not brave enough to stay. I ran inside the stadium, but others were brave. They stood there in the rain and listened while the Mayor spoke for a few minutes.</p>
<p>God knows what Uttama told him about me. Afterwards the Mayor came up to me, walking at least 200 metres out of his way. He thanked me profusely for the trouble I had taken to come to the Pan American Masters Games. I thanked him and said quite a few nice things about the athletes. He was very happy.</p>
<p>After the Mayor came, the president of the organisation, a tall young man, introduced himself to me. I thanked him and he thanked me. He was very nice.</p>
<p>Then a man 67 years old came up to me. Last year he was decathlon champion in his age group. He started telling me about himself. He said he had seven children and eighteen grandchildren and that whenever he won it was all God's Grace. The next day, the newspaper had his timing. My timing and throwing distances in the ashram were far, far better. But I can't brag, since I was 26 or 27 at that time and he is 67.</p>

<p>I was supposed to join in the 100metre dash. Just before the race, it started raining. Many others didn't run because of the rain, but I wanted to show off. During my 20 years of competing in India, I never used starting blocks. I lost my balance at the start and I was last. God wanted me to have this experience.</p>
<p>Once upon a time I was first — for 16 years. But here, there was at least a 50metre gap between the first runner and me. The audience was enjoying the fact that there was such a gap between us.</p>
<p>On the board it was mentioned, "Sri Chinmoy, Puerto Rico." The Puerto Rican disciples were so delighted. I had said that I was not going to run the 400metre dash, but they didn't listen. My name still appeared on the board: "Sri Chinmoy, Puerto Rico."</p>

<p>A thin, tall black man came up to me and said, "Guru, don't you remember me? The other day I ran 800 metres with you." Then I recognised him. He was in the Randall's island race in New York City. I had told Danny to videotape him. I said, "Yes, you ran extremely well. I was far, far behind." He is national champion in his age category. He was so happy to see me. He couldn't believe that I was in Puerto Rico. At Randall's island he ran a 2:10 and my timing was three minutes. But in India in the 800 metres I had stood first.</p>
<p>In half an hour, again he came up to me just to chat. In the Pan American Games he defeated everyone in the 800, but in the 100 he didn't get a place. So, he said nice things and I said nice things.</p>
<p>Then some elderly athletes were showing that they could do the high jump and pole vault. One of them pushed the bar with his shoulder, so everybody laughed. One or two athletes were good when they jumped. I was watching and enjoying. Sometimes when people were throwing the javelin, it did not point. Even world champions have that problem.</p>
<p>One 75-year-old ran very fast. Then, when the race was over, the first, second and third place finishers embraced one another and took pictures. It was most thrilling. Many times the experiences were very, very good.</p>

<p>Today something very significant took place. When I arrived at the airport, there were only 12 minutes before the plane was scheduled to take off. I went hurriedly to the last check point. As soon as I came near the door and saw the man who was in charge of checking, he came running towards me and grabbed my right arm powerfully. Then he embraced me and said, "Sri Chinmoy, you are a man of peace. The other day I got so much peace from your meditation at the Pan Am Games."</p>
<p>He asked me how old I was, and I said, "Forty-nine."</p>
<p>He said, "You look younger every year. I need peace. The world needs peace badly."</p>
<p>Then he asked me for my ticket. I had my ticket and boarding pass. But I was looking for my passport, because they always ask you for a passport when you are leaving Puerto Rico. He said, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>I said, " I am looking for my passport."</p>
<p>He said, "You are a saint. You don't need a passport. You are universal. A man of peace is universal."</p>

<p>I gave the man at the check point my boarding pass. God knows what he did with it. He said to me, "You will get a refund of $69." Then he said, "I just put you a few seats ahead."</p>
<p>I had bought a ticket for the coach section. But when I entered the plane and showed the stewardess my pass, she took me to the first seat of the first class section. So I got a $69 refund plus first class accommodations.</p>
<p>In ten or fifteen minutes' time, the same man entered into the plane. There was some bad news: all the breakfasts were rotten, so they had to take them out of the plane. I thanked him for what he had done. He said to me, "It is my honour, my pleasure. At least I can do this much for you. I am so honoured."</p>
<p>So, if you can really bring down peace, at least one person may get peace. And because he got peace, he put me in the first class section and gave me a cheque for $69.</p>

<p>I was sitting in the first seat of the front row. One of the stewardesses said, "Please let me take the bag that is in front of you until the plane is in the air. Then I will bring it back."</p>
<p>So I gave it to her. Then there was an announcement that the plane would be delayed for twenty minutes. When I went to the stewardess to get some books out of the bag, a tall man came and stood in front of me and said, "Master, Master, why didn't you run yesterday in the half-marathon?"</p>
<p>I said, "I couldn't do the 400-metre dash. How could I have done the half-marathon?"</p>
<p>He said, "Your races are so good because they are held early in the morning. I always enter your races. Early in the morning I run."</p>
<p>Here the half-marathon was held at three-thirty in the afternoon, so he didn't run. And he is Puerto Rican! Puerto Ricans are accustomed to that kind of heat.</p>
<p>So you see, if you start races early in the morning, there will be at least one person who will be happy and grateful.</p>
<p>He said, "Your students, your disciples, are so good."</p>
<p>Another stewardess happened to be there and she said, "Because the Master is good, the disciples are good." Then she said, "Master, I have been to your meetings quite a few times, but now it is different. At the meditations you are very distant. It is good, but you are somewhere else. Now you are talking."</p>
<p>I said, "At that time I meditate."</p>
<p>She said, "Yes, that's why you are so distant."</p>

I didn't have the heart to tell her I didn't want any more.</p>
