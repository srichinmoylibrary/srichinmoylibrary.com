<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is the relationship of Father and son. Because of God's infinite Bounty and Compassion, this is possible. In addition, His infinite Compassion has kindled the flame of aspiration in my heart. When this flame of aspiration climbs high, higher, highest, it carries with it unconditional love, unconditional devotion, unconditional surrender. This happens with all seekers; only most aspirants are usually not aware of it. In my case, out of His infinite Bounty, I am conscious that my aspiration carries with it unconditional love, devotion and surrender.</p>
<p>The Supreme Being can assume any form He wants. But on the human level, if anybody asks me which form I treasure most, I will say His personal form. There is more familiarity in the personal form. Now, it might seem that familiarity could breed contempt. However, when I — or any true spiritual Master — deal with the Supreme Being on the familiar level, the seeker in me increases its intensity and capacity. When a spiritual Master deals with the divine Reality, his familiarity cannot diminish his love. When I deal with the personal aspect of the Supreme, I do not lose my love, devotion and surrender. The more familiar we become with the Supreme, the more we establish our oneness with Him.</p>
<p>This familiarity is a good opportunity for us to establish our heart's capacity and all-transforming oneness with the Absolute Supreme. Thus, the familiar, personal aspect of the Supreme cannot create problems for the true seeker. But in earthly relationships, this is not so, because people realise each other's weaknesses when they become familiar with each other. The Supreme Being, on the other hand, ignores our weaknesses, because He is manifesting Himself and has assumed these infinite forms in and through us. It is His creation and He is perfecting Himself in the process of evolution. He thinks of us as His own infinite extension, His own Reality-Light, and He helps and guides us on the inner plane.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, why does the Supreme allow you to suffer?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, why does the Supreme allow you to suffer?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Allow me? Two reasons. One reason is that I am a very bad man. The other reason is this: He says, "Since you have a big mouth, you have to prove that you have a big heart also. Otherwise, you are a liar." 'Big mouth' means that I claim that I have realised God. He says, "You have realised God? Then prove it. How? By showing that you have a big heart. If you have a big mouth, then you have to have a big heart." Only a big heart has the right to produce big talk, say big things. Anybody can say big things, but when it is a matter of doing, most of the time they can't do it. So the Supreme says, "Since you have used your mouth and said many, many things about Me and about yourself and about humanity, now I want you to have a big heart, too. How can you have a big heart? Through identification. You have to identify with somebody's back pain, somebody's leg pain, somebody's tooth pain. Like that, identify, identify." It doesn't mean that I have back pain because I have taken somebody else's back pain. My back pain may be for some other reason. Somebody may have a very serious type of disease which I am taking as back pain. Then, in a few days, this back pain dissolves; it goes away. Again, if the Supreme wants me to immediately throw this disease into the Universal Consciousness, that also I can do, without taking it directly. Some mediums take pain from others and then they suffer. In my case, when He wants me to take, I take; and when He wants me to throw, I throw. On many, many occasions, He does not want me to take someone's suffering as my own pain. He says, "Don't take it into yourself. Just throw it."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He makes me talk. Then He says that the disciples at least should feel that I take their suffering. Even if I have taken the suffering of some disciples and <em>told</em> them, still they don't believe. I will say, "I have taken away your headache or your stomachache or your ulcer or your cancer or your heart attack," and they say, "Thank you, thank you." But then they go home and say, "He suffers every day from headaches and colds and all that. He cannot cure himself, and he says he is taking away my serious, serious disease. He does not have the capacity even to stop sneezing and coughing, and he says he has the capacity to take our disease."</p>
<p>The Supreme says we are all one, and then he says, "Prove it." When Sri Ramakrishna could not eat because of cancer in his throat, his consort and others begged him to ask Kali to cure him. He did not do it. Finally, he said to Kali, "I am suffering from cancer, and my disciples are telling me that I have to cure it. I say, 'How can I ask You?' But they insist." Kali said, "They are all your children. Tell them that you don't have to eat. While they are eating, it is you who are eating in and through them. Through hundreds of mouths you are eating, so you don't have to eat your own food." Sometimes I really suffer. I suffer because I love you people. But if I become indifferent, then I can get rid of anything.</p>
