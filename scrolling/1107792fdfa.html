<p>Silence within, sound without. Silence-Eternity within, Sound-Infinity without. Silence-Eternity-Dream within, Sound-Infinity-Reality without.</p>
<p>Silence is God the Creator. Sound is God the Creation. Silence is the progress-delight of God the Creator. Sound is the success-height of God the Creation.</p>
<p>Silence is never, never afraid of sound, but sound is always afraid of Eternity’s and Immortality’s vastness-silence.</p>
<p>My silence-heart-life is a non-stop aspiration-flight to my Transcendental Goal—the Goal of the ever-transcending Beyond. My sound-mind-life quite often carries me into a tenebrous indolence-coma.</p>
<p>With my silence-heart, I always claim God as my own, very own. With my sound-mind, at times I praise God and at times I blame God, depending on my success-smiles and failure-cries.</p>
<p>When my sound-life lives in the shackles of bondage, when I live only in my buried hopes, at that time my silence-heart comes to the fore and inspires me with new hope, new inspiration, new aspiration and new dedication to go and visit my Lord’s Forgiveness-Heart, Compassion-Eye and Protection-Feet.</p>
<p>My silence-soul is the only teacher that teaches me how to speak to God and how to listen to God devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally.</p>

<p>Man’s eternal question: “Where is God?”<br /> God’s eternal question: “How to please man?”<br /> Silence has the answer to these questions.<br /> Indeed, silence is the answer.<br /> Silence, silence!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Concentration</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Concentration" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Concentration is the hero-soldier-confidence of the third eye, the vision eye. Concentration is the fastest lightning speed. Concentration is the supreme secret of immediate and inevitable success.</p>
<p>Although determination and concentration have a close connection, concentration is infinitely, infinitely higher than determination. Determination comes from the silent mind proper. Concentration comes from the all-knowing vision-eye.</p>
<p>Concentration silences the destruction-loving animal in me. Concentration inspires the inactivity-cherishing human in me. Concentration manifests the all-loving divine in me. Concentration expedites God’s all-fulfilling Arrival at my heart’s door.</p>
<p>Concentration secretly intensifies my heart’s God-hunger. Concentration speedily clears my mind’s thought-forest and gives me discipline-joy at every moment. Concentration indomitably tames my wild restlessness-vital. Concentration vigorously energises my sleeping lethargy-body.</p>
<p>Concentration smilingly and blessingfully asks me: “O seeker, do you want to accomplish ten most significant things in the short span of ten minutes, or do you want to accomplish only one thing?” I tell concentration that I would like to accomplish ten most significant things in the short span of ten minutes.</p>
<p>Concentration blessingfully and proudly tells me: “Then come and be in my boat. I am your only boatman.”</p>
<p>Concentration has a most significant message for me. It tells me: “Be brave within, be brave without!” When I am brave in my inner life, I breathlessly love only God the Creator in His own Way. When I am brave in my outer life, I smilingly serve only God the Creation in His own Way.</p>
<p>Concentration tells me that I have only one Master. That Master is transcendental Delight and not ignorance-night.</p>
<p>Each human being on earth is a God-representative, but concentration, meditation and contemplation are the most powerful representatives of God here on earth. These three representatives of God are piloting humanity’s aspiration-boat to the Golden Shore of the Beyond.</p>
<p>Concentration is the mind-divinity’s swiftness. Meditation is the heart-divinity’s vastness. Contemplation is the life-divinity’s fulness here on earth. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Meditation</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Meditation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Meditation is God-discovery. Meditation is self-mastery. Meditation is man’s Eternity’s progress-light in God. Meditation is God’s Infinity’s Satisfaction-Delight in man.</p>
<p>Meditation is for the Truth-seeker. Meditation is for the God-lover. God’s transcendental Vision-Eye blesses man the Truth-seeker. God’s universal Oneness-Heart embraces man the God-lover.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s meditation-message: “Realise God.” Today’s meditation-message: “Realise God, plus manifest God.” Tomorrow’s meditation-message: “Realise God, manifest God and, finally, become another God.”</p>
<p>My mind’s good meditation is the bankruptcy of my self-doubt and God-doubt. My heart’s better meditation is my vastness-fulfilment and my oneness-perfection. My soul’s best meditation is my life’s God-manifestation here on earth.</p>
<p>Before I meditate, I compel my reasoning mind to disappear. Before I meditate, I beg my loving God to appear.</p>
<p>After I meditate, I soulfully offer myself a new name: gratitude. After I meditate, God, out of His infinite Bounty, blesses me with a new and fruitful name: satisfaction.</p>
<p>Each time I meditate on God, He teaches me a new life-surrender-song. Each time God meditates on me, I offer Him a new gratitude-heart-song.</p>
<p>Earth meditates for man’s transformation. Heaven meditates for God’s Satisfaction. I meditate for my nature’s complete perfection. God meditates for the universal manifestation of His own Transcendental Consciousness and Transcendental Vision here on earth. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Desire versus aspiration</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Desire versus aspiration" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Desire versus aspiration. Desire binds; aspiration liberates. Desire wants to possess; aspiration wants to renounce. Desire means plus, plus, plus material wealth. Aspiration means minus, minus, minus material wealth. Aspiration means plus, plus, plus spiritual wealth—love, devotion, surrender, purity, gratitude and self-offering.</p>
<p>He who desires sings most pitifully his life’s poverty-songs. He who aspires sings most soulfully God’s Prosperity-Songs.</p>
<p>He who desires wants to possess each and every thing, each and every individual in the entire world. He who aspires wants only those things that will help him to transcend his abundant limitations and teeming imperfections. He knows that he needs help, and the things that can help him he welcomes and invites to come to his rescue.</p>
<p>A desiring man prays to God to get God’s all-conquering Power. An aspiring man meditates on God to get God’s all-fulfilling Love. A man of desire wants to show the world his capacities, his strength. A man of aspiration devotedly and soulfully places all his incapacities — his insecurity, doubt, fear, uncomely thoughts and everything else that is unaspiring in him — at the Feet of his Lord Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>A man of desire wants to dominate the world. He wants the whole world to surrender to him. A man of aspiration wants to establish his universal oneness-heart with the rest of the world. How? On the strength of his self-giving, which is the only way to bring about world peace.</p>
<p>A desire-intoxicated man, like Julius Caesar, wants to say to the world: “I came, I saw, I conquered.” An aspiring inspiration-man wants to say to the world: “I came, I loved and I am becoming inseparably one with you.”</p>
<p>A desire-intoxicated man at every moment wants to show his superiority and lord it over the world. An aspiring inspiration-man wants only God’s Compassion-Eye to guide and lead the whole world to its Ultimate Destination, the Destination that is flooded with infinite Light and Delight. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Obedience</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Obedience" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Obedience, obedience, obedience!</p>
<p>Obedience is acceptance—acceptance of God’s Light. Obedience is rejection — rejection of ignorance-night. Obedience is perfection—perfection of the human nature.</p>
<p>Obedience, from the spiritual point of view, is never a helpless submission. Obedience is the seeker’s discovery of the inner Light, the Pilot Supreme. Obedience is not the annihilation of individuality — no, no! Obedience is the seeker’s cheerful and free entrance into universality.</p>
<p>Obedience is the beauty of faith. Obedience is the purity of faith. Obedience is the prosperity of faith. Faith awakens the human in us. Faith leads the human in us. Faith liberates the human in us. Faith takes us to God’s Compassion-Eye. Faith brings God’s Satisfaction-Heart to us.</p>
<p>My obedience is my selfless, unconditional dedication-life to my Lord Supreme. My Lord Supreme is not far away — no, no! He is near, nearer than the nearest. He is here to grant me my full realisation. He is here to help me manifest His own Transcendental Divinity here on earth. My obedience-heart, God’s Compassion-Eye and God’s outstretched Arms live together, sing together and play together to manifest God’s Will here on earth.</p>
<p>If I do not obey my Inner Pilot in this lifetime then, in my next incarnation, I may commit the same blunders that I committed in this incarnation, but even sooner — perhaps at the very dawn of my earthly sojourn. If I do not obey my Inner Pilot in this incarnation, my human life will sadly miss the touch of divinity and the divine in me will starve and starve most deplorably.</p>
<p>Obedience reached its supreme, ultimate, absolute height when the Saviour Son’s obedience-heart voiced forth: “Father, let Thy Will be done.” By virtue of this obedience-prayer, man’s eternal thirst, without fail, will be quenched by God’s infinite Nectar-Delight. </p>

<p>Happiness, happiness, happiness!</p>
<p>My happiness abides in my soul’s promise to God. My happiness dwells in my heart’s hope for a higher life. My happiness resides in my life’s willingness to fulfil God at every moment.</p>
<p>I am happy when, early in the morning, I place my ignorance-head at God’s Forgiveness-Feet. I am happy when, early in the morning, my inspiration-eye catches a glimpse of God’s Compassion-Eye. I am happy when, early in the morning, my aspiration-heart is blessed by my Lord’s Satisfaction-Heart.</p>
<p>To be happy, I must not allow insincerity to stand at my mind’s door. To be happy, I must not allow insecurity to stand at my heart’s door. To be happy, I must not allow impurity to stand at my life’s door.</p>
<p>Happiness, happiness, happiness!</p>
<p>To be happy, every day during my meditation I send my body to enthusiasm-kindergarten, I send my vital to dynamism-elementary school, I send my mind to obedience-high school, I send my heart to surrender-college and I send my life to gratitude-university. I send the members of my earthly existence to study these divine subjects in order to make myself a perfect instrument of my Lord Supreme, for only as a perfect instrument of my Lord Supreme can I truly be happy.</p>
<p>To be happy, I beg and beg my Lord Supreme to grant me a will-power-sword and to make it sharper than the sharpest. With this sharper than the sharpest will-power-sword, I shall challenge the ignorance-night that has enveloped my being for thousands of years and liberate myself.</p>
<p>To be happy, I pray and pray soulfully to my Lord Supreme to grant me the capacity to ring the bell of His universal Peace. I also beg my Lord Supreme not to allow ignorance-titan to touch my Eternity’s dream-boat, which I have been sailing from time immemorial towards the Golden Shore of the Beyond.</p>
<p>My soulful God-invocation is the beginning of my happiness-peace. My sleepless self-dedication is the continuation of my happiness-journey. My unconditional God-manifestation in God’s own Way is the culmination of my happiness-perfection. </p>

<p>“My child, you and I do not belong to the past. We do not even belong to the future. We belong only to the Eternal Now.” </p>

<p>I must sleeplessly raise my aspiration-heart. I must immediately lower my resistance-mind.</p>
<p>I must never allow my aspiration-heart and dedication-life to fall asleep at my Beloved Supreme’s God-manifestation-wheel.</p>
<p>I must never allow inferiority’s quick and wild invasion of my heart. At the same time, I must never allow superiority’s vainglory-aggrandisement to enter into my mind.</p>
<p>My sense of helplessness, unworthiness and uselessness definitely is my own creation. Nobody has thrust these weaknesses upon me. I must not allow them to force me to walk towards my spirituality-graveyard.</p>
<p>Here and now I must draw the curtain over my uncertainty-mind. I must bring to the fore my confidence-heart, which is always eager to listen to the Dictates of my Inner Pilot. I must completely evacuate my mind’s complaint-department, for it is only with oneness-love that I can have peace in my mind.</p>
<p>I must never neglect my heart’s enthusiasm-fragrance-garden. I must never carry with me my yesterday’s elephant-heavy frustration-burden. In spite of my teeming weaknesses, my Lord Supreme tells me that He will, before long, grant me His Eternity’s Peace and Infinity’s Grace. “Why, why, why?” I ask my Lord Beloved Supreme. He tells me that His choice Hour has struck for me. Now I am consciously willing to listen to His Dictates. I am consciously willing to change; I am consciously willing to be moulded, guided and liberated from the meshes of ignorance-night by Him.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme to please in His own Way is the sole reason I came into the world. I must and I must please and fulfil Him at every moment. His Satisfaction can be my only satisfaction. There is no other way. This solemn promise of my entire being I am now offering to my Inner Pilot Absolute Supreme. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">World peace from a Hindu perspective: a Hindu world-peace-dreamer</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="World peace from a Hindu perspective: a Hindu world-peace-dreamer" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I am a Hindu. I love being a Hindu. I am proud to be a Hindu. Why? Why? Why? Because a Hindu soul is a world-peace-dreamer, a Hindu heart is a world-peace-lover and a Hindu life is a world-peace-server.</p>
<p>My spiritual ancestors, the Vedic Seers of the hoary past, taught my soul the song of universal peace. My soul has taught the singer in me that particular song. Now I wish to sing that song lovingly and devotedly for you, my world-peace-dreamer, lover and server brother and sister-friends.</p>
<p>The song is in Sanskrit, the mother of all Indian languages. I wish to give the translation first:</p>

<p>May there be peace in Heaven.<br /> May there be peace in the sky.<br /> May there be peace on earth.<br /> May there be peace in the water.<br /> May there be peace in the plants.<br /> May there be peace in the trees.<br /> May there be peace in the gods.<br /> May there be peace in Brahma.<br /> May there be peace in all.</p>

<p>[Sri Chinmoy then performed the song in Sanskrit, accompanying himself on the harmonium.]</p>
<p>“God, Power infinite You have. God, Light infinite You have. In and through all Your Attributes, You manifest Your Divinity’s Infinity. God, my sole prayer to You is to bless me with Your Compassion-flooded Peace-Eye. This is all I need from You.” This peace-prayer is, indeed, the quintessence of all Hindu prayers.</p>
<p>“God, I do not desire even an atom of Power from You. God, I do not desire even an iota of Light from You. What I need from You is a sea of Peace in which I can swim and dive, a sea of Peace in which I can lovingly and unconditionally invite all my brothers and sisters from the world to join me.” This peace-meditation is, indeed, the quintessence of all Hindu meditations.</p>
<p>A Hindu prayer cries in order to fly up high, higher, highest to reach the Creation’s ultimate peace-height. A Hindu meditation smiles in order to dive deep, deeper, deepest and enter into the heart of the unfathomable Peace-Source.</p>
<p>If you ask a Hindu seeker what he thinks of world peace, his spontaneous and immediate reply will be: “I do not think of world peace. Why? Because the more I think of world peace, the more I puzzle myself and confuse the poor, helpless world! Peace can never bloom and blossom and cover the length and breadth of the world on the strength of dividing and thinking minds. Peace can and shall bloom and blossom and cover the four corners of the globe only by virtue of self-giving oneness-hearts. These self-giving oneness-hearts are made of God-pleasing prayers and God-fulfilling meditations.”</p>
<p>Peace is the alpha and omega of our earth-reality and our Heaven-dream. We are given by the Absolute Lord Himself the signal opportunity to journey, and the infallible assurance that we shall complete our journey, to the Land of ever-transcending Love and Bliss only when we become world-peace-boat-passengers. Everything else will ultimately disappoint us save and except our peace.</p>
<p>Our Lord Beloved Supreme, with His birthless and deathless Compassion-Light, is telling us:</p>

<p>My children, My sweet children,<br /> Eternity’s peace-seekers<br />     Yesterday you were.<br /> Infinity’s peace-lovers<br />     Today you are.<br /> Immortality’s peace-servers<br />     Tomorrow you shall become.</p>

<p>Hinduism is the temple-heart of a Hindu peace-seeker. In this temple-heart the peace-seeker sleeplessly rings the oneness-bell of a oneness-world-family. Hinduism does not believe in the supremacy of one religion over other religions. Hinduism believes only in the oneness-intimacy of all religions.</p>
<p>Excruciating pangs heavily weigh upon the heart of each and every peace-loving human being because countless unaspiring people use their meddler-muddler-mind-concern to try and solve all the world’s problems and bring about world peace. This approach is, indeed, stupidity’s abysmal absurdity-abyss. Millions and billions of Infinity’s blue-winged, golden peace-birds are sleeplessly flying over the firmament of our division-cherishing minds — trying to enter into and radically transform our minds. All they need is an invitation from our minds to come down to reveal and manifest peace here on earth.</p>
<p>The dictionary word ‘peace’ charmingly yet definitely attracts world attention. The capacity-profundity-velocity of the mind’s peace-word begins and ends in utter failure. But the illumination-perfection of the aspiring heart’s oneness-peace-message can and shall inundate the entire world with peace at God’s choice Hour. Let us all prayerfully, soulfully and self-givingly invoke God to expedite that Hour.</p>
<p>God and His Time will complete His cosmic Self-Manifestation-Picture only when our inner life becomes peace the soulful and our outer life becomes peace the beautiful.</p>
<p>Here I conclude: having a Hindu origin, I personally would like to become a full-time God-loving, God-serving and God-fulfilling peace-instrument-student.</p>
<p>Since our subject is peace, with your kind permission I would like to meditate on peace. I have spoken about peace at many, many places; I have written many books about peace. But my writings and my talks, I feel, are of no avail. It is only when I meditate soulfully that I feel I am of true service to my peace-loving brothers and sisters of the world.</p>
<p>So please allow me to meditate on world peace. I wish all of you to join me. Let us together meditate on world peace, for it is only our prayers and meditations that will definitely bring about world peace. For our prayers and meditations come directly from our heart—the heart that unites us and makes us feel that we all belong to a oneness-world-family.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Poet and poetry</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><sup> , </sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Poet and poetry" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A poet has three very special names: yesterday’s delight-seeker, today’s delight-seer and tomorrow’s delight-harbinger.</p>
<p>There are three types of poets: ordinary poets, great poets and seer-poets. Ordinary poets grow like mushrooms in infinite number. The great poets are few and far between and are also known as born poets. The seer-poets are of the supreme heights. A seer is he who envisions the present, the past and the future all at once.</p>
<p>Poetry has three very special names: inspiration-mind, aspiration-heart and beauty-life.</p>
<p>God wanted to have a very, very special garden of His own. He asked His poet-son to be the gardener. He also asked the gardener to create a garden as beautiful as possible and, at the same time, as small as possible.</p>
<p>The poet-gardener devotedly asked God if there was any esoteric purpose for the garden to be smaller than the smallest and beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful.</p>
<p>God said to His newly appointed poet-gardener, “What is poetry, if not My real Beauty? Do you not recall what My English poet-son Keats’ immortal utterance is: ‘A thing of Beauty is a Joy forever’? Beauty and Infinity are inseparable. I want to reveal the Infinity that I am through the finite that I equally am. Therefore, I am asking you to make Me a garden of beauty unfathomable and beauty unsurpassable.”</p>
<p>God further said to His poet-gardener, “My son, once you have accomplished your task to My Satisfaction, I shall entrust you with another task. You will be the only flute player in My garden. Infinity’s Beauty-lovers from the four corners of the globe shall visit and drink deep the beauty of our garden.”</p>
<p>The difference between a prose writer and a poet is this:</p>
<p>A prose writer is a marcher. He marches and marches along Eternity’s Road to arrive at Infinity’s Goal.</p>
<p>A poet is a singer. He sings and sings along Eternity’s Road to arrive at Infinity’s Goal.</p>

<p>The prose writer has thunder-legs.<br /> The poet has lightning-feet.<br /> Arriving at the destination, the prose writer declares,<br />     “I have become.”<br /> Arriving at the same destination, the poet whispers,<br />     “I eternally am.”</p>

<p>I have been writing prose and poetry for over half a century. I am very happily and proudly sailing in the boat of Coleridge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I wish our clever poets would remember... Prose: words in their best order. Poetry: the best words in the best order.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it is illumining to read a comment by Rabindranath Tagore, the master poet of India, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1913. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I wonder why the writing of pages of prose does not give anything like the joy of completing a single poem. One’s emotions take such perfection of form in a poem, they can be taken up by the fingers, so to speak. While prose is like a sackful of loose material, incapable of being lifted as you please.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poetry I read to lighten my mind and enlighten my heart.<br /> Poetry I read to sweeten my bitter mind.<br /> Poetry I read to replace my heart’s sorrows with my soul’s ecstasy.<br /> Poetry I read to transform my human mind-jungle into my divine heart-garden.<br /> Poetry I read to fathom my own inner worlds and to scale my own higher worlds.<br /> Poetry I read to see and feel Divinity’s Beauty inside the heart of humanity.<br /> Poetry I read to watch the hide-and-seek of my heart’s tearing tears and my soul’s blossoming smiles.<br /> Poetry teaches my heart infinitely more than it preaches to my mind.</p>

<p>Ancient poetry pined for inner freedom. Modern poetry hungers for outer freedom.</p>
<p>Since, according to many, I am a modern poet, I do not know how I can escape from Goethe’s irrefutable observation of modern poets: “Modern poets mix too much water with their ink.”</p>
<p>Ancient poetry paid more attention to the Unknowable than the knowable. Modern poetry maximises the power of the knowable and allows the Unknowable to remain a stranger, a perfect stranger.</p>
<p>The ancient poetry-boat was quite often overloaded with poetry-passenger-readers. The modern poetry-boat is quite often empty of poetry-passenger-readers.</p>
<p>Now what about those who are not poetry-lovers at all—no, not even poetry-readers? They do not care in the least either for ancient poetry or for modern poetry. Dear audience, with your soul’s permission, I am crying ditto to a statement by Anthony Hope Hawkins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I wish you would read a little poetry sometimes. Your ignorance cramps my conversation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ancient poetry loved to swim in the sea of tears. Modern poetry loves to surf in the ocean of laughter.</p>
<p>Poetry tells the world, “O world, I am a flower. Appreciate my beauty if you want to. Enjoy my fragrance if you want to. But do not expect from me anything more than my beauty and my fragrance. If you expect anything more, you will be doomed to disappointment.”</p>
<p>Poetry tells the world, “O world, I can teach you how to smile, even while you are crying.”</p>
<p>In my case also, I have my own ancient poetry and modern poetry. My ancient poetry embodied my inner cry:</p>

<p>A sea of Peace and Joy and Light<br />     Beyond my reach I know.<br /> In me the storm-tossed weeping night<br />     Finds room to rage and flow.</p>

<p>My modern poetry reveals my inner smile:</p>

<p>I am flying and flying<br />     On Immortality’s Wings<br />           In Infinity’s Sky.</p>

<p>When I started my poetry-journey, my inner experiences and realisations spontaneously expressed themselves through the power-aspect:</p>

<p>No mind, no form, I only exist;<br />     Now ceased all will and thought.<br /> The final end of Nature’s dance,<br />     I am It whom I have sought.</p>

<p>{{{fleuron}}}</p>

<p>My spirit aware of all the heights,<br />     I am mute in the core of the Sun.<br /> I barter nothing with time and deeds;<br />     My cosmic play is done.</p>

<p>As I continue my poetry-journey, my inner experiences and realisations spontaneously express themselves through humility and devotion-aspects:</p>

<p>My Lord,<br /> Your Love has entrapped my eyes,<br />     My heart, my life and my all.<br /> May I be allowed to entrap<br /> The hallowed dust of Your Feet?</p>

<p>Throughout my poetry-journey, my poetry-tree has cherished various branches: philosophy, prayer, religion, spirituality, my love of Nature’s beauty, my love of word-making, which the English language indulgently allows me to explore, and my abiding love, concern and hope for this world of ours.</p>
<p>When nationalism captures my mind, I soulfully sing:</p>

<p>I dearly love my India<br /> And her age-old silence-peace.</p>

<p>When internationalism embraces my heart, I offer my sleepless and breathless prayer-song to God:</p>

<p>My Lord, do give me the capacity<br />     To wipe every tear<br /> From every heart.</p>

<p>Wherever I go, Nature’s beauty enters into me and feeds me with abundant inspiration:</p>

<p>The sky calls me.<br /> The wind calls me.<br /> The moon and stars call me.<br /> The green and dense groves call me.<br /> The dance of the fountain calls me.<br /> Smiles call me, tears call me.<br /> A faint melody calls me.<br /> The morn, noon and eve call me.</p>
<p>Everyone is searching for a playmate.<br /> Everyone is calling me, “Come, come!”<br /> One voice, one sound, all around.<br /> Alas, the Boat of Time sails on.</p>

<p>It was Horace who offered us the following illumining definition of poets: “Poets, the first instructors of mankind.”</p>
<p>May I add,</p>

<p>Poets, the first God-Beauty-lovers<br />     of God-Nature-Creation.</p>


<p>Poetry is not something to be understood.<br /> Poetry is not something even to be felt.<br /> Poetry is something to discover one’s universal Reality.<br /> Poetry is something to uncover one’s Transcendental Divinity.</p>

<p>I am deeply honoured to be talking to you in this august hall dedicated to Theodore Roethke, the esteemed American poet who was a beloved professor and poet-in-residence at this University. According to my humble opinion, Theodore Roethke was truly a God-Beauty-lover in God the Creation. I would like to end my talk today by invoking the presence of his bright illumination-soul: “The Light Comes Brighter,” which celebrates the simultaneous arrival of Spring in nature and in the mind:</p>

<p>“...soon a branch, part of a hidden scene,<br /> The leafy mind, that long was tightly furled,<br /> Will turn its private substance into green,<br /> And young shoots spread upon our inner world.”</p>

<p>My highly esteemed Chairman Shawn Wong, my lovingly revered Professor Charles Johnson, your university is unique for its motto: “Lux Sit — Let there be Light.” Your love of light, both the light of the soul and the light of the mind, is supremely unparalleled. Today you are kindly, compassionately and blessingfully honouring me with “The Light of Asia” Award. In silence-secrecy-ecstasy I am sowing the seeds of my heart’s gratitude-tears and gratitude-smiles in your beauty-non-pareil-heart-gardens.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Indian philosophy: a glimpse</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><sup> , </sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Indian philosophy: a glimpse" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 

<p>The philosophy of the mind says:<br />     God perhaps has.<br /> The philosophy of the heart says:<br />     God certainly is.<br /> The philosophy of life says:<br />     God is both the seeker and the Sought.</p>

<p>When I go beyond the mind-philosophy, I declare:</p>

<p>No mind, no form, I only exist;<br />     Now ceased all will and thought.<br /> The final end of Nature’s dance,<br />     I am It whom I have sought.</p>

<p>{{{fleuron}}}</p>

<p>My spirit aware of all the heights,<br />     I am mute in the core of the Sun.<br /> I barter nothing with time and deeds;<br />     My cosmic play is done.</p>

<p>When I go beyond the heart-philosophy, I whisper:</p>

<p>     Sweet is my Lord.<br /> Him I have realised as the Eternal Truth.<br />     Sweeter is my Lord.<br /> Him I have realised as the only Doer.<br />     Sweetest is my Lord.<br /> Him I have realised as the Enjoyer Supreme.</p>

<p>When I go beyond the life-philosophy, I promise:</p>

<p>Never to meet again:<br />     My yesterday’s face,<br />     My backward race,<br /> Never to meet again.</p>
<p>Never to meet again:<br />     The clasp of death<br />     And Satan’s breath,<br /> Never to meet again.</p>
<p>Never to meet again:<br />     Chinmoy the failure,<br />     Ignorance sure,<br /> Never to meet again.</p>

<p>The cruel critics of philosophy say that philosophy is nowhere to nothingness and nothingness to nowhere. The same critics say that philosophy is absurdity’s longevity. They also venture to say that in everything there is a winner, but when two philosophers fight, there is no winner, no loser. In this connection, I wish to cite the opposing views of two immortals in their different fields. Beethoven, who is vested with supreme authority in the musical world, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Music is a higher revelation than philosophy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, Milton, the immortal epic poet, is there to gainsay this denigration of philosophy. Milton writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How charming is divine philosophy! Not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose, But musical as is Apollo’s lute.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between the two, I must needs cast my vote with Milton and place philosophy on the same level as music in its capacity to reveal and manifest the Divine here on earth.</p>
<p>To me, philosophy is the mind-clearance. Philosophy is the heart-assurance. Philosophy is the life-transcendence.</p>

<p>The philosophy of my mind says: “I doubt.”<br /> The philosophy of my heart says: “I hope.”<br /> The philosophy of my life says: “I am lost.”<br /> The philosophy of my soul says: “I promise.”<br /> The philosophy of my Lord says: “It is all done.”</p>

<p>In May 1882, the great German scholar Max Müller delivered a series of lectures at Cambridge University. The first was entitled, “What Can India Teach Us?” Professor Müller expressed himself most powerfully and succinctly by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most fully developed some of its choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered over the greatest problems of life, and has found solutions to some of them which well deserve the attention even of those who have studied Plato and Kant — I should point to India.</p>
<p>“And if I were to ask myself from what literature we, here in Europe, we, who have been nurtured almost exclusively on the thoughts of Greeks and Romans, and of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw that corrective which is most wanted in order to make our inner life more perfect, more comprehensive, more universal, in fact more truly human, a life, not for this life only, but a transfigured and eternal life — again I should point to India.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Max Müller ventured to study India’s ancient scriptures, the Vedas, in their original Sanskrit, he truly discovered the wealth of meaning behind Hamlet’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There are more things in Heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With your kind permission, I wish to take a leaf from Professor Müller’s life-book and ask, “What can Indian philosophy teach us?”</p>
<p>Indian philosophy does not subscribe to the ‘salvation from sin’ philosophy. Indian philosophy subscribes to the ‘liberation from ignorance-night’ philosophy. It offers to humanity an unparalleled prayer:</p>

<p>Lead me from the unreal to the Real.<br /> Lead me from darkness to Light.<br /> Lead me from death to Immortality.</p>

<p>This kind of philosophy is not God-speculation, but soulful God-invocation based on an intuitive certainty of God’s Existence. Hence, we can never apply to it the criticism made by Keats that “Philosophy will clip an angel’s wings.” Indeed, Indian philosophy is most closely connected with that of the ancient Greeks. It was Socrates who declared, “The unexamined life is not worth living,” and Plato who said, “True philosophers are lovers of the vision of Truth.”</p>
<p>In order to understand Indian philosophy, we must first realise that it is founded upon Spirit and Matter. Spirit plays the role of involution. Matter plays the role of evolution. Spirit is inward dive. Matter is upward flight.</p>
<p>Now, God has a habit of repeating Himself so that nobody remains with His Philosophy unlearned. In India, this divine philosophy has been embodied and expressed in age after age by her spiritual Masters and Avatars, or direct descendants of God.</p>

<p>India’s first Avatar Sri Ramachandra’s philosophy is:<br />     Obedience and sacrifice.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna’s philosophy is:<br />     Give up all religions.<br />     “Take shelter in Me.”<br />     “You I shall liberate.”<br />     “Be thou only an instrument.”<br />     “You have the right to work, but not to the fruits thereof.”</p>
<p>Lord Buddha’s philosophy is:<br />     Compassion and forgiveness.</p>
<p>Sri Chaitanya’s philosophy is:<br />     Love unconditionally.<br />     Everybody has the right to deserve love.</p>
<p>India’s philosopher unparalleled Sri Shankaracharya’s philosophy is:<br />     Neti, neti. Not this, not this.<br />     The world is an illusion.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna’s philosophy is:<br />     The synthesis of all religions.<br />     Be a child-heart; God will immediately be all yours.</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda’s philosophy is:<br />     Be brave.<br />     Have adamantine will-power.<br />     “The soul cannot be won by the weakling.”</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo’s philosophy is:<br />     The acceptance of life.<br />     Yoga integral.<br />     “Fate can be changed by an unchanging Will.”<br />     “We are sons of God and must be even as He.”</p>
<p>Ramana Maharshi’s philosophy is:<br />     “Who am I? Who am I?”</p>

<p>Since I am a son of my Mother India, I, too, have my own philosophy. My philosophy is:</p>

<p>Love, devotion and surrender.<br /> Love the Supreme in humanity.<br /> Devote yourself to the Supreme in humanity.<br /> Surrender yourself to the Supreme in humanity.</p>

<p>Each philosopher-sage of the highest order realises the Truth in his own way. Each one creates a path which others may follow in order to arrive at the Destination: the Golden Shore of the Beyond. But the Truth itself does not vary. That is why we say that the Indian philosophy, the Indian religion and the Indian spirituality all have the selfsame source.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Satyameva jayate</em> Truth alone triumphs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peace I find when I am lost inside God’s Compassion-Eye.<br /> Peace I become when I am lost inside God’s Forgiveness-Feet.</p>
<p>Mine is a mind-jungle totally empty of peace.<br /> Mine is a heart-garden flooded with peace.</p>
<p>The divine in us embraces peace.<br /> The human in us longs for peace.<br /> The animal in us destroys peace.</p>

<p>President Gorbachev, the peace-dreamer, peace-bringer and peace-server of this century, has urged again and again: “What we need is Star Peace and not Star Wars.”</p>

<p>I heave a sigh when my mind becomes a victim to searing conflicts.<br /> I become a singing bird when my life becomes the breath of peace.</p>
<p>My heart’s God-love-beauty has peace.<br /> My life’s God-surrender-fragrance is peace.</p>

<p>The dream-flooded and soul-stirring words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ring forth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I still believe that one day mankind will bow before the altars of God and be crowned triumphant over war and bloodshed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Devotedly I chant the Name of my Beloved Lord Supreme.<br /> Bountifully my Beloved Lord Supreme enchants my life.</p>

<p>My soul’s peace-smiles and my heart’s peace-tears together cover endless miles unobstructed.</p>

<p>Infinity is the Source of my soul’s peace-smiles.<br /> Eternity is the Source of my heart’s peace-tears.</p>
<p>Peace is infinitely more than the birthless and deathless promises of my mind.<br /> Peace is in the ever-blossoming hopes of my heart.</p>

<p>I wish to cite the momentous utterance of U Thant, the third Secretary-General of the United Nations, who was widely revered for his innate spirituality and deep wisdom. He said: “There is no peace in the world today because there is no peace in the minds of men.”</p>
<p>God comes to me, compassionately and unconditionally, and gives me Peace.<br />Man comes to me, immediately and ruthlessly, and takes away all my peace.</p>
<p>God comes and man comes.<br />When God comes, I swim in the ocean of infinite Delight.<br />When man comes, my very earth-existence is devoured by the unquenchable thirst and insatiable hunger of sorrows.</p>
<p>But love mankind I must, for mankind is unmistakably an extension of my own reality-existence. The lofty realisation of Mother Teresa, the twentieth century’s unparalleled server of bleeding humanity, echoes and re-echoes in the inmost recesses of my heart: “Works of love are works of peace.”</p>

<p>I ask God,<br /> “My Lord, is there any way I can embody<br /> and treasure Your Peace forever and forever?”</p>
<p>God says,<br /> “My child, there is a way.<br />     Just illumine your mind more, infinitely more.<br />     Feed your heart more, infinitely more.<br />     Energise your life more, infinitely more.<br />     Lo, in you My Infinity’s Peace has found its Eternity’s Abode.”</p>

<p>Peace is today’s soul-seed-world.<br />Peace is tomorrow’s life-tree-world.</p>
<p>But the peace of tomorrow must be built upon the solid foundations of today. What are those foundations? President Woodrow Wilson, the champion of the League of Nations, has a most significant message for the world community in this connection. He advises us that lasting peace can never be the fruit of a war where one side defeats the other. “It must be a peace without victory,” he proclaims.</p>
<p>We can look to the soul-stirring words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to clarify our peace-goal even further: “This is the peace that we are seeking: not an old, negative, obnoxious peace which is merely the absence of tension, but a positive, lasting peace which is the presence of brotherhood and justice.”</p>
<p>O world, you will not be happy and satisfied if you come and visit God’s omnipotent Power-Head, but you will be completely happy and supremely satisfied if you come and visit God’s omnipresent Peace-Feet.</p>
<p>Man thinks his mind’s love for world-power and his heart’s love for world peace can live together. Indeed, this is the height of man’s stupidity.</p>
<p>Up until now, God has been pleading with the human mind to study the world peace course. But now God is forcing the human mind to study the world peace course.</p>
<p>The moment the division-mind desires to live in the heart of oneness-peace-world, God will immediately declare His supreme Victory on earth.</p>
<p>One minute of world peace is ten hours with God.</p>

<p>As a God-seeker, I can have genuine peace only when I take God’s Compassion-Feet as my only shelter-rocks.</p>
<p>As a God-server, I can have fruitful peace only when insecurity completely loses its foothold in my life.</p>
<p>As a God-lover, I can have ever-blossoming peace only when I keep my heart-door wide open for my Lord’s Compassion-flooded Arrival.</p>
<p>Peace is something that we cannot give.</p>
<p>Peace is something that we cannot receive.</p>
<p>Peace is something that we become. Once we become peace, then only can we give peace to the world and receive peace from the world.</p>
<p>God tells me that if I can answer two questions, only then will He bless me with peace: Who am I? What am I?</p>
<p>Since I do not know the adequate answers, out of His infinite Bounty, God tells me who I am and what I am.</p>
<p>Who am I? I am the smiling soul of Immortality’s God.</p>
<p>What am I? I am the crying heart of Eternity’s God.</p>
<p>Peace has now become a slogan. The child of yesterday and the man who has one foot in the grave talk about peace. If we can have peace as our sole mantra-incantation instead of our slogan, peace is bound to descend from the realm of the Beyond.</p>
<p>When the mind talks about peace, invariably pride looms large.</p>
<p>When the heart talks about peace, oneness blossoms all-where.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme blessingfully and compassionately asks me if I really need peace from Him.</p>
<p>I say to Him: “I do, I do! The sooner the better.”</p>
<p>My Lord gravely and sternly tells me: “Then stop flattering Me with your mouth. Start aspiring immediately with your heart. Start serving Me immediately with your life-breath.”</p>
<p>I ask my Lord: “What about my praising You?”</p>
<p>My Lord says to me: “Do I have to tell you why you praise Me? You praise Me to raise your outer status. Do I not see through your clever and tricky movements?”</p>
<p>I become the hush of silence.</p>
<p>My Lord becomes the abundance of His Self-Giving.</p>
<p>Since anxiety, worry, jealousy and insecurity are preventing us from achieving inner peace and outer peace, can we not enter into the inner life with our meditation-fee and join an anxiety-worry-jealousy-and-insecurity-prevention society? Needless to say, in the inner world there are many such societies.</p>
<p>And, once we do well, our Lord Supreme will proudly give us a free life membership.</p>
<p>Smiling, singing and dancing, my Lord Supreme comes to me with His Infinity’s Peace when He sees me speedily running towards my heart-home before, long before, ignorance-night can dare to capture me.</p>
<p>O ignorance-flooded mind of peace-refusal, peace-reluctance, peace-unwillingness and peace-unreadiness, do you not think it is high time for you to reverse the course of your life so that you can enjoy the Beauty of God’s Life Universal and the Fragrance of God’s Self Transcendental?</p>
<p>God and God’s Compassion-Eye stop playing hide-and-seek the moment I prayerfully proclaim:</p>

<p>I am only for You.<br /> Thine is the Will I am made of.<br /> Thine is the Will I live for.</p>

<p>Only a sleepless self-giver is blessed with peace, for only he can walk along with his soul through the bountiful meadows of the Heavens.</p>
<p>God solemnly asks His world-peace-preachers: “Tell Me, My children, what do you actually want from peace, world-recognition or world-illumination? If your peace is for world-recognition, you will find Me nowhere in My entire Universe. If your peace is for world-illumination, I shall be extremely proud of having you as My invaluable and indispensable partners in My world of Vision-Light and in My world of manifestation-delight.”</p>
<p>When my mind preaches peace-gospel, God immediately becomes a roaring and thundering laughter.</p>
<p>When my mind teaches peace-philosophy, God immediately starts sleeping and snoring.</p>
<p>When my heart prayerfully learns peace-songs from my soul, God immediately and proudly embraces both the teacher and the student.</p>
<p>To my soul, God says: “My child, you are My world-transforming Power.”</p>
<p>To my heart, God says: “My child, you are My world-awakening Hour.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The New Millennium and world peace</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><sup> , </sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The New Millennium and world peace" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>O New Millennium, every thousand years you come to bless us, the entire humanity, with new dreams, new hopes and new promises. And now, once again, you are fast approaching. Today we wish to invoke you most soulfully and prayerfully.</p>
<p>O New Millennium, you are not a mere number. Your arrival heralds the divinely significant descent of a new consciousness on earth.</p>
<p>The Old Millennium says to the New Millennium, “My Brother, do not make the same mistakes that I made!”</p>
<p>We ask our Lord Beloved Supreme, “Please tell us frankly what kind of mistakes we have made in the Old Millennium and how we can rectify them in the New Millennium.”</p>
<p>Our Lord Supreme compassionately replies, “In the 20th Century, power and helplessness are in action. In the 21st Century, Love and Light will be in action.”</p>
<p>We say to our Lord, “Please tell us if we have understood You correctly: in the 20th Century, we have left God to be with ourselves. In the 21st Century, we shall leave ourselves for God and we shall live only for God, only for God.”</p>
<p>Our Beloved Lord whispers deep within our hearts, “True, My children, true. Spirituality you have rejected, God you have neglected. But do not give up! The 21st Century will help you find your way back to my Heart-Home. I have already erased My dissatisfaction-memories of the past. Can you not do the same? May all uncomely memories of the 20th Century fade away from your mind as quickly as possible! Exhale the dust of the past. Inhale the fragrance of the future.</p>
<p>“World peace is the sole theme of the present-day world. Right from a child to a 99-year-old, all incessantly talk about world peace. I dearly love the world-peace-dreamers, world-peace-lovers, world-peace-servers and even the world-war-mongers who on very, very, very rare occasions genuinely feel the supreme necessity of world peace in the very depths of their heart.</p>
<p>“Needless to say, the supremacy of the mind wants to bless the world with peace. Indeed, it is the height of stupidity! Indeed, it is the height of absurdity! It is the intimacy of the heart that can and shall inundate the world, either in the near or distant future, with peace.</p>
<p>“Might is right. This ignorance-founded theory has to be immediately and permanently shunned. Right is might, and right is founded upon Light. This infallible reality has to be accepted here and now, and must needs be practised throughout Eternity.</p>
<p>“The dividing and divided mind will never be able to enjoy even an iota of peace. It is the uniting and united heart that can and shall enjoy peace in immeasurable measure.</p>
<p>“Where is peace, if not a prayer-height away? Where is peace, if not a meditation-depth away? Let us have only the prayer that teaches us, ‘Not my will’. Let us have only the meditation that teaches us, ‘But Thine be done’.</p>
<p>“The Source of everything is God the Compassionate. Therefore, the Source of science is also none other than God Himself. God expected science to be always an unparalleled boon in the process of humanity’s evolution towards Infinity’s Light and Delight. But, alas, science in many aspects of human life has been a veritable curse, instead of being an unimaginable blessing. Instead of having the vision of an ever-blossoming creation, science indulges in an ever-increasing destruction.</p>
<p>“The spiritual seekers are eagerly and breathlessly waiting for the Golden Day when the heart of spirituality will be able to successfully embrace the mind of science and visa versa. Each will teach the other a new song. Science will teach spirituality the song of Infinity’s Peace-Beauty. Spirituality will teach science the song of Immortality’s Peace-Fragrance.</p>
<p>“I hope I have answered your question, my sweet children.”</p>
<p>O God, our Lord of Compassion, long two thousand years ago the Saviour Christ took birth to liberate mankind from the throes of ignorance-night. Alas, in two thousand years we have not been able to transform this world into the Kingdom of Heaven. Please tell us if the children of the next century will succeed in fulfilling his vision.</p>
<p>“My children, do not succumb to despair. In the New Millennium, My Compassion-Rain shall again descend in measureless measure. And this time it will be greeted by humanity’s wide open receptivity-heart-door. So smile, My children, smile. The New Millennium will be the abode of mankind’s dream.”</p>
<p>O Lord Beloved Supreme, we are ready, our hearts are ready, our entire being is ready to sing of the supremely, gloriously rising dawn of the New Millennium.</p>
<p>“My children, something more I wish to add. Millennia have passed by, but humanity has not yet seen the face of peace. To My great Joy and Relief, in the 21st Century, the Mother Goddess of Peace will visit each and every earth-family to whisper and inspire the supreme necessity of a oneness-world-family. Her persuasion of her children will be founded upon her all-disarming Smiles. Her God-receptivity-beauty and God-gratitude-fragrance will cover the entire length and breadth of the world. Tomorrow’s humanity and tomorrow’s Divinity will not only have infinitely more faith in each other, but also will work together for humanity to arrive at the Heart-Door of the Absolute Supreme and for Divinity to ring its Victory-Bell in the readiness, willingness and eagerness-home of humanity.”</p>
