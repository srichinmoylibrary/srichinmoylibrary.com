<p>At half past four this morning I was walking on 150th Street. A lady looked at me and I thought she was crazy, so I got frightened. I began to move away from her. Then she had to say, "Keep going. You are doing a very good job."</p>

<p>This afternoon, while I was out walking, I passed by Sulochana's store and I saw that Goran was painting the door. I stood there for two minutes to draw his attention. He was wearing one of our famous T-shirts and he was going on, going on. I was standing only ten metres behind him, but he did not see me. I have to appreciate his power of concentration.</p>

<p>About two weeks ago, when I was out walking, I saw Sulochana watering her lawn. I began screaming "Sulochana" and, finally, she turned round. Otherwise, she was not seeing me.</p>
<p>Of all the disciples, I see Sulochana the most. No matter which side I go, she is there. She gets my smiles not once, but at least four times. For others, I give one smile or even half a smile, but Sulochana gets at least four different types of smiles from me.</p>

<p>About two months ago, when I was warned by a quarter, I very faithfully bent down and picked it up. Since then, I have picked up pennies, nickels, dimes and so forth. Today also I got a penny. I bent down very devotedly so that I would not displease Mother Lakshmi. If Mother Lakshmi becomes mad, she can turn someone into a street beggar, so we have to be very careful.</p>

<p>The other day, when I was out walking, I saw Mitali. Mitali, as usual whenever she sees me, was in the seventh heaven of delight. Mitali is the only disciple who jumps up and down when she sees me. No matter how many times a day she sees me on the street, she jumps up and down, up and down.</p>

<p>I was walking along 150th Street. I crossed to the right side of the street and a short Indian-looking man called to me from the left side of the street, "Swamiji, Swamiji, wait, wait!"</p>
<p>He had a child's carriage with a four or five month-old child inside. I waited and he dragged the carriage across the street. Then he lifted the child up and said, "Swamiji, please bless my baby."</p>
<p>Very affectionately, I put my hand on the child's head and blessed the child. It was a little girl.</p>
<p>I said, "May I ask her name?"</p>
<p>"Her name is Lakshmi," he replied. He was so happy. Then I asked him where he came from and he told me that he comes from Trinidad.</p>

<p>This afternoon I was walking on the right side of the Grand Central Parkway. An elderly couple was walking ahead of me with their little granddaughter. Both of them were about eighty years old and she was seven or eight years old. The three of them were blocking the pavement. I could not walk by them. I was approaching quite fast, but they were blocking the way.</p>
<p>When I came near them, the little one saw me and moved aside so that I could pass. As I went by, she said to me, "Sir, please walk slowly! You are frightening my grandfather."</p>
<p>So I started walking slowly. I passed by them and I could have resumed my former speed, but I listened to her request. I continued walking slowly the rest of the way home!</p>

<p>As you know, I have been walking eight miles a day for the last two months. Now I am walking seven miles a day; I have decreased. Seven is my special number, so I was wondering why I had to do eight miles. Now I do seven. On rare occasions, I do six and then I compensate the next day by walking nine miles.</p>
<p>Anyway, at three o'clock this afternoon I started walking and I have quite a few amusing stories to tell you. I decided I would walk four miles. I went along 150th Street to the Grand Central Service Road and made a left. Then I went to Main Street. I crossed over Main Street and continued to Queens Boulevard. I had covered about one and a half miles and I was extremely, extremely thirsty.</p>
<p>I had brought with me a ten dollar bill and a twenty dollar bill in case of emergency, but I hate to carry water or any kind of drink. I was planning to cross Queens Boulevard and go into one of the stores. Some disciples go to Pasta Lovers and I thought I could buy a drink there, but I did not want any Italian food.</p>
<p>Then, right near the courthouse, I saw a vendor. I was so relieved. An old man, very thin and short, was selling drinks. On the table I saw the drinks and I was able to read "Snapple" on the label.</p>
<p>I asked him, "Do you have Diet Snapple?"</p>
<p>He said, "Yes." Then he picked up one can to give me. I asked him, "Are you sure it is Diet?"</p>
<p>"Are you deaf? Are you blind?" he screamed. "I told you it was Diet. Look, it is written 'Diet' and 'Snapple'."</p>
<p>"I am not deaf, I am not blind," I replied.</p>
<p>He took my ten dollar bill and turned his back to cover his money while he counted out my change. He wanted to hide the money that he had. The drink was $1.45 and he gave me all one dollar bills in change. I did not count the change. I thanked him and went away.</p>

<p>Then I walked about 200 metres. Just past the courthouse, I saw another vendor. I was still drinking from the first can. I had not finished even half. But I threw it into the garbage bin and went up to the second vendor. I said to myself, "Today I am in the world of amusement, so let me have another experience!"</p>
<p>This vendor was short, about forty years old and he had a moustache. He was very polite and from his accent I knew that he was Puerto Rican. I asked him the same question: "Do you have Diet Snapple?"</p>
<p>Very politely, he said, "Yes, we have." He charged me $1.30 — fifteen cents less than the previous one. He was so kind and polite. Then I noticed that he was also selling knishes. Knishes have become my most favourite snack. An argument was going on inside my mind whether to buy one.</p>
<p>Temptation and greed were on one side and my stupid diet was on the other. I was saying to myself, "In the morning I took a knish, now again I have to do it? Tomorrow I will feel miserable when I get on the scale. Yesterday I took a knish after eight o'clock at night and I gained weight, so today I promised that after four o'clock I would not eat anything. Now it is already after four o'clock." Then my greed and temptation would say, "Who cares if tomorrow I gain one pound?"</p>
<p>The argument was going this side and that side. I felt miserable. Finally my diet won. I had to be content with my Snapple. This time I drank the whole can.</p>

<p>Once more I went on my way. I was on the pavement. You call it the sidewalk. I do not like that word; I call it the pavement. Perhaps it is a British word. Anyway, I saw a van coming towards me. It was about fifty metres away and it was honking and honking. I saw that it was Bruce. Whenever he sees me, he screams, "Guru, Guru, Guru," twenty or thirty times, plus he honks. So many cars were passing by me, but Bruce was screaming and screaming.</p>

<p>Now I had completed my two miles and I was wondering, "Shall I go back the same way and make it four miles or shall I continue walking in the same direction and go to Hillside?" Then I remembered that if I went to Hillside, I would have to climb up 150th Street, so I started going back.</p>
<p>Right in front of the courthouse, I saw a little girl. She was three or four years old. She was wearing white. She said to me, "Sir, would you like to have a piece of candy?" Such a sweet, little girl!</p>
<p>Then her brother came. He was a little older than his sister. He said to me, "No, you have to give me a dollar." I did not feel like giving a dollar to the boy for the piece of candy, so I walked away. Then I heard somebody running behind me. I turned around and saw that it was the little girl. She said, "I want to give you the candy free."</p>
<p>Immediately I put my hand inside my pocket and took out three one dollar bills. Quickly I gave them to her. Then her brother came. I gave him a dollar. I was holding the candy in my hand. I said to her, "Will you make me happy? Please take it. I am on a strict diet."</p>
<p>She said, "I do not want money from you. I want to give it to you for free." Her name was Eva. She was so nice.</p>

<p>I continued walking. I came back and crossed Main Street. Then I saw an elderly gentleman, tall and thin and a little bit weak, coming towards me. He said to me, "Sir, please tell me if I am heading towards Main Street."</p>
<p>Main Street was only forty metres away. I said to him, "Yes, yes, you are quite close." And I showed him the way.</p>
<p>He was so happy. When I can give people correct information, I am in the seventh heaven of delight. When I cannot tell them, I feel miserable. I told him this and then I felt that he wanted to speak with me. So I was describing how twenty years ago I had the same problem. I was fifty metres from Union Turnpike early in the morning and I had to ask an elderly woman where Union Turnpike was. She just pointed straight ahead and said, "You are so near. You are facing it."</p>
<p>So this elderly gentleman and I were in the same boat. Then he told me that he was about to turn back because he was arguing with himself whether he was going the right way. He did not know he was so close. So it went on. Two old men had a very nice conversation. He gave me a broad smile and I gave him a broad smile.</p>

<p>I came to my new 800-metre mark. It is a round circle and a long line. There I saw a white dog that looked exactly like my Sona. It was white and bulky. I did not pay any attention to the dog. I was just walking.</p>
<p>Then the dog started following me and licking my left calf so affectionately and lovingly. I covered more than ten metres and it was only licking my leg. The owner came running. He said to his dog, "You love this man more than you love me, Tak!" The name of the dog was Tak. Then he grabbed the dog and put it on his heart and went into his house.</p>
<p>Here the dog not only followed me, but it was licking very affectionately my left calf. I knew that it was not going to bite me. It was only showing me all its affection.</p>
<p>How many incidents one can have in the course of a walk!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The memorable mile</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The memorable mile" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This morning I went out to walk at 4:20 and I came back at 5:10. Nobody will be able to guess correctly how far I walked. In fifty minutes, I walked one mile. One mile! Every twenty metres I had to stop and massage my legs, sometimes holding the rail or the fence. I went along 150th Street to the service road and made a left turn. Then I went up to my 800-metre mark and turned around.</p>
<p>When I was returning, around 300 metres or so, a car stopped and Aushadi came out of the car to greet me. Then I continued walking. What kind of pain I had! Usually I go six or seven miles, but today I could not. I need rest. Tomorrow I will take complete rest.</p>
<p>This experience I shall always remember: fifty minutes I took for one mile! There was, unfortunately, no juicy story, nothing. Only I saw four or five buses. At that hour there was nobody to sympathise with me. The buses were empty, empty, empty. There were no passengers inside.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was walking in front of Pramoda's house. She saw me, but she was in trance. I was also in trance. Both of us were in trance. I think she was singing a little bit or whistling. Then I drew her attention and she saw me.</p>
