  <h2 id="page-title">Part I — Introduction: a talk to disciples</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part I — Introduction: a talk to disciples" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Sometimes I get a few complaints from some of my disciples. They say that they have not made any progress and that there is no hope of their making progress in the future. But I wish to tell them that a student's spiritual progress can be judged only by a spiritual Master. You will ask how the aspirant cannot be aware of his own progress. But I wish to say that the aspirant becomes aware of his own progress only when he becomes truly advanced.</p>
<p>We expect everything sooner than at once. We all want to be God-realised souls overnight. It is an excellent idea, a great aim that all of us cherish; but we have to know where we actually stand. To be very frank, some of you are absolute beginners in the spiritual life. I am not trying to discourage you, far from it; only this is just a bare statement of fact. Again, you have to know that he who is a beginner today can easily become an expert tomorrow. But at the very beginning of our journey, if we feel that God-realisation will dawn on us tomorrow or in the near future, it will be a deplorable mistake. We have to go step by step. Before we go through kindergarten, if we want to enter into the university, it will be a ridiculous idea.</p>
<p>God-realisation does not come by hook or by crook. Years of spiritual discipline, iron discipline, are necessary in order to have higher and deeper spiritual experiences. Then, from these experiences, we enter into a deeper region which we call the region of realisation. This region also has to be surpassed in order to enter into the real realisation, the absolute realisation — in other words, God-realisation. I am not throwing cold water on you. I only wish to say that each spiritual aspirant or seeker must have infinite patience, and his patience is nothing but inner light and inner wisdom.</p>
<p>To my sorrow, some of you do not even follow the basic spiritual disciplines. First of all, there is nothing as important as regularity in the spiritual life. Today some of you meditate at six o'clock in the morning, tomorrow at four o'clock, the day after at eleven or twelve o'clock. Then again, there are some who meditate only once a week, or once in a blue moon. This is deplorable. Regularity must be practised. If it is at seven o'clock that you meditate, please try to meditate every day at seven o'clock. If it is at eight o'clock, then every day meditate at eight o'clock. Your inner being will never take any responsibility for you if you are not regular in your spiritual life.</p>
<p>Along with regularity, please try to have purity in your body, vital, mind, heart and soul. It is in purity that God's Breath abides. The purity of the body is of paramount importance in the spiritual life. If physical purity is lacking in a human being, then it is simply impossible for the Divine Being to breathe in that particular individual. Then, along with physical purity, there also has to be cleanliness in the body. I am sure all of you take baths at least once a day. What we call "cleanliness" in the outer world, in the inner world we call "purity." There also has to be purity in the mind. If your mind is roaming here and there, if your mind is cherishing all kinds of undivine thoughts, then purity is just a far cry. So physical purity, mental purity and vital purity are all of paramount importance.</p>
<p>Before you actually start to meditate, no matter what time it is, please wash your eyes, ears and nose. You should use cold water and not hot water or warm water. Then, you have to know that it is always better to meditate in a seated position. Of course, when you are spiritually more developed you can meditate while lying down, while standing, while running, while eating, while talking. But right now, you should meditate at home in a quiet spot. You need not sit cross-legged; you can sit in a chair or you can sit on your sofa. But try to keep your spine erect and straight. These are the basic things that you must know.</p>

<h2>Question: What is your process for enlightenment and what do you ask of your disciples?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one thing that I ask of my disciples: to aspire. By aspiration we mean inner cry. We cry for name and fame in the outer world, but in the inner world we cry for peace, light and bliss in infinite measure. So I ask my disciples to cry inwardly to achieve peace, light and bliss and to grow into peace, light and bliss.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do you teach people to meditate in a specific way?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do you teach people to meditate in a specific way?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many to whom I have not given any specific meditation, because it is not necessary. When I meditate with you people, my very presence is enough to bring the soul forward and let the soul meditate. Some of you people say, "I don't know how to meditate," but you do not know that when you meditate with me, my main task is to bring the soul forward so that your soul will meditate in and through you. Again, if you can consciously create a pure vibration and a sincere attitude, then it is easier for the soul to remain to the fore and to receive everything. So you don't have to learn any specific meditation, because it comes through my eyes. When you are looking at my eyes, at that time if your soul is hungry for peace, then peace will enter into you. If your soul is hungry for light, then light will enter. If it is hungry for any spiritual qualities, they will enter. The mind may not understand, but the mind is not at all necessary for meditation.</p>
<p>Sometimes when the soul is receiving peace, light and bliss, it wants to assimilate them. Again, sometimes even before the soul assimilates the qualities, it wants to express them. Now assimilation is always good and expression is also good. In some cases we see that the souls are eager to assimilate and keep something for fifteen or twenty days, or for five days or perhaps just five hours. and then express it. In other cases we see that the soul wants to reveal, manifest and express these qualities immediately, in a day or a few hours' time. If assimilation is not complete, then proper expression is not impossible, but it is very difficult. Again, sometimes it is quite possible to express it.</p>
<p>Today while we were meditating, two people's souls did not want to assimilate. One young man's throat centre, the centre of expression, immediately wanted to express what it received. He very powerfully said, "Now I have got it, and I want to give it to others immediately. He did not try to assimilate at all; he just wanted to express. What his soul did is not bad at all.</p>
<p>Now, in another young man's case, his soul wanted to express something, but his vital came forward, saying, "No, no, no! The best thing is to keep it like a miser who saves his money." He started giving it out, but then he began assimilating instead. The rest of the disciples all assimilated whatever they got from me. Only these two individuals did not want to; they wanted to express what they could, although the second one decided to assimilate at the last minute. Now, this expression can be to others, to the atmosphere or to the universal Consciousness. Sometimes it is like knowledge: the more you give, the more you get. Someone may feel, "Let me read for one hour and give as I receive." Again, someone else may say, "No, let me learn more, and then I will give. Let me read for two hours and afterwards give." It is like knowledge to some extent, but it cannot be compared with human knowledge.</p>
<p>However, if you want to be in a position to give constantly to the world at large, you have to realise God first, assimilate your realisation and then come with a special mission to give to mankind. Otherwise, before realising God, you have only partial light, partial truth. When you try to offer your light and truth, you will think you have a big heart. Instead of saving it to get one hundred dollars, which is your goal, you will say, "Oh, I have got one dollar. Let me give it to mankind." If someone is kind, he will take it from you and think, "He has only one dollar, but he is so generous. Whatever he has he gives." But if you are giving that one good dollar to an undeserving person or to someone who is vitally very strong, impure and obscure, he will just grab it and feel, "No, he is telling a lie. He has more than one dollar." He will act like a thief and say, "You have more money; you are not giving me enough." He will strike you and beat you in the inner world. When you have only one dollar to give, these forces are so strongly tempted. They feel that you have more wealth to give. They try to destroy your potentiality and possibility.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us try to feed the Supreme with our meditation and aspiration. For my disciples, the easiest and most effective way of doing a good meditation is to enter into me, into my consciousness. Try to remain in my consciousness twenty-four hours a day. Then only can you rest assured that you are really safe in our boat. Otherwise, you may try to leave the boat. Then I will have to jump out of the boat and enter into the sea of ignorance to rescue you. Also, to get a good meditation, one has to have inner discipline and one has to know what the truth is, what aspiration is. This requires time. If God-realisation is your sole wish, then I wish to say, please meditate well.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, how can we go deeper and deeper within so we can go beyond the surface mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, how can we go deeper and deeper within so we can go beyond the surface mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to dig a well today, first you have to find an instrument to dig with. Then you start digging and continue until you are tired. The next day you will dig again, and the day after you will do the same. In this way you will work every day and make a little progress. That is how you will one day get water. So if you want to dig deep within yourself, if you want to get Immortality-Nectar, then you also have to dig regularly in the same way. But in this case the digging implement is your aspiration. This aspiration is like a magnet. The higher your aspiration goes, the deeper inward the magnet pulls you. Aspiration is the only tool, the only instrument, with which to dig the barren soil within you. As you go deep within the earth with outer implements when you dig for water, so also with aspiration you can dig deep within yourself in order to get Nectar, which is Immortality. It is only a matter of regular daily practice.</p>
<p>You have accepted the spiritual life and you want to make progress. You may meditate once a day or once a week or once a month; or you may say, "No, I wish to meditate three times a day. What is wrong with me? I eat three times a day. Why can't I meditate at least three times a day? And if I spend an hour for my luncheon and an hour for my dinner, then can I not also spend at least two hours in meditation?" But here we have to know that meditation is not like eating earthly food. If your mind is roaming all the time, you can spend hours and hours in meditation but you will make no progress. If you spend two hours in meditation, then out of those two hours perhaps you can meditate well for only five minutes. Again, if you say, "I am selecting five minutes and as soon as I enter into meditation, I will have a most sublime meditation," usually it does not happen, especially in the case of beginners or new seekers.</p>
<p>So what all of you should try to do is this: if you want to meditate well for fifteen minutes, try to keep aside one hour for your meditation. Then during that hour, consider forty-five minutes as being only for your preparation or for allowing your mind to roam in the world of fantasies. Of course, this is not the ideal thing, but you have to feel that right now you are helpless. So you can keep aside forty-five minutes for your own purpose and then meditate well for fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Again, you may feel that if you sit down for fifteen minutes, you will be able to meditate well and you won't need forty-five minutes extra. You may feel that you don't have to take a few preliminary starts before you run the race. Before a sprinter runs the full distance of one hundred metres, he runs twenty or thirty metres in order to warm up, so that his body can be properly co-ordinated. So the same principle can be applied here. If it is necessary, we shall take a few practice starts. And if it is not necessary, then right away we shall cover the hundred metre distance, that is to say, we shall go deep within.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Try to think that you have three things in your possession: the soul, the heart and the mind. In your case one possession, the mind, the intellectual mind, is suffering because it has been given very good training at Yale and now you are neglecting it. Try to take the mind as a possession, but feel that it is a very heavy burden on your shoulders. Who wants to place a heavy burden on his shoulders? Feel that you can easily take off this load; you can get rid of the gross physical mind.</p>
<p>Your heart is another possession. When you think of or try to feel the heart, feel that there is something inside the heart and that is why it is beautiful and meaningful. Your last possession is your soul, which represents reality and divinity. The soul needs a heart. The heart needs a soul. The soul is a seed; the heart is a tree. The seed needs the tree; and if there is no seed there cannot be a plant. The heart-plant comes from the soul-seed; then the plant grows into a tree and the tree becomes a banyan tree. But first there must be a seed.</p>
<p>If the mind is creating problems, feel that you don't need the earthbound mind. You have had enough use from it. Just take the heart as a plant and the soul as a seed. If you can grow into the consciousness of the seed, there will always be the possibility that the seed will germinate and you will grow into a plant and then into a tree.</p>
<p>Think of what will produce results. The conscious awareness of the soul will always create something ever new and vibrant. If something constantly grows inside you which is pure, divine and immortal, then automatically things that are not immortal and aspiring in the physical mind will be transformed because of the constant growth. They will be transformed and illumined if they have not already left. If the mind still remains a heavy load, it will be transformed. All you have to do is to give all importance to the seed, the soul. Then the physical mind will leave you or it will have to surrender to the flood of light inside the heart which is the soul.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. The best thing is to meditate every day. If you cannot meditate, then pray. But you cannot say that you only want to increase your selfless service and forget about your meditation. No! If you want to help people, then help people after you have done your meditation. You have to do the first thing first. You have to meditate. If you cannot meditate, you can pray. Ultimately, prayer and meditation will give you the same goal. But to go without praying or meditating is like going without money. Without any wealth, what are you going to have to give to others? If you pray, you acquire inner wealth; but if you don't have inner wealth you are like a beggar.</p>
<p>Then, when you have spiritual wealth, you must give your wealth to the right person, and not to the wrong person. There will be many who need your help, but if you give to the wrong person, then you are creating more problems for him and for yourself.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, before you start meditating, breathe in deeply a few times. Very deep breathing helps conscious awareness. If you still find yourself falling asleep and starting to enjoy the bliss of sleep, at that time you should say "No, let me enjoy the bliss of meditation." Instead of entering into other worlds you should say, "No, let me remain in this world. I won't even knock at the door of the sleep worlds. I shall stay here outside.</p>
<p>In meditation, movement is going on but in a very subtle, peaceful way. In it is the life that lifts us up towards the goal. But when we enter into sleep there is no life at all.</p>
<p>During your meditation you yourself will realise when, instead of getting a very dynamic inner thrill, you are entering into a world where there is no life at all. You should feel, "No, I want to enter into a place where there will be fulfilling and dynamic life."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it wrong to sleep in meditation if we have worked all night?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it wrong to sleep in meditation if we have worked all night?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes even though you are exhausted you have to work very hard. Some doctors are runners and yet they have to train vigorously. During the day they work very hard and they can practice running only at night. An example is Dr. Roger Bannister, the first to run the four-minute mile. He was a doctor in England who could practise his running only at around eleven o'clock at night after a long day of work. He had a goal; so he practised hard and didn't make excuses.</p>
<p>You also have a goal in your life. Important things, such as functions, do not take place every day. Opportunities do not come every day in your life. If you use the opportunity you are gaining something. Spirituality is like an opportunity. If you miss one meditation you have to feel that you have missed something, you have covered one step less. When you don't do something regularly, your consciousness loses its capacity and the road becomes very long. For someone who does meditation every day it becomes very short. Insincere people say there will be another opportunity. But as the Supreme Himself is always progressing, if you miss one opportunity you have to feel that you have really lost something. Once you relax, ignorance has covered you. If you fail to get up once, then on that day ignorance has come to you.</p>
<p>I tell you, nobody has lost his body by praying and meditating. If you people say that someone has become exhausted and gone mad for God's sake, it is all lies. God is all Wisdom. So if you have worked very hard and do not think you can keep awake in your meditation you must ask your Master if he wants to excuse you.</p>
<p>Emotionally disturbed people try to push too fast and realise God overnight. But stable people do it gradually. Anybody will succeed if he prays or meditates. At one time my sincerity was to realise my God. Now my sincerity is my oneness with you people. Tomorrow you do not know what will happen, so avail yourselves of today's wealth. Parents say their children are very young and later they will pray or meditate; but that tomorrow will never come. To put things off is to be insincere. Feel that you have to do what is required immediately. Most of us believe in a future life, but we do not believe in the capacity of the immediate life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In India all western tourists go to visit the Himalayas. When they come back from the Himalayas do you think they are God-realised? True, as in the past, even now Indian sages and seers meditate at the foot of the Himalayas, but God-realisation and meditation are two different things. Just because many have realised the Highest there, we are apt to say that this place will give us realisation and fulfilment immediately, but it is not so. It is not where we are that is important; it is the Will of God that will give us realisation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I read a book about concentration and meditation in which it said that one should pay attention to the direction in which one is facing, whether it is to the East, South, West or North.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I read a book about concentration and meditation in which it said that one should pay attention to the direction in which one is facing, whether it is to the East, South, West or North." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For concentration we do not need any particular direction: East, West, North or South. You can sit and concentrate in any direction. In India there are some who are not actually aspirants, but who are extremely eager to have the results of their prayers and desires. They feel that the South is the best because they believe that one of our gods, Ganesha, is situated in the South. They feel that before meditating one has to bow down to him and say, "I bow down to Ganesha." Ganesha, the son of Lord Shiva, is supposed to be the boon-giver. So if your meditation concerns the fulfilment of a desire which you would soon like to get, then I wish to say the South has some value. But the other corners, East, West and North, are of no use. That is the only thing that I can say about meditating in a particular direction.</p>
<p>But when concentration is concerned, there is no necessity of facing a particular way, because you are concentrating to enter into deeper meditation, to enter into your inner life. At that time you may even keep your eyes closed. Concentration does not mean that we have to always keep our eyes wide open. No, we can concentrate with our eyes closed. From the strict spiritual point of view, meditating facing one direction or another is all very foolish. You may say that the sun rises in the East and since the sun signifies the Creator, if you look at the East immediately you will get inspiration and aspiration. When the sun sets you see that all the world is now taking rest, spiritual sleep, inner sleep for nourishment. This means you will get double energy and dynamism for the morrow if you look at the West. Now, in India people look to the North because the Himalayas are there. They feel even the name Himalaya will immediately take them to God-realisation. In the West and even in the South of India people think that a touch of the Himalayas will give them God-realisation. This is a stupid feeling. There are thousands and millions of people living at the foot of the Himalayas but they are not realised. These theories are all mental fabrications.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part III — Collective meditation and the master: a talk</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part III — Collective meditation and the master: a talk" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This is a collective meditation; that is to say, we all meditate together. In the beginning of today's meeting for about half an hour what I did was to bring down peace — sublime and infinite peace. After that, I stood in front of each of you and entered into you to observe what the soul, the inner being, the outer being, the physical, the vital, the mind and the heart wanted at that particular moment. While I was doing this I must say, almost all of you aspired to have something or to grow into something. Your physical mind may not have been aware of your soul's immediate need, but your soul was spontaneously trying to bring to the fore the spiritual need, the inner need.</p>
<p>Sometimes I see that there is no aspiration. Some students do not want anything. It is not that they have everything; it is just that they do not have the inspiration to either draw something from above or to get something from me. With these students I just try to kindle the flame of aspiration. But if I stand in front of someone and see that that particular aspirant wants to have Peace, immediately I bring down Peace from above. If I see someone who wants Light, then I bring down Light. If a third person wants Power, I bring down Power. There are other divine qualities also. According to the aspiration, necessity and receptivity of each individual aspirant, I bring down spiritual, divine treasures from above.</p>
<p>There are some aspirants who get immediate inspiration and aspiration when they see that a great spiritual figure is standing in front of them, inspiring them or guiding them to speed up their spiritual life and spiritual progress. Those who are conscious of the fact that a spiritual person can do and does this act of upliftment in their spiritual life, are consciously benefiting from my spiritual presence.</p>
<p>I wish to add something more. The soul, as you know, right now is encaged; it is inside the body. At times during the aspirant's conscious or unconscious life, it wants to fly from one plane of consciousness to another. That is to say, it tries to go from the second plane to the third plane, and from the third plane to the fourth plane — up, up, up. There are seven higher worlds and seven lower worlds of existence. If I see that the soul of a particular aspirant wants to have that experience of the soul's journey, then I do it for him. Today I have done that here with one particular seeker. And, of course, to each individual I have given my inner wealth according to the individual's aspiration and necessity.</p>
<p>Very often, just for a second during the meditation, the aspirant's soul feels my inner concern, love and blessings for him. Then it is blocked up for five, ten or fifteen minutes; then again it resumes its performance. Or at night, when the particular seeker is asleep, the soul of the person comes to me again to be benefited and to seek my guidance. That is also done.</p>
<p>So these are the major things that I do during the collective meditation. And once you can make a conscious contact with my soul, then you can rest assured that my existence on earth will act like your slave. Once anyone makes real contact with my soul and sincerely wants my help, then I am at his or her service forever. But this contact must be transformed into identification, and from identification into oneness. If a seeker can establish oneness between his soul and my soul, then I shall be always responsible for that particular human being. This is my soul's Assurance.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Can you please speak about collective meditation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you meditate in a group, feel that ignorance is against you in a tug of war. So at whatever time the meditation is scheduled to begin, at that time you have to start pulling. It is like starting together in a race. Before a race, all the runners have to come and wait at the starting point. When the starter fires the gun, immediately the runners begin running. But if a runner is not at the starting point at the appointed hour, the starter does not wait for the latecomer. Today we are meditating in a group. When we meditate together, we have to know that we are meditating with the Supreme, in the Supreme and for the Supreme, against ignorance. We are not competing against anybody; we are competing against our inner weaknesses, inner imperfections. In order to conquer these forces, we have to run toward the Goal.</p>
<p>As each spiritual Master has a boat of his own, we are also in our own boat. Every day the Supreme is judging the passengers. Now I may scold you from time to time, but I wish to say that many who are in my boat are winning the race against ignorance. Although there are some who do not meditate well, some do meditate very well. Again, there is every chance, every fear, every apprehension that we may also lose mercilessly. We have been winning, true, but if we lose our capacity, ignorance may win. So please feel that only when we can see the smiling Face of the Supreme have we achieved everything. He is giving us this opportunity. He offers everyone the same opportunity, but so far it is only spiritual seekers who have availed themselves of it. Right now many new people are entering into our boat. This is the Supreme's wish that I am executing. A kind of self-complacency has developed in some of the older disciples who have been with us for four, five or six years, and this self-complacency is a danger to our mission. The new disciples will add new life to our inspiration and aspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have a friend who knows how to meditate, and if you meditate with him, even unconsciously you may receive inspiration from him. Then, automatically the power of meditation will increase in you and your ignorance will decrease. You will learn many things from your spiritual friends; you will be able to have a new perspective on life.</p>
