  <h2 id="page-title">Aspiration Defeats Realisation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Aspiration Defeats Realisation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Flying to Australia is really an arduous journey! I don't know how my Australian disciples come to New York every year, sometimes twice a year! Had I been their disciple, I would have told God I could wait for a few more incarnations before coming to Australia to see my guru. The plane journey sincerely kills me â€” perhaps because I am an old man. Twenty-four hours â€” no, twenty-seven hours â€” we were on the plane.</p>
<p>I really admire my Australian children. Is this not a sign of their aspiration? Their aspiration has defeated my realisation! Of course the heart is very close. My children have a heart to know how much joy they can give me, and I do hope I give them a little joy as well. In the heart there is no distance, no distance, no distance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">An Apprehensive Soul</h2><span property="dc:title" content="An Apprehensive Soul" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This time, when I arrived in Australia the soul of Australia approached me with tremendous apprehension about whether it would be able to please me. Even when I was in the plane, my disciples were so excited that I was coming, but the soul was suffering from apprehension.</p>
<p>The first time I went there, I was new, and the soul greeted me with immense joy. I did not expect much, and the soul did not expect much from me. But over the years we have developed a good friendship. Since I have done so much for the soul of Australia through my Australian disciples, and the soul knows how much I have done, not only for the disciples, but also for the Australian consciousness, the soul of Australia wanted to give me something very powerful and striking. Sometimes when you consciously want to give something great, very striking, you may be full of apprehension whether you will be able to give or not. When you want to do something or give something very significant, then you become apprehensive.</p>
<p>So right from the airport I was seeing a kind of apprehension. The soul greeted me with utmost joy, love and gratitude, but there was also apprehension about what was going to happen and whether I was going to be pleased and satisfied. But when the concert was over there was tremendous relief, tremendous relief. During the first concert, when there were people waiting outside, I saw that the soul felt great relief that I was well received. Even if nobody had waited for the second show, the soul would not have minded because the first concert was more than enough. It is not only the number of people but also the sincere enthusiasm. The soul of Australia wanted to show me the sincere concern for peace and the sincere aspiration of its people, and when the soul saw that it was able to show me those things, the soul was more than pleased.</p>

<p>I have an Indian accent, but some Australian accents are far more difficult to understand. I have such problems when they say 'eight'. I was trying to get a number from the telephone operator one day. He was saying 'ite', 'ite'. I couldn't understand what this word 'ite' was. The first time he said it, I thought it was 'heart'. But what did 'heart' have to do with the number? I made him repeat the number four times. Then I realised, "Oh, it is eight!"</p>
<p>The next day, when I asked Ghanta his age, he also said 'ite' â€” but it didn't confuse me because I had already gotten training from the telephone operator.</p>

<p>One morning the disciples held a race for the public. Two runners were going ahead of me, and one of them was telling the other, "This guy is everything. Turn around." He wanted his friend to see me properly.</p>
<p>After the race somebody else came up to me and said, "Why do you not allow people to eat meat and fish?" Perhaps he had become very hungry from running.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Happiness Does Exist On Earth</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Happiness Does Exist On Earth" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Since my childhood ended, in my entire incarnation I have had only two or three happy moments. Of course, when I achieved God-realisation was one. And the day I rode with the engineer of the steam train in Australia was another. When I was young it was my greatest desire to be the driver of a train. God did not see fit to fulfil this innocent desire of mine, but now my Australian children have fulfilled it!</p>
<p>The engineer was so kind, so nice; he received so much. Every two minutes he was putting coal in the furnace, and talking, talking, talking, all about his experiences with this train and other trains. He has been in India, and he talked about the Darjeeling train, which is much more peculiar and dangerous than this one. This train is mainly for children and for tourists, and quite a few of the workers on it work for free. His real job is running a nursery, and driving the train is a labour of love. If everyone took a salary, they wouldn't be able to keep the train running.</p>
<p>Every year there is a race â€” the train versus runners. The runners start and finish at the same place as the train. But they run on the road, while the train goes on its track. The route is very hilly and very scenic. One year Kishore joined the race, and he was one of those who beat the train. But the driver told me, "We get joy by losing to the runners. Otherwise, could anybody defeat us?" The train can safely go about 22 miles per hour. If it goes much faster, it will go off the rails.</p>
<p>At one point the engineer asked me to sit on his seat, but it was so narrow! My thigh was larger than the seat. The sound the train made gave me such joy. And the whistle was so loud! He would pull the handle just half an inch, and such a loud noise it made!</p>
<p>So my Australia has given me tremendous joy by fulfilling an innocent childhood desire of mine.</p>

<p>Each country gave me joy. Australia gave me tremendous joy, and Japan gave me tremendous joy. India also gave me tremendous joy, plus a tremendous headache!</p>
<p>Australia's success is most, most remarkable from both the outer point of view and the inner point of view. They wanted 1,000 people, but 3,000 came. The hall holds 2,000. But 200 more came in, and there were still 700 or 800 people outside. When the first concert was over, I took a little rest and then played again for the ones who couldn't come in the first time. It was the first time I ever had to play twice. The concert was extremely well received.</p>

<p>When I was in an Indian restaurant in Australia, an Indian lady asked me where I came from. I said I came from Bengal. She said, "I am also from Bengal."</p>
<p>I said, "I am from Chittagong." Then immediately she said she was from Shakpura, which is where I grew up.</p>
<p>I asked her some questions in case she was fooling me. Although I am much older than she, she was really from Shakpura. Her name was Anita.</p>
<p>The restaurant we were in was only three and a half miles from her present home. She had come to Australia with her son.</p>

<p>My flute gave me the greatest joy and also the greatest suffering when I stopped at Delhi airport on the way to Madras.</p>
<p>The customs man gave me a very hard time. He opened all my things. When he opened my flute case, he was positive it was a gun. He lifted up the three parts and held it to the light as if he were trying to see through it. O God! Everywhere there is suspicion, suspicion!</p>
<p>I kept telling him, "It is not a gun! It is a flute!" But he would not allow me to touch it in order to show him. He was afraid I might do something dangerous. I said, "For God's sake, allow me to play." Then I put the three pieces together and for a second I blew through it.</p>
<p>"Oh, it is a flute!" he said. "Okay."</p>

<p>Right beside me was another man who was also coming from Japan, like me. He had a small Japanese umbrella. On the top it was tied with something plastic that looked like a snake.</p>
<p>The customs man said, "This is something dangerous."</p>
<p>The man said, "It is only an umbrella," but the customs officer would not believe him. Then the customs man spoke to another officer, who was a little bit superior. He was an inspector.</p>
<p>The inspector said, "They are dangerous things." He asked the man to follow him into a room off to the side. Meanwhile the accused man was shouting and insulting the inspector in Tamil. This happened in Delhi, which is Hindi-speaking.</p>
<p>It took them practically ten minutes to finish their examination of his umbrella. In the meantime, I was sitting in the lounge, waiting for the final boarding call.</p>
<p>When he came out, he said, "Look at these idiots!"</p>
<p>I said, "My flute became a gun and your umbrella became such a dangerous weapon."</p>

<p>I arrived in the Ashram only to hear all about the trip I was about to take to France. Three or four old friends of mine work in Paris. They are my admirers. They came back to visit the Ashram just before me, and told everybody about the concert I was going to give in France â€” even what kind of posters we had. So my Ashram friends knew all about the concert even before I arrived.</p>
<p>One of my friends told another friend that everybody wants to become world famous. He said everybody pretends that he has conquered desire, but it is only pretense. He said to his friend, "I am sure Chinmoy also had that desire. But in his case, God has satisfied his desire."</p>
<p>Recently that man moved to Holland. Now he teaches physics at a university there.</p>

<p>At the check-in counter in the Delhi airport, I was carrying two very small handbags. One of them was smaller than the smallest.</p>
<p>There was a very long line. When I finally got to the head of the line, the man asked me where was the tag for my little grey bag.</p>
<p>"For such a tiny one you need a tag?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Yes, you need it," he said. So he sent me back to get a tag.</p>
<p>When I came back to the line, I said to the man who was second in line, "Perhaps you saw me earlier. I was already at the head of the line."</p>
<p>"Yes, I saw you," he said. "And even if you had not been here before, I would have allowed you to enter the line because you are an old man."</p>
<p>I think he was about my age.</p>

<p>A minute or two later another funny thing happened. While we were waiting on line for something else, they were strictly checking to see if people had more than one carry-on bag.</p>
<p>A young girl right ahead of me had two bags. They pulled her out of the line and told her to wait on the side. I also had two bags: the little grey bag on my shoulder and another one I was carrying. The official saw my two bags. He said, "Why have you brought two?" Then he looked at me and said, "Allowed, allowed! You are an old man."</p>
<p>So I was an old man twice in five minutes. One of the reasons they thought I was old was because I was limping. I was limping on account of my leg pain. So every disadvantage is a blessing in some way. If you are an old man, you can take two bags onto the plane.</p>
<p>In India several friends of mine at the Ashram said to me, "For the first time, you look old. What has made you so old? We are so sorry for you. Your stay in America has made you old!"</p>
<p>I said, "I am old because I have so many responsibilities."</p>
