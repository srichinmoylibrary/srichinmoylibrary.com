<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is absolutely right. To be very frank with you and with your listeners, I don’t have the capacity to give people instant realisation. I know that it has taken me many, many years to fully realise the Truth, and I know that it has also taken others quite a few years. It is not like instant coffee, which you can get in the twinkling of an eye. When we try to acquire outer knowledge, we start with kindergarten, primary school, high school and then we go to college and university. It takes us fifteen or twenty years to reach a certain standard and get our diploma. Spirituality is also a form of study. If it takes us twenty years to acquire outer knowledge, do you think that we can acquire inner knowledge in a day or two? Inner knowledge is infinitely more difficult to attain. To keep our mind at peace even for a minute is so difficult. All the time we are being attacked by undivine thoughts and ideas and we can’t make any progress. So it is absurd to think that inner knowledge can be acquired overnight.</p>

I am sure you have been asked this question often." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are right. I have answered this question many times. I am an individual and I happen to have been born in India. It was not my decision; it was God’s decision. God asked you to be born in America; He asked me to be born in India. When one prays to God, one comes to feel that one’s home is not India or America, but God’s entire creation. An ordinary person, an unaspiring person, feels that his family is the world — his father and mother and brothers and sisters. Then, after some time, he feels that his village is the world; then his town, his city, his province, his country. But a spiritual person feels that the whole world belongs to him. It is immaterial to him whether he happens to have been born in India or elsewhere. He is not confined to any particular place. Just because he feels that he is God’s son, he feels that he lives wherever God lives. If my father is in the court, if my father is in the bank, then I am also there, inside his heart. So, since my eternal Father is omnipresent, I am also everywhere within Him.</p>
<p>As an individual I stayed in India and as an individual I have come here. Now you are asking, “Why don’t you take care of your own house? Why are you bothering to work here?” But being a spiritual man, I will say that my house is not in India or America. My house is wherever God takes me. Tomorrow if He takes me to Europe, then there will be my house. Wherever God feels that I will be of some use to Him, He will bring me. And wherever you will be of some use to Him, He will bring you. So there is no India, no America.</p>
<p>For the suffering of India we can blame mankind, we can blame India. They are lethargic, they are not trying. But we have to know that by blaming India or some individual, we do not accomplish anything. True, there are many things wrong in India. But if you see something wrong in me and you point out all my failings, I tell you that I am not going to change my life. Unless and until somebody from within inspires me to do the right thing, I will not do it. So, if India has some problem, then naturally God will send somebody to take care of that problem. If God says that I am not the right person, then He will send somebody else.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Interviewer: Everybody talks about destroying the ego as if it were some terrible thing. But I spent my life creating one and in fact, many people who follow spiritual teachers are looking for self-confidence and a better ability to function. I wish you would explain it to me.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Interviewer: Everybody talks about destroying the ego as if it were some terrible thing. But I spent my life creating one and in fact, many people who follow spiritual teachers are looking for self-confidence and a better ability to function. I wish you would explain it to me." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us try to be explicit in our understanding of what ego is. According to my inner experience, there are two types of ego: one ego is limitation, bondage and death. This is the ego that says ‘I’ and ‘my’. When we speak of ‘I’ and ‘my’, we confine ourselves to the finite. The other ego is the divine ego. “I am God’s son, so how can I stoop to such ignorance? God is all Light, all Perfection, and I am His son. It is beneath my dignity to surrender myself to ignorance.” This kind of ego is very good.</p>
<p>The human ego binds us, but the divine ego only liberates us. The divine ego says, “You are free, you are eternal, you are infinite, just because you are one with the eternal Father, who is infinite, eternal and immortal.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> So the first ego you define as a sort of small, selfish kind of thing.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is absolutely right. It cares only for its own existence. The other one is the universal ‘we’, the universal heart. As I said before, the heart means identification, oneness. God is everywhere, so if I am God’s son, then I can claim the entire universe as my very own. If I remain in my room and you remain in your room, then there is a sense of separativity. You have your life and I have my life. But if we feel our divine oneness, then there is no separativity. I claim you and you claim me. When we are aspiring, we feel the presence of God and we feel our universal oneness, our oneness with the Universal Consciousness. If we don’t aspire, then we remain with our limited, selfish consciousness.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> How does one get from the one kind of ego to the other?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A child’s world, in the beginning, is his parents. Then gradually, gradually, his world becomes more vast. In the spiritual life also, we grow from the one to the many. From limited experiences we get very high, deep, vast experiences. Similarly, we can start with the human ego and gradually transcend it; then we enter into the divine ego. Or right from the beginning, if we pray and aspire, we can try to curb our human ego and remain in the divine ego.</p>

<p>Question: Is it possible to be spiritual and material at the same time?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the beginning, partly we are spiritual and partly we are material. Then we get inner Peace, Light and Bliss and transform the material into the spiritual. But if we say that we have to become spiritual and neglect the material right from the beginning, that is impossible. The spiritual and the material go side by side in the beginning. At first the proportion may be, let us say, two per cent spiritual and ninety-eight per cent material. But there comes a time when the spiritual and the material are amalgamated, fused into one. At that time we see in the material world the real spirit, and matter is used for a divine purpose. Let us take, for example, a knife. With this knife I can stab someone and with this knife I can also cut a fruit and share it with others. If the spiritual enters into the material, if my spiritual life enters into my material consciousness, then my view of the material life changes. At that time the knife becomes a kind of help, an instrument for me to cut the fruit and share it with you.</p>
<p>Unless the spiritual light enters into the material world, the material world will remain blind. But if we have spiritual light in the material, then the material also becomes half spiritual. They are like two brothers. One brother is right now a little bit ignorant. But that doesn’t mean that we shall have to throw aside that brother. If we bring light into the younger brother, then he will also be of great help in fulfilling our mission.</p>

And in spite of the fact that I hadn’t bowled in a long time, I found myself bowling extremely well. Is that the kind of thing you are talking about when you talk about getting away from that smaller ego?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you say that you were all absorbed in the ball and that you focused all your attention on it, I have to say that this is not a matter of ego. It is a matter of your own concentration. It is very good. If we don’t pay attention to what we are doing, then how are we going to achieve perfection? The larger ego, the divine ego that I am speaking about, goes a little further. Here we work with utmost concentration, but also there is something else. We offer the result at the Feet of the Supreme with the same kind of cheerfulness, whether it comes in the form of failure or success. We play our game and then either we will lose or we will win. But if we can offer both success and failure with the same cheerful frame of mind, then the divine ego is playing its role most successfully. Here the loser and the winner are one, and we are offering the result to the universal Oneness. So whether we lose or win doesn’t matter. We don’t feel miserable if somebody else wins, because we feel our oneness with him. Here the divine ego is the feeling of oneness.</p>
<p>But first things first. When you are looking at the ball and focusing all your attention on it, you are doing absolutely the right thing. Then, after you have done the right thing, the result will come. This result you have to offer at the Feet of God. That is absolutely the right attitude, the divine attitude. Otherwise, if you don’t concentrate on the ball, if you just look at your friends, then you are allowing sheer negligence to enter into your life. If you are negligent in anything, then you cannot achieve any success.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is necessary that a material basis exists here on earth. But if we do not use material wealth properly, then we will be going back to the animal kingdom. Here in the West, if we don’t wear proper clothes, if we don’t take showers, if we don’t eat material food, earthly food, then how are we going to live on earth? So whatever material actions are beneficial to our existence we shall perform. The things that are not helpful we are going to transform, so that eventually they can also be an added help to our feeling of universal oneness.</p>

Now come and enter the battlefield of life. Face the world.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I agree with your wisdom to some extent. But it is not that we have to accept the material life fifty per cent and the spiritual life fifty per cent. It is not like that. We give full importance to the spiritual side and also to the material side. But we feel that the material life will be of real value to us only when the spiritual life enters into the material life and brings light into it. It is not that we will accept each one fifty per cent. One hundred per cent both of them we will accept on the basis of their oneness. At that time there will not be two sides, one spiritual and one material. No, only two brothers will come together. Right now one brother has a little more light than the other, so that brother will bring light into the other. Then they will become one and both of them will be one hundred per cent illumined.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, through prayer you can also do it. In the Western world, people give more importance to prayer than to meditation. If you find it difficult to meditate, then you can pray. In the West it is very easy to pray, because right from the beginning people are taught to pray in church and at home.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not a mental process. Unfortunately, I will not be able to explain it to you. It is a gradual revelation. Gradually, gradually, gradually it came to the point where everything became very clear to me. Gradually I came to the point where I saw or felt the truth that I had been searching for. When we take exercise regularly, we strengthen our muscles and become very, very strong. In the spiritual life also, slowly and steadily we win the race.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely right. It is a question of how we approach the truth. If we know that we are eating just because inside us there is the soul or some divinity and we have to stay on earth to manifest this divinity and do something divine, that is one thing. But if we eat just out of greed, if we become voracious eaters just to satisfy our greed, then we are acting like an animal. The attitude that we have is of utmost importance. While we are doing something, if we feel that we are doing it so that we can become better, so that we can be of help to society, then it is a spiritual act. But again, if we are doing something just to show our own supremacy, just to show that we can do it and others cannot do it, then it is all wrong. So it depends on how we approach an object or subject or situation. It is the approach that is of paramount importance, not actually what we do.</p>

What are your thoughts on this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I fully agree with you. But again, in some cases I have to disagree in the sense that it depends on the individual. One individual will say that he can easily stay on earth without smoking, whereas another individual will say that he can’t stay on earth even for a day without smoking. Similarly, there are some people who will say that they can stay on earth without the spiritual life, without God. Again, there will be others who will say, “No, without God we can’t stay even for one fleeting minute on earth.” So it entirely depends on the individual.</p>
<p>In this world we have to know one thing: first things first. If I have to go to school, early in the morning I brush my teeth and take a shower, and only then do I go to school. I don’t just run from my bed to my school. We have to know that we can’t put the cart before the horse. Early in the morning, before we go to our office, we pray to God. We don’t go to the office first and then pray and meditate after we come back home. No. We know that early in the morning if we pray to God and meditate on God, then we enter into the spiritual world, the inner world. Instead of enjoying jealousy or hatred towards mankind, if early in the morning we can pray and feel the universal love, then this love we can spread in our multifarious, day-to-day activities. But if in the morning we do not pray and meditate, then we may enter into the world of jealousy. We will see competition and all kinds of destruction around us and we will be spreading this destruction. So the inner world has to come first. From the inner world we enter into the outer world. The light of the inner world has to enter into the outer world. Only then the outer world will want to be like the inner world. If I have love, then I can give you love. And if I give you love, then this love you will be able to give to somebody else. But if I have hatred, then I will only give you hatred and immediately you will offer your hatred back to me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do you see the West as active and the East as passive?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do you see the West as active and the East as passive?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The West is quite active. I use the word ‘dynamic’. It is very good. We have to be dynamic, for then only we can do something. But very often it happens that dynamism turns into aggression. Then, in India they are passive. In the name of eternal time, many people are leading a lethargic life; they are wallowing in the pleasures of idleness and will not budge an inch. That is very bad. Again, India has peace and poise; and if one has peace and poise, then one can grow into something sublime. If India really leads the life of inner silence and the West leads the life of inner dynamism, then they can be amalgamated and brought together. It is like the ocean. On the surface there are waves and surges. It is very dynamic. But at the bottom it is calm and quiet. It is the same sea that deep within is calm and quiet and on the surface is full of waves and surges. The sea has both these qualities: the dynamic quality and the passive quality. So here also, when the dynamic quality of the West and the passive quality of peace that India represents can be brought together, it will be a tremendous success for humanity. But instead of using dynamism, if America uses aggression, and if India, instead of using world peace, actually offers its lethargy and nothing else, then it is only self-deception on both sides.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In my philosophy, I feel that they are all branches of the same Tree: God the Almighty Father, God the Infinite, God the Eternal. This Tree has quite a few branches. One branch we call the Christ, other branches we call the Buddha, Sri Krishna, Mohammed and so forth. A tree needs branches otherwise, we don’t appreciate the tree.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Let me ask you a question. If this tree has all those branches, and things still seem to be pretty terrible, maybe the branches were just weeds.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, they are branches. The only thing is that we do not want to be under the branches. If we ordinary human beings had cared for their messages, if we had really followed the messages that Sri Krishna brought or the Christ brought, then we would have made tremendous progress. But even when they were here in the physical plane, how many people believed them?</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> So you figure it’s people’s own fault?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is our fault. Suppose you have some knowledge. It is up to me to come to you and say, “Please teach me.” If I don’t come to you for instruction, is it your fault? The great world teachers came to inspire us and still they are inspiring us from within. They came with Light in infinite measure, but humanity did not respond. Whose fault was it? And now again the same thing is happening: they are inspiring us from within, but most of the time we reject it. Only if we accept their Light can we also grow into divine Light.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I would like to ask the spiritual leader if he believes that it is possible to have a perfect universe?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I would like to ask the spiritual leader if he believes that it is possible to have a perfect universe?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is possible. It is not only possible; it is inevitable. It is only a matter of time. As we said before, God-realisation cannot be achieved overnight. Similarly, perfection cannot be achieved overnight. In order to achieve something, it takes quite a few years. Perfection we will have in the world just because God wants it. Without making us perfect, God will not be satisfied, because He wants us to be exactly like Him. He is perfect. So how will He be satisfied when He sees that His children are imperfect? He does not want us to all the time quarrel and fight and kill one another. No. His message is the message of perfection, the message of oneness. Just because He wants universal oneness and perfect Perfection from us, we are bound to achieve this. It is a matter of time in the process of evolution of consciousness.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Very interesting, the idea of a perfect universe. Are there many people these days whom you admire — religious leaders or political leaders, or anybody in the world who you think is on the path?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Believe me, I admire everyone because, according to my philosophy, everyone has something special, unique. God always wants to express Himself and reveal Himself in a unique fashion. When we look at a flower, we see that one petal is a little smaller, one is a little larger. When we see a beautiful building, at one particular place it has one shape and at another place it is totally different. But we admire the building because each place where we focus our attention gives us a feeling of inner joy, inner faith. Like a magnet, it pulls us or we pull it. God wants to fulfil Himself in a unique fashion in each individual. That is why I admire each individual, because God wants to do something in a specific way in each individual. Therefore, each individual really deserves my appreciation and admiration.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> I'm very happy you came. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am so happy that you have given me the opportunity to be of service to thousands of people. Nothing gives me greater joy than to be of service to mankind, because that is the only thing that I can do. If I am employed to do the thing that I can do, then naturally I am most grateful.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Thank you, Sri Chinmoy.</p>
