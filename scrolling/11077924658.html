<p>We shall not wait. If we wait, we shall lose. If we lose, we shall weep. Who wants to weep? Nobody. We wish only to smile at our Beloved Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>We shall not wait. If we wait, we shall fail. If we fail, we shall die. Who wants to die? Nobody. We want only to live on earth to spread the Light of our Beloved Supreme. We want to live on earth to manifest Him in His own Way.</p>
<p>To wait is to make friends with empty hours, empty days, empty months and empty years. To wait is to miss God’s Perfection-Freedom-Train which is bound for the ever-increasing Satisfaction-Station.</p>
<p>If we do not wait, our life’s inspiration and our heart’s aspiration will make us see the Face of our Creator. Our Creator needs no future; He has and He is the Eternal Now.</p>
<p>If we do not wait, our Beloved Lord, the Author of all Good, will make us His choice instruments by transforming our life within and without totally, Him to manifest in His own Way. We shall be His perfect channels of revealing Light and fulfilling Delight.</p>
<p>If we do not wait, in the outer world revolution will be our name; in the inner world, evolution will be our name; and in our own world, satisfaction will be our name.</p>
<p>We shall not wait. We shall start praying and meditating. We shall pray continuously. We shall meditate continuously. If we continuously pray, one day at God’s choice Hour, we shall grow into God’s Transcendental Height. If we continuously meditate, one day at God’s choice Hour, we shall grow into God’s universal Light. </p>

<p>God’s universal Push awakens us. God’s transcendental Pull liberates us.</p>
<p>We worship God because we think that He is far, very far. We love God because we feel that He is near, very near.</p>
<p>Sincerity we need; purity we need. With our sincerity we strengthen our aspiration-heart. With our purity we enlighten our dedication-life.</p>
<p>In our life of aspiration, in our life of dedication, we wish to make fast, faster and fastest progress. How do we achieve this goal? We achieve it on the strength of our faithfulness, cheerfulness and soulfulness. Faithfulness we need in our physical consciousness. Cheerfulness we need in our vital consciousness. Soulfulness we need in our psychic consciousness.</p>
<p>We all wish to make progress, continuous and constant. How is it that we do not make satisfactory progress? We do not make satisfactory progress precisely because we live in the world of complaints. We complain and because we complain, we do not make any progress. Because we do not love God, we complain and because we complain, we do not love God. And because we think of the world too much, we make no progress.</p>
<p>There are two lives: the aspiration-life and the desire-life. We started our journey with the desire-life. Then we gave up the desire-life and entered into the aspiration-life. At God’s choice Hour, we shall enter into the realisation-life, where satisfaction will be ours within and without. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Gratitude-heart</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Gratitude-heart" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Pure is our aspiration-plant. Purer is our dedication-flower. Purest is our gratitude-heart. Sweet is our soulful smile. Sweeter is our inner cry. Sweetest is our gratitude-heart. Gratitude is pure happiness. Happiness is sure perfection. Perfection is complete satisfaction both in man’s world and in God’s world.</p>
<p>Our gratitude-heart ceaselessly receives blessingful love, soulful concern and fruitful oneness from Above. Our gratitude-heart feels that its very existence on earth is an unconditional act of God’s Grace. Our gratitude-heart knows that its acts are for God and for God alone.</p>
<p>In this world we are apt not to value anything or anyone, but our gratitude-heart always values everything in God’s Creation. It values God the Creator and God the Creation. It values God’s Compassion and it values God the Compassion. It also values God’s Justice-Light and God the Justice-Light, for it knows that God, our Beloved Supreme, is always the Author of all Good.</p>
<p>Our gratitude-heart never fails God. It carries with it flaming aspiration, the burning inner cry and a constant self-giving reality. At every moment God pleases our gratitude-heart with His boundless Concern, Compassion and all-loving Oneness.</p>
<p>We aspire for the Infinite, the Eternal and the Immortal. The seeker in us is constantly trying to transcend himself on the strength of his aspiration-cry and dedication-smile. Our seeker-heart’s experience-life, realisation-life and God-fulfilling manifestation-life are clearly read in the Face of our Beloved Supreme. Our own autobiography is clearly read in God’s own Face. We offer Him our gratitude-heart and He gives us His constant Assurance that He has chosen us to be His choice instruments, Him to fulfil in His own Way here on earth and there in Heaven. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Choice</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Choice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Who is called? Who is not called? He who needs is called. He who does not need is not called. Who needs? The seeker-lover in us needs. Who fulfils our need? The Beloved Supreme, the eternal Liberator, fulfils our need and responds to our inner cry.</p>
<p>What does the seeker in us need? He needs God-Truth, God-Light and God- Delight. God-Truth awakens him, God-Light illumines him and God-Delight fulfils him. God-Truth he hears. God-Light he sees. God-Delight he feels.</p>
<p>There are two worlds: the desire-world and the aspiration-world. In the desire-world, our supreme choices are division and self-assertion. In the aspiration-world, our supreme choices are God-discovery and self-mastery. A sincere seeker, in the process of discovering and uncovering, realises his birthless and deathless inseparable oneness with his Source. The seeker in us constantly needs God’s boundless Compassion-Rain and God’s Satisfaction-Reign. God the Beloved Supreme constantly needs from the seeker in us our aspiration-plane and dedication-train.</p>
<p>He who chooses the Absolute Supreme has already been chosen by the infinite and unconditional Bounty of the Supreme. The seeker’s soul, the seeker’s heart and the seeker’s very existence on earth, have already been chosen by the Absolute Supreme to be his faithful, devoted and unconditional instruments for His divine Manifestation. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The seeker’s duty</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The seeker’s duty" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The seeker’s duty is complete non-cooperation with the desire-world. The seeker’s duty is constant co-operation with the aspiration-world.</p>
<p>The seeker at times gets success from the desire-world but, to his wide surprise, he eventually sees that inside his desire what looms large is frustration. Desire itself is a dissatisfied hunger: when this hunger is fulfilled, it only increases.</p>
<p>In the aspiration-world when the seeker makes progress, he sees that in his progress itself there is satisfaction, abiding satisfaction. The aspiration-world and progress go together; progress and satisfaction go together.</p>
<p>The human duty is to love, serve and become the height of Truth. The divine duty is to sing the song of oneness, to dance the dance of perfection and to live the life of fulness. The human duty is to discover God-Reality within and without. The divine duty is to uncover God-Beauty here, there and all-where.</p>
<p>Not to feed the doubting mind is the supreme duty of the seeker. To feed the loving and aspiring heart is the supreme duty of the seeker. To live in the soul and for the soul is the supreme duty of the seeker.</p>
<p>The seeker’s duty is to have inner courage. This courage is an act of inner faith. Faith is an act of self-giving love, and love is an act of God-becoming life. The seeker’s ultimate duty is to offer his soulful cry from the inmost recesses of his heart. When the seeker offers God his soulful cry from the inmost recesses of his heart, at that time God, out of His infinite Bounty, tells the seeker that He also has a Duty of His own. And that Duty is to grant the seeker, His chosen instrument, a blessingful and fruitful Smile. </p>

<p>We shall now try to empty the mind. Indeed, this is the most difficult task, but we shall do it. Our mind has made friends with teeming thoughts. These thoughts are unhealthy, uncomely, unaspiring and undivine. The moment our aspiration-heart eliminates one thought, to its wide surprise another thought immediately crops up. It seems that we are forced to play an endless game.</p>
<p>But there is also another game, and that game is the will-power game. We have inherited that game from our Father, the Lord Supreme. When we play that game we transform our thought-world into the will-power world.</p>
<p>From where do we get this will-power? We get this will-power from our heart’s calmness-sea. From where do we acquire this calmness-sea? We acquire it from our soul’s freedom-sun and oneness-sky.</p>
<p>A man of will-power braves all the storms and tempests of life. He knows that he is not the earth-bound body but the Heaven-free soul. His body is not earth-bound; his life is not earth-bound. He also knows that he is not his nature’s slave, but a supremely chosen instrument of his Inner Pilot, his Beloved Supreme. What he truly has and what he truly is, is aspiration-flame, and this aspiration-flame makes him feel that he is always Heaven-free. He is in the world, true; but he is not of the world. At the same time, he knows that he is for the world, for the world’s transformation and for God’s manifestation in and through the world. He is always for this world.</p>
<p>Let us try to empty the mind. In our mind’s emptiness will loom large Infinity’s Peace, Eternity’s Light and Immortality’s Delight. Let us try to empty the mind.</p>

<p>“Lord, reform Thy world, beginning with me.” This is a prayer of a Chinese Christian, which President Roosevelt quoted at a press conference in 1941.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, I know. I know that my nature’s transformation is the answer to the world’s transformation.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, I know. I know that my heart’s purity and my life’s humility comprise my soul’s magnanimity.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, I know. I know that my love of You is my journey. I know that my surrender to You is my Destination.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, I know. I know that in my desire-world I am the abyss of nothingness. I know that in my aspiration-world I am the sea of fulness.</p>
<p>Yesterday, my Lord, I came to You proudly and haughtily. Today, my Lord, I have come to You devotedly and unreservedly. Tomorrow, my Lord, I shall come to You soulfully and unconditionally. Lord, my Lord, when I speak to the world about You, it is not my personal opinion. It is the revelation of my sweet oneness-relation with You.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, do make me see and feel that my heart’s perfection-cry has to be continued and transcended.</p>
<p>Lord, my Lord, do make me see and feel that my life’s satisfaction-smile has to be renewed daily and pursued.</p>

<p>Silence is the God-Song. This Song is an ever-transcending experience. Silence is the God-Music. This Music is an ever-illumining realisation.</p>
<p>There are two realities: sound-reality and silence-reality. Sound-reality is self-reliance. Silence-reality is God-reliance. Sound-reality is self-declaration and self-admiration. Silence-reality is God-adoration. Sound-reality is the declaration of our human autocracy and supremacy. Silence-reality is our constant self-transformation in God’s Compassion-Heart. A man of silence has a free access to God’s personal properties. These properties are Eternity, Infinity and Immortality. In the soul of Eternity, man the seeker learns from God. In the heart of Infinity, man the seeker speaks to God. In the life of Immortality, man the seeker becomes another God. </p>

<p>I watch before I pray. I watch and see if there are undivine thoughts trying to assail my mind. Needless to say, I do not surrender to these undivine thoughts.</p>
<p>I watch before I pray. I watch and see if there are divine thoughts trying to inspire my heart. Needless to say, I welcome these thoughts with my open mind, open heart and open arms.</p>
<p>I pray, and then I watch. I watch and see if the jealous world is trying to rob me of the peace, light and bliss that I have acquired from my prayer. Needless to say, my conscious awareness prevents the jealous world from robbing me.</p>
<p>I pray, and then I watch. I watch and see if there are sincere seekers who would like to have the peace, light and bliss that I have acquired from my prayer. Needless to say, to them I immediately offer my peace, light and bliss devotedly, soulfully and unreservedly.</p>
<p>God watches me pray. Through my prayer He expects me to change for the better: to have a better consciousness, a better aspiration and a better realisation.</p>
<p>God watches me pray. Through my prayer He expects me to become a more soulful instrument of His, Him to serve unconditionally in His own Way.</p>
<p>God watches me pray. Through my prayer He wants me to become an unconditional seeker, an unconditional server and an unconditional lover.</p>
<p>Before God created this world, He watched and measured the ascendance of His Silence-Height. Now that God has created the world, He watches and measures the excellence of His Sound-Might.</p>
<p>I pray, I watch, I accept and, finally, I embrace the Feet of my Beloved Supreme with my heart’s purity. God meditates, accepts and, finally, embraces my heart with his constant Self-giving Reality and Self-giving Divinity. </p>

<p>My Lord, my simple faith follows You. My Lord, my sincere love follows You. My Lord, my intense devotion follows You. My Lord, my unconditional surrender follows You.</p>
<p>My faith knows what You are. My love knows who You are. My devotion knows all about our closeness. My surrender knows all about our oneness. I know, my Lord, that when I do my best, You do the rest for me compassionately, unreservedly and unconditionally.</p>
<p>Why was I created? I was created to love You. Why was I created? I was created to need You. Why was I created? I was created to manifest You here on earth. Why was I created? I was created to be a perfect instrument of Yours, to please You in Your own Way.</p>
<p>I have a secret, a supreme secret. I am at my journey’s start, and the Goal is still a far cry. Indeed, this is my inner conviction. My Beloved Lord Supreme also has a secret, and this sweet secret He shares with me. He tells me that I am not at my journey’s start but that I am at my journey’s close; I am at my destination. But this destination of mine, unlike other destinations, is ever-transcending, ever- illumining and ever-fulfilling. At the destination the journey actually does not come to a close, for each destination is the starting point for a new journey. Therefore, I am always walking, marching and running along Eternity’s Road, in the process of a new, illumining and fulfilling journey. </p>

<p>I appreciate, I admire, I adore and I love. I appreciate God the Power. I admire God the Light. I adore God the Delight. I love God the Compassion. Power is great. Light is good. Delight is immortal. Compassion is all-fulfilling.</p>
<p>My God-appreciation multiplies my joy. My God-admiration multiplies my strength. My God-adoration multiplies my beauty, inner and outer. My God-love multiplies my satisfaction, within and without.</p>
<p>In the desire-world there was a time when I was a total failure. Nobody gave me a helping hand. I accepted my total failure, which was undoubtedly a blessing in disguise. Then I left the desire-world and entered into the aspiration-world. Here, at times, I am assailed by doubt, fear, teeming anxiety and worry. Yet sometimes I am also encouraged and inspired by the higher worlds of Light and Delight.</p>
<p>The world of desire separated me from the world of satisfaction. The world of aspiration, at the present state of my evolution, does not guarantee me abiding satisfaction. But there will come a time when I shall enter into the realisation-world, and my realisation-world — which will be founded upon my aspiration-world — will grant me everlasting joy and everlasting delight.</p>
<p>In the desire-world, when I failed, nobody blamed me. In the aspiration-world, when I was half-successful and half a failure, the world around me did not care for me. But when I succeed in the realisation-world, the entire world will care for me, for the realisation-world is the world of oneness.</p>
<p>The desire-world is the world of division and possession, where each individual tries to lord it over others. In the aspiration world fear and doubt and other negative ideas assail my human mind, and my aspiration is at times thwarted by undivine, unhealthy, uncomely forces. But the realisation-world, which is the world of inseparable, eternal and all-pervading oneness, can never be assailed by teeming doubts and negative forces. For this is the world of oneness and perfection, and inside perfection what looms large is satisfaction: satisfaction of the universal Soul, which the seeker in me embodies, and satisfaction of the Transcendental Reality, which my seeker-life also embodies. It is only in the realisation-world that I can have satisfaction, and this satisfaction of mine I can share with my fellow-seekers, who are sailing in the same boat towards the Golden Shore of the ever-transcending Beyond. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Success and progress</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Success and progress" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Confidence in myself I need. Assurance from God I need. Confidence tells me that eventually I can become a perfect instrument of God. Assurance tells me that this goal of mine is within my easy reach.</p>
<p>Confidence means to have the key to God’s Kingdom. Assurance means to have the willingness and devotedness to open the door. Once I have opened the door, I see the face of success and feel the heart of progress.</p>
<p>Success is in the desire-world. Progress is in the aspiration-world. We succeed in life. We succeed in fulfilling our ambitions. But in outer success there is no assurance that we will be happy, even if we have great success, greater success and greatest success. Whereas with progress, even when we make just an iota of progress, we become happy, and our happiness is abiding.</p>
<p>Success belongs to our earth-consciousness. Progress belongs to our Heaven-consciousness. Success makes us feel that we have the capacity, that we can do everything. In success we feel that it is we who are the actual doers. Progress makes us feel that we are not the doers. It makes us feel that there is an unseen force deep within us that encourages and inspires our progress, and that inside this progress is our constant happiness. This unseen force is the doer; God is the Doer. This is what we learn from our progress.</p>
<p>The seeker marches along the road of success, but that road ultimately fails to show him the destination. Then the seeker walks along the other road, progress. Here at every moment he meets with joy and satisfaction, for at every moment he sees a destination. Needless to say, this destination is only the starting point for a further, more illumining and more fulfilling goal.</p>
<p>Success makes the individual feel that might is right. So in the world of success, the individual human being comes first and God comes next. This is what success tells us. But progress tells us that might is God’s Compassion and right is also God’s Compassion. Progress also tells us something else most significant: God is first and God is last. In between is the seeker’s place.</p>
<p>Man finds his eternal place between God the Leader and God the Follower. God the Leader and God the Follower grant him a place in the inmost recesses of the Universal Heart. In this place, the seeker at every moment sees that God the Leader and God the Follower are taking him to his Destination, where he will become one with the Transcendental Vision and the Universal Reality that he has been longing for throughout Eternity. </p>

<p>Our human life is not a bitter complaint. Our human life is not a serious problem. Our human life is not a heavy burden. Our human life is not a deplorable failure.</p>
<p>Our human life is a God-inspired aspiration-journey. Our human life is a God-intoxicated dedication-road. Our human life is a God-fulfilling manifestation-song. Our human life is a God-satisfying perfection-mission.</p>
<p>Our divine life is not a mental hallucination. Our divine life is not an escape from the hard realities of the world. Our divine life is not the total negation or destruction of our earthly life.</p>
<p>Our divine life is the only true reality. Our divine life sings the song of the Infinite inside the very life-breath of the finite.</p>

<p>What shall I make of myself today? I shall make of myself a simplicity-life, a sincerity-heart, a humility-mind, a purity-vital and a luminosity-body. Simplicity will reduce my possession-necessity. Sincerity will multiply my God-necessity. Humility will connect me with Heaven’s true Reality. Purity will expand my heart’s length and breadth. And inside my luminosity, my heart’s inner cry will constantly see an ever-transcending, ever-illumining and ever-fulfilling dawn.</p>
<p>What shall I make of myself tomorrow? Tomorrow I shall make of myself an unconditional seeker, an unconditional lover and an unconditional server. The seeker in me will always cry. The lover in me will always smile. The server in me will always cry, smile and, at the same time, gain perfect Perfection.</p>
<p>It is at God’s choice Hour that I can give up my human life, as previously I gave up my animal life. For me the Hour of God has struck. Now is the choice Hour for me to enter into the divine life. But the divine life will not negate my human life; far from it. It will only change, transform and illumine my human life. Inside my human life teeming desires assailed my mind. But now I shall embrace the aspiration-life, the life of inner cry. Here I shall cry not for name or fame or earthly possessions, but for the Feet of my Beloved Supreme. My only goal is to sit at His Feet, Him to please in His own Way at every moment. Darkness I have, and my darkness I shall place at His Feet. An iota of light I have, and this iota of light I shall place at His Feet. I have an inner cry, an insignificant inner cry, and this inner cry I shall place at His Feet. I have a fleeting, soulful smile. This soulful smile, although it is fleeting, I shall place at His Feet. My earth-bound expectation, my Heaven-free satisfaction, both I shall place at His Feet.</p>
<p>The human in me, the divine in me, the animal in me I shall place at the Feet of my Beloved Supreme. He will utilise the divine in me to manifest Himself in His own Way. The human in me also He will utilise to manifest Himself here on earth in His own Way. The animal in me—which is doubt, jealousy, insecurity, impurity and so forth—He will utilise again in His own Way. Everything that I have, everything that I am, my Beloved Supreme will use, Himself to serve in His own Way. I shall be only an instrument, an unconditional instrument, of my Beloved Supreme, Him to please in His own Way, here on earth and there in Heaven. In the desire-world, in the aspiration-world, in the experience-world, in the realisation-world and, finally, in the oneness-world I shall please Him, my Beloved Supreme, always in His own Way, always. </p>

<p>God’s World and man’s world.</p>
<p>In God’s World there is no such thing as imperfection. It is all perfection, all-illumining and all-fulfilling perfection. In man’s world there is no such thing as perfection. It is all imperfection. The outer nature of imperfection is discouraging. The inner nature of imperfection is disheartening.</p>
<p>In God’s World there is no such thing as impurity. It is all purity. Purity is the oneness-delight of God the Transcendental Beloved Supreme and God the Universal Lover Divine. In man’s world there is no such thing as purity. It is all impurity. Impurity is at once impulsive and repulsive. The very nature of impurity is to destroy the entire being.</p>
<p>In God’s World there is no such thing as failure. It is all experience. Experience is the precursor of realisation and realisation is oneness within and without. In experience we notice two things: success and progress. Success eventually surrenders to progress, for progress is always encouraging, illumining and fulfilling, whereas success at times proves to be a disaster in disguise. In man’s world there is no such thing as success. Even when so-called success comes, it never brings abiding satisfaction.</p>
<p>In God’s World there is no such thing as sacrifice. It is all closeness-perfection and oneness-satisfaction. In man’s world also there is no such thing as sacrifice. Here it is all division-wall and destruction-volcano.</p>
<p>God’s World is always ready to inundate man’s world with Infinity’s Love, Eternity’s Concern and Immortality’s Life. It is man’s world that must needs accept the blessingful gifts from God’s World with a tiny gratitude-flame from the very depths of its heart. </p>
